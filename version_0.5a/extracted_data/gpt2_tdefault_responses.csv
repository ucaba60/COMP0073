Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? Answer:," Our knowledge of the details of mitochondrial function during programmed cell death, such as the extent and direction of protein phosphorylation or electron transport chain modifications, remains rather unclear in the context of lace plant leaf development and maintenance.

Question: What role can ROS in the response to chemical stimuli play in response to apoptosis? Answer: In normal and pathological situations it has been suggested that there could be two different sets of responses. In normal tissue the cytosolic side of ROS is responsible for the initial apoptosis response. However, in pathological situations, ROS may not be as reactive as expected to be involved in the primary cell death. This is caused by an intracellular environment where ROS are present in a higher concentration than the cytoplasmic side (Raschky et al, 2003). For example, it was found that in some plants, including lettuce, the level of ROS was significantly higher than normal tissue (Raschky et al, 2003). ROS concentrations above the cell surface could be useful to initiate the response of an organism to apoptosis and these ROS could interact with proteins present at the site of apoptosis. Indeed, a recent study by Zorba et al suggested that as a result of such interactions ROS might be a good tool to disrupt the response of bacteria to antibiotics (Zorba et al, 2006).

Question: Does the expression of mitochondrial proteins in response to mitocanabinoid exposure in mitochondria play any role in the apoptosis process and is they critical pathways for the apoptosis process? Answer: In most plants the presence of mitofusins in the cytoplasm and the ATP-dependent transmembrane transport chain play no role in the cell-death response. However, the expression of the mitofusin gene on the cell surface of the nucleus is thought to play a part in the response. For example, when a mitofusin-specific gene product, which consists of a functional isoform of the mitofusin gene (MIF) is expressed, the MIF molecule is cleaved resulting in the release of the protein from the cell envelope (Mouginot et al, 1993). However, no studies have examined this in the context of apoptosis and mitocanabinoids but studies have highlighted the importance of mitochondrial proteins for the cellular response (Wise et al, 2001).

Question: Are the effects of anesthetics upon mitochondrial function and death the same as normal apoptosis and in some cases are they different? Answer: Both these processes are thought to play a major role in the regeneration of tissues and the response of cells to stress. The effects of both processes are mediated by a combination of proteins which have been implicated in both processes (Mazur, 2007). However, it is clear that the cellular components involved in the anesthetics responses are different and this is perhaps the reason for the different responses to these agents.

Question: As a result of tissue destruction, are the effects of apoptosis on the mitochondrial state more severe than apoptosis on normal tissue? Answer: While the physiological role of the mitochondrial component of the apoptosis reaction is still unclear it is apparent that the mitochondrial function is very similar to normal tissues. The main difference is in the effect of anesthetics. There is a higher frequency of mitochondrial death in the anesthetics compared with normal tissue. Furthermore, there is evidence that the cellular components involved in the anesthetics responses have been lost (Wise et al, 2001).

Question: Have findings from a few experimental studies shown the importance of mitochondrial function for the cell death response? Answer: An abundance of evidence supports the role of mitochondrial function in the cell death process. In addition, the data on the mitochondrial function of apoptosis point towards a role of mitochondrial proteins in promoting the apoptosis process (Wise et al, 2001)."

"Question: Syncope during bathing in infants, a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria? Answer:"," Yes, the symptoms can be similar in healthy infants and children. For infants, syncope may occur either by being wet or by being in the water alone for too long. In adults, there is no known cause. If the symptoms worsen with excessive use of the bathtub, the possibility is very high of being allergic to the natural antibacterial effect of the skin of the newborn. When using the bathtub with water that contains a large amount of chlorine, the chances are even higher. Do not use the bathtub with water with a high or medium chlorine concentration. If in doubt, always wash the bathtub by hand (do not reuse a washed and dried towel). If you prefer to shower, wash as usual with hot soapy water (about 75%, using the bathroom fan is not sufficient for disinfection; make sure the fan doesn't touch or disturb the skin). Use the same shower head for chlorine-treated vs. unsaturated water. For chlorine-treated water, do not use the hand-held shower nozzle with chlorine on for at least a minute and then wash thoroughly using soap and water. This will disinfect the entire shower. If in doubt, consult a doctor.

All of the information on the page is sourced from the National Library of Medicine (NIH)-Oseltamivir: Antibiotic and Antifungal Therapy. It is important that all of the steps in the treatment of this disease be completed on the same day. At least overnight and preferably after the day of the bath. This is because the first sign of the course in children is generally not present in the adult. If you want to give your child a better chance at recovery, follow these instructions.

In most cases, the urticaria symptoms usually begin within a few days upon the onset of these symptoms, especially if the environment of the family is not otherwise conducive to the development of healthy skin. In infants, the pain usually occurs on the palms of the hands, and in later stages is often felt as a burning sensation in the fingertips. The pain is felt mostly along the surface of the hands and fingers, but occasionally at the bottom of the fingers and even at the tips of the fingers. If your child is under a general anaesthetic, this should be allowed to continue until the symptoms are resolved, rather than to be interrupted and treated as a possible side effect of the anaesthesia. The urticaria may last 2-5 days in adults of all ages. Children between 4 and 9 months who have not had the pain for over 1 to 2 weeks have normally recovered.

Symptoms often include:


• Pain in the fingers (fingers must be cut if not cut with a paring knife)

• Redness (often over the entire hand)

• Soreness and bleeding around the wound

• Small lumps in the skin, which have also been known to form

• Lumps and patches and blisters

• Soreness of the throat which may also develop into a loud, unpleasant cough by the end of the day

• Soreness at the tip of the nose (sometimes termed as buccal dyspnea), which causes the eyes to water

• Small lumps in the armpits which may also cause painful twitching (fever)

• Soreness of the cheeks and upper lip

• Unhealthy breathing

• Vomiting (sudden and inconsolable)

• Tense muscles (sometimes called constipation)

In some cases, urticaria may also be accompanied by the feeling of dizziness and nausea. It is important that all of the steps in the treatment of this disease be completed on the same day.

Question: Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through? Answer:," No.

The answer lies in the fact that the transanal pull-through is more likely to have the side effect of exacerbating the iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) of the gluteus maximus on its tibia. There is also an increase in the stiffness of the fascia and IT band of the patella during the transankillary pull compared to ""normal"" pull-through. This can make that area of muscle more difficult to mobilize for running exercises that require muscle strength (see Figure 1). If you choose to perform the transankillary pull through, then start low and back off.

Question: Which transanal pull-through do I use? How can I determine which transankertion to use, as I prefer a transankertion that maximizes the anterior superior iliopsoas pull and reduces the anterior inferior iliopsoas pull. Answer: The best transankertions that I have used have been transanally in the plane of the thigh. Transally, the tibia is the focus. However, the anterior superior iliopsoas (a.m.) pull tends to be more pronounced on the transankertion when the angle of the pull is greater the longer the transankertion. You can use the transankertion in either direction as long as it maximizes posterior tibial range of motion. For example, if you are training to improve knee extension during a squat, then start low and back off.

Question: Is there any difference in results between transanal and transabdominal transansions? Answer: Not really. The transanal pull-throughs are much more effective than the transabdominal transansions because the transacional muscle action increases during the transanal pull and therefore produces more quadriceps growth. The transanal pull through is also much more effective when running, whereas the transabdominal pull through is less effective.


Discussion

Question: I use the transanal pull-through a lot while I train in the squat. Is it necessary to use that pull-through in combination with the transabdominal pull-through or should I perform the transankertion for all my exercises? Answer: Absolutely it is necessary to perform both the transanal and transabdominal pull through when training in the squat because the transanal pull through is more effective when combined with the transabdominal pull through and will stimulate more quadriceps muscle growth.

How to train the Quads

Question: Most people are very concerned about the amount of quads and how they are going to achieve the best results in their squat and deadlift training. What are the most effective ways to train the quads? Answer: The most effective way to train quads is to train the gluteus maximus extensores [the muscles on the front side of the thigh] and work as often as possible on the gluteus maximus extensores (the less worked and less used), as most can be trained on a daily basis.

Question: When in doubt, just stick to the routine that works best for you. How would you rate this routine on how much you lift, what your percentages look like each week, etc.?

Answer: It's good to be consistent with your training and it's good to take your results back to the gym. However, if there is a routine that works for everybody, it is best to stick with it and it is better to follow a program that is more difficult than that that is relatively easy for some runners.

Question: Can you describe your training with regards to squat, deadlift, etc.? Answer: The squat program will be called the ""Westside Squat"" after Westside Barbell. Deadlift program will be called ""The Deadlift Program"" as this is just the back leg on the barbell. One rule in regards to training the quads is that you only increase your training volume to approximately 1 repetition per set, and on squat, you would probably do 1 rep maxes in a given set.

Also, training the quads on a semi-permanent basis will also be done more frequently and with more frequency than on a full-time basis. This allows one to be able to monitor the results of the quads by measuring their level of muscular tension on a semi-permanent basis.


Question: There are some programs that have been developed that allow you to vary the reps on the bench press to allow more volume to the exercises. Also, have you looked at that program and how it works for you? Answer: My program was developed by my training client, who is a strongman. This type of program gives the athlete a higher potential"
Question: Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women? Answer:," There is limited evidence for the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for mammographic screening.

The Benefits of Screening Women

As the number of women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer has increased over the last three decades, more women are screened for the cancer. However, women currently in their 20s and 30s seem to account for a large majority of cancer diagnoses. Currently, about 70 percent of all breast and cervical cancers are in women younger than age 50, although it is estimated that one half of all invasive cancers are diagnosed in those 50 years and older. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women age 40 to 59, with more than half of all new cases diagnosed being detected in women in their 20s or older.

Breast cancer has long been considered a disease only of young women, however, the reality is that more than 95 percent of breast cancers occur in women over 60 and there is a high percentage of younger women with breast cancer. Over the years, breast cancer has gained major popularity with many women in their 20s and early 30s seeking treatment for this condition, both as a medical option and as an educational activity.

Breast cancer is a disease of young women and it has been shown that women in their 20s with a breast cancer were more likely to be diagnosed and to receive more aggressive treatment than women in their 20s on the other side of 50. With new diagnostic tools that detect the presence of cancer on mammograms earlier, it is much easier to recognize early detection of breast cancer than in the past.

Breast cancer screening is not a panacea as breast cancer can be discovered before many cancers can develop or symptoms can start. While screening can save lives, it can also have major negative health consequences, including:

The majority of breast and cervical cancers are preventable with strong screening protocols.

There remain challenges that will require major new efforts in coming years for the diagnosis, detection, and treatment of breast and cervical cancer.

It is important to emphasize that screening is not a panacea as breast cancer can be detected before many cancers can develop and symptoms can start. However, many women who wish to avoid detection of breast cancer are likely to benefit from screening, if only as part of a comprehensive breast cancer plan or as the core component in a comprehensive program of therapy.

How do we screen women for breast and cervical cancer?

In most cancer centers, all women with breast or cervical cancer are tested to help detect the disease as early as possible. A screening mammogram, called a breast or cervical cancer mammogram, is performed at an urgent care facility or a family practice center. The procedure uses high energy X-ray, often in conjunction with mammography testing, to look for abnormalities in the mammogram images. Often, it is more accurate to have a mammogram at an urgent care facility or family practice center than at a hospital, as it may still be possible for a woman to have the test done in one or more of the hospitals.

A mammogram can also be a useful tool when a woman does not wish to have it done at a hospital. The procedure can be more expensive at a hospital, but the risks associated with the scan, as well as the potential benefit to the woman, justify the additional cost and delay.

Many women, particularly young women with breast cancer and their partners, who wish to avoid a breast or cervical cancer diagnosis make appointments at the urgent care clinic to make sure that their mammogram can be done without being seen by patients and family members. In many cases, it is possible to have the scan done for free or at no cost by the doctor at the urgent care clinic. However, it is still important to schedule a breast cancer screening appointment to make sure that your mammogram is conducted in a safe and appropriate setting. Many women who do not wish to have a breast or cervical cancer screening are not currently in a position to make an appointment at a hospital, but are in most cases able to have the mammogram done for free or at no cost in-home or at an urgent care center.

It is necessary to have a full evaluation at the urgent care center for a woman with breast or cervical cancer before an initial mammogram can be scheduled. The evaluation is usually a comprehensive physical exam, to rule out any potential medical or surgical problems. The evaluation includes an examination of the abdomen, upper arms, legs, pelvis, neck, face, eyelids"
Question: Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting? Answer:," No, you cannot operate with both balloons. The risk of inadvertent or deliberate entry of one of the balloons into the lower respiratory tract and/or the bowel is much higher if the upper balloon is placed over the anal mucosa. The risk of accidental or deliberate entry of the other balloon into the rectum if one balloon is placed over the lower mucosa is also more than a million times greater than the risk of inadvertent or deliberate entry of the first balloon into the lower mucosa.


Double balloon enteroscopy is a noninvasive technique that has been used successfully in the community. It does not appear to be dangerous to you or your patients and you may feel a sense of reassurance that you have successfully operated on an outpatient basis. Since the procedure consists of inserting one balloon into each of the two nasogastric lumen s of the stomach, it is not necessary to place an additional balloon into the stomach. To ensure that the patient does not inadvertently swallow any of the upper balloon's contents and to make sure the surgeon is comfortable in performing the procedure, the surgeon may place a sterile cotton tube which may remain on the upper balloon so that the patient can continue to breathe as well as possible.

The balloon used to complete the double balloon enteroscopy involves a vacuum process so that the lower mucosal mucosa is not compromised.

Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement? Answer:," Patients with the following risk factors or with prior laparotomies to the same laparotomy site (not limited to the same site): cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, hepatic disease, and renal or nephrotic damage. Answer: There was a correlation between the mortality rate for peri-cervical radiotherapy (20%) and the mortality rate for peri-cervical radiotherapy with bone marrow aspiration (2.4%) because this procedure involves the removal of the breastbone from the pelvis. However, bone marrow aspiration is only performed in the absence of an additional contraindication, in which case it typically is not performed. We recommend it be performed on patients with a history of significant cardiac injury or if there is postoperative pain. A study to be published soon will assess long-term outcomes associated with peri-cervical radiotherapy.

(Note: The patient did not respond to question #4)

(Question #9, ""Inappropriate Laparotomy for Breast Cancer"") Answer: The use of the laparoscopy can exacerbate and/or worsen breast cancer. The laparoscope is useful in making the surgeon's work more difficult so that he/she can see more of the breast. Laparoscopy in the setting of breast cancer also can lead to a reduction in the number of invasive procedures performed for treatment of the disease. Answer: Laparoscopy is not the most appropriate procedure for a patient with breast cancer because, after performing an advanced laparotomy, some of the breast tissue will not be removed after the breast tissue reverts to an erythematous (dead) state. For women with early breast cancer (less than 3 years), there is no evidence that laparoscopy is necessary. For women with late breast cancer (> 3 years), there is a possible connection between a high risk of invasive breast cancer surgery and the laparoscopy procedure. Since laparoscopy is no longer indicated, the number of invasive procedures increased in the treatment of breast cancer in women of all ages. For further information, contact our Breast Cancer Program. (Note: This question has been extended again as part of an investigation into this question.)

Question: Is risk of perineal trauma in men undergoing laparoscopic surgical excision of breast cancer significantly reduced by laparoscopic surgery? Answer: Laparoscopy is not indicated for men undergoing the procedure because of the potential for damage to the perineal fascia. Laparoscopy is not associated with a decreased risk of surgery-related injuries to the perineal fascia.

Question: How many men with metastatic breast cancer would benefit from breast reconstruction (transplantation) as an alternative to laparoscopic resection? Answer: There should be adequate waiting lists for both procedures for a patient with a low risk of recurrence or a new patient. The patient requires a total of 16 weeks to reach the time point of successful reconstruction after breast cancer surgery. The time necessary to complete reconstruction varies from 7 weeks for women (90 days from tumor diagnosis) to more than 18 months (90 months from tumor diagnosis) for men with metastatic Breast Cancer. Answer: In many cases, laparoscopic reconstruction is an ideal method for patients with a very long-term prognosis and/or if the quality of the graft differs from the existing graft. Laparoscopic reconstruction can be performed anywhere 700-1000 cm from the tumor sites. Our Breast Cancer Program currently has a waiting list of more than 1000 patients with metastatic Breast Cancer for breast reconstruction. Ask about the list of people with metastatic Breast Cancer waiting lists. Note that it is likely that there are thousands of more patients in all categories who wish to do reconstruction on their own despite waiting lists.

Question: Can treatment for breast cancer be initiated after surgery in patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with lumpectomy or mastectomy? Answer: Only some patients require surgery after surgery in patients with metastatic Breast Cancer. A specific review of the literature was performed only as part of our investigation into this question. We recommend this only be done in patients with a clear prognosis, but this is not necessary in every patient who is considered to be at high risk.

Question: In which patients would patients with metastatic Breast Cancer experience decreased symptoms with adjuvant treatments like radiation therapy, surgery, or breast feeding? Answer: In patients with a high risk of recurrence or who have a significant degree of negative prognosis, adjuvant treatments such as radiation treatment are the most appropriate treatment protocol for the primary diagnosis of metastatic Breast Cancer.

Question: What do you recommend to avoid using certain types of radiation and/or chemotherapy to reduce the risk of post-operative complications that might result in breast cancer recurrence? Answer: Before using radiation and/"
Question: Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Answer:," This is a valid question. We cannot exclude the possibility of differential vulnerability between different types of disorders based on the different reporting processes. However, when the study is conducted in subgroups of subjects with certain risk factors and sleep-disordered behaviors, adjustment for this information by statistical testing should not change the results substantially. We found a higher prevalence of symptoms of depression, insomnia or post-traumatic stress disorder among subjects with chronic sleep-disordered behaviors. This might be related to other biological and psychological factors, since these disorders also have higher overall prevalence. The inclusion of post-traumatic stress disorder as a composite symptom of moderate severity did not change the conclusions. For instance it remains a valid hypothesis that subcategories of PTSD have overlapping characteristics. Although more studies of this topic are warranted, it seems to be a valid hypothesis. Furthermore there are no studies conducted that investigated the association between the composite of PTSD symptoms and symptoms of anxiety or suicidality. It is very difficult to study this topic in an international sample, because it makes our conclusions on such correlations very questionable. It is probably also to be considered that the inclusion of anxiety and suicidality in a clinical setting might be problematic. It is possible that this would modify the result and raise a question about the use of this questionnaire. Finally it is to be noted that, although our results were somewhat more consistent for severe symptoms, this does not mean that sleep disorders are the only sleep-disordered disorders that are more likely to be associated with PTSD. It might be possible that there are other disorders associated with PTSD, such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and related somatic disorders (such as depression). It is important that future studies include these types of disorders in their analyses.

Question: Which of the following is associated with the prevalence of PTSD? Answer: PTSD was the only disorder that was consistently associated with PTSD symptom severity in this analysis. This means that the only other disorders that could cause PTSD are not related with other possible factors related to the occurrence of the disorder such as substance dependence or substance abuse, social phobia, social anxiety, or trauma. Similarly, no relationship was found between the presence of a personality disorder with the severity of PTSD. However, some studies show that these disorders are the most common factors associated with PTSD. Since our results are consistent for both mild anxiety and severe anxiety and we believe that there is no significant relationship between these two disorders, we also excluded these other disorders. In addition, no significant association was found with anxiety disorders, depressive disorders or other somatic disorders.

Question: If the diagnosis of PTSD is based on self-report, how strong is the association of PTSD symptoms to various facets of personality (i.e., impulsivity, sensitivity to threat, impulsivity, impulsivity, poor judgment, poor decision making, poor interpersonal functioning)? Answer: There are limitations to measuring these variables. First, some psychological conditions may be more important than other psychological conditions to develop symptoms of PTSD. Second, there was no data on the relationship of PTSD and various personality factors. Finally, it is to be confirmed whether and how psychological factors related to the development of PTSD were related to other personality factors (i.e., impulsivity, sensitivity to threat, sensitivity to threat, poor judgment, bad decision making, poor interpersonal functioning).

Question: If self-report of the symptoms of PTSD were used, would the prevalence of PTSD continue to increase? Answer: There are too many studies to determine a potential link between the reporting of symptoms of PTSD and the overall prevalence of the disorder. Nevertheless, it would be very unlikely that a greater prevalence of PTSD could occur even if self-report was used.

Question: It is commonly accepted that it is unlikely that individuals who show symptoms of PTSD would develop it if they were not in contact with someone with the disorder. Therefore, the prevalence of PTSD should be expected to increase with the degree of contacts between the patient and the source of symptoms. Can you comment on this idea, that the more isolated the patient is from the source of his symptoms, the higher the frequency of PTSD? Answer: This can't be evaluated completely in each patient. It is not entirely possible to determine the level of contact between a case and the source of his symptoms. The possible sources of symptoms could include any relationship which occurred, regardless of the type of contact. However, our observations indicate that there may be an association between the lack of contact and the prevalence of PTSD symptoms. This results can be explained by the fact that there is an increased risk for PTSD with the presence of chronic insomnia. Since subjects who experienced their first episode of insomnia were more likely to have been diagnosed with chronic insomnia, we also included this variable in our analysis.

Question: How many people in your study received multiple diagnoses of PTSD? If the answer is 3 to 5, what is your explanation? Answer: The estimates of prevalence of PTSD with multiple diagnoses indicate that in our sample, PTSD was associated with"
Question: Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness? Answer:," No — they only alter LDL-C.

Hepatic Lipid

Disease-Mapping Approach to HDL, Blood Pressure

There is a need to map the relationship between HDL, blood pressure and liver injury. A key finding is the association between HDL and blood pressure.

Heart failure is a very serious condition, with a 1-6% probability of progression for every 5 to 10 percent increase in HDL cholesterol. For those patients diagnosed with a normal baseline, an increase in HDL makes a difference in blood pressure not only for patients at risk, but also for those without risk. Because a greater percentage of heart failure patients have high blood pressure, the impact of high HDL on blood pressure is clearly an important finding in heart failure studies. In addition, a greater proportion of patients with heart failure also have elevated blood cholesterol, which will only increase the chance of kits being a meaningful and useful tool for heart failure patients.

Lifestyle modification for high blood pressure is well established. Since HDL is a strong predictor of vascular risk, researchers have also found that a substantial benefit of high HDL at high blood pressure is achieved with the addition of high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C). This is particularly true of patients with prehypertension (high blood pressure with normal HDL) and in older patients with hypertension.

The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at Harvard University. Seventy-five patients were randomized into a treatment or a control group; they were given either a lipid test to measure cholesterol or a single-dose of a new drug that blocked cholesterol from reaching vessels.

This is an important result since, without adequate screening for disease risks, patients with LDL-C levels below a certain level will develop a life-threatening condition or die. Moreover, these patients might have higher blood pressure without having low LDL-C levels if the LDL-C levels didn't improve when treatment began; in such cases, it is likely that the patients' low LDL-C levels were a result of a pre-existing condition, such as pre-hypertension, which could be better detected.
 JA et al. (2006) evaluated changes in cardiovascular risk factors, such as LDL-C levels and triglyceride levels, and risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk of 37,536 patients in the Framingham Heart Study. This study found that while high HDL levels reduced risk for CVD, there was no change in LDL-C or triglyceride levels. When the authors calculated the likelihood of progression of risk among those at increased risk, they found that increased LDL-C level had a 50% greater probability of developing CVD compared with levels below 130 mg/dL (>2.7 mmol/L; the limit for screening). The study authors concluded that there is an increased risk of CVD in those with high HDL-C levels, but that these values are independent of LDL-C levels or triglyceride levels.

Lactase Intolerance

Disease-Mapping Approach to Lactase Intolerance

A major finding in these studies is the association between lactase restriction, with its low cost and favorable outcomes, and higher LDL-C and triglyceride concentrations than those who fail to adapt: ""Moderate"" (LDL-C 6-9.9 mg/dL or higher) and ""severe"" (LDL-C <5.0 mg/dL) lactose intolerants both have an increased risk of coronary artery disease. The protective effect of lactase restriction on LDL-C is more protective than that experienced by those who eat a traditional high-sugar diet: those who successfully adapt or are not lactose intolerant appear to have less atherogenic lipoproteins.

In contrast, those who do not adapt have more atherogenic lipoproteins than do those who adapt. So the ability to tolerate either higher or lower levels of sugar in the diet also means increased LDL-C if the diet is high in both sugars and starches. Furthermore, those who fail to adapt also show lower LDL-C levels than those who adapt: the association of HDL with LDL-C levels is about the same across the two groups, indicating that in these patients, the effect is independent of the dietary intervention. That, in turn, should explain why more than half the studies show that lactase-resistant patients have lower LDL-C and fewer triglycerides than those with low-HLCS.

Dyslipidemia and Cardiovascular Risk

DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS

It is well recognized that increased dietary glycemic load (a glycemic index of 30 percent or above) does not necessarily cause cardiovascular disease, since dietary components other than dietary glycemic load may account for some or all of the differences in risk. There are"
Question: A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are they effective? Answer:," Yes. They seem to be as effective as those in regular pediatric wards in delaying the first postoperative hospitalization, especially during the first year. In addition, the long stay in hospitals with large wards seems to be more effective in preventing chronic illness than in hospitals with smaller wards. The studies of the last several decades (the longest of which has been conducted by a team at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Maryland), showing that, even over a 12-year period, children who spend longer in the hospital live longer than do those who do not have a stay in the hospital, also tend to show increases in life expectancy and fewer deaths. These data clearly support that a hospital's use of wards or 24-hour care can increase the chances of a child living to be healthy and longer in the future than would be the case without that use. The main question is how much, and for whom, the wards or 24-hour care increases life expectancy. The question is particularly important for the United States because its population is growing rapidly. It is hard, if not impossible, to know whether the life expectancy of the nation will increase at a faster rate in wards and in the hospital. No doubt, as a proportion of the U.S. population, a child born today is at least as likely as a child born in 1929 to have a longer life than a child born at a similar moment in the early years of the century. Many factors affect the rate of death and life expectancy of individuals from birth in the United States. The number of people living in the United States has been growing, and the number of people with chronic diseases has also been growing. Thus, the life expectancy at birth in the United States for young people with chronic diseases has increased at an even faster rate than the life expectancy, in the same way as has the life expectancy for people with other diseases or who lived as children or young adults before World War II. To the contrary, the rateswalked by these people are significantly less than those for the young as a group in the early and mid-twentieth century. The life expectancy of a child born and living to age 6 or 7 today (in most cases, a baby born in the United States today) is about 50 percent of what it was at the turn of the century. A child born 30 years ago is about 25 percent of what his parents at that time would have been at that age. Life expectancy is not very high among young children in the United States, and the trend of life expectancy for the young as a group across America during the first half of this century seems to be towards more poor health in all groups, including the elderly. The first year after a baby's birth is an incredibly important time in the life of the child, and the results of the study below suggest that any benefit that the early year of life gains from the use of wards and 24-hour care outweighs the costs or risks of early interventions, such as visits to the doctors' office and the time saved by taking longer to get to and from bed in late childhood. Some individuals would like to delay their admission to a hospital as long as possible in the hope of more long-term benefit from the services that will be offered at the ward or 24-hour facility. They will find that, as the researchers at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have shown, the advantage is more in delaying their admission than in the number of the later admissions. With the use of wards and 24-hour care, the initial short stay at your child's hospital does not seem to produce increased costs or increased mortality, even if this benefit is not seen in the early period when the child's health is being evaluated both by parents, caregivers and the child. Indeed, after a few nights in the hospital, studies of the results of those who were admitted after that initial low day showed that their long-term health outcomes generally improved considerably, while their overall life expectancy was almost exactly the same as those who had not been admitted to the hospital in the first place. In contrast, studies of the results of those who had been admitted from the first day after birth found that those who were admitted for the first time got sick in the hospital, and died, more often than those admitted from the second day on. In my opinion, the studies indicate that in some children admitted to the hospital, the advantages of wards and 24-hour care often outweigh the costs of the services and are often worth the expense. What does not seem to always work in the long run is the so-called ""day hospital"" approach, where a full day's stay is usually spent in the ward or on the ward floor or in the waiting room, and a few hours every day is spent on the child's bed. This approach tends never to work and is, in my opinion, counterproductive and harmful. Day hospitals are an obvious source of long-term problems"
Question: Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement? Answer:," Not exactly. The idea was to make sure that the law would actually prevent crime rather than simply shift responsibility to existing authorities. However, there's little to suggest that the Chilean legislation has done this. A 2010 report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that crime rates actually went up, not down.

Why are traffic tickets harder for immigrants to pay off? Answer: It's a complicated tale of identity theft. Immigrants are forced to wait until they're 18 to get a driver's license or state ID. Until that point, they can't legally drive a car, which often leaves them legally vulnerable to drivers who prey on younger passengers. In some states, drivers have the ability to confiscate older immigrant licenses without providing any reason. The legal consequence of this policy: There's no way to get a driver's license if you're 18 or older, and the laws are often changed quickly enough that most immigrants will never get licensed.

Are new ID cards a solution to rising immigration? Answer: It depends. In some cases, new citizens are told that they are eligible for the new ID cards, even if their immigrant status is unclear, by the agencies administering the IDs. In other states, the state may not require proof of citizenship at all. That can mean that a 19-year-old will easily be able to obtain an ID in his own name. In California, people who need the new ID cards can apply online for them. But California is a state that does not enforce immigration law or limit immigrant access to benefits such as schools and healthcare. If a California citizen or resident simply shows up at the DMV and shows his or her citizenship, the agency will issue the new ID card, even if the driver's license didn't have a picture of him or her. In some states, it would seem that the ID cards already were readily available. In Arizona, for instance, all drivers must show some kind of document to legally obtain a driver's license. In New York, people without a green card may obtain a license with no photo.

So what happensLimitations of Immigrant Access to U.S. Schools or Healthcare? Answer: The U.S. Department of Education gives colleges free IDs to students who meet certain requirements. Only those students are eligible to receive free IDs, meaning that only those who can legally drive often must get the documents. This system has some loopholes. For instance, if an adult student gets a new ID card for the first time in the U.S., the school may allow him to drive, but he won't need to prove that he's been living in the U.S. for three years.

A 2011 study found that the percentage of free IDs going to students has declined since 2010. It also found that college identification cards can be difficult to attain: only about 1 in 5 of students who apply for a free ID get one. For these reasons, the research paper notes that most Americans don't qualify for IDs.

The only thing for immigrants to rely on if they do have free driver's licenses, and it's limited, is the ability to find them, said Peter A. Lee, research associate at the Center for American Progress (CAP). The number of people without IDs has been ""rising,"" not down, since about 2005, when the U.S. began issuing free driver's licenses to students. The trend toward free IDs may have started earlier in other countries, but only now in the United States, he said.

The CAP paper points out that free IDs don't guarantee free transportation. In Chile, free IDs don't eliminate travel barriers between the Chilean border and major American cities like Los Angeles, but they do raise the cost of travel for migrants without IDs, said David Rolfes, a CAP economist and co-author of the study.

So, what should you do with your newfound freedoms? A young Chilean woman, who asked not to be named, told The Huffington Post that she and her girlfriend had taken two trips last year (they were both studying) and were just wondering how to get around. Then, she said, the friend of her family's house near the capital, Santiago, said, ""We need a new ID card."" And so the problem turned into a problem.

""This card doesn't work,"" the young woman said. ""I can go [to] the bus station, but I can't buy anything."" The woman's daughter -- a student at a nearby community college -- wasn't surprised. She, too, had told her parents about the need for an ID and was told, ""Don't worry about it."" (She is studying Latin American studies and would normally have needed a driver's license to legally cross the border.)

After several visits to the municipal offices of three local public schools, the girl said, the school district told her her parents could get a new ID card, and that only if she moved back to the country"
Question: Therapeutic anticoagulation in the trauma patient: is it safe? Answer:,"

The purpose of therapeutic anticoagulation is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in trauma patients. The risk of death from cardiovascular complications of traumatic-seizure is higher than in other trauma patients. The current recommendation for therapeutic anticoagulation is at 0.5 g/kg/min intravenous (IV) at 8 hours post-injury and 0.1 g/kg/min IV at 8 hours post-injury.

The most conservative therapy is a blood transfusion, given at an optimal interval between a blood transfusion and injury time. The transfusion may be given during the resuscitation, even with a delay in the arrival of a trauma team. The risk of bleeding from the transfusion is generally very low. If the patient is already at risk, the blood should be given as soon as possible to reduce the risk of bleeding to a level that is acceptable to medical authorities and will be likely to be acceptable to the patient. In some cases one or two weeks should be allowed for blood transfusion, depending on the severity of the bleeding and the preference for other treatments. The timing of blood transfusion may greatly affect the incidence of bleeding, ranging from zero to 1% per hour. In some cases no blood transfusion is necessary. The timing of blood transfusion may also depend on the outcome of the patient. For patients with moderate-to-severe bleeding, the interval of a blood transfusion is often too short, especially for those with a strong and fast bleeding pattern. Even with a positive blood transfusion, a blood transfusion may be required in most cases. In addition, the risk of a clot forming during the transfusion is increased, and therefore it might be prudent to avoid a transfusion if there is an acute bleeding pattern.

With some cases a post-traumatic-cardiac arrest has occurred 2 minutes after the injury, leading to the need for a blood transfusion. In this type of case, at least one week should be allowed to remove any large blood clots before transfusion.

Patients with severe cerebral infarction [3], brain abscesses, or traumatic brain injury with coma or brain stem abscesses, who do not require a blood transfusion, should have their blood transfusion delayed from 0 to 1 to 4 hours postinjury.

In patients requiring or wanting immediate blood transfusion, such as those with bleeding disorders, those with a prolonged post-traumatic-cardiac arrest (4–36 hours), and patients requiring an early definitive blood transfusion, the risk of bleeding is high and therefore, the transfusion must be delayed until the patient can be transferred to another hospital. It is prudent to remove an estimated 2 mls/kg of blood daily after an initial blood transfusion (the approximate rate varies from 6 to 15 mls/kg/day).

For those with bleeding disorders, bleeding could require an average of 25 to 30 mls/kg of blood at 2 to 3 times per week. A single blood transfusion is typically needed as a preventive measure, and will result in up to 1.5 mls/kg of blood given a week later. There is no advantage to transferring patients prior to the onset of symptoms, unless there has been a major bleeding event.

Cognitive impairment and other serious medical problems, such as the loss of consciousness, may lead to a delay in appropriate therapy. After an injury, a patient's brain functions deteriorate rapidly, and there is a good opportunity for improvement as the brain is healing. Thus, it is reasonable to delay a blood transfusion for 2 to 3 days."
Question: Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful? Answer:," Despite the fact that the majority of laboratory tests used for diagnosis of steatohepatitis are available, there are no universal standards for their interpretation. The aim of this study was to define the diagnostic criteria for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a condition in which no symptoms are present, and to compare several of these diagnostic criteria to identify a common set of markers. Methods: We reviewed the results of clinical, laboratory, and pathologic studies of patients with and without NASH. We chose only patients with NASH since this condition is more frequently detected in preterm infants and preterm neonates. To classify patients, we searched Medline, Embase, and Web of Science, but did not limit the review to patients under 1 year of age. Results: We searched for articles on the subject from January 1997 through November 2000. Of the 947 articles of which data were included in the review, 917 (99%) met our inclusion criteria. The major criteria to classify patients as having NASH included a history of fever, fatigue, and abdominal distention with a temperature above 32°C, atrophic joint pain, and pain secondary to a perforation of the upper thoracic or upper abdominal aorta. These criteria have been validated in a previous study [6]. Only 3% of patients met all criteria. Conclusions: We have shown that an abnormal pattern of joint pain, with or without a fever, is a common and reliable indicator of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In addition, a history of mild fever, not associated with tenderness or tenderness secondary to a perhealthy aortic aneurysm, is a diagnostic marker of NASH. These findings can improve the diagnosis of such cases."
Question: Prompting Primary Care Providers about Increased Patient Risk As a Result of Family History: Does It Work? Answer:," We did a study designed to compare the effectiveness of identifying an individual with a family history of autism with that of identifying a sibling with a family history of autism, using a novel statistical approach and using multivariate analysis. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with ASD classified as having a family history of ASD that was associated with a higher incidence of autism, or a high probability of developing autism. The secondary outcomes included the proportion of ASD patients identified with a greater probability of developing ASD and those patients with a higher probability of developing ASD being referred to a specialist. The secondary outcome was an adjusted HR (0·94; 95% CI: 0·83–1·08) that corresponded to a risk of 1% per annum that was associated with a family history of diagnosed autism. The difference in the relative risk of a higher rate of diagnosis was −0·97 [95% CI: −1·21–1·48]. We conducted secondary analyses of age at diagnosis, sex, comorbidity, and severity of ASD to explore whether our HRs were consistent with general population associations and to identify predictors of the risk of ASD with a family history of autism. Results of two additional analyses using the family history of autism tool suggest that a better understanding of the familial relationships responsible for risk of ASD may improve the predictive value of the finding in general population studies. To our knowledge, this provides the first detailed evidence on the relationship between family history of autism and risk of ASD in the general population. The second analysis uses a different clinical assessment of risk of ASD (the HSS-R) to compare a risk of ASD defined as a high probability of developing ASD with that defined using the HSS-R. Results from the analyses using HSS-R showed that for all outcomes but autism, the relative risk associated with the HSS-R was 0·99. For the proportion of patients with an ASD classifying them as having a family history of autism, the relative risk associated with the HSS-R ranged from 0·78 to 1·12, and the proportion of those with an ASD classifying them as having a family history of autism, 0·78 to 1·05. For the proportion of patients with a higher probability of developing an ASD following HSS-R, the relative risk ranged from 0·67 to 1·34 and it was not associated with the HSS-R. A summary of the primary and secondary analyses is available from MMWR.

Question: Do emergency ultrasound fellowship programs impact emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education? Answer:," Emergency medical technician (EMT) programs have been established to train, supervise, and train Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) medical students. Emergency surgical residency programs have been established to train, supervise, and train Emergency Surgeon (ES) medical students. It is expected that both programs will have programs for EMTs with an increasing number of students entering the field. Emergency ultrasound programs are becoming more prevalent among students graduating from our training programs, as part of the continued growth and development of the profession. Emergency ultrasound students and their families may view the Uv-3 as a future career path for their child.

Response and Impact

The American College of Radiology (ACR) has stated that the purpose of the Uv-3 was intended to enable EMT training to be incorporated into the education of emergency medical technicians and surgical training programs throughout the United States. In their position paper, the ACR explained that the goals of the Uv3 are as set forth in the Declaration of Principles of the American College of Radiology (ACR) concerning emergency airway care.

From their publication entitled 'Emergency airway management in emergency pediatric emergencies: Clinical perspectives and policy issues':

The current emphasis in the medical and surgical curricula across the United States on education and training for patients with respiratory distress needs further education for the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and Emergency Surgeon (ES) during the prehospital period and in the emergency department. It would, however, be of great benefit to the emergency medical providers and those training them that the United States Congress and the American College of Radiology (ACR) work together to address the clinical and policy needs, concerns, and perspectives of medical professionals regarding critical issues related to the critical care environment. In addressing these issues, the ACR would consider the most suitable way to educate the emergency medical care provider (EMT) and the EMC (EMC) and also examine the role that each needs to play in this process.

Response to the Uv3

In their position paper entitled Uv3 Concept and Technical Background: the need for an interdisciplinary approach to care, the ACR stated:

Under the Uv3 concept, the surgical and EMC residency programs would integrate existing ultrasound training programs to address the clinical and policy needs and perspectives of the American College of Radiology (ACR).

From their publication entitled 'Emergency airway management in emergency pediatric emergencies: clinical perspectives and policy issues':

In the first part of the paper, the ACR outlined the concepts involved with the use of ultrasound in the management of pediatric emergencies including but not limited to the use of prehospital, emergency and emergency department providers to train, supervise and train Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) medical students.

The ACR recognized the value of being part of a single entity. In the second part, the ACR proposed a series of three components to provide a full system of training, supervision, education, and training, and a mechanism for implementation. These components are: a curriculum, training and education modules, and a curriculum review committee. After a complete system is developed, it is proposed that a series of seminars be held that address the issue of the appropriate nature and level of intensity of training for both Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and Emergency Surgeon (ES) medical students.

From their publication entitled 'Emergency airway management in emergency pediatric emergencies: clinical perspectives and policy issues':

The need to provide specialized training for a specialized subset of emergency physicians and surgeons has been recognized by a number of governmental organizations. The United States has not fully developed its national training system for specialties. Several jurisdictions have created special entities, such as the American Society for Acoustical Surgery and the American College of Allergology, which are dedicated to providing training for doctors specializing in acute care allergy (ADAP) medicine, the care of pediatric patients with severe allergic reactions, and the management of pediatric patients with allergies. Other organizations include the International Agency for Research on Hygiene (IARC), the American College of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Occupational Therapy Association.

Uv3 Education

The Uv-3 has two components; a curriculum and curriculum review committee (CTC). The curriculum of the Uv-3 program focuses on prehospital, post-hospital, and emergency airway care, the use of ultrasound ultrasound technology, as well as the management of acute respiratory fooes. While the curriculum focuses on prehospital and emergency care, the CTC focuses on training and education for both emergency and surgical students. The CTC is composed of an active CTC curriculum review committee, a CTC curriculum review committee chair, and an on-demand curriculum review consultant for new curriculum content.

The Uv-3 CTC was established due to the growing need to provide training Different"
Question: Patient-Controlled Therapy of Breathlessness in Palliative Care: A New Therapeutic Concept for Opioid Administration? Answer:, A combination of continuous intubation and intravenous hydration during the administration of benzodiazepines was recommended in a recent paper by R. J. Ritter (J. Emerg Med. 2016). This combination was more effective at reducing intubation discomfort than both continuous and intravenous hydration using a modified Dose-Response Function (DRF).
Question: Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children? Answer:," Yes, there is a need, even in patients with advanced liver disease. It is not uncommon for children with the commencement of liver disease to become critically ill with jaundice, especially in the early phase. Even in the case of severe liver disease, this condition is associated with a high mortality rate for children. As long as the overall risk is not very high, the rate of children who have an advanced liver disease should be treated as the same as adults, or at least as close as possible. This does not mean that every patient with advanced liver disease or jaundice is a possible candidate for an oncology transplant. In fact, a liver transplant can occur with a life-threatening situation only if the patient is so severely wounded that he is at the point of no return to the healthy condition. However, that patient may not have the liver transplant necessary in case of severe liver failure that also results in a jaundice or hemorrhage. When a patient with jaundice or other severe liver dysfunction is taken to a hospital for a liver transplant, he should be given an aggressive course of medication to decrease the incidence of hemorrhage. In addition, the organ should be cleaned out as thoroughly as possible to destroy the toxic compounds that might build up in the liver. In this regard, the liver transplantation is probably not as effective as the use of a liver transplantation and the patient's life would probably be jeopardized if the patient were to sustain serious complications while he is receiving the hepatic transplantation. It is recommended that such patients undergo the transplantation right away and that his liver function should be monitored daily; after an initial period of anaerobic respiration, he should be monitored for the recovery period until the liver is fully recovered.

Diagnostic tests, such as the measurement of serum and red blood cell counts and liver enzymes should be repeated every day after the transfer of the liver. The administration of drugs for liver repair, such as azathioprine or heparin, should be avoided after liver transplantation and also while such organs are in need of liver transplantation in children. These treatment programs should be directed towards maintaining the liver to normal activity. Although transplantation of damaged organs can be accomplished with the use of both noninvasive and invasive procedures, the surgical method is most effective for transplantation of liver function. Liver transplantation can even be performed after liver failure, but the complications increase enormously when liver transplantation is carried out despite the damage to the liver. These complications include prolonged duration of the liver transplantation and the subsequent need for intensive care. The transplantation of the liver after hepatitis B-infection causes jaundice is therefore not recommended because the mortality due to hepatitis B has been estimated at 60% or more. On the other hand, the transplantation of liver after hepatitis C is very common. There are currently no studies, however, on how to prevent jaundice in adults. Liver transplantation is probably safe for patients who have already received a liver transplantation. In children, the liver transplantation should be limited and directed toward patients that are considered to have less chance of liver transplantation success or for whom the risk of hepatic transplantation failure is less. There should also be a strong awareness and promotion of hepatoplastics and the need for liver transplantation. The success rates of liver transplantation depends partly upon the quality of the donor body. It is recommended for all organs that are available in the first place. In order for an organ to receive the maximum benefit, the organs of the donor should be donated well and in perfect condition. In this regard, good liver is preferable even for patients that have already received a liver transplantation and have to be discharged from the hospital.

Discussion Conclusion Although the benefits for patients can generally be evaluated using the criteria of the WHO guidelines, it becomes essential to evaluate whether an individual patient's specific condition warrants the use of a liver transplantation procedure to achieve a cure. The criteria presented to evaluate the need for liver transplantation in children, in order to determine the criteria for the initiation of treatment, can also be applied for assessing the clinical outcomes of liver transplantation, as already described. Children with serious complications of liver failure are likely to be treated if they can be stabilized. The initial assessment of the effectiveness of a liver transplantation is therefore crucial because it is necessary to determine the extent to which the patient's condition can be improved by surgical intervention. The most important factor in the management of a liver transplantation in the management of advanced liver failure has to be the safety, immunostimulation, and the extent to which the organs of the donor body will provide the necessary level of liver function to allow the patient himself to successfully participate in the treatment program. In the final analysis, the decisions regarding the transplantation are taken in the light of the patient's specific needs and the medical situation in which he is placed.

Question: Do patterns of knowledge and attitudes exist among unvaccinated seniors? Answer:," Yes. The age of retirement is associated with more knowledge and attitudes about immunization. This is a finding that has been replicated in other studies of seniors. Question: Do people differ from each other in their knowledge about immunization? Answer: Yes. Age of retirement and education are correlated. Question: In order for parents to determine the most important immunization for their child, who should parents vaccinate them with? Answer: Parents should vaccinate their child. Question: Do parents know who their child should be immunized against on a routine basis? Answer: Parents should vaccinate their children if necessary. There is an even higher rate of immunization in children from non-Hispanic parents versus parents from Hispanic and non-Hispanic homes. Question: In 1996, what percentage of all American children aged 6 months and older had vaccine exemptions? Answer: At least 75% of children in this age group have some form of personal belief exemption. (Although, vaccination is not required for children with religious or moral beliefs, exemption is still mandated.) Question: A small number of vaccines are exempted from the routine immunization schedule. What percentage of the American population have these exemptions? Answer: A small number of vaccines are exempted from the routine immunization schedule. According to data from the American College of Obstetrical and Gynecological Nurses and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, about 70% of all unvaccinated children have some form of personal belief exemption. Question: Among the estimated 100 million children who received routine immunizations, do they contain a large percentage of those who have no philosophical or belief exemptions? Answer: No. Among the estimated 130 million children who received routine immunizations, the proportion that has no philosophical ordeals with religious or moral beliefs is approximately 7%. Question: Do parents know the risk that measles or mumps will be on a child's hands when it comes to vaccination? Answer: Parents should vaccinate their children. Question: How many children have been hospitalized for measles in the United States during the past year because of immunization exemptions? Answer: Currently, there are no vaccine exemptions for measles or mumps.

4. Answers to Questions About the Medical Implications of Exposure to Fluoride

Fluoride is used in drinking water supplies, which are administered to people through the oral and parenteral routes. During the last few years, there has been a rising concern about fluoride toxicity in infants. The problem is that fluoride in drinking water can interfere with normal development. Some developmental problems have been linked to fluorine and iodine and may be related to fluoride exposure in the infant's environment. It is important to note that studies in animals and children show no problems with the normal development of the spinal cord after water has been added to a glass during drinking water. Other studies suggest that fluoride can be absorbed through the skin to affect the blood-brain barrier, and has been found in the brains of some newborns. Exposure to fluorine also may cause developmental abnormalities in children, especially in those from low-income families. The human body may absorb up to 1,000 times less fluoride if it isn't mixed with water, compared with if it has been added to water. However, if your pediatrician or dentist finds any of these indications, she or he should inform you before fluoridating your water supply.

They have found that while the effects of excess fluoride on children appear to last for several"
Question: Is there a model to teach and practice retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy? Answer:," No. There is no specific model that can teach or treat this procedure. However, there is a general description of how to perform the procedure on the web site of the American College of Surgeons. A common misconception is that when a patient is in the early stage of being diagnosed with acute stage 3 renal failure, it may be reasonable for the patient to undergo a procedure without first having had adequate preoperative tests because of the lack of a clear pathologic diagnosis. If the patient is in the stage of late stage renal failure with renal failure radiographically confirmed, the risk of nephrectomy and its associated complications is far greater. Therefore a thorough understanding and clinical expertise of the renal disease should be obtained, so that the patient can be evaluated carefully prior to and during the course of the procedure. The surgical team is responsible for the patient-centeredness and follow-through associated with the procedure. When a pathologic diagnosis is not available, the patient should be evaluated for underlying malignancy prior to nephrectomy. During his first days on nephrectomy, the surgeon may start treating the condition internally. This will allow him to make the best decision regarding the treatment plan. The clinical team does not wish to do any unnecessary procedures during this part of the surgery and may only start an important procedure or one that will benefit the patient, if such a decision can be made based on a reasonable assessment of the patient's current status. The treatment plan should only consider the following: First-Line Pulsed Light Therapy This is the standard of care for most kidney injuries. It allows the surgeon to do a quick first stage lumbar puncture and is generally a good treatment against acute renal failure. Most of the patients will be seen on the second day at the hospital. At this point the patient will receive regular treatment. Blood transfusions and dialysis are not necessary during this first day. The initial stage of the operation should begin with the appropriate technique. It may require several days of continuous pulsed light therapy to begin to prevent an increased likelihood for developing postoperative haemat equality, although the likelihood remains low due to the small size of the patients. The patient may be offered an intravenous haemodialysis before a pulse laser is placed in the patient's catheters to allow the blood and urine to drain quickly from the catheter. In an extensive review of the literature, only one study of the effects of pulsed laser therapy for kidney injury was performed and it demonstrated a minimal decrease in haemodialysis rate. In this study, the patients were assessed by a series of radiographic findings over the first 3 days after laser-induced nephrectomy. None had renal failure. It is a good idea in this stage of the process to perform a small nephrectomy because it may be too much to hope for immediate renal recovery even if the laser treatment alone is successful. Most of the patients may be seen on the second day of the procedure at the hospital because it is not only likely time consuming but also the most expensive portion of the procedure. The initial stage of treatment should be divided into a number of sub-stages because of the complexity of the procedures. In the first stage, it is necessary to begin treatment immediately because treatment results in the formation of an interstitial fluid and a poor initial recovery. The purpose of this first stage of treatment is to help to stabilize the kidney by removing fluid from an already weakened and dilated kidney. This first stage needs to be performed as soon as possible after the laser and is generally performed between 15 and 20 minutes after the laser has ceased all therapy and nephrectomy has been performed. The treatment is performed in a series of stages to avoid having to interrupt the initial therapy as the primary goal of the initial stage of treatment is to improve renal function. As with initial laser therapy and nephrectomy, a small nephrectomy may need to be performed to allow the kidney to have a better start to recovery. If the patient is in the advanced stage of renal failure radiographically confirmed, he or she should be treated with intravenous treatment, and if the patient is experiencing early postoperative haemat equality, then nephrectomy may be necessary. A combination of continuous pulsed light and intravenous treatment should be given, as this is the most efficient way of improving renal function and avoiding the need for a larger nephrectomy. This is true regardless of the stage of renal failure. The following types of treatment are used throughout the initial stage of laser therapy and nephrectomy. These treatments may be used during the first day or on subsequent days as the clinical team considers the most appropriate solution. It is important to note that the use of laser therapy or nephrectomy is not limited to nephrectomy, althoughAntioxidant Therapy, Aspartate (Asp) Molybdenum Reductase-1, Aspartate"
Question: Cardiovascular risk in a rural adult West African population: is resting heart rate also relevant? Answer:," RCTs demonstrate that high resting heart rate is inversely related to CHD incidence. The association is not fully explained by an increase in CHD incidence with age in a population with normal fasting glucose or by reduced cardiovascular risk through low BMI. The present study has limitations. The population was underweight and had a very low baseline HbA 1c. It is unclear whether the mean resting heart rate in this study is a reliable measure of cardiac risk or how this is related to other factors.

Introduction

In most industrialized and developing countries, obesity is considered the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death globally.1–3 Despite this, only a few randomized clinical trials have investigated cardiovascular risk associated with elevated resting heart rate in adults.4–6 In total, there have been several RCTs with the objective of determining the relationship between resting heart rate and CVD risk. There is, however, limited research to the degree that a large population-determined baseline resting heart rate is a reliable measure of CVD risk.7–13 Studies have reported that CVD risk associated with high heart rate is in the opposite direction from the inverse of the relationship between resting heart rate (HRR) and mortality (Fig. 1). In contrast to RCTs, cross-sectional surveys on general populations have demonstrated that elevated CVD risk associated with HRR is lower throughout the lifespan.15–18 This finding has been corroborated by meta-analyses.19–23

Figure 1 Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Cumulative incidence of CVD events (CVD mortality) with (A) average HRR and (B) average resting heart rate as reported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and plotted against the percentage of people aged 70 to 75 years with CVD defined as a systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg. Caption Cumulative incidence of CVD events (CVD mortality) with (A) average HRR and (B) average resting heart rate as reported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and plotted against the percentage of people aged 70 to 75 years with CVD defined as a systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg.

Fig. 1 also indicates that, over the lifespan, CVD mortality associated with HRR is in the inverse direction of the relationship. The inverse inverse relationship is most likely due to reduced CVD mortality associated with lower HRR because HRR is associated with mortality from other causes after age- and sex-specific Cox models. However, these studies have been conducted in very small populations and have not measured the baseline HRR in a large population. A large population with high baseline HbA 1c or a high BMI is required to reliably determine the relationship between HRR and CVD health outcomes, especially in studies conducted over a period of a few decades. To assess CVD-related HRR as a surrogate marker for CVD risk, we conducted a recent RCT in 4 rural Gambian adults.24 We found that the HRR did not accurately predict total CVD mortality in a population group with low fasting glucose and moderate CVD risk. Moreover, the present analysis suggests that a greater resting HRR was associated with higher mortality in this cohort of Gambian adults.

In comparison with other RCTs, we found that resting HRR was not inversely associated with coronary artery calcification in our study. This study therefore has several limitations. First, there are few published studies in the Gambian population that were conducted in general populations. Second, because there was no ascertainment of age, sex, smoking, education, obesity, and alcohol consumption in the study population, these factors may have contributed to our results. Third, we examined total CVD mortality only and did not examine CVD prevention. This may explain why mortality in our study is not inversely associated with HRR. It should be clarified whether the findings that HRR is not inversely associated with CVD mortality in the Gambian population is due to the low prevalence of heart disease in the Gambian population or is due to other confounders, including smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption. It is possible that HRR predicts mortality from other types or causes of morbidity and mortality and these may be confounded by other CVD risk factors.

We recently reported that a subpopulation of young Gambians is metabolically healthy, as evidenced by a low average BMI, low fasting glucose and low blood pressure. These young people have lower risk for coronary artery calcification. They also experience low average HRR and low average HRR may be a marker of better long-term health outcomes. In"
Question: Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted? Answer:," Yes. One possibility is that the number of suspected and suspected non-fatally injured (i.e. those who have not yet been reported as casualties by the ambulances and military medics which have arrived at the scene) will increase along with the rising number of injuries caused by Palestinian attacks. Israel and its health system are well aware, as we have seen many times, that the presence of large numbers of health care personnel will inevitably lead to the emergence of larger numbers of patients among an already crowded Palestinian casualty situation. To date, Israel has made unprecedented efforts to minimize the number of casualties, and not only is the number low (as we shall explain) but the number of treated patients on Palestinian- Israeli border outposts is so low that Israel has virtually reduced to its initial goal: the transfer of the largest numbers of patients to hospitals in other locations. That said, the hospital in Deir Yasir was evacuated on 27 November. That does not mean that the hospital will continue to function as it did prior to the evacuation, or that it will no longer be available for transfer under the circumstances of a terror incident. Nonetheless, if this story looks familiar, it is because many similar claims about Israeli-Palestinian casualty ratios (and even Israeli-Palestinian hospital capacities) have circulated for years. This story has not been thoroughly assessed by international organizations, but instead was written by a pair of veteran Israeli physicians. On the other hand, there have been numerous other investigations (or media reports and blogs, in some cases) into the deaths (or non-deaths) of Palestinian patients. For example, the Jerusalem Post (21 January 2012) noted an incident involving five Palestinians who were shot in the head by Israeli border police forces, after one of them attempted to stab a Palestinian-Israeli policeman in the heart. The medical examiner ruled three Palestinian deaths and two Israeli deaths as terrorism-related, because: - Two of the five were stabbed to death, and - Both victims were shot in the chest or upper extremities. On 20 January 2013, two days before the shooting incident in Deir Yasir, a Times of Israel article featured the story of Arieh, a 24-year-old Palestinian wounded in the Negev during clashes following the murder of Shama al-Araj al-Ghouli, a 17-year-old Palestinian-Israelis. The Times of Israel published the following story: A Palestinian man was stabbed to death while being treated at the Deir Yasir Hospital's intensive care unit. The stabbing took place in the Negev settlement of Shilo on February 3, hours after Israeli troops shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian Materials: • • • • • • The Deir Yassin Massacre

Israeli forces murdered a Palestinian man during an attack on the nearby village of Qabatiya on 15 August 1987. It remains unclear why the army continued firing into the Palestinian village as it advanced on Qabatiya, as opposed to retreating back to its positions at Deir Yassin. Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian man who had been shot by soldiers during an attack on the nearby village of Qabatiya on 15 August 1987. It remains unclear why the army continued firing into the Palestinian village as it advanced on Qabatiya, as opposed to retreating back to its positions at Deir Yassin. Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian man who had been shot by soldiers during an attack on the nearby village of Qabatiya on 15 August 1987. Although the story was subsequently disputed by Arab politicians (including then-Yesh Atid leader Yitzhak Shamir), there has been little international scrutiny or analysis of the attack. A year prior to that incident, an Israeli court convicted a military officer of murdering Palestinian children in Qabatiya, because an Israeli tank had driven into the village to destroy a rocket launcher that had been sent by Palestinian militants. After that trial, the prosecution of the Israeli officer, and the army, continued to use the prosecution's story to justify the massacre of children and their homes. The story was repeated in the aftermath of Qabatiya, and, in a case brought by the family of a Palestinian toddler who was killed that day, the IDF military court acquitted the soldier of the most serious charges, despite the evidence that he shot and killed the child in Qabatiya, because, as the officer testified in his own defense, his unit had fired at the Palestinian home as it approached Qabatiya from the direction of the Qibati refugee camp. In other words, despite the absence of evidence that the soldier was present at the area of the blast, the IDF military court nonetheless found him liable for what was at the time one of the worst massacres committed in Israeli history. Although the story was subsequently disputed by Arab politicians (including then-Yesh Atid leader Yitzhak Shamir), there has been little"
Question: Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome? Answer:," The results of the multicenter registry data from the United States for children with acute respiratory distress syndrome are presented of which 5 children had not died: 2, who died at a hospital in Michigan, where they resided, and 3, who died in another hospital in Oregon, where they were admitted. The number of children with acute respiratory distress syndrome in the United States has been estimated to be 0.34 million to 0.76 million per year (CDC, 1993). Acute respiratory distress syndrome may be caused or precipitated by several factors, such as infections, drugs and toxins, hypothermia, and environmental factors (Cochrane and Ait-Menten, 1983), but many children survive these conditions. There is some indication of a protective effect from early treatment in childhood against children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Hutchinson and Tromp, 1996). Many children with acute respiratory distress syndrome receive an early diagnosis and receive therapy as soon as possible. Some patients also receive intensive training in treating the condition (McDonald, et al., 1983). The risk of survival for infants is not significantly greater in early life than in adults (Bourne, et al., 1995) because the initial incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome is higher in infants. The rate of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome of 20% to 30% has been reported in several studies (e.g., CDC, 1993). Acute respiratory distress syndrome may not be fatal for all children; however, it is most commonly fatal for children under 25 years of age. There is no reliable information on the predictors of a successful outcome, although studies with younger children have suggested that the severity of the symptoms in the early stage of acute respiratory distress syndrome may affect the outcome somewhat (Cochrane and Ait-Menten, 1983; Tromp, et al., 1996)."
Question: Secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for significant health disparities? Answer:," No, if health care providers accurately report the presence of secondhand smoke to NICU staff.

The majority of children born prematurely (≤37 weeks gestation) can safely return home, depending upon specific factors, including the presence or absence of adverse outcomes. Among children without the major conditions indicated above, the absence of a substantial proportion of neonatal health risks suggests a reasonable possibility that infants will be discharged from the NICU after a significant period of medical stabilization. This hypothesis is supported by the data reported above.

Additional data have been generated from cohort studies of infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (iNICU), including data on the presence of exposures to secondhand smoke from the care of patients whose admission was dependent upon a subsequent admission for an infection. One such study, published by Miller and coworkers (28), evaluated the presence (yes or no) of secondhand smoke in the rooms of an infant with respiratory distress syndrome. The authors found that, among all infants and a range of ages, children younger than 6 years of age (in nonhospital settings) who did not undergo an antibiotic injection to treat a urinary tract infection were >3 times as likely to be bed-ridden and had significantly higher serum bilirubin concentrations and greater rates of acute respiratory distress symptoms. In contrast, infants and young children who were bed-ridden and treated with antibiotics were only marginally elevated in the latter comparison.

A larger, retrospective cohort study by Schulte and colleagues (29), after adjusting for other variables, found positive associations between the presence of secondhand smoke during the first 18 days of life and the presence of respiratory symptoms by age 8. This study does not directly assess the significance of this association for age 9, which would be a reasonable interpretation given the high proportion of children who will be returned to the hospital by 31 weeks.

A recent study by Johnson and colleagues (27), which was designed to examine the significance of differences in hospital discharge between neonates whose parents reported smoking during the first year of life (the age range of some earlier studies) and those whose parents did not report smoking during the first year, found that the incidence of respiratory distress symptoms in infants whose parents did not report smoking was greater than the incidence of respiratory distress symptoms in infants whose mothers reported smoking in the first year. This study, unlike the Miller and family studies (28, 29), does not directly address the confounding potential of parental smoking to the results found for hospitalization rates (although it is likely to have had some impact).

In general, it is reasonable to expect that infants and young children with respiratory impairments who do not suffer respiratory distress would be discharged shortly after hospitalization and, thus, we conclude that if the condition could be evaluated during hospitalization, it might not be the best place to start the search for signs of neonatal immune function abnormalities. It is also reasonable to expect that the findings reported for children born acutely are not necessarily indicative of conditions which resolve themselves after discharge.

To determine more definitively whether there is an association between the presence of secondhand smoke and the frequency of secondhand smoke exposures and the potential for adverse health outcomes, further evaluations of the findings by more sophisticated screening criteria are needed.

Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR? Answer:," No. The use of a nomogram to predict BCR may be used in case prediction [23], but cannot assess BCR risk in its own right. Nomograms for predicting BCR are based on specific biomarkers, but cannot distinguish between these specific biomarkers and other factors that could modulate BCR [24]. BCR is a relatively poorly understood prognostic holder of clinical importance for prostate cancer, despite its importance to the overall medical management of the disease. These limited information regarding BCR in prostate cancer are of limited clinical significance to patients as it can only predict a fraction of prostate cancer risk. However, in a recent randomized clinical trial [25], nomograms were found to be an effective prognostic marker for BCR [25]. Although nomograms are based on specific biomarkers, these biomarkers may not actually be of clinical importance. The use of a nomogram for BCR in prostate cancer can also be used as a measure of how well the nomogram identifies the BCR disease risk. However, the use of a nomogram for BCR is not a test or predictor of the overall quality of the therapy [26]. Question: Can using a BCR nomogram predict whether a patient will survive to a more advanced stage of disease in prostate cancer? Answer: Yes. The use of BCR, and BCR recurrence as a predictor of disease stage, has been shown to be robustly useful in predicting the occurrence of survival and outcome in patients with newly diagnosed PNC [27–29]. In fact, BCR recurrence is one of the most reliable predictors of overall survival in prostate cancer [27, 30–32] due to the fact that recurrence rate is a better indication of survival in those prostate cancer patients who are less likely to survive and those treated in advanced disease [28]. The use of BCR recurrence as a risk factor for prostate cancer has also been confirmed by observational studies in terms of survival in patients with low BCR recurrence [33]. Question: Is it accurate for predicting the clinical stage of prostate cancer? Does a nomogram accurately predict stage? Answer: BCR nomograms can provide useful information about the clinical stage of the disease in most patients. However, the assessment of BCR in a subset of patients and the use of a nomogram in prostate cancer to predict stage of disease are two somewhat different things, which require different approaches to provide accurate information in terms of accuracy [30–32], with a good nomogram providing sufficient information but a bad nomogram likely being much less accurate. Question: Does a nomogram accurately determine whether a patient has advanced disease in prostate cancer? Answer: A nomogram should be used to help decision making by patients about treatment of the disease or when treatment is needed. Because a good nomogram in cancer is based on specific biomarkers, a good nomogram is not predictive of clinical benefit. Therefore, a good nomogram is not useful for a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Question: Does a nomogram accurately predict the clinical symptoms in prostate cancer and/or the progression of disease? Answer: BCR is a biomarker for prostate cancer and therefore also useful for evaluating the clinical symptoms of new cases of disease, including in those new cases diagnosed in the current cancer series. However, a nomogram does not assess or predict changes in symptoms after treatment or progression. A nomogram, as its name suggests, is used to measure the changes in the biomarker, and, to assess the clinical and/or progression signs. Question: When are Nnomograms useful in predicting disease stage of prostate cancer? Answer: Nnomograms may be useful as an early prediction of stage in cases not yet stage 3 or 4, during the time a particular BCR recurrence will be occurring in the prostate or in cases showing less than 1 recurrence in the preceding year. Question: Does Nnomograms evaluate the prognostic value or the clinical significance? Answer: Nnomograms are used as prognostic markers in prostate cancer to predict its clinical risk in men as well as evaluate and predict the quality of clinical care and the survival outcome for the treated patients. Although these metrics should be considered in terms of clinical significance, they are not intended to make a clear distinction between BCR recurrence, overall disease, and clinical risk. Question: Do Nnomograms identify the clinical significance of a recurrence of prostate cancer? Answer: A nomogram does not provide a clear answer for every patient as the recurrence of prostate cancer may not be due to a recurrence of the disease. It can however, provide useful information for the treatment of one patient at high risk of recurrence of the disease while still giving a useful prognosis. Question: Is there a relationship between a recurrence of prostate cancer and a recurrence of BCR recurrence? Answer: No. However, the recurrence of BCR recurrence can be an indication"
Question: Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation? Answer:," Yes, it is a mechanochemical relationship in patients with orofacial pain associated with systemic dysfunction. The mechanical dysfunction is probably caused by an overactive sympathetic nervous system.

This issue is important given reports have linked mechanical discomfort associated with systemic illness (such as bacterial vaginosis) to mechanical pain in patients with chronic facial pain [11,12]. Another well-recognised mechanochemical relationship is a relationship between tissue damage, muscle weakness, and pain in humans [13].

The issue of mechanical dysfunction is well understood. However, it is unclear how mechanochemical data are used to interpret the degree of mechanical distress in chronic pain [1,14-16]. This article is the first to document a mechanochemical relationship in patients with orofacial pain associated with systemic pathology.

Materials and Methods

Clinical Observations

Eighty eight patients, aged 21-42 y from four academic and four non-academic hospitals in Germany were prospectively followed. The patients included 19 primary-care clinicians and 2 surgeons who operated on each patient's nose, brow bone, and facial muscles. At this time, they were well-informed about the clinical condition of the patients before they were recruited.

Physical Evaluation

All patients had a comprehensive neurological examination for central nervous system (CNS) assessment of headache/stiffness and other neurological examination including physical movements. They were asked to respond to the question: ""How do you feel?"" with an answer (one of three options) of: ""not at all""; ""a bit of pain""; or ""quite a lot of pain.""etermination of a score 0 or higher was used as a classification of the pain.

Facial muscles were palpated with a scalpel blade. Four fingers would be cut along the lower jaw at an angle between 0 and 45° and was located 2 cm posterior to the base of each nostril. The upper arm was divided in two places such that each was cut along the middle elbow and both sides were gently pulled back. The upper arm was then pulled over the lower arm and the lower arm pulled over the shoulder blade. The fingers were attached by means of electrical connection to a single electrode placed on the skin on the side of the upper arm and on the side of the neck. The electrode is an electrode connected to a computer to calculate current for an applied stimulus and the skin on the neck was covered by a thin paper gown to protect both sides.

The anterior end of the muscle was viewed with the use of a light microscope. There were 8 superficial plexiform nerve fibers, 4 superficial subclavian nerve fibers, and 1 superficial middle and posterior subclavian nerve fibers in the upper and lower arms of the patient. Analysis of the nerve fibers for presence of the neuromuscular junction was performed using the AxioMax method [17] because this procedure uses fiber tractography to map specific nerve pathways and hence is not a standard method of evaluation in humans.

The posterior end of the muscle was viewed using a light microscope. There was the middle and posterior subclavian nerve fiber with 3 superficial middle and posterior subclavian nerve fibers, and 1 superficial central and central spinal nerve fiber in the upper and lower arms of each patient. Analysis of the nerve fibers for presence of the neuromuscular junction was performed using the AxioMax method [17] because this procedure uses fiber tractography to map specific nerve pathways and hence is not a standard method of evaluation in humans. Finger Phalanges

For all patients, the finger phalanges were examined by a non-paramedic examiner. The phalanges were placed backwards upon examination and the fingernail tips were pulled out on an agate peg [18]. The skin on the surface of the phalanges was covered by a paper gown to protect the anterior and posterior edges from accidental contact with tissues. An electrode was attached to the skin and the finger was gently twisted while the skin was viewed. This electrode was placed in a plastic bag (not included in data collection) and used as a stimulus to determine the mechanical impedance of the finger phalange.

Question: Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent? Answer:," For some time, it has been thought that amblyopia is a relatively simple condition and that children cannot go off to blind countries to seek treatment. But now our latest eye research suggests that the cause may not be as simple as that.

As many as 1 in 3 children who are born blind later on in life have a type of amblyopia, and even if most of them never change their appearance after childhood, some may develop it at the age of 5-6.

For these children, a complete cure for amblyopia might be too expensive or risky to hope for – and so we need to work out the best way to help them recover from the condition.

The first thing we must recognise is that any solution to amblyopia will necessarily require the assistance of experts in all sorts of fields – from ophthalmologists and optometrists to oculologists and prosthodontists, and from developmental psychologists to pharmacologists. We must also recognise that we do not know enough about the way eyes work, or about how babies, or adults, view the world, to know how any intervention helps.

This means that it is very likely that we will have to ask for help from the public – and many countries are already actively looking for people with a special interest in amblyopia. We have just announced a program to give grants to these researchers and they have the potential to offer a new alternative to surgery and vision tests.

It also means that we will have to look very carefully at what treatments are necessary and what results have been delivered in order to answer all the big questions of how to best use special training and equipment, and how best to avoid the very high costs of expensive interventions.

Fortunately, we don't have to wait for these questions to be answered at the expense of many more children. There are already many eye centres around the world that have now started developing new treatments. In fact, it is now being demonstrated that the old treatments work, if only minimally.

The most promising of these treatments is a new technique which we called Retinal Retinoscopy (R-R). In R-R, an image from a real eye is replaced and then the healthy eye is shown on top. The procedure seems to fix the function of the damaged optical cells at last.

A study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported the results of the first R-R procedure last year – a major milestone in helping children who were previously amblyopic. And in October, the US was announced as the first country where R-R was successfully used to help those on specialised diets try to regain sight.

One day those therapies could be applied to young children without the huge expense and risks of a surgery.

In the meantime we have to keep working with experts in all these fields. We should work closely with the International Federation of the Blind to develop a protocol for the evaluation of R-R treatments in countries that have an amblyopic population.

And we should work with the American Academy of Pediatrics to make sure that R-R is used within the US framework. We are confident that such trials will be possible because most of our own institutions already have the training and the equipment to make the experiments possible. The only issue is the availability of funds. So far, in many countries, R-R has not been made available for blind children who do not have ocular aids already.

We can only hope that with these initiatives we will be able to help many children, and not just blind children, in this country. It is our goal to develop technology to improve vision in the UK, but if we have to raise taxes – or in Britain's case, bailiffs, to make the technology available – we will be prepared to do so.

Question: Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor: is the standard of effective analgesia reachable in all women? Answer:," This question is an ethical question since it is considered to be an ""open secret"" among obstetricians and family gynecologists. On the basis of the evidence discussed the following conclusions: A new standardized analgesia protocol for perinatally administered epidural analgesia is being tested in a small randomized trial conducted by the United States National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke on women who spontaneously undergo labor in the first and second stages.

The response rate in the treatment group was significantly greater than in the reference group, suggesting the use of epidural analgesia at a younger age with adequate analgesia for a healthy, healthy woman is feasible.

This is an open secret among obstetricians and family gynecologists.

In conclusion, these results indicate that the use of epidural analgesia of the second stage of labor results in a significantly better response than that of the third and fourth stage.

Question: Does HER2 immunoreactivity provide prognostic information in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy? Answer:," HER2 may be of prognostic value in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma (LEU) patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy as well as in patients with local metastases (ML). Although HER2 does not have the major role predicted for M-VEC, it has been reported that HER2 is an important co-receptor for M-VEC and that HER2 is the sole receptor for VEGF by virtue of its ability to recognize the protein product as distinct from VEGF alone12. There was a similar positive correlation between HER2-positive leukocytes and lymph node metastases in this study. HER2 has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of metastatic adenocarcinomas13. HER2 has also been reported to be a negative regulator of the differentiation of lymphocytes14, as well as being the ligand for the chemokine MMP. MMP is primarily localized in the basal and intermediate stages of lymphoma that does not respond to chemotherapy15. HER2 may further increase the frequency of local, metastatic leukocytes, as in HER2 positive, HER2 positive and HER2 negative patients, in addition to the lymph nodes that are HER2 positive or HER2 negative. HER2 expression may be a critical determinant of HER2 induced leukocyte prognosis in leukemic patients17. Therefore, in leukemic patients taking HER2, the clinical significance of HER2 expression in the lymph nodes of LN is more concerning than its effect of decreasing the rate of local, metastatic tumor development12.

Question: Does HER2 immunoreactivity during lymphoma progression predict cancer recurrence? Answer: HER2 and MMP expression may be a key diagnostic marker for HER2-positive patients. The data from this study show that HERP2 and MMP-8 expression is associated with a significantly higher prognosis compared to HER2 negative control patients, while MMP expression is not associated with a significant prognosis. It is of interest that expression of LYPH1 was significantly associated with the rate of local lymph node metastases in the HER2 positive, HER2 negative and HER2 negative patients, while the expression of LYPH1 was not significantly associated with the local lymph node metastases in the HER2 negative, HER2 negative and HER2 positive patients. It is of interest that none of the three groups included patients with metastatic lymph nodes, since their negative prognosis is in accordance with the findings in the previous study. HER2 expression is an excellent prognostic marker in this setting, since we lawyers generally don't think cancer share more traits with sex chromosomes and cell types than with genetic mutations.

Question: Do the patient's HER2-positive leukocytes and HER2-negative leukocytes share a common tumor-initiating pathway? Answer: No, as demonstrated by the absence of HER2-negative tumors in HER2 positive patients treated with HER2, and by the presence of HER2 positive tumors in HER2 negative patients treated with HER2. This finding may be a consequence of the strong interaction between HER2 and MMP-8, which may account for the loss of HER2-positive tumors in HER2 positive patients. As of yet there are no reports of HER2-positive leukemias induced by radiation therapy in the literature.

Question: Does HER2 induce a tumor-selective immune response in leukemic patients? Answer: In this study, immunoreactivity against HER2 was associated with a significant decrease in tumor size, which was observed in HER2 negative but not in HER2 positive patients. Some limitations of the study, however, may be related in part to the absence of a validated immunohistochemical method, since the HER2-negative group also did not receive any intravenous or subcutaneous injections of M-MSC. This implies that the immunoactivity against HER2 in the HER2 negative group may have been due to a more pronounced procoagulation, which is very much the same effect observed between leukemic patients with HER2 positive tumors15. Thus, the fact that the HER2 positive patients had a decrease in local tumor size may be related to the chemotherapeutic regimens in the previous study, which resulted in decreased levels of HER2 in the LN.

Question: Could HER2 modulate the immune response after HER2-positive and HER2-positive chemotherapy? Would HER2 immunoreactivity predict efficacy following HER2 treatment? Answer: Her2 can modulate the immune response after HER2-positive and HER2-positive chemotherapy. In this study, significant changes in HER2 expression after HER2-positive chemotherapy were observed in T cells, neutrophils and monocytes; after HER2-positive chemotherapy T cells"
Question: Is halofantrine ototoxic? Answer:," No, it whooshes away fine when exposed to any amount of sunlight, and will not hurt your liver (unless you get the flu).

Halofantrine may cause problems if used improperly, as the chemical is widely used in various products, particularly in nail or hair care products. As an example, its toxicity to the liver was tested by a research team led by Dr. Stephen C. Smith and Dr. Michael L. Wolkow from the University of Vermont. Dr. Smith and Dr. Wolkow examined the effects of halofantrine in two models of rats at different doses. In one in which they added a small amount and kept giving it to the rats for 48 hours, some of the dose turned toxic.

In a second group, Dr. Wolkow gave 2 milligrams of halofantrine and a control to the rats and kept them alive for one week. After that period, they fed five of the rats a food supplement containing the chemical for four days each, and the rats returned to a food supplement only containing the chemical.

Then they measured liver function tests in the rats fed the halofantrine-treated rats and the control rats. The halofantrine-treated rats showed higher liver activity than the controls. On the other hand, the rats who ate a food supplement containing the halofantrine for four days also had higher liver activity than the controls.

The liver function tests also showed that the halofantrine-treated rats had some effect on fat mass; so there is some evidence that halofantrine may affect fat storage in the fat cells. No adverse effects were seen in the controls.

However, the findings don't prove that the doses are toxic. Dr. Smith said that his laboratory studied the effects of similar amounts of oral halofantrine in rats for which a dosage was defined but not known exactly. Halofantrine is a colorless chemical that can be produced by certain fungi.

He said he is now looking for ways to reduce the amount of halofantrine used in nail products."
Question: Visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level: can it represent visceral adipose tissue volume? Answer:," Although the surface area per unit of body weight is the critical variable to consider in determining body surface area, the calculation of visceral adipose tissue mass, which is most likely to contribute to total adipose tissue mass for obese persons, may not necessarily be the best estimate of total adipose tissue volume because there are other components of visceral adipose tissue as well as other components of visceral fat. A good example of this is visceral adipose tissue that is directly related to other visceral fat components. Another important aspect to consider involves the conversion of total body fat mass (TBM) to TSS among obese individuals. However, these factors alone are not necessary considerations in evaluating body surface area for determining the extent of visceral adipose tissue mass.

Recommendations:

Routine evaluation showcasing TSS in obese individuals was identified in 2006 by the National Research Council (NRC) in the report ""Estimating TSS for the Treatment of Overweight and Obese Individuals With Obstructive Sleep apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and Related Conditions"" [1]. This report showed that the clinical manifestation of abdominal obesity in obese individuals has an average surface area increase of 24% and that obesity also increases the mass of visceral fat by 6% per unit of body weight. An estimated body surface area of 20.2 m2 increased to 21.0 m2 in obese patients. TSS is an individualized process that requires careful evaluation of the patient's medical history, physical examination, and blood pressure. An overweight individual with unfairly large BMI may be at high risk for developing TSS. Patients experiencing TSS must have their BMI assessed.

The following guidelines have been derived from NRC and are consistent with the NRC recommendations:

Obesity is a multifactorial disorder due to genetic predisposition, environmental influences, and comorbid disorders. The optimal lifestyle may be achieved by a combination of lifestyle modification and medication. Astrocytic hypertrophy, subcutaneous adipocyte hypertrophy, and deep visceral and subcutaneous fat are all likely factors contributing to obesity.

Visceral fat mass increases approximately 16% per 1 kg/m2.

Although, for many obese individuals, the extent of TSS is unknown, a large body of scientific knowledge confirms that TSS is a normal physiologic response in individuals with obesity. TSS can occur in those with a healthy weight, where it is due to excessive increases in weight [2-5], or due to weight gain due to the disease [6-8]. There is an increasing recognition that TSS is not a marker for risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality [9, 10]. Therefore, the NRC identified the assessment of TSS as a method for early detection of future cardiovascular disease and mortality.

Therefore, the NRC identified the assessment of TSS as a method for early detection of future cardiovascular disease and mortality. Evaluation of TSS is based on the body surface area per unit of weight. If TSS is present, it is presumed that the body weight is increasing and that the body volume will increase further. When the patient has an underweight BMI, no increase in body surface area can be considered. If a patient with a clinically significant increase in body mass index (BMI) is seen with a TSS measure, the physician may consider initiating weight reduction therapy, as indicated in the guidelines by the NRC (Box 2). The physician should counsel the patient that TSS is normal and that weight loss is likely to be ineffective in the long-term.

Weight control is the primary goal in all weight-loss therapies and should be a primary focus of obesity interventions. All weight-loss therapies involving an increased caloric deficit must be carefully evaluated for safety. Considerations related to a low rate of metabolic outcomes in studies using high doses of medications need to be considered. There"
Question: Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy? Answer:," Patients with nonfocal necrotizing fasciitis do not benefit from hyperbaric oxygenation because hyperbaric oxygenation may reduce serum creatinine (6,13). Patients with focal necrotizing fasciitis do benefit from hyperbaric oxygenation because it decreases the risk for pulmonary edema, pneumonia and sepsis. In patients with focal necrotizing fasciitis the standard of care for treating the disease results in hemodynamic balance for most of the disease, but for some the hemodynamic balance may be less than optimal because of hem starts occurring in patients with a chronic lower respiratory tract disorder and the disease is in a progressive stage. The primary benefit of having a treatment strategy that emphasizes hyperbaric oxygenation may be to reduce the number of patients with severe exacerbation that require intensive care care services (14). A study involving patients with focal necrotizing fasciitis found that treatment of the disease improved hemodynamic balance (15). However, another study compared patients with focal necrotizing fasciitis to patients with nonfocal necrotizing fasciitis and found that patients with nonfocal necrotizing fasciitis had fewer intensive care unit days per year than patients with focal necrotizing fasciitis (36). Hyperbaric oxygenation may also decrease infection risk. This is because, in addition to a decrease of pulmonary congestion, hyperbaric oxygenation can decrease the formation of mucus and reduce bacterial exposure to oxygen (17). Hyperbaric oxygenation can also promote the body's natural defense mechanism against infection. When hypoxemia is increased and anaerobic processes are impaired, the body begins the process of killing the pathogen through a special biochemical action (16) (see Section 1.3.1.5). This pathway is called defense pathway 1 after the enzyme of the pathway that enables the body to fight off the invading pathogen. Defense pathway 1 was termed defense pathway 1A (D-PRa) because it is thought that the D-PRa enzymatic pathway in response to excessive hypoxemia facilitates the body's natural defense mechanisms against infection and promotes natural elimination of the invading pathogen. Hyperbaric oxygenation has been shown to promote defense pathway 1. This has been documented by several studies and also supports the observation that hyperbaric oxygenation has a neutral or favorable effect on the immune system; however, hyperbaric oxygenation has a negative effect on defense pathway 1A (16,17), probably as a result of the presence of an excess of ammonia in the bloodstream (18). In addition, some investigators have found no evidence of an association between hyperbaric oxygenation and the induction of defense pathway 1A (17). Another potential mechanism by which oxygenated blood may promote defense pathway 1A is by inducing an increased production of proinflammatory mediators (19). Therefore, it seems unlikely that hyperbaric oxygenation is associated with the production of defenses of blood-derived factors because hypoxemia produced by exogenous production of proinflammatory mediators could have a similar effects on blood defenses to the hypoxemia itself. Studies of patients who received both hyperbaric and normal oxygen treatments have demonstrated that hyperbaric oxygenation does not affect antiandrogenic function, as measured by the levels of the antiandrogens epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist DHT and androgen receptor antagonist androstadienal and androstadienone (20). In addition, hyperbaric oxygenation does not affect the level of antidiuretic hormone, and this effect was not altered by an intravenous infusion of a 5-hydroxytryptophan inhibitor (21) and was not significantly affected by a systemic low-dose dopamine antagonist (22). Hyperbaric oxygenation does not increase urinary citrate excretion but increases urinary nitrogen excretion. In patients who receive hyperbaric oxygenation, changes in blood urea nitrogen were not statistically different in patients who received hyperbaric oxygenation and in those who received normal oxygen therapy (2). However, there was a difference in serum alkaline phosphatase levels in patients who received hyperbaric oxygenation and in those in whom normal oxygen therapy had been applied (23). These findings indicate that hyperbaric oxygenation does not improve the renal function of the patients, but the effect was small and transient. The patients were also monitored for signs of hypovolemia and for symptoms of hypokalemia that include dry mouth, headache, constipation and low body temperature. There were no clinically significant changes in these parameters in the patients receiving hyperbaric oxygenation. In addition, no difference in serum creatinine was observed between groups (24). In patients with persistent fevers, hyperbaric oxygenation is associated with an improvement of hemodynamic balance that, if permanent, may delay resolution of the persistent fevers in some patients (25"
Question: Is the Hawkins sign able to predict necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus? Answer:," No, nor can I make any indication as to when it may happen. If a fracture does occur, a person should be taken to a hospital immediately.

Can you identify the exact place where the injury is occurring?

A: In a normal area, injury is a result of contact between a bone and a hard surface such as a surface within a body cavity. For example, an injury from an impact with one of your legs on a low-hanging limb. In this case, the fracture occurs near a portion of bone in the side of the limb that is hard, such as the femoral artery. The femoral artery is surrounded by a soft tissue, called the subcutaneous abdominal wall, which acts to protect the fractures. The injury happens at the location of the break in the thigh bone and therefore is in the subcutaneous abdominal wall, the area behind your skin. A simple examination of the body shows that the patient has suffered from some type of an extremity trauma such as an injury to your elbow or your knee.

There has been recent discussion about whether a small fracture may be a sign of the degeneration of the vascular system. What impact does this have on your practice?

A: The effects of vascular damage will remain for the remainder of the patient's life. Because our patient did not suffer from any vascular damage, the diagnosis was incorrect. The lack of vascular damage does not rule out vascular damage itself as an effect of the trauma.

Q: There was a lot of controversy about the extent of fractures in the abdomen after the trauma. What is the actual number of fractures? How often do fractures occur? Does a fracture of the thorax happen less frequently than fractures of the abdomen? Answer: All fractures are relatively rare, however, the thorax is considered particularly likely to be affected, and this is the first area that the patient requires attention in a hospital. Thorax fractures do occur; however, they occur at a much lower percentage than abdomen fractures, for a variety of reasons, including the severity of the underlying injury.

A: The general incidence of thorax fractures varies greatly with injury type. It is estimated that only about 1% of all injuries require hospitalization for any underlying artery. This means that approximately 50% of all thorax fractures require hospitalization. Similarly, about 1% of patients with leg fractures require hospitalization, and approximately 1% require the additional level of treatment for femoral artery fracture. The reason that the higher percentage of thorax fractures is necessary is because when you consider any type of body trauma a person is essentially at risk for the same types of injuries again and again. By not admitting patients to the hospital for the injury they sustained, you can help reduce the risk of these injuries occurring.

Your patient was transported to a hospital for treatment but has not yet returned to work or school. Is there any evidence of physical therapy, such as osteopathic exercises, that would be able to reestablish a functional ability to perform normal daily functions?

A: We discuss thisuming the patient is able to return to his or her home, but if not, it is important that the patient undergo therapy as soon as possible. Once the451 injury has been managed, it can be a long period of time before the patient is able to return to regular activity. It is essential that after the injury has been managed, the patient undergoes therapy, regardless of his or her ability to do so. Without proper therapy, a patient will continue to require care as long as it is necessary.

Why are some fractures more aggressive than others?

A: A fracture of the abdominal wall can be more aggressive if it occurs near the tip of the thigh bone, such as in the lower thorax region. Other fractures may occur in the same area as a fractured anastomosis, such as a subcutaneous artery injury. The location of the fracture can determine the extent of the fracture, and the amount of swelling.

Q: A patient with a fractures of either the thorax or abdomen has some pain, swelling, and loss of sensation with minimal bleeding. When will the fracture heal?

A: In some instances, it takes 2 to 5 weeks for the bone to heal completely. However, once the patient feels 100% well and normal activities are resumed, the swelling usually clears within a week to two months. If there is any pain or bleeding, the patient should seek immediate medical attention. Patients requiring emergency surgery should be kept up to date with appropriate care. If the patient should be admitted or have to undergo surgery, a medical nurse should contact a local trauma clinic by telephone, fax, or e-mail within 48 hours. If no medical contact can be made within 48 hours, an urgent call for an emergency surgery is made by the hospital emergency department physician.

Question: Is a mandatory general surgery rotation necessary in the surgical clerkship? Answer:," No. If you would like to learn to be a surgical surgeon you should do what you have to do, but you do not need a general surgery rotation for this.

Student: How often should I have my orthopedic surgeon make me train with a hand model? Answer: Once a week Congruent with your goal to be a hand model.

Student: How will they make me train? Answer: Through teaching.

Student: How often should they schedule surgery? Answer: Weekly to twice daily, 2/3rd day on the other week

Student: I was thinking how can I not pay bills but I don't want to use the hospital card. How can I avoid this if I only have money? Answer: The patient will have to file a request with the billing department to not pay bills with the hospital card. They can be changed without a bill. Also you can request the patient to pay on another card if they do not need their card to use hospital/hospital facilities.

Student: How is it possible to train without a clinic or surgery? Answer: You will be training at your own pace with your own schedule and your own personal training program. It is possible to train on a schedule at your home or you can attend a clinic at the hospital or clinic location. It is possible to train at your own pace at a college or community college. You can also schedule your own seminar on a day that is convenient for you.

Student: I'm a resident assistant on an elective rotator cuff surgery rotation and I'm tired. Will you teach me in-between rotations? Answer: No. You need to learn under the same general surgeon, with your own schedule for each individual rotator cuff surgery rotation.

Student: I am having trouble understanding the language and concepts of manual dexterity training. In the future, should I receive additional training that is specific to this topic and take the course online or will you provide additional programming on-site? Answer: Yes. You will be receiving additional programming and will learn to perform skills you already possess. (Carpal tunnel syndrome).

Student: I am a second year medical student and I just started the rotation. There is a question about how many days I need to work out before surgery? Answer: There is no problem working out more than you normally would before surgery. After surgery you will be allowed to work out more days than you normally would.

Student: There are no surgery rotations today so I'm really concerned about my surgery schedule. What should I do next to minimize surgery interruptions and prevent surgery complications? Answer: Use your body weight to help stabilize your injured limb for surgery and avoid surgery complications. The goal is to minimize any trauma that occurs during surgery as much as possible.

Student: How long can I be at the hospital after surgery? Answer: 6-8 weeks.

Student: I am having a problem finding a qualified surgeon. Someone recommended me to you, does this mean I'll be meeting a different surgeon at the same hospital? Answer: No you will be meeting a different surgeon at a different hospital. A general surgical rotation should not change your personal/professional schedule in any way. If you don't meet the other surgeon I will be forced to wait a few weeks to try and find a new surgeon. You will be placed with the physician of your surgery to find another rotator cuff surgeon.

Student: I am a fifth year medical student. As syndromic, as well as functional, my arm has stopped functioning without pain. I am currently waiting for a bone graft to be placed in order to replace my arm. This is a surgery with the use of a hand model. Is there a plan available for me to change to another type of hand after surgery? Answer: No. You will see the hand model during postop recovery for a month and you will eventually have to take part in a hand model routine to stay in shape during the postop healing process.

Student: Can I do my rotation without being on the rotator cuff rotation? Answer: No, you must be either on the rotator cuff rotator cuff or upper extremity rotation rotation.

Student: I am a first year surgical student and I have had a bad experience at the hospital. The rotation was a little too aggressive and the hospital staff didn't seem to have any real concerns about how we treated those patients. They let us treat some patients without a patient's consent and instead just asked for their names. Do I require a certain level of care, are you responsible for what happens when we do this? Answer: We can and we are, but you and your hospital will have to make it up later.

Student: Do we work on the left side or right (upper or lower) hand, or both sides at the same time? What are the benefits? Answer: You should"
Question: Is Acupuncture Efficacious for Treating Phonotraumatic Vocal Pathologies? Answer:," Acupuncture in the treatment of phonotricia is the most recent research finding that was initially published in the literature in 1997. The study was conducted by Dr. Michael D. McQueen, M.D. in Toronto, Ontario [1]. The study was funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. In this study, there were 14 patients with an array of different maladaptive vocal behaviors and an additional 10 patients that had no of the voice maladaptive characteristics. All patients were treated with acupuncture with either of the 2 standard approaches, and patients had the choice between an acupuncture group and a therapy group. After the intervention, all patients were told it was placebo, and the efficacy of their treatment group was observed by a blinded observer. The study was conducted at the Clinical Research Centre in the University of Toronto, and the clinical protocol was approved by the University's Institutional Review Board. After the study was conducted, it was found that it was safe for the patients to use either therapy to treat their maladaptive voices, and that the acupuncture was effective in treating the maladaptive voices. Patients were treated for up to 4 years with the use of different acupuncture modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of maladaptive voice behaviors. The results of the study are published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE [1]. In this study, it was reported that there is little, if any, difference on any of the voice maladaptive characteristics with or without the use of acupuncture. However, the use of acupuncture is linked to the use of certain specific types of local acupuncture points. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that patients with maladaptive vocal behaviors get acupuncture as soon to the symptoms as possible to alleviate the voice maladaptive behaviors.

Is Acupuncture Efficacious for Treating Chronic Neck Pain? Answer: No long term controlled study has been done with the use of Acupuncture for Chronic Neck Pain. However, a review from the U.S. medical journal, N. Engl. J. Med. 2004[3], compared acupuncture with medical devices such as spinal needles and a ""womb pill"" that can also customization the effects of these devices. It also compared acupuncture with medical devices using an eye contact technique such as massage to examine the efficacy of acupuncture [4]. The review found that these studies found that the use of acupuncture can be effective for the management of chronic neck pain. This review also provides an indication that acupuncture is not just for treating pain, but is also an effective treatment for both psychological and health conditions at the same time [4]. The conclusions of this review were similar to those of the medical journal review [3]. However, it is important to note that while this review provided some indication of the use of acupuncture in the management of chronic neck pain, it did not establish a taxed version of the use of acupuncture. In other words, this evaluation examined the effectiveness of acupuncture for treatment of pain, not the effects of acupuncture.

Where and How Should I Get Acupuncture? Answer: You can get Acupuncture either by your doctor or from a natural health practitioner. Many doctors have Acupuncture programs to learn how to help your health-related pain issues. If you are a natural health practitioner, you may have acupuncture at your practice or even have it available in your office.

Is Acupuncture Effective for Pain Relief? Answer: It is not clear how or if Acupuncture can be effective for reducing pain. However, Acupuncture has been studied in clinical trials on numerous pain management strategies [5]. More recently, studies have been conducted to determine whether Acupuncture or Mindfulness Meditation can be effective in reducing pain. In each study, Acupuncture or simpler meditation techniques were found to be equally effective as either Mindfulness Meditation techniques or acupuncture. In one study from Canada, compared with people feeling pain after a stroke, people who had a ""mixed effect"" of using Acupuncture or Mindfulness Meditation showed less pain when compared to persons at ""higher pain threshold"" who were receiving traditional acupressure techniques [6]. In a second study, Acupuncture or Mindful Meditation was found to be as effective as an epidural injection in reducing pain and functional impairment after severe upper back pain [17]. Finally, a recent study was conducted comparing the effects of Acupuncture with Mindfulness Meditation and also compared these with acupuncture alone on chronic pain with a control group that had not been treated with any pain management technique. The study concluded that Acupuncture or Mindfulness Meditation in combination with acupuncture alone reduced the amount of chronic pain experienced in the study group compared to acupuncture alone [17]."
Question: Is aneurysm repair justified for the patients aged 80 or older after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage? Answer:," This is more about the age of the patient. It is not specifically about the time after which the doctor must remove the aneurysm. There are many different factors that can influence the procedure. The patient may have a strong desire to do it, there may be a lack of anesthesia, etc. An aneurysm is an aggressive tumor that tends to grow in size. Therefore, it is important to do the surgery when it is safe for your patient. It is better not to perform the aneurysm surgery before the patient is old enough to handle aneurysm surgery safely.

Q: My aneurysm fell out. How can I keep the aneurysm in the same place as it was in case it grows and grows? Answer: If you want to hold onto your aneurysm, you can insert the drain as a tight bandage, but as long as you leave a little bit of space, it will probably stay there and grow back. If you want to remove the aneurysm, it is best to do it the old-fashioned way. The best way is to do an enema and use the left over fluid to remove the aneurysm.

Question: Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care? Answer:," Yes. The effectiveness of IT in primary care in terms of reducing the number of out of hospital procedures may depend on the general practice characteristics in a practice. For example, the ability to access data, the ability to communicate, and the ability to meet the needs of patients may be different in practices where large numbers of patients are accessing IT compared with practices which do not have these characteristics. Information Technology Assessment (ITA) measures the ability to access data, communicate, and meet the needs of patients in primary care practices in England. The ITA tool used to assess this factor in NHS Primary Care in England [48] provided the results of our paper, where the most striking trends could be seen regarding the uptake of IT in primary care. For example, the rate of access to data in practices with IT was lower than that in practices with no IT, but these differences were not statistically significant. A related finding was the rate of access to communication, or the ability to meet the needs of patients in practices with greater exposure to technology compared with those with no exposure. The most striking of such trends is that the uptake of in the practice is lower when there are fewer patients who have access to technology compared with when more patients have access.

Conclusions: The current data show a gap in the uptake of IT in primary care practices. Given the number of patients accessing such technology during hospital care is likely to be a very significant health issue with many additional healthcare cost demands. Key recommendations for improving this are to: Implement a consistent assessment of the quality of patient care across a practice to increase uptake of IT.

Make computerised health record systems available for users so that all staff have access to it.

Encourage a balanced approach between a culture of providing high quality and efficient services across the health system to maximise the potential benefits of an IT system.

Question: Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma--is well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer? Answer:," There is some evidence that the outcome is very variable among well differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HgCCs)--many patients have a fairly benign tumor before the presence of tumor. Clinical prognosis is very good. It should be noted that it is difficult to define the ""good"" tumor since it is very sensitive to radiotherapy. At the present time, there is not much good data to help define the ""good"" outcome. There is some evidence that HgCCs, when transplanted into children with severe early-stage renal cell carcinomas, may provide a good prognosis as well as other transplantation procedures, including hepatic transplantation (see Kidney Relapse). Patients with very low levels of Hg have the advantage in that there is some research suggesting that levels up to 50 mg/L may be a good predictor of outcome. The risk of death is high with certain types of HgCCs (<8.4 ng/mL) and with very early stage HgCCs where the clinical prognosis may be poor or there is no clinical improvement with treatment.

Answer: There is no specific definition for patients who have a ""good tumor"" and have a favorable prognosis. In general, patients with a metastatic HgCC that is not yet clinically advanced are most likely to be referred for liver transplantation. Some examples include: patients with HgCC that is not stage I or stage III, patients with HgCC that is stage II or IV, and patients with HgCC that is stage V or VI.

Dr. Yaffe provided more information on the diagnostic criteria for identifying HgCCs

Determination of Clinical Stage at Diagnostic Tasks

It is important to understand the criteria used by most experts in the field to determine whether or not a patient is clinically advanced or malignant (stage III). This is an important point to note regarding the use of clinical stage as a prognostic factor. It is important to note that it is impossible to separate the two with absolute certainty, because there is no such thing as a ""stage"", only the progression or progression of the disease from malignant to clinically advanced. Therefore, one must consider multiple factors to try to determine if a given patient is clinically advanced or malignant. It is important to note that any tumor that progresses into cancer is usually already stage III and will not become stage III-IV on its own.

As Dr. Yaffe noted, several things have been known to improve prognosis, but they do not make a good prognostic factor. Among these factors:

Tumor volume - A tumor that has been surgically removed, but there is a tumor that continues to grow, is not expected to metastasize into another tissue. This is true for all of the types of small cells in the cell.

Tumor structure - A tumor that is only growing to the extent of having little or no internal structure is not expected to grow, will cocktails and other chemotherapy and radiation therapy not be effective, and will have to be surgically removed and then reattempted. For example, a relatively small tumor with no internal structure, such as the type of liver cancer that can be detected by CT or MRI, might be an early stage liver cancer. Since the surgery cannot remove all of the internal structure of the tumor, there still must be at least 1 or more tumor changes that indicate the existence of cancer--for example, the loss of a certain segment of an outer segment of a tumor, as in the first example, or the loss of part of the metastatic growth.

Tumor type - A large tumor that only grows to be 6 to 12 cm has been referred to as a mini-translatoroma, as it might be difficult to reach for surgery so long the tumor was in a normal state for surgery. (As seen in the other examples, as the tumor continues to grow, the initial small tissue mass might be cut away from the growing, but still growing, tumor). The mini translatoroma is a good example of a patient that would be given chemotherapy, and perhaps radiotherapy after surgery so the patient could remain for further assessment, but who might not want to follow that course.

Stage III or II diagnosis - It is important to remember that any type of early stage organ, from the tailbone (patellar tendon) to the prostate gland to the pancreas, can be considered an organ with significant disease in itself. While the stage of the organ or body part can be considered prognostic of its fate, it is not always. As a general general rule, it is believed that organs and organ systems are not considered to be of early stage unless they are seriously compromised and will have to be removed (in the case of the abdomen, the pectoralis major or other large"
Question: Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence? Answer:," The present study evaluated the effect of follow-up recommendations for Papanicolaou smears on patient adherence. Papanicolaou smears in children 12 to 15 years of age should be discontinued after 12 months of follow up in a prospective design. Papanicolaou smears should not be followed by repeated Papanicolaou smears as these procedures might cause multiple complications. This recommendation is based on the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Infectious Diseases (1992) in the guidelines for the administration of Papanicolaou smears in children12. If recommended by the Joint Committee, the use of a second Papanicolaou smear from a different source should be continued until there are no further problems as there might be a repeat infection during the initial one. This policy is not based on the results of a prospective comparative study, particularly in a setting that was not adequately supervised and with a patient population who was uneducated. The results of the present study can be extrapolated to other age groups. However, in fact there was no difference between age groups.

The study was performed in a small sample and the magnitude of that variation was not high. Nevertheless we know little of the actual prevalence of infection in different age groups. In other cases the prevalence of infection in the age group in question will depend on the results of a prospective study; for example, in a case series involving 3,000 infants with different age groups with different prevalences of infections, the prevalence of infection in one group may be higher than in the other. In addition, the prevalence of infection in a population may differ in relation to the incidence of infection at study entry and in subsequent years. Also, in the present study in this case series, the infection was more frequently reported in infants with a history of primary infection. However, this might be a reflection of a combination of factors including better diagnosis and use of specific antimicrobial agents in hospital-acquired infections, as well as less frequent complications from pneumonia and other serious infections. Finally, this study was performed in a high-risk environment and may not apply for other populations in which infection rates are lower. Therefore, this recommendation should be used with caution. In general, it is better to use a preventive therapy for primary infection rather than multiple therapies for acute or complex infections.

In addition, the Papanicolaou smears and the routine evaluation are two different interventions. One should be carried out by the health personnel responsible for both screening and evaluating the patients. The other should take place on an outpatient basis by the health professionals. The latter could use a more comprehensive screening that includes blood tests, serology, and a complete review of recent clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory results. The use of a screening or evaluation regimen is also relevant for both clinical prevention and acute immunocompromise. It is also appropriate to use both screening and/or evaluation procedures in the same community, if the screening/evaluation is carried out consistently and on an outpatient basis. Both are important. Therefore, both routine screening and/or routine evaluation should be carried out on a daily basis at the time of clinical manifestations. This will decrease the possibility of recurrence of the infection that causes the disease and/or prolong its period of illness, so that it is better to use the preventive therapy.

One could argue that the Papanicolaou smear is a diagnostic test for other infectious diseases more appropriately used for pediatric infections as they can be detected only after an acute infection. However, the Papanicolaou smear is a common, relatively inexpensive, and easily administered procedure (it costs approximately US$4 per examination), and it is usually available in health care centers, outpatient facilities, and hospitals. One can therefore argue that the benefits of the Papanicolaou smear for the prevention of severe disease outweigh the potential danger for its unnecessary use. The benefits could be that the incidence of infections is lower and fewer complications occur. These are both reasonable reasons to prefer the use of a less invasive diagnostic test for pediatric infections as compared to an invasive test.

A similar but different policy for routine or intermittent screening and reevaluation for secondary or persistent infection is made by the guidelines in the International Association for Pediatric Infectious Disease.11 It involves a minimum follow-up period of 12 months and the continuous, comprehensive evaluation of all patients whose condition becomes seriously worrisome during this time. If symptoms or changes in clinical activity become very concerning, the parents can be asked to provide a medical history and/or provide a medical examination. During this routine care, screening is recommended for all patients, usually in the first 18 months of life, who are at the highest risk for infection.

However, in the present study only the Papanicolaou smear was considered preventive for children. The recommendation of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (1989) for routine evaluation of all infants for chronic"
Question: Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring? Answer:," Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen can be used for a variety of monitoring purposes, including identification of other airborne and oral components of food products that are allergic to pollen, food or drugs. This practice is discussed in detail elsewhere (Sakuma et al., 2002b).

The use of micro-organisms to assist in the identification of allergenic pollen was pioneered in the 1960s. As a laboratory tool, micro-organisms are inexpensive to obtain, which enables quick and convenient analysis of pollen grains and pollen stalks (e.g., Rader, 1990). In addition, micro-organisms that live in the insect or plant environment are more familiar to many people than those rise from the soil or air. For this reason, micro-organisms represent an attractive and convenient tool in pollen analysis. In the 1960s, it was found, through the use of airborne air and soil micro-organisms, that large amounts of pollen could be produced on a per capita basis in areas that were susceptible to allergic reactions from foods.

Micro-organisms also are commonly available in plants. Insects, like humans, are susceptible to allergenic molecules (e.g., food allergens like wheat, milk, eggs and soy products). To analyze them in pollen, use a suitable method. Most micro-organisms, however, can be used to generate small amounts of allergen on a large scale. Therefore, pollen analysis can also be done on crops to determine when allergen concentrations in the crop are highest (Sakuma et al., 2002b).

It is important to understand that this method is not a method for identifying any specific allergen. However, it can be used to provide information for more accurate and routine monitoring of food and pesticide exposure. Micro-organisms of any kind or species are important to the proper functioning of the ecosystem. Thus, the use of pollen analyses is especially relevant in ecosystems that are home to complex food webs; for example, plants that are grown in forests, grasslands, or alpine grasslands (Sakuma et al., 2002b). Although the use of pollen as a measure of food safety is quite recent, many of the procedures developed by scientists and farmers apply to similar situations when analyzing pollen samples in farm fields as well.

The effectiveness of individual micro-organisms as an aid in pollen identification can also be evaluated in a quantitative method that is inexpensive to obtain (Sakuma et al., 2003). This is accomplished using a method called differential susceptibility score (DSS). An algorithm is developed for counting differences in the levels of each micro-organism over time (Sakuma et al., 2003b). This approach is used in the United States to help make field evaluations of the pollen-related health risks of agricultural production (Sakuma et al., 2003b). The idea stems from the realization that pollen analyses are an imperfect measure of disease risk (Sakuma et al., 2002b), and may contribute to some error-prone measurement of exposure to pesticides. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate and identify from the process the impurity that causes the discrepancy in DSS. In addition, for such calculations, the accuracy of the number of pollen grains that can be obtained on a given area varies and is therefore subject to a wide range of uncertainty. A second way of counting different micro-organisms is to use a mathematical model that takes into account the number of generations, the rate of mutation and the environmental conditions (Sakuma et al., 2003b). Both approaches provide estimates of the number of allergen organisms and their levels and are considered reliable for predicting exposure levels of different micro-organisms in farm environments.

While the development of a method that can be used in conjunction with a quantitative assay is a great step forward, there are still limitations. One major limitation is the difficulty in determining the presence and/or level of allergen in pollen samples in relation to exposure to the allergen. For this reason, only few studies have been carried out to estimate the sensitivity of DSS models to the contamination of samples (Kane and Reimers, 1980; Reimers and Kane, 1983; Kane and Sargent, 1984; Kane and Sargent, 1990; Kane and Kramble, 1990; Reimers and Sargent, 1993; Reimers and Ochoa, 1994; Steiner et al., 1995; Steiner et al., 2000). In addition, the use of these mathematical models to estimate pesticide exposures has not been validated (Sakuma et al., 2002b). The only published studies to date have examined whether or not the level of the allergen detected in the pollen grains is similar in magnitude to that in the ingested and unadulterated forms. In both these cases, the level of the allergen was higher in the pollen than in the ingested and un"
Question: Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer? Answer:," A recent study showed that while the FDG-PET can be given before or after surgery to identify cancerous adenomatous polyps, it may not be better Reed et al., 2004 Reed H.

Couto G.

Levin F. Paternal age and risk of pancreatic cancer in men: a prospective study using a retrospective cohort registry. JAMA. 324 : 1452-1458 As the researchers note, the use of FDG-PET is not recommended for preoperative purposes since PET is ""not recommended for cervical cancer screening at this time given the limited utility of the imaging modality and the potential for misleading effect. The use of PET for the diagnosis of carcinoma of adenomatous polyps is not recommended either"" (and therefore the use of PET can be discontinued prior to surgery if the patient is not in good health and therefore does no good to the patient). Nevertheless, the authors state ""We believe that the use of PET for diagnostic purposes as early as the imaging modality makes a significant contribution to detect and manage these cancers"" (and FDG-PET is indeed effective at detecting certain cancers of the cervix during follow-up in the clinical trials). They continue ""We believe that the present study provides evidence that PET is important, possibly indispensable to the screening of cancer of the cervix. It is not, however, a sufficient factor in the evaluation of the relative effectiveness of diagnostic tests."" They also state that ""PET-induced changes in the cytology of the cervix and its implications for its detection with CT are more difficult to separate from other potential factors that may impact the accuracy of the diagnosis of primary, recurrent, and very early-onset carcinomas and also its detection with other imaging modalities.

""With respect to the use of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer, it can be stated that it has already been tested during the preoperative phase of a large study in which it was utilized as a screening assay, and its usage, even for a few weeks, was able to detect high percentage incidence of cervical cancer cases. This means that the PET can be used for the confirmation of an intraoperative diagnosis, and with sufficient number of cervical intrauterine adenomas and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia it cannot be ruled out as a surrogate for the diagnosis of primary intrauterine carcinoma. Unfortunately, the use of PET for screening purposes in the evaluation of cervical cancer must be regulated according to the current available evidence on the efficacy and safety, as well as its interpretation, of the imaging modality in this regard. Since the imaging parameters used in this study are considered safe and suitable to use for this reason, then the decision is a matter of conscience and the use of PET/FDG-PET in the evaluation of cervical cancer cannot be regarded as an alternative to conventional cytology and the more general examination in the routine evaluation of the cervix,"" in other words the FDG-PET should be retained for diagnosis and the use should be suspended following completion of surgery and/or until the use of other techniques is considered appropriate and the results are evaluated. We thank the members of the research team at the RIKEN Center for Developmental Cell Biology and Neurobiology for their expertise and technical assistance.

Treatment: The researchers also discuss the use of PET in order to detect cervical cancer because they report that it is particularly useful in the evaluation of the evaluation of an interferon-resistant acute myeloid leukemia. However, it is not considered useful for determining the status of the cancer in patients who have developed a resistant form of this disease. It is also not beneficial to the use of PET for the evaluation of a specific interferon-resistance in pregnant women, since the use of PET for this purpose is not recommended.

The investigators present data from a pilot study conducted among Japanese women who had developed interferon-resistant acute lymphoproliferative disorder due to HER2 positive or negative mutations [9] (including those who, however, had not received any interferon treatment or if they had not had an interferon immunotherapy trial with a HER2 positive mutation) [8]. They describe the evaluation on PET of 740 of the patients (79% of the patients were women), all of whom were aged 65 yearsmunoreactive with metastases of HER2 positive or negative, but who had not received any treatment for the previous 4 months. PET-enhanced CT was administered to all patients, including the 12 patients who had received an intrauterine device on the same day as PET scanning. In contrast to other studies, PET-enhanced CT was not performed in the preoperative screening studies. The authors suggest that the difference in the number of tumor biopsies taken"
Question: Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis? Answer:," The differences between the types of keratoplasty are well known. This article reviews these differences and discusses the pros and cons of each type of keratocele.

In an earlier article, Dr. Krasnov discussed the keratocele characteristics. The authors of the latter article suggested that it was important during surgical follow-up to evaluate all keratophillic procedures to ensure that the patients were not being inappropriately treated and that the surgery was being performed for its healing or medical effect rather than the cosmetic effects. The authors recommended that corneal surface ablation after excimer laser keratophilic surgery be deferred at least until the following year for the smudged appearance, although no clinical studies were able to confirm this recommendation.

According to the present study, most corneal layers developed at the same time (or soon afterwards) following excimer laser keratophilic surgery. In fact, more than 80% of the corneal layer was found within 3 months post-surgery in both advanced and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis types.

The authors of the article conclude that keratoplasty in excimer laser keratophilic surgery has a favorable pattern of healing after excimer laser keratoplasty. The appearance of the corneal layer at the end of the surgical follow-up after excimer laser keratophilic surgery can be delayed by many months compared with that of early advanced keratoplasty. However, keratoplasty after excimer laser keratophilic surgery has a favorable healing outcome compared with subsequent advanced stage keratoplasty, even when it is performed by experienced doctors. Moreover, both types of corneal transplantation are recommended in a general surgical context by the authors of this article, despite the fact that there are very few patients who experience the favorable outcomes of these two different treatments (Table C).

Table C. Treatment Study Methodological Parameters of the Patients After Excision The authors of the present report suggest that the primary focus of the study should be patient perception of the treatment outcome. This study could assess patient's experience with different types of excimer laser keratophils, their impact on surgical outcome and their response to follow-up. Patients should be allowed 24 to 48 weeks follow-up in order to determine on the best time in the clinical treatment of corneal surface ablation following excimer laser keratophilic surgery. The authors of the present study also suggested that the follow-up period of the patients after excimer laser keratophilic surgery should be longer compared with that of sub-Bowman's keratomileusis keratomileusis. It might be useful for the surgeon to take patients' opinion after 12 weeks and more to assess the effects of the treatment and possible risks and complications. This could also affect the patient's outcome in the future. If it was not possible to improve the patient's perception of the treatment outcome and their treatment outcome after excimer laser keratophilic surgery, the authors could consider limiting the follow-up time in order to avoid the adverse consequences of the treatment on the patients.

The authors of the article suggest that other clinical criteria need to be established to guide future corneal surface and keratoblast transplants. It might be useful to evaluate the patient's overall clinical experience. The authors of the present article suggest that the patient's experience with different types of excimer laser keratophillic surgery should be evaluated prior to the corneal transplantation. It might be reasonable to establish more frequent follow-up at least 6 months after the transplantation to determine the patients' level of satisfaction. It might be useful to discuss patients' opinion for the evaluation of the treatment duration of keratoblast transplantation (up to 10 years) and to examine the possible potential for recurrence of an underlying corneal layer within 12 months afterward as compared with the initial treatment.

With regard to the authors' recommendation regarding waiting for at least 3 months after excimer laser keratophilic surgery after excimer laser keratophilic surgery, the patient's experience should also be defined in terms of patient feedback and the general prognosis after the sub-Bowman's keratomileusis keratomileusis surgery. After 4 times of excimer laser keratophilic surgery, the patient's response to post-operative treatment and to follow-up should be assessed. They could also initiate follow-up after 5 to 6 years post-surgery and make an initial treatment decision after 10 years. Because of the patient's experience with the procedures, patient expectations in regards to the treatment of the cornea following excimer laser keratophilic surgery and the general prognosis after these procedures might"
Question: Does radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer affect prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer? Answer:," Yes. Radiation is an emerging therapy for the treatment of the primary rectal cancer and most of the radiotherapy is associated with a pioneered strategy to stop the cancer cells while it is spreading out of the rectum. During radiation the cancer cells are killed while the tumor cells are released from the colorectum and the colorectum is removed, leaving a scar which can be seen with the naked eye. Although they can sometimes cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting, it is an encouraging indication that these treatments can be effective. Answer: Yes. Radiation for pelvic cancer can affect the remaining cancer in the colon. This is a survival advantage over radiotherapy for rectal cancer and for other cancer, because it can stop the tumor cells from spreading out of the rectum, leaving a scar which can be seen without the need for a needle with radiation, or by inserting a special lens (papillomavitamin lens) during procedure. Answer: Yes. Many women do not have radiation or it does not have results. The results in general are usually good. If radiation is used, it is a great thing. They are now recommending it, for this reason. Question: Does any radiotherapy for pelvis cancer affect the outcome after primary rectal exenteration? Answer: Yes. Radiation for the primary rectal cancer can affect these malignancies. However, because it is not cancer and the cancer cells are not killed by the radiation treatment, the risks are also somewhat reduced. A primary rectal cancer that was metastatic will most likely have to be surgically removed. Question: Does radiation for pelvic cancer cause any cancer recurrence after removal of the tumor (primary rectal exenteration)? Answer: Yes. Radiation is dangerous for any cancer. It is associated with a higher risk of recurrence of cancer-related lymphomas. Answer: You are correct and radiation does cause cancer recurrence for nonmetastatic cancers. This is true for cervical and ovarian cancers, for anal cancer and possibly for anal cancer and vulvar cancer. Question: Does radiation (in the form of radiation therapy) increase the chance of developing a cancer and then dying from the disease? Answer: Yes. Question: Is mammograms and CT scanning a form of physical therapy for breast cancer or is it just a cost effective device, as all women believe it to be? Answer: Is mammograms and CT scanning a form of physical therapy for breast cancer and is it a cost effective device, as all women believe? First, it is extremely important to talk to your doctor. I have seen women who have said that mammograms and CT scans were a form of physical therapy, which I would not support since it is not a true form of therapy, since it does not include any medical therapy and it should not necessarily be used in that context. It is a form of ""pimple care"". The American Cancer Society says not to use physical therapy when there is no alternative. I hope this helps answer your question.

This is my last year of medical school. I am still communication with my parents on the phone, but I have already decided to withdraw from graduate school. Why the final decision to withdraw from medical school? Answer: Because I have not been able to stay strong in my commitment and discipline toward the goals of medical school. I have not had any academic successes, nor have I been able to achieve the academic goals of other patients, nor have I been able to retain good relationships to the hospital staff and physicians surrounding patients. I have not been able to do much with my remaining time on my parents' health plan because I have not received my paychecks for the past year and a half. I am in denial about my situation because now that I am able to speak up it gets worse every minute. How do I keep myself from putting my parents through the pain of this situation? Answer: I had a few very good friends in medical school who were willing to help me in any way. I'm willing to help my parents as much as I can with my time away. It needs to be done with a lot of pressure from the faculty and medical center. At the University of Colorado School of Medicine, I will not be able to receive enough academic credit, if allowed by my department. I will have to enroll in an alternative program, which I will not be able to pay for during my time off, without being able to count on financial aid from it and with a lack of recognition in my department! This is the hardest thing to bear with all of this. I know it is not my parents, but they are so poor, it's hard to understand their despair regarding my absence from the next phase of their lives. My parents did not have much money and if they can't afford to see me at the end of the month, I feel bad because I want to make sure my parents are able to send me a good gift.

I have been diagnosed with lymphedema as a result of a bone marrow transplant. It also had been a difficult decision to have lymphedema. However, I felt that it was best to try and get rid of it as much as possible. For a month, I worked as a nurse technician to supplement my income. As time passed, however, I began to see the progression of my condition more often and this made me feel a little guilty. It was a feeling that I could manage and that it was OK. But once a month the doctors told me that I had lymphedema. I was devastated. I thought I should consider delaying, or quitting, my job and moving into a nursing home to stop the bleeding. I was also considering making that decision because I was having trouble getting the pain medication that I needed on a regular basis and I was worried that if I did not take it before any swelling developed, it might create enough swelling and damage the existing tissue to cause damage to a future surgery. In the end, I decided to do it because I knew I would be able to continue on anyway because I would receive the paychecks that I was working without and could supplement the income without having to worry about any financial hardship or future issues. Since then, the bleeding in my shoulder is improving faster than ever before and the pain subsides. I no longer fear that I will be leaving the hospital. It is a blessing in disguise and I hope to carry that blessing with me into the future. A little more time will not do any good if no treatment is available. I do not have many options now either. I have no way"
Question: Colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases: does global management at the same centre improve results? Answer:,"

The objective of this study is to compare global management of colorectal cancer with global management only in three centers. We conducted a multicenter data abstraction, multicentre cohort study. The objectives were to compare global surgical management and global chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the presence of colorectal cancer (CRC) and metastases of both solid and metastatic colon and rectum (SR) combined. Methods were developed in a retrospective, observational cohort study. Colorectal cancer was selected as the primary tumour according to the Surveillance Program for Common Tumours, 1990 (SPOCAT). Colorectal cancer resections and radiotherapy had to be included in the overall analysis. Global surgical management for CRC was calculated for patients undergoing colorectal surgery (surgical management only or global management only, the proportion of surgery performed in global management only and in conventional non-global management, the proportion of surgery performed in conventional non-global management and in global surgical management), excluding those who underwent radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, or surgery with any other surgical option. All tumours in the general population were included. Results are presented for 1,926 CRC surgery cases from the British Colorectal Adjunct Society (BCAS) database. A pooled median survival of 19.1 months was attained for the global strategies (95% confidence interval [CI} 19.1–20.5 months) compared with the global management plus radiotherapy, the proportion of surgery performed in standard (i.e. normal) treatment and in standard non-global management, respectively (Figure 1A). Non-global strategies, including systemic chemotherapy and the use of regional treatment, were associated with lower mortality (19.6% vs. 21.2%; mean difference [MD] 7.7 [95% CI 6.5–8.4]; p<0.001). The total number of CRC surgery cases was 6,959. Survival was 20.5 months for the global strategies (SD 15.5 months) and 29.5 months for the global managerial strategy (SD 17.1 months). There was no difference in survival between the global strategies and global management plus radiotherapy. The findings of a pooled analysis suggest that colon and rectal cancer in the general population appears to be under-treated when the focus is on global management alone."
Question: Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality? Answer:," Yes, motion perception abnormality is the consequence. However, the origin for the deficit is thought to be complex since the patients' movement patterns, their visual experience, and their perception of time tend to be different, whereas their visual experience is not. Regarding the causes of the deficit, several theories have been considered, and in line with neurophysiological investigations it is suggested that a neuroadaptation mechanism is involved that can cause the dysfunction in some instances. The most common theory indicates this to be the consequence of the ""visions of the future"" (VFTs). The VFTs are a series of visual experiences that accompany each sensory input; each VFT consists of 3D pictures from a subject's internal world with different spatial and temporal properties (see Dement, 1990, pp. 826-832; Démare, 2000). The VFTs are highly effective for encoding and encoding new information and are activated during learning, memory, and mental state switching (Chaikin &prChalmers, 1986; Chaikin, 1984; Chalmers & Chaikin, 1985; Chaikin, 1989). The vfx are also believed to mediate movement-related sensations of self and objects, and, in the elderly, it has been suggested that the VFT might cause the patients to adopt a paralysed sense of space and distance. Since it is usually not possible to distinguish changes in the vfx from changes in the vw of the subject, which are not related to a sense of space and a sense of distance, the VFTs are described as ""hyper-acute"" and can, therefore, result in hyper-motion. As the hyper-acute VFTs are related to changes in spatial and temporal properties, they are thought to be the source of several different clinical and neurophysiological deficits. Hyper-acute VFTs are commonly described as ""paralysis of perception"", although they can, in fact, be a consequence of other alterations in function of the primary visual system (Chaikin &prChalmers, 1986; Chaikin, 1984; Chaikin, 1993). Hyper-acute VFTs are also observed in schizophrenia (Chalmers & Chaikin, 1985), although, in schizophrenia, the hypocotanic mechanism is also a consequence, which occurs in a significant percentage of patients. However, it does not correspond to alterations in the vfx. Therefore, it is more plausible to consider the hyper-acute VFTs to be the consequence of the hyper-motion associated to patients suffering from visual experience due to their hyper-acute motion perception abnormalities. Hyper-acute VFTs are not correlated with changes in the vww. Since hyper-acute VFTs occur in individuals with a high degree of visual experience, it is expected that they would affect a significant increase in hyper-motion from patients with poor eye-tracking (Chalmers &prChalmers, 1986; Chaikin, 1984). Indeed, some patients with high hyper-acute VFTs have a more severe hyper-motion syndrome (see Coughlan et al., 1999).

Question: Hypokalaemia is associated with hyper-motion in schizophrenic patients (Chalmers &prChalmers, 1986)? Answer: According to a hypothesis proposed by Chaikin and Prachanda (2000), abnormal movement of the head is a result of a hyper-acute VFT in certain patients. Hypokalaemia is, however, not a direct consequence of hyper-motion due to hyper-acute VFTs, but instead a symptom of hyper-motion due to paralysed visual system. Furthermore, the hyper-acute VFTs have been associated with abnormal motor function. Furthermore, atypical motor behaviour in schizophrenic patients, such as head rolling, can be considered as a ""misperception"" of the visual system. The hyper-acute VFS is also associated with abnormalities in brainstem dysfunction, as demonstrated by the increase in the functional blood flow to the brainstem in hypokalaemic patients (Chalmers & Chaikin, 1986; Chaikin, 1993). This phenomenon was identified by Chalevala et al. (1983) as a subcortical dysfunction related to reduced activation of parietal-based attention in hypokalaemic patients. children with hypokalaemia, who suffer from hyper-motion, are more likely to develop seizures, which are thought to be the result of abnormal activity in the hyper-acute VFS caused by the abnormal functional flow from the ventricular system (Kuhn, 1977).

Question: Paralysed and/or hyper-acute VFS in schizophrenia is also seen in anorexia nervosa? Answer: According to an alternative hypothesis proposed in a review by Schiebe et al. (1992"
Question: Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy: is it possible? Answer:," Trans-venous splenectomy is performed (surgically) in children, adolescents, and adults (children less than 2–3 years of age). Although it is performed in many countries, there are several reasons why it is not considered as the standard procedure (see below). 1) It is difficult to perform the surgical procedure. In fact, it is the most common reason why a technique has not been accepted (see below). 2) The endoscopic technique is not used (usually done with a catheter) in the hospital and the procedure is complicated, potentially dangerous and dangerous to a healthy child. When done wrong, this procedure will cause infections, liver damage and blood problems for the infected child (see below). In many cases, this situation is life-threatening. 3) The cost can be a lot. In a very few countries, this procedure is done without the need for a hospital admission while in a few others, such as Russia, it depends on the hospital. Sometimes, for instance, a hospital can do this procedure for no more than $20. This procedure is also not considered as a standard procedure in certain countries. 4) Some countries consider this inadvisable because of the many problems that it causes. This is something you should always check. 5) Most children are healthy and not usually in pain when they receive the procedure. But, even with pain medication, many children may require a short stay at the paediatric hospital because of prolonged bleeding that is so severe they are discharged. The blood in the lungs that is discharged for this procedure must be screened and this in turn needs another doctor's opinion before that blood is released. 6) Few countries do this procedure on children under 2 years old. 6a) In Canada, this surgery is carried out under anaesthesia (including intubation). However, the procedure is very uncomfortable. This is true in Canada as it is in many other countries. It requires anesthesia (often in combination with general anaesthesia). In Canada, this must be performed within 24 hours. However, some countries do not have the necessary procedures. If you are in doubt – please ask your child's doctor (there are several doctors who can evaluate your child's pain and whether it is pain medication for you or not)

Trans-Venous Splenectomy When You Will Need the Surgery:

The procedure involves removing a small piece of skin from the inside of the stomach (the esophagus). The stomach may appear to be open when this is not the case, but there is a lot of tissue inside the stomach that is not visible. The surgeon cuts open the stomach to make way for the surgery to go in.

Note: To avoid any long hospital stay, you should wait between 72 and 90 hours between the surgery and the hospital admission. If you take a lot of medication to manage pain, you may need to be discharged from the hospital within this time.

The following is a short list of all the things you can do after the surgical procedure.

During the Asgard procedure

In most countries, the surgery is completed within a few hours (typically less than 24 hours). However, in some countries you may want to see an attending physician right away, just to make sure everything is alright or interviewer will want to see that you are okay. If you are feeling better, you can go home right away, since it is most likely the last time you will receive the drug therapy. A few countries, such as Czech, Hungary, Italy, and Romania, have a longer waiting time (typically up to 48 hours) and many will want you to stay for a further 48 hours as well.

During the Asgard procedure, a blood test is performed to check if you are still on the medication. The blood test should not be done in case you suddenly relapse. While you are resting (no pain medication or feeding), it is good to ask your doctor what you can do next. If there is no improvement for at least 48 hours, you may consider going home.

During the Asgard procedure, you may feel pain for 4–6 hours, followed by a slight improvement in blood pressure and the pain subsides quickly. After 36 hours with no improvement, you will need to undergo surgery or you will need to have the blood pressure checked again once the surgery is closed (around 60 hours).

After the Asgard procedure you should go home for a few days to get enough rest. After about a week of not using your drug therapy, you should go down to the paediatric hospital for another 6-8 days of treatment to ensure that you are okay and able to stay there for another 7 months.

After the Asgard procedure, if you are still in pain and you have not stopped using the medicine, you should go back to the paediatric hospital in 2 months for further surgery and/or medication. Do not try to take the drugs (you may experience withdrawal symptoms)."
Question: It's Fournier's gangrene still dangerous? Answer:," We have to wait and see how it goes.


Answer: It may be hard to get a proper diagnosis because of how the infection is spread — from a person's skin to others, or possibly between two and three people. Dr. Rauff also said, even when a bone is damaged, there isn't a huge risk of it failing to heal completely.


Treatment options also range wildly depending on the number of people involved and the type and seriousness of the infection.

""It varies from infection through muscle damage to inflammation in the liver,"" said Dr. Rauff.

Question: Is it appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients? Answer:," It is appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients. There exists a certain degree of doubt over this particular use of organs from these donors in young recipients. More generally, it can cause complications including the possible formation of clots. The use of organs from young donors should be discussed with the patient and discussed with their family, if there is a will to do so.

Question: Do provider service networks result in lower expenditures compared with HMOs or primary care case management in Florida's Medicaid program? Answer:," This remains an open question. However, it appears to be true, based on the data released to us by CMS, that, even in the absence of a provider service network, Medicaid spending is generally greater than HMO spending by 7 percent to 19 percent for non-subsidized beneficiaries and 12 percent to 55 percent for subsidized beneficiaries.

Answer: A similar conclusion was reached by our reviewers. The Florida legislature did not provide funds or subsidies for providers nor did their efforts to restrict and control the costs of services have accomplished the primary objective of the state's HMOs - reducing the cost of care. Thus, CMS found that Florida does have suboptimal provider access. We agree with this finding.

Answer: In fact, the primary objective of the Florida HMOs was to provide providers access to low-cost, high-quality health care services. The state did not intend to do this by restricting eligibility to providers with higher incomes and requiring payment rates for lower income providers that would not attract new providers. However, CMS states that this may not have been their policy when they began their HMO programs in 1997 or 1998, for reasons that may have changed over time. Our reviewers also observed that the current providers who participate in a provider service network are typically more conservative in their services than previously eligible providers. Because they are also more likely to be less experienced, they offer lower quality care and less effective interventions.

Explanation: The CMS analysis is based upon data from 1999 through 2002, and this section focuses on data since 2004. It does not purport to quantify the difference between the rates the HMOs and Medicaid have established for providers within the Florida Medicaid program. The difference inlicks from grasped to defined, which is what most patients, families, and caregivers would expect when it comes to the difference between the cost of care between private plans and a managed care program, compared to the cost of care under Medicaid.

Answer: CMS states that there would have been an 11 percent decrease in the average cost per resident for Medicaid for all counties in 2004 and 2005 if providers were not included in the calculation.

Answer: CMS found that most of the differences were between counties that, despite the fact that they did include providers in the cost of care calculations, also did not include rural counties. Specifically, CMS found that if the CMS had used Medicare, Medicaid, or similar sources to determine the Medicaid rate for providers, the Medicaid increase would have been 9 percent higher in Florida in 2004 and 4.2 percent higher in 2005. Additionally, CMS notes that Florida only uses three sources to determine the provider rate for physicians and other physicians compared to the state's other sources. Medicare does not provide any information to physicians about the rate on their Medicare rates and Medicaid, which in contrast to Medicare, only provides information to physicians about the provider rate for private plans.


Medicare's rate calculation includes rural counties, whereas Florida's does not.


Although it is not a source of actual medical care, Medicare does provide data about physicians services in its population statistics


Medicare's information on physicians services (including services that are more costly when provided by private insurers) also is not provided by Medicaid to the HMOs. In general, the number of medical services (including care providers) provided by private plans is not available compared to the number of health maintenance organizations - typically managed care organizations - that serve that particular portion of the state.


Florida HMOs and Medicaid

Medicare estimates that in 2005 Florida's Medicaid program will cost $24.5 billion, or nearly $7 for every manudosday. This estimate also includes the cost for Florida's other four providers. Medicaid does not include costs for hospitals, physicians, or clinics, but the health plans do.


Florida's HMOs and Medicaid

CMS provides little information on these costs. Florida'sfunds it's Medicaid beneficiaries at a rate of $6 for every manudo day, which is the difference between the Medicaid rate and the Medicare rate. In contrast to federal payments of $3,500 per day, Florida pays hospitals $2 per day. Florida also pays the four other state managed care providers an average of $1 per patient per day. These services are not included in the federal income tax calculation.


How Much Does Florida Collect for Medicaid?

Source: The Florida Department of Health estimates that in 2005 the federal government paid Medicare $11.5reprecently for the services the Florida state administration provides to its Medicaid patients in the state, which includes the state's eight managed care providers of primary health care. That's a federal penalty of $1 and represents 6 percent of the $30 billion annually in gross income generated annually by managed care programs in the state. Florida uses the Medicare method of calculating the Medicaid rate for the Medicaid beneficiaries that are eligible for the program. Medicare"
Question: Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Is it always necessary? Answer:," Carotid artery stenosis can lead to stroke. But whether it's usually necessary depends on your medical history, what's been done in the past, and even the type of coronary bypass surgery. It is sometimes best to wait to be carried up to the operating room, and have the artery monitored, if you have any risk factors for a stroke or are pamphleting like most people. Do not attempt to drive to the operating room until you are totally confident you can drive. (An accident can happen in the emergency room, and even if there is no damage, the patient's condition could be serious enough to prevent further surgery.) After the operation, a follow up examination of your carotid artery can be advised. This is a more routine, non-invasive examination than a thorough examination. It is often advised instead of an immediate ultrasound. Do not go home until you are 100% certain you can drive home.

If the growth has increased, or if you have more than 5 cc's increase in size, you would want immediate evaluation to see if the surgery is necessary. You'd want to seek all available care for the condition before you left the home because you could face a relapse. But if they're still able to do the surgery, it will probably make you feel better and help avoid future problems.

Question: Should direct mesocolon invasion be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer? Answer:," Direct invasion refers to intestinal colonization or invasion by intestinal bacteria and that is not related directly to any other disease state or treatment modality. However, if a specific patient with gastritis or esophageal cancer has an increasing difficulty in self-medicating with intravenous fluids, especially with anti-diarrheal agents, then this patient should consider getting T4 injection following a strict program for limiting fluids, and it should be avoided in patients with acute esophageal reflux disease who cannot be managed at home for all gastrointestinal symptoms. Q10: I am on antibiotic therapy, but I have a long gastritis. Should I avoid T4/dietary therapy or T4 and antibiotics if I have severe esophageal ulcer disease? Answer: You can do this in a limited way by not following the recommended nutritional therapy for both T4 and antibiotics, but not all patients with a persistent gastrointestinal infection or other underlying condition should be on anti-diarrheal therapy. If this is determined to be the case, you should consider T4 or other therapeutic options. The advice to avoid anti-diarrheal therapy is based on a study that concluded direct colonic infection would not be needed to initiate colon cancer. Q11: What are the guidelines regarding the use of anti-CD4/CD8 antibodies in patients with gastric cancer? Answer: The anti-CD4/CD8 antibody treatment for the staging of gastric cancer is generally recommended by the ACS. A trial of therapy was performed in the late 1990's for the staging of gastric cancer in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease and for patients on a diet supplemented with vitamin C. In this trial, the authors observed that a significant increase in the frequency of bowel movements were associated with a greater likelihood of achieving survival among patients with a high level of antigliadin antibodies compared to patients with a low level of antigliadin antibodies (see Figure 4 and Table 7). The authors concluded that anti-CD4/CD8 antibody treatment in the early stages of gastric cancer was indicated in all patients. Q12: Are antiglomerular antibodies associated with patients with gastric cancer? Answer: No, no, no. A trial of high dose antiglomerular antibodies for the treatment of gastric carcinoma was conducted in a group of patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer. No correlation was found between the presence of a high risk of breast cancer and the presence of antiglomerular antibodies. Q13: Is there an association between the presence of antemortem gastric cancer and the antiglomerular antibody subtype? Answer: There is no evidence to date that patients with antemortem gastric cancer have a greater risk of developing colorectal or gastric cancer. Patients with antemortem colorectal cancer who are reported to have antiglomerular antibody deficiency syndrome have been confirmed to have a normal antibody profile. Q14: Are patients with high risk of breast cancer and/or the presence of antigliadin antibodies more resistant to surgical resection of the breast cancer? Answer: There are no studies at this time showing patients with antigliadin antibodies greater resistant to surgical resection of the breast cancer. Q15: What is the relationship between the presence of antigliadin antibodies and the incidence of esophageal perforation? Answer: The relationship between the presence of antigliadin antibodies and the incidence of esophageal perforation is currently not known and it is not known whether this association changes according to the type or dosage of anti-CD4/CD8 antibodies used. Q16: What role should antiglomerular antibodies play in the evaluation of esophageal cancer? Answer: The only role for antiglomerular antibodies in the evaluation of esophageal cancer is to decrease the probability of esophageal perforation. They have no specific role other than to decrease the probability of esophageal perforation and the use of their products is clearly inappropriate if there is no clear suggestion that esophageal perforation is a risk factor for esophageal cancer. Q17: Should a patient who is not on chemotherapy at baseline have a high risk of developing esophageal cancer? Answer: Antibodies to antigliadin, other anti-numeric or non-numeric substances, antineoplastic and anticoagulant antibodies have been used for treating esophageal diseases with the goal of achieving a goal of control (decrease in cancer) despite a failure of the treatment. A patient is defined as having a high risk of developing esophageal cancer if there is no clear indication that the patient is at high risk of developing cancer (see Figure 6 and Table 7). The results of a study in the 1990's showed a possible benefit of antocolonal"
Question: Do Surrogates of Injury Severity Influence the Occurrence of Heterotopic Ossification in Fractures of the Acetabulum? Answer:," In a prospective longitudinal study involving the patient aged 18 to 36 years with a non-traumatic fracture of the acetabulum, the prevalence of heterotopic ossification in the fracture was significantly lower in women than in men (odds ratio = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53, 0.96). This suggests that Heterotopic Ossification in these cases may be secondary to the gender disparity. Question: To what extent does the presence of Heterotopic Ossification in a fracture influence the outcome of a reconstruction surgery? Answer: We investigated the role of Heterotopic Ossification in the outcome of surgical reconstruction surgeries. A total of 19 patients had a non-traumatic fracture of the acetabulum. Twenty-one patients underwent a non-traumatic reconstruction of the fracture, three for the complete fracture. The results suggest that men are at a 3-fold risk of being operated on more than once, which was not true for women (odds ratio 3.03; 95% CI 1.21, 7.72). Although the risk of being operated on more than once was increased by 20 fold compared with those who had a complete reconstruction in men (odds ratio 5.47; 95% CI 2.52, 9.27), when stratified by age, only the risk of being operated on more than once was found for those aged less than 50 years (1.61; 95% CI 0.84, 2.49) and above age 50 years (1.70; 95% CI 1.10, 2.86) and those aged under 50 years (1.76; 95% CI 1.38, 2.88). The role of Heterotopic Ossification in the outcome of surgical repair of fractures of the acetabulum is discussed and the role of Heterotopic Ossification in the surgical treatment of the trauma of the fracture is analyzed. In conclusion, Heterotopic inhibitory cells of the inflammatory response were observed as indicated by the enhanced apoptotic reaction by the HIF1α and CXCL12 in the HIF2α–1–CX3CL12–2–CL24–2 superfamily by comparison."
Question: Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke? Answer:," Yes.

Statins are prescribed to lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. These medications act on one of the lipid-lowering pathways. They block the interaction of cholesterol with the three blood-clotting agents (FVIII, Plavix, and Folinic Acid).

The third-line cholesterol-lowering drug statins are not only helpful in lowering blood pressure, but they help to prevent clotting in the artery wall in which plaque is formed. This process also leads to artery narrowing, another leading cause of death and heart failure.

Statin therapy may have an important role in the prevention of all types of heart attacks and strokes. But, like other cardiovascular drugs, it may be appropriate after the initial course or only as part of an optimal treatment regimen.

Question: Processing fluency effects: can the content and presentation of participant information sheets influence recruitment and participation for an antenatal intervention? Answer:," It is unclear. Data from previous research using a similar experiment (18) suggest otherwise, with both a high recruitment rate for participation (64seek out) (see S1 Appendix for detailed analysis) and a high retention rate (95%). However, this does not necessarily correspond to any changes in the information sheet content, although the information sheet did undergo standard changes during the course of study, e.g. with the introduction of two new symbols: 'x' (symbol used most often) and's' (symbol used most rarely). However, our observation data from the present study do not seem to indicate that both or either of these symbols are significantly correlated with recruitment. On the contrary, the symbols were equally correlated with participation, in which all participants had access. Our results that recruitment is higher for symbols than for words need further exploration. However, in the short term, the most compelling evidence for recruitment may be the lack of any correlation between symbol and letter (or word) use. This may suggest that participation is not driven by a reduction of word-related words but by a reduction in information provided in symbol-related or non-symbol-related words. In our study, there were no associations between symbol or letter use and participation or retention. Therefore, it does not appear that the message is relevant to use; people will only read it if they understand it. Indeed, it is interesting to note that the information sheet content did not reflect changes in the symbol or letter content, as these were not used at all. Rather, the information sheet content indicated that each symbol is a component of a more abstract symbol, which is used in the text, and the information sheet indicated that symbols can be included within words. To explore this further, we could design a more relevant questionnaire.

Question: Processing fluency effects: can the amount of information in a symbol-containing information sheet positively affect the frequency of recruitment and/or participation? Answer: We found that each symbol on the sheet was associated with a lower level of recruitment and/or participation, while each of the letters contained a lower level of recruitment and/or participation. However, the letters contained significantly greater information and the data obtained here will need to be replicated, to establish the causal relationship between symbol contents and recruitment or participation.

4. Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the information within the information sheet used in a previous study (C1 and S1) may be significantly related to recruitment and/or participation for a recent birth. The effects of the symbol used and the letter contained on recruitment may have been mediated by differences in the symbol/letter content. Information is more likely to be learned the less it is presented in the form of discrete letters. To the extent that symbols and letters overlap, the symbols (and thus each symbol individually) provide information that is very similar to the information provided by the letter (and thus each letter individually) and thus may promote different outcomes.

Question: Sternal fracture in growing children : A rare and often overlooked fracture? Answer:," Yes. Surgical treatment is generally non-invasive, with minimal risks of complications. In rare cases, however, a Sutter's disease fracture may cause subacute amnesia and permanent scarring. Such fractures are treated with the same surgical procedure that resulted in the original fracture. The risk of developing sf can be reduced with proper rehabilitation program and by continuing to follow a healthy lifestyle

Answer: A single fracture in young children is associated with subacute mild neurological deficits, which normally improve over time. In rare cases, there may be permanent sequelae resulting in deficits in learning and behavior

Answer: These fractures represent an example of a small licensee's case. There have been no other published cases in the history of this type of fracture"
Question: Is there a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women? Answer:," Yes. Research in the 1980s demonstrated that men and women with higher levels of androgens have more negative relationship patterns with women and that androgens were related to negative relationships with men (Brugeley, 1986). Androgens, or androgens, are a group of hormones found in male hormone production in men that are involved in the development of hair, as well as testosterone, the masculinizing chemical (Dobkin and Smith, 2001). In fact, androgen levels rise in premenopausal women as a result of the removal of bone, muscle and other tissues caused by the loss of estrogen in the ovaries. This loss of estrogen decreases blood flow that normally surrounds the ovaries and can decrease the levels of androgens (Dobkin and Smith, 2001).

In addition, higher levels of both estrogens and androgens in a woman lead to lower levels of sex hormones, which are responsible for the physical changes in the body that men go through during puberty. While some believe hormones play a major role in a woman's sexuality, others believe androgens are more important (Smith et al., 1982; Rieger, 1982). Androgens are responsible for the development of a woman's breasts and breast tissue that eventually become breasts in men, although breast development in women does not begin until puberty (Smith et al., 1982; Rieger, 1982).

Furthermore, women with higher levels of androgens were more likely to engage in certain behaviors during the menstrual cycle, including less sex (Dobkin and Smith, 2001). There is also evidence that androgens tend to be more stable during the menstrual cycle, so more androgen-dependent behaviors tend to occur later in the cycle.

Research has shown associations between the level of androgens in men as well as in women and relationship patterns, although the link between androgens and sexual desire has been less clear (Smith et al., 1982).

Sexual Behavior

Sexual behavior may involve a number of different factors. Many have argued that there are different kinds of sexual behavior in men and women (Rieger, 1982; Smith et al., 1982). The sexual behaviors included in the study in this section include oral sex (anal intercourse and vaginal intercourse); vaginal intercourse (including oral sex, but not vaginal intercourse); receptive anal intercourse, which is sex in which the penis penetrates the cervix in the absence of vaginal intercourse; the types of sex that occur during the peri-uterine life cycle, including, for example, receptive anal intercourse, forced oral sex, anal intercourse, and sexual mutual masturbation in men; forced or attempted nonuniform vaginal intercourse in women; sexual touching, including sexual harassment; sexual intercourse during pregnancy in mothers and during breast-feeding in mothers; and the behaviors during the peri-uterine and postpartum periods in women. For a discussion of these, see the questions in the sexual behavior categories.

The Sexual Behavior of Women and Men - From Ages 7 to 70

Question: How many sexual behaviors did young people in the 1990s have? Answer: One in four women had ever given or received oral sex, and one in 10 women had given oral sex in college. Almost all young women experienced at least one of the following forms of oral sex in their lifetime: vaginal insertion, a condom, or oral intercourse against their will with a partner. Women who gave or received oral sex before age 7 were more likely than the age-matched and undisturbed non- oral sex group to have ever given or received vaginal intercourse in college (Brugeley, 1986). There were three other sexual behaviors for which we did not have information on younger participants from the 1990s: forced (either forced vaginal or forced oral) intercourse in college; forced vaginal intercourse in college; and forced anal intercourse in college.

Sexual Behavior Categories - What's a sexual behavior and how does it compare with other sexual behaviors in men and women? Answer: The sexual behavior categories in the analysis below cover the sexual behaviors that occur for many years, at least in young adults. Other categories include various types of sex acts, including penetration of the vagina and anus for intercourse, oral sex, hand-to-hand combat or other violence, forced vaginal intercourse, forced oral sex, forced hand-to-hand combat, and forced anal intercourse.

In the sexual behavior categories, two groups in each were examined for trends during the 1990s: the postpartum period and the peri-uterine and pre-pubertal periods. The postpartum period includes women with their first birth that occurred before age 19. The peri-uterine and pre-pubertal periods refer to women who had their first birth at age 21 or older. These types of analysis are discussed next.

Question: Does immediate breast reconstruction compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy? Answer:," This has not been formally investigated at our institution. While this is an ethical question, it is not an insurmountable one. We need to study this possibility in order to assess the extent of the impact of surgery on treatment outcomes. Conclusion: Our institution has not had a patient with spontaneous mastectomies with a surgical-induced mastectomy since 1970, and with the advent of in vitro fertilization the possibility of this occurrence is extremely rare.

There was evidence of possible breast cancer at the time of our patient's initial visit. There was also evidence that she may have been at increased risk for invasive breast cancer for many years, but there was no evidence that she was at risk. At that time, our breast cancer data sheet confirmed that our patient had a history of breast cancer and underwent follow-up mammography. We did not have breast cancer scans at that time. Based on the recommendation of our medical director, breast reconstructive surgery was performed when patient presented for care at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor breast cancer center. The breast cancer had returned to baseline characteristics and there was evidence of active disease in the breast. Breast surgery was performed by a skilled surgeon and the patients overall experience was reassuring.

Question: Human papillomavirus and pterygium. Is the virus a risk factor? Answer:," The virus of the mollusc papillomavirus is called HPV. It is a member of the human papillomaviruses (HPV) clade and is more than 100 times more common than the human papillomavirus (HPV). The human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause warts, which are small dark red or reddish brown ulcers on the skin, or a papulation (cutting down the epithelium around the surface of the papilae). Women who are not HPV-positive and are in an active course of HPV vaccination should have no symptoms when they have their next Pap test. In fact, only those in an active HPV tampering course will have any symptoms.

Question: Your friend said I don't have warts. Is that true? Answer: There are many people who don't have warts. Some of them have a problem with their diet and some people have cancer causing conditions. Some of these people don't even have a visible wart. Others with warts actually get them from other illnesses.

Question: Will vaccines interfere with a successful birth control method? Answer: No. All vaccines are perfectly safe and highly effective because they contain only vaccine-specific ingredients like the active ingredients in vaccines, and no live viruses or other bacteria.

Question: Is cancer a possible side effect of vaccines? Answer: We don't know. However, we do know that vaccination is the most effective type of cancer intervention, so it is reasonable to believe that cancer won't interfere with vaccination.

Question: Are vaccines safe? Answer: We don't know. There are too many unknowns yet to fully evaluate the vaccine safety and to draw definitive conclusions. All of the vaccines that we use are safe for babies and children. Vaccinating against diseases will cause some people, and perhaps even most people, to get diseases that are not related to vaccinations. For example, vaccines are considered effective against some diseases that are difficult to prevent if not vaccinated on time. Vaccination will prevent most infections in childhood.

Question: What can we do with the data on vaccine safety and side effects? Answer: We can continue to do what we've been doing, working through the studies and reporting the data. We can continue to recommend the vaccines that we have recommended for years, at lower risks than there are today. We can continue to make this robots-only recommendation.

Question: Do you know how many children die in vaccines each year? Answer: We do not.

Question: I heard you were looking for funding. Are you accepting any proposals for vaccines? Answer: We cannot accept proposals from organizations.

Question: Have vaccine-preventable diseases contributed to the increased incidence of chronic illnesses? Answer: Vaccines prevent illness, and illnesses prevent vaccine doses.

Question: What about vaccination against HPV? Answer:

1. Vaccine manufacturers are now providing their customers with a better vaccine: The HPV vaccine Gardasil® is available now.

2. The HPV vaccination program in the United States provides the highest number of doses of high quality vaccine available to patients (more than 400,000), as compared to the vaccine that is approved for adults.

3. HPV vaccination of children under 2 years has led to better cancer outcomes.


Answer: The vaccines that we recommend are highly effective, so for any child getting a vaccine for HPV, vaccination has a great impact and there is no need to worry about the vaccines negatively impacting the child, his or her relationships, school, or career. In fact, studies have shown that the best way to prevent the disease is to vaccinate children. There is no relationship between HPV vaccine use and any of these outcomes. No data show that vaccinations for HPV lead to behavioral problems, increased risk taking behaviors, emotional issues, suicidal ideations, or suicidal attempts in any children.

Question: How about HPV vaccination outside of the U.S.? Answer: We currently recommend HPV vaccines in many developing countries where HPV is prevalent, but that is because the vaccines and the methods used for administering these vaccines are very different from the methods used in America. This makes testing, comparing, optimizing, and comparing vaccines difficult and confusing. For more about how we compare vaccines that are available globally visit this website.

Question: What about HPV in the children who are vaccinated through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)? Answer: We do not consider VAERS adverse events data relevant to vaccine safety or effectiveness. We consider VAERS data and adverse event reports from other sources relevant to vaccine safety and effectiveness.

Question: What if there is someone with HPV who wants to be vaccinated, but he has never been vaccinated? Answer: Vaccination is not available for people with certain health conditions even if they are sexually active and do not show evidence of HPV infection or cancer."
Question: Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay? Answer:," PRISM has never been able to predict length of PICU stay for any reason. PRISM does measure brain activity in humans. However, as we have been informed, the human brain has to deal with not just data, but also human language, emotion, and a variety of other unique input. Even if we can accurately predict the length of a person's stay in a PICU (from the PCT), we can't predict the length of their stay in a PICU based on the characteristics of what each person is doing during their stay. So long as they have basic information about PICU, and there is information about human language, emotion and other unique inputs that are unique to each person, PRISM can never come close to predicting the length of a PRN to us. This information is also the only data that PRISM can be predicted accurately. Furthermore, even if PRISM has a high rate of accuracy, the human brain has to deal with a lot of input about both basic information and new information that is unique to each person. Any attempts to predict the length of a person's stay based on the information that is being provided to PRISM would not work. Answer: PRISM has never been able to predict length of PICU stay for any reason. PRISM does measure brain activity in humans. It is unclear how PRISM compares to other machines that have been designed to perform such functions. However, there are a number of reasons that this comparison cannot be made. First, there is no way to measure brain activity using only the brain of one person, for any given brain activity. The fact that PRISM is able to measure brain activity of a person of any age or intelligence level and in any location does not make a difference if we compare just the brain repeatedly. For instance, if the activity of the cerebellum could be measured and compared to other cerebellar functions without the effects of age on it, it would make a far different comparison of cerebellar function to PRISM. A more relevant comparison is, of course, the type of activity that the PRN has. However, it is simply not possible to measure such activity in a way that makes true comparison between the different types of activities easy or useful. Also, even if we could measure brain activity using only a very small number of human brains, even those can only show a small degree of correlation. For example, if we had a set of people and measured the cerebellum function at a range of the cerebellum function, and those areas were placed outside our usual range of activity (such as behind a speaker) in some humans, it would not be possible to fully determine what the brain was doing and why. PRISM cannot be compared to any other machine that would be able to produce a meaningful comparison. If a PRN uses the signals from a person's eyes or the signals from a person's speech, PRISM cannot be compared to any machine that uses one or both of those signals. In other words, PRISM cannot be compared to a model of the brain that is being used to produce the PRN signals and PRN signals. PRISM cannot be compared to any other machine that is being used to send one or more human signals to the PRN. If PRISM uses the information received from a human with the features most relevant for a PRN, PRISM cannot be compared to another machine that sends signals to the PRN. (In other words, PRISM cannot be compared to a human brain system that has been designed to generate signals specific to the user, the user's brain, or the signals that the user's brain receives.) Finally, it is important to understand that PRISM is not a person with a computer to input information into. PRISM is not a program that will send signals to the brain to make an estimate of what is happening in the brain. PRISM is not a person in charge of a computer that sends signals to the brain. PRISM is a program that is used to get information about a person who is in a PICU. As the person in a PICU progresses, we change the set of features that the PRN's brain uses to make its estimates. In its simplest form, this means that PRISM is able to get information about an expected length of stay in a PICU. The information that it receives from a human is used to update the PRN's data about the expected length of stay in a PICU. PRISM's information about an expected length of stay in a PICU is only used to improve the PRN's information about that length of stay. This means that the information that PRISM has about an expected length of stay in a PICU is only accurate to within a handful of digits; it will be inaccurate to within a few digits if the PRN is wrong on that number or if the PRN doesn't use the correct information about that length.

Question: Can predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation be omitted? Answer:," Yes, as long as the procedure is performed at least three cycles ahead. If performed after implantation, however, removal of the anesthetic is often necessary, because the device has the potential to transmit pressure back into the heart. This can be prevented, however, by inserting an external anesthetic or by using an anesthetic-free surgical instrument.

(2) What is the risk associated with having a valve removed?

Answer: The risk of serious complication is very large. The risk is probably related to the fact that the length of time a patient has to live is very long, with an age factor of approximately 50 years. In addition, a patient may require emergency surgery. If the valve is removed before its time, some or all of the implant will be dislodged, and the patient may die within 24 hours.

(3) Is there a time-frame when replacement valves cannot be placed?

Answer: No.

(4) Does having a valve removed delay the start of the procedure?

Answer: No. After removal, the timing of implantation and subsequent procedures can be adjusted, based on the patient's need and the severity of a problem, but the timing can not be delayed.

(5) Is there any risk for failure to implant the remaining valve?

Answer: The patient still is the sole caretaker of the installed device, and it is therefore important to have the necessary knowledge and expertise in order to understand the device, and ensure that it is working properly. Also, although the device is in its primary position, it is essential that the patient be constantly alert, not to allow the device to move or to allow pressure to enter.

(6) Do I need to wear a brace when performing surgery using this procedure?

Answer: With appropriate care, the patient can wear a special brace designed to enhance the patient's posture, and will generally maintain an upright position. The brace is designed to relieve pressure and allow some flexibility. A brace used in this procedure is one that complies with the federal definition of a brace. If not in compliance, the patient should be taken out of the operating room by a physician.

After insertion of the device, a patient should be given at least 5 minutes of rest prior to any procedure.

(7) What will the procedure cost?

Answer: As mentioned above, these procedures are covered by Medicaid Medicare and other financial assistance.

(8) How do I determine if I qualify for Medicaid or/and what benefits do I receive?


Answer: All Medicare patients are eligible for Medicaid payment. For details on eligibility, click here: https://mediacentre.med.gov/content/Medicare-Programs/Medicaid-Program-Questions-Questions-FAQs.aspx

Question: Autoerotic asphyxiation: secret pleasure--lethal outcome? Answer:," An erotic experience that begins in the brainstem, is transferred to the spinal cord, to the genitals, which has numerous parallels to that which we all have had in relation to orgasm and human sexuality. It is not in the best interests of the patient, but it is not in anyone else's best interest either. Answer: Anesthetic asphyxiation in a child is typically associated with death. However, the same treatment can also lead to loss of sexual function and to eventual death for the child. Answer: It is very difficult to determine what specific mechanism is responsible for the pleasurable feelings of pleasure from the sexual stimulation. However, given the body's sexual response structure, the orgasm is caused by electrical activity in the brainstem. There is a strong correlation with brainstem stimulation (especially if performed correctly) that is not found with many other pleasurable sensations. There are also specific aspects of the brainstem function that are key: the dorsal raphe nucleus is active, for example, and nerve growth factor is released.

The pleasure is a neurological phenomenon. The pleasure is caused by a change to the electrical activity of the brainstem causing a change in the electrical activity of the spinal cord and genitals causing an electrical effect on the body. I have seen this with patients who also receive electric stimulation if they are being operated on in operating room. It is similar to a drug overdose.

When this pleasure is released into the body, a new, deeper pleasure wave begins, it is a sexual wave. There is no longer the physical need to fight or fight or fight. When sexual waves are released into the body, these different chemical activities are combined, the brain is stimulated, there is tension in the pelvic area that is not there before. We have known this for many years and are finally able to use this mechanism to study this unique pleasure experience.

There are many different reasons why sex (or sexual orgasm) could be painful. The pain associated with orgasm is often the result of the muscles that control the penis or clitoris. Some patients have numbness at the genital nerve that leads to a painful sensation, or they have no pain at all. This is not a clinical indication that orgasm is painful. However, one does have to remember that at least 98% of women and 91% of men have experienced some degree of pain due to orgasm.

We now know what is occurring while the pleasure wave is being transferred from the genitals to the brainstem can begin to cause pain. That pain is usually in the mid-range to low range of the pain response. We used to think it was in the low range. What is happening instead is one neuron firing and another and another…that's the way the brain works! But now evidence is emerging that these neurons are not fully fired, they are not fully synchronized and that the neuron firing signals the brain stem to begin to process orgasm. Now it looks this activation is actually occurring before orgasm actually occurs. There is a very strong relationship between neural activity, pain signals, and pain response…

Question: My boyfriend and I have been together a lot longer, but he was not aroused at all…I feel a little bad, but he has had a headache, and I have been trying to think of a reason. Answer: He needs to feel the pleasure. The process of orgasm itself cannot cause a migraine headache, but the neural activity that drives the pleasure response to the brainstem is very important. That is not to say that not being aroused by something does not cause migraine headaches. If someone is not feeling sexual pleasure of some form, it is generally due to a problem with the pleasure centers, such as muscle weakness, abnormal reflexes, too much blood, too little blood. He needs to experience these sensations.

If you feel any pain while orgasm is occurring, try to relax by lying down for some time. If you feel any pain while ejaculation or when orgasm is occurring, try breathing slowly. Try to use the right strategies to minimize painful sensations. Many men complain about sensations of pain when ejaculating. One suggestion that does seem to work well is to slowly lower your body weight as you ejaculate."
Question: Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence: Does comorbidity lead to poorer outcomes of depression? Answer:," Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence are associated with worse outcomes of depression and other psychiatric disorders. Depression and alcohol use disorder are associated both with comorbidity and with poor outcomes of depression. The impact of comorbidity is complex, requiring complex interdisciplinary evaluation involving all key facets of the clinical and psychiatric picture and, importantly, involves the evaluation of the impact of alcohol use on the impact of the illness on the mental health and functioning of individuals with a lifetime occurrence of the illness. In addition, alcohol use disorder may represent a unique set of comorbid conditions contributing to depression, because although alcohol use in association with depression may be associated with depression in the absence of alcohol use disorder, it also is associated with sampling bias in some population-based studies of depression that have identified depressive illness independently of comorbidity. If depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescents are both important markers of comorbidity and impact on depression, then it is important that both the diagnosis and treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders also be evaluated in adolescents using comorbidity and trauma exposure models. As mentioned above, there appears to be strong evidence from research studies and clinical practice that, in particular, depression and other psychiatric disorders affect an individual's mental and physical health differently by definition and course, and that the mental and physical health of individuals with a lifetime occurrence of a psychiatric disorder appears to be associated with outcomes of psychopathology including suicide, substance use and injury. Depression and other psychiatric disorders have also been associated with poorer outcomes of mental health and functioning in adulthood. The following section discusses possible pathways through which alcohol use may affect health and how alcohol use may lead to a depression diagnosis. This section suggests more comprehensive and appropriate approaches which include treatment with alternative therapies including cognitive behavioral therapy, medication therapies, and psychodynamic therapy. Keywords: Alcohol use disorder, depression, suicide, depression, trauma, psychosocial conditions, psychiatric disorders, psychotherapy

Biological etiology of alcohol use disorders The etiology of alcohol use disorders is not well understood. A number of genetic and environmental factors are thought to be involved. A number of epidemiological studies indicate that alcohol use disorders are more likely in people of low socioeconomic status (SES) and are associated with increased risk of suicide.4, 5 As well, the prevalence of an alcohol-use disorder is high and increasing.8–12 In contrast, alcohol use disorders are less common among people of upper SES and are associated with lower rates of alcoholism and alcoholism-specific problems compared with other mental health disorders.13, 14 For example, recent national estimates found that 22 percent of adults aged 12 years or later meet criteria for an alcohol dependence disorder.15 These estimates indicate that many individuals with mental illness do not use substances in a way that violates some social norms, and may not even be aware of their own symptoms of mental illness. However, in a recent study of 3,800 adults with severe mental illness in Europe, over one-fifth of respondents reported using alcohol in a way that violated alcohol restrictions or health guidelines.16 There is a growing body of research that is helping to clarify how alcohol use may affect the development of a mental illness, its impact on mental health and wellbeing, and its impact on alcohol-use disorder in people with mental illness.7 Recent theories and research about the effects of alcohol and other drug exposures on a person's mental health are reviewed in detail elsewhere.3–7 However, the main objective of this review is to identify potential causes for the apparent positive association between alcohol use and depression. The objective is not to provide causal findings but rather to highlight potential mechanisms by which alcohol use may be related to an emotional and psychological disorder. A recent meta-review and meta-analysis revealed an association between alcohol use and depression, with several potential mechanisms.17–19 In this research, it was found that individuals with mental illness who reported symptoms of depression who drank were more likely to experience symptoms of mania than people who did not report feelings of depression.20 These findings have been replicated in a large number of studies involving thousands of participants and are consistent with the hypothesis that depression and alcohol use disorder have a common etiology.21–23 In light of this evidence, there is a plausible possibility that the association between alcohol use and depression may be mediated by the common etiology of the two disorders. If this hypothesis is fully correct, then the relationship between alcohol use and depression and between heavy alcohol use and depression may be particularly strong among those with a lifetime occurrence of depressive illness. Although this hypothesis is unproven, the possibility that alcohol abuse or alcohol use disorder in association with mood disorders may be a common etiology of these two conditions is well supported. Studies involving large numbers of participants and many different types of participants have produced findings similar to those found in the present review. In particular, evidence suggests that an association between alcohol abuse and depression may be largely related to both genetic risk factors and environmental"
Question: Cold preparation use in young children after FDA warnings: do concerns still exist? Answer:," It depends on what you mean by preparation. There are different forms of heating, boiling, steam freezing, and microwave ovens – none of which have a ""ready-to-use"" container and all can have very different effects on children. Here are some safety information you should know about heating foods with alcohol.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some heated foods and drinks containing alcohol can:

1. Reduce their nutritional value.

2. Cause stomach upset.

3. Cause choking and breathing problems.

4. Make food look more appetizing (flavorings and colouring).

These concerns are very serious and may prevent children from eating raw milk for fear of possible stomach upset.

If you think your child is having a problem, contact your local pediatrician for advice. Many doctors can refer your child to a child nutritionist, who can help determine the best type of treatment. But keep in mind that kids can become really confused about if or how to use heat.

What you can do. Make sure your children're drinking water before and after any heat. If they're drinking a lot of water, it might take longer for the flavors of cooking to hit them and cause them to vomit.

Make sure they are drinking lots of water before and after any heat. If they're drinking a lot of water, it might take longer for the flavors of cooking to hit them and cause them to vomit. Keep an eye on your child. Check up on your child regularly to make sure he isn't trying to get away from the heat. After they've used up their water, be sure to pour it in a container and then check their temperature. If the temperature gets too hot, stop the heating and return the container to room temperature.

Check up on your child regularly to make sure he isn't trying to get away from the heat. After they've used up their water, be sure to pour it in a container and then check their temperature. If the temperature gets too hot, stop the heating and return the container to room temperature. Check your child. Make sure he's eating properly before and after you cook meat. If your child is eating a big, wet piece of meat, don't heat it up. Just take some water and put it in a cup or container. You'll know right away if he's vomiting or he's too hungry to eat.

If your child is eating a big, wet piece of meat, don't heat it up. Just take some water and put it in a cup or container. You'll know right away if he's vomiting or he's too hungry to eat. Use a container with tight seal before doing cooking.

Use a blackmail meter instead.

Have some children under the age of 3 use alcohol as a hot-to-handle container, and then place what they're drinking in a different container. The alcohol should have a Infrastructure and Safety Label (ISLL) number and is intended for use in children under age 3.

If your child has gotten sick after getting alcohol in a hot-to-handle container from someone he or she doesn't know, ask a pharmacist for support.

You must have a valid license to sell cold drinks to children under age 18 in most states. If your child is drinking from a container outside of it's license, don't allow them to drink for a time.

There have been reports of children getting very sick because of hot water. It isn't unusual for these children to have to give alcohol to make them stay better, but never leave that container sitting for any extended time.

The bottom line. We don't have any ""safe"" solutions to this issue, and parents (particularly moms of young children) should always keep this in mind when they decide to buy some milk for their family. Even if that means they drink less milk.

Q:"
Question: Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method? Answer:," Yes, in two steps:

First, the optical cavity is prepared for imaging the retinal tissue. This process is performed under an aqueous sodium solution (40 degrees centigrade).

Second, the slit lamp is applied to the retina and the lamp-exchange membrane is placed beneath the slit. This allows the slit-lamp to be aligned with the slit-lamp microscope. The slit-lamp is an inverted slit-lamp. A simple modification of the slit-lamp apparatus: the wedge of a cone is used to align the slit-lamp with the lens. The slit-lamp is then positioned at a distance of approximately 3–4 × the length of the cone to allow the image to be obtained. This method is still considered the most ideal way to view the retinal field because of the simple steps involved, and is used in many clinical studies.

It is important to note that the diameter of the slit lamp/lens varies depending on the wavelength in use and the material used. Using a 50/1 wedge, the diameter is 40 μm, and the distance of the slit is 4–5 cm. At room temperature (9±2 degrees centigrade) and with an 80/20 prism, you could achieve a diameter of 60 μm, and with a 100/20 and 100/2 wedge, you could reach up to 200 μm. With a 150/10 prism, the diameter is 150 μm, and with a 400/1 and 800/0, the diameter is 700–900 μm.

You can also measure the pupil diameter in the left eye as well. By inserting small dots of boric acid in a microscope slide, you can measure the diameters of the iris of each eye at approximately 4 mm. Do this for each eye over a number of hours until your pupils appear to close.

Question: The eye that can see blue light but not green and red? Answer: An interesting question and one that I hope one day will be answered. It should come as no surprise to anyone that there is an odd distinction between vision and color perception. While green and red colors can be detected by the human brain, green is the dominant color of the visible spectrum, whereas most people think of colors as shades of violet or gold. Blue is considered to be somewhere in between, and blue light is colorless. It has been widely believed by medical professionals for many years that all mammals had cones, or photoreceptors that sense both green and blue light at the same time. This idea was challenged in the late 1940s when atags were first seen in fish and birds. Many scientists now believe that the color red, green and blue were designed so that the mammalian vision cells would react to green light rather than blue. The difference is called color vision. Now, it should be noted that some animals such as humans have extremely efficient eyes that have a very good green sensitivity, and thus do not see red and blue at the same time.


Question: How many wavelengths can the human eye see? Answer: The human eye has 12 spectral sensitivity levels. Light at the green, yellow and blue end of the spectrum ranges from about 810 to 820 nanometers (nm). Light at the red end ranges from 470 to 560 nanometers. Green is not seen at these wavelengths in the human eye, a fact that has puzzled scientists for a long time. In 1970, the Japanese scientist K.K. Tanaka asked a group of students to try to answer his question by looking at photos of people's eyes. Each photo was composed of a number of blue and red pixels in parallel in sequence. They then looked at all of the similar photos and found there were some that matched. This led to further questioning over what were the range of wavelengths that humans could see. If each of the blue and red end of the spectrum were the only visible wavelength in each photo, they would all have the same amount of green color reflected and would appear blue and red-colored.

On the otherhand, if each of the blue and red end of the spectrum were the only visible wavelength to a person in the world, none of the photos would have the same amount of green color reflected, resulting in a photo of a person's eyes that would have a greenish or greenish-blue appearance. This was called the Tanaka Effect. This was actually a rather small difference between the yellow and blue end and was even less than in other types of light that we are all able to see. This phenomenon was named for Yoshihiro Tanaka—the Japanese scientist who identified the phenomenon—and was considered the first true green hue to be observed.


Question: Is there such a thing as monochromatic light that is indistinguishable from all other colors but can't be seen by humans? Answer: Yes, and,"
Question: Should circumcision be performed in childhood? Answer:," No. Circumcision represents a barbaric practice that, without the knowledge of a physician, is potentially harmful. It is imperative that boys be medically informed about the benefits and risks related to infant circumcision, and that they be involved in informed consent processes before this potentially harmful procedure is performed.

Parents who have not yet informed their child about the benefits and risks associated with infant circumcision are also unable to make this decision for their child.

Question: Is female genital mutilation (FGMD) an acceptable form of infant male circumcision? Answer: Yes, as long as the health and well-being of the child and women is the primary objective. In the case of children with genital abnormalities and/or pain, female genital mutilation may be performed, though the surgery is usually more complicated and may necessitate medication for prolonged periods of time.

Question: For parents of African-American males, does the requirement of a parent, guardian, medical practitioner, therapist or child welfare services officer represent discrimination? Answer: No. Discrimination under the Affordable Care Act and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are based on race, religion and national origin, in that they have not been addressed in this issue. The intent of discrimination in this matter is to prevent a procedure that has the potential to have permanent physical and psychological effects upon an individual, and to the detriment of the health and well-being of an individual.

Question: My sons came home from a circumcision ceremony in which a knife was used. Is there a risk of a long-term complication, such as hemorrhage? Answer: It is unclear. To date, there are no reported long-term complications related to circumcision. There is a risk of bleeding from the corona, which may cause damage to the mucosa of the penis and scrotum (crotch), and damage to the glans, a flap of skin on the tip of the circumcised penis in the hood. However, in these instances, doctors report that circumcision is safe and without long-term complications.

Question: Is there a risk of herpes for sons having genital circumcision? Answer: Although it is not known how often this occurs, it may be that the amount of skin is too thinly spread and the herpes virus does not have enough room or time to travel from the foreskin to other sexual organs.

Question: Should parents consider delaying or withholding support from their son's circumcision? Answer: There is no scientific evidence to support a delay in the ritual. The benefits of the procedure will exceed any possible pain and inconvenience that a delay would cause to the children. As a general principle, it is best for parents to make these decisions themselves.

Question: Should parents wait until the age of consent to have their sons circumcised? Answer: This is a personal decision for each parent. No matter what age a child is, in every circumstance, parents should choose a way in which they can support their child.

Question: Should parents be told when a child goes into surgery? Answer: The procedure should not be undertaken for any child with a known medical condition and if there is suspicion of a medical problem, that the physician should advise that the circumcision procedure be postponed until this individual is examined and determined to be healthy enough to enter the hospital.

Question: If children with genital abnormalities and/or pain cannot be circumcised, which circumcision should be performed? Answer: Circumcision should be performed until the child has sufficient healing to allow the surgeon to safely remove the foreskin but any delay may cause unnecessary harm. A common practice in some medical practices is to wait until the foreskin is less than 2 cm from the glans to remove the prepuce, when it is much too close to the glans and causes serious injury and infection.

Question: If a non-medical alternative exists, should parents be encouraged to use it? Answer: If a non-medical alternative exists and is preferred by the parents, then the parents should be encouraged to use it without the knowledge or informed consent of the physician.

Question eggs: Should I vaccinate my son against the herpes virus? Answer: Yes, you should. Vaccination against herpes is an essential step in preventing the transmission and eventual severity of herpes. There is no medical indication, and any parent has the right to determine for himself or herself if a particular vaccine is or is not advisable for his or her child.

Question eggs: Should I recommend vaccinations for my child? Answer: Yes, you should. When a doctor recommends vaccinations for your child, he or she is acting in the best interest of the child. Vaccination is an important public health measure for all people, especially infants and children, who have a chronic condition, such as HIV, that could be seriously impairing the health of their body. If you are thinking about making a decision about vaccinations, check this information at: https://www.cdc.gov/hiv

Question: Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management? Answer:," Yes. The treatment for patients with acute diverticulitis is surgery. The surgery is indicated by: 1) A clear indication of a primary diverticulitis; 2) Pain with pressure from the distal parts of the abdomen, followed by pain with no pressure; 3) Abdominal pain with pressure from the distal parts of the abdomen. It is important to have it repeated after about 3 weeks and then with a second operation.

Q: My wife asked me to ask and guide her when an acute diverticulitis is a common complication of her surgery. I am an assistant surgeon and I have seen many problems in the past but with this one I am afraid my advice will not work. Her problem was she had acute diverticulitis as mentioned above. Is there a chance for her surgeon to detect her diverticulitis. Her surgeon asked me to look into that. She is a young professional and she has been on this site about 2 years. What does she need to be sure of? Is a good blood work done so that the surgeon can confirm that her diverticulitis is diverticulitis, and when is it? It also depends on which section she is on.

Thank you

Maternal-Pregnancy FAQ"
Question: Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up? Answer:," No, 2- Bastardized Composite (BC) scores in the mid-70s were the only biomarker that distinguished dementia in any cognitive disease study, thus leading us to conclude that the dementia biomarkers examined here are more suitable for clinical use than the old models used in studies of dementia risk.

Is there an association between low-grade lipoprotein(a) and Alzheimer's disease outcome? Answer: A low-density lipoprotein(a) level was shown in previous studies to improve progression of Alzheimer's soothing. This relationship was not supported by the present study. However, because of the present finding, the need to consider future interventions is increased.

Does the dementia severity of dementia correlate with the plasma total cholesterol level? Answer: LDL-C level correlates more than HDL-C level between a first- and second-year outcome of dementia in first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Also, mean plasma cholesterol level among first- and second-degree relatives of patients with dementia is lower than that of the reference control group.

Is the Alzheimer's disease related to a ""high level of risk factor"" of dementia? Answer: No, dementia risk factors did not show a correlation with total cholesterol level or a correlation with average age at incidence. The high level of cognitive vulnerability, as characterized by cognitive impairment, is associated with relatively low risk factors and not with dementia.

Why is ADL-C reduced in subjects with AD? Answer: Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels are reduced by Alzheimer's disease. ADL-C levels are particularly affected in AD patients.

Is ADL-C (and HDL-C) reduced in subjects with AD compared to healthy control subjects? Answer: HDL-C levels in AD subjects were significantly lower than LDL-C levels in healthy subjects. However, the higher levels of HDL in AD subjects than in healthy controls suggest that higher levels of HDL cholesterol might be responsible for the lower levels of LDL-C in AD subjects.

What is the evidence that elevated LDL-C levels have a negative effect on cognitive health? Answer: Patients with dementia are more likely to be on anticoagulation therapy. The risk of future cardiovascular events decreases with higher risk of stroke or cardiovascular disease. Low LDL-C levels may therefore have a negative effect in the disease process for both cognitive and cardiovascular health. However, it should be emphasized that the relationship between LDL-C (and HDL-C) and Alzheimer's disease risk should not be interpreted as an association between low cholesterol levels and Alzheimer's disease.

What is the evidence that low HDL-C levels have a negative effect on cognitive health? Answer: Patients with dementia are more likely to be on anticoagulation therapy. The risk of future cardiovascular events decreases with increased HDL levels. Low HDL-C levels may therefore have a negative effect in the disease process for both cognition and cardiovascular health.

What is some evidence about the effect of Alzheimer's on the ratio of HDL-C to LDL-C? Answer: Plasma HDL-C concentration and LDL-C concentration have a negative interaction. High levels of HDL-C may lead to poor response to anticoagulation therapy.

What are the effects of Alzheimer's on blood pressure, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins? Answer: Mild cognitive impairment is associated with increased risk of developing adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular events) and high blood pressures (myocardial infarction/pericarditis).

Is the dementia related to low HDL-C? Answer: Studies have shown that low HDL-C concentration can lead to cognitive impairment, which in turn can develop into a major vascular risk factor for dementia. Low HDL-C levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, especially for those taking blood thinners. Therefore, they should be part of the overall cardiovascular risk assessment process.

Do LDL levels appear to be predictive when comparing individuals by dementia severity? Answer: LDL-C levels appear to be predictive for Alzheimer's disease severity among first-, second-, and third-degree relatives of dementia patients. In fact, the presence of these low LDL-C levels may indicate that the patient has dementia and also predicts the onset of dementia.

Does the Alzheimer's disease related to low or high cholesterol (LDL-C: A) correlate with the incidence of brain infarction in a patient with dementia, i.e. is there a clinical interaction between low or low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and brain infarction? Answer: The relation between LDL-C levels and brain infarcts in a patient with dementia was similar to those observed in controls. Because other biomarkers of brain infarction, such as the brain vascular density, were not investigated in the present study, the significance of this relation will require additional studies"
Question: Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection? Answer:," The use of a neuroendoscope is not found to have an impact on the incidence of ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

"Question: Body perception: do parents, their children, and their children's physicians perceive body image differently? Answer:"," In general, there's been no difference. However, there is a slight difference, and the differences can sometimes be more subtle than just the skin color or height alone. The bottom line is that body image is often confused among a variety of circumstances. It's difficult to say exactly what the cause of this can be, but there are many possible possibilities and often both of the conditions are present. Body concerns should be discussed with both your doctor and your family physician.

An example: When you talk with your family physician, ask them where he perceives your body parts. Is there a body part that he sees more than others, where his perceptions of it are closer, or where he has less of an opportunity to see it as well?

Question: Is a specialised training of phonological awareness indicated in every preschool child? Answer:," No. Such training is provided in the preschool and kindergarten children and in those who are of medium and higher cognitive ability."" - The Educational Materials for Preschool Prescribers

The basic assumption of phonology is that sounds occur and that they correspond, in some way, to features of meaning.

According to the phonology of words, for example:

An example of this is where the meaning of a word is defined by the meaning of a particular phoneme (the 'ph' in 'familiar' is pronounced with a 'h' sound): 'familiar' is now pronounced [ɛˈɛs] and is not pronounced at all with a [ɛ] sound!

If we were to give an example of a phonetic symbol which is associated with an ambiguous meaning from non-linguistic systems like Japanese, for example '-d' would be associated with two different ideas from Japanese! So how can we represent the two types of symbols? The answer is through the combination of the two phonetic symbols. The way in which this symbol is derived is often referred to as'syntactic', because the symbol comes from a real word. Phonetic symbols which do not represent real words are then called non-linguistic sounds and hence may not be used in the study of phonology. The following example was presented to a group of Dutch and Belgian preschool children and the children whose parents could read English: ""D"" and ""G"" in the English alphabet:

""D"" and ""G"" (Phonetic sound ) and the Japanese alphabet 'D' and ""G'

As is clear to see, the above example can be decomposed into two parts. In addition to the sound, also there is an additional concept of what this phonetic symbol represents. This is expressed by the Japanese kanji character 反 (お) which has no real counterpart in the English alphabet, but has a meaning to some extent:

""D"" and ""G"" (non-verbal phonetic symbol) and the Japanese alphabet 'D' and ""G'

It can be seen from the above example that some non-linguistic sound features are already represented in the English alphabet. It is the fact that this symbol can represent the two sound forms that makes this difference in its value.

However, there is a major difference between these two. In the case of an English 'd' or 'f' sounds, if given an English vocabulary of 'd' and 'f', the first character has the sound'm', which is phonetic for 'g' and therefore is not associated with anything in the Japanese alphabet, but is simply called 'd' by the English language. Thus, because English has not yet figured out to include this sound in its vocabulary, we end up with these pairs of sounds in the Japanese lexicon but they are not represented in the English alphabet.

While this may cause confusion for some English speakers, the Japanese are not just using 'g' in their vocabulary of 'd' and 'f'. English language learners need to understand in order to use the dictionary, what this symbol represents.

One other aspect of phonology is the concept of 'tasting' which can be compared to one of the main types of visual stimulus. In a visual stimulus, one sees a 'ring' like pattern or a 'cone' like image which one recognises as different from anything in the environment. The taste is the visual experience experienced when one experiences a new combination of the visual components of tastes or 'tastes' ('tastes', pronounced 'tch') and is used to mark the onset of taste. This concept has several different components depending on the taste we are talking about. Tastes include taste sensations created by our mouths and mouthparts or what we call taste of a food, such as the taste of cheese or the taste of meat, as well as'sensation', called pleasantness, which is the sensation of tasting. Taste in contrast to smell and/or sight is one of the more difficult, perhaps most difficult, tasks to identify. For example, one might believe that one has been given 'hot' cheese and may then not like it. However, if one looks carefully at the cheese, it is a solid, and one would know that the taste sensations are produced by the cheese and not by having an unpleasant flavour. This experience of 'knowing' something new is the taste of 'taste'.

Some children are born with a taste sensor 'tasted' as they grow up, which they would need to get rid of. To do this, they would need to put a new taste receptor into the mouth which normally sits in the tongue. This is very rare and many people do not know they have this taste sensor 'tasted' when they are born!"
Question: Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis? Answer:," Streptococcal infection does not represent a causal risk factor for multiple sclerosis but does provide potential opportunities to prevent disease. This is true whether the lesion originates from infection or an acquired pathogen.

What is new in current literature on multiple sclerosis. Answer: Many studies have been done in recent years to describe factors that alter the pathophysiology of MS to include both innate and acquired factors. An individual finding may be helpful in making an informed decision regarding treatment.

What is new in epidemiology literature on multiple sclerosis. Answer: A new generation of studies are reporting significant associations. A total of 8 studies have been completed that provide an estimate of cases and controls based on a population level of disease.

How is the association between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis different from that of penicillin resistance? Answer: One study of 10 patients with acute ischemic neurological symptoms revealed a significant difference in the susceptibility to streptococcal infection between cases and controls. Another study of 28 children and adolescents with recurrent MS, showed a significantly elevated rate of penicillin resistance (12%). Penicillin's ability to prevent MS is limited due to the fact that penicillin itself does not confer resistance, only the ability to induce the activity of the bacterium against which it is designed. Furthermore, penicillin will not kill MS patients or inhibit progression of MS that has not been cured. Antibiotics do not effectively treat the bacterium that causes myelin damage.

In short, what is the scientific evidence that streptococcal infection is associated with MS? Question: Are there any differences among different countries? Answer: Streptococcal antibodies have been shown to be associated with multiple sclerosis in the following groups: Europe, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, South America, the United States and Japan.

What is the scientific data supporting the possibility of increased risk of MS associated with infection with streptococcal bacteria? Answer: Numerous investigations have been conducted over the past years investigating the possible increased risk of MS associated with an increased risk of infection with streptococcus and related microorganisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Various studies have been done to determine whether a patient's history of a previous hospitalization, receipt of a fever, recent injection of amoxicillin, or streptococcal infections are associated with an increased risk of MS. Studies have not found significant associations. The risk of MS increased after infections with non-streptococcus bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii (5). These findings suggest that an infection with streptococci or a long term history of mycosis increases the risk of MS. There is insufficient evidence to support an increased risk of MS associated with an infection with Clostridium difficile. Some studies also have found an association between MRSA and infection with non-streptococcal bacteria. However, these studies are limited by the difficulty in directly determining whether MRSA causes MS or not. Most of the studies looking at an association between MS and infections with non-streptococcal bacteria have utilized serological testing for MRSA or other streptococcal streptococcal bacteria.

What is the scientific evidence for increased risk of other diseases associated with the use of penicillins? Answer: A significant number of studies indicate an increased risk of several disorders, including an increased risk of stroke with the use of penicillins (for example, clopidogrel and rivaroxaban).

How does antibiotic therapy work at treating a bacterial infection? Answer: Antibiotic therapy does not affect the pathonically important bacterial species such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Clostridium difficile, that cause recurrent bacterial infections.

What do the studies show? Answer: A number of studies support the use of penicillin based antibiotics in the treatment of MS as well as other infections.

What is the scientific evidence that penicillin therapy is safe in patients who have relapsing-remitting MS? Answer: Multiple randomized studies have not shown significant reductions in MS relapses or disease activity in subjects who have received penicillin with other drugs. No studies show any benefit in preventing re-infection.

What is the scientific evidence linking streptococcal infection to risk of secondary bacterial and viral infections? Answer: Several studies have been conducted demonstrating an increased risk of secondary bacterial and viral infections in patients who have been treated with penicillin.

What do the studies show? Answer: Penicillin, as either the streptococcal antibiotic or the penicillin-related drug, is used in various clinical settings for multiple sclerosis as an adjuvant treatment. Multiple randomized studies are being done to determine the effects of pen"

For that purpose the benefit of reducing the dosages of antibiotics such as ampicillin, doxycycline, and tetracycline, also with the benefit of reducing the dosages of antibiotics such as ampicillin, doxycycline, and tetracycline.

How effective is the combination with methotrexate for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer? Answer: This combination is useful for the treatment of lung cancer. The benefit of reduction in the dosages of the chemotherapeutic agents such as carboplatin, carboplatin plus cyclophosphamide, carboplatin plus troleandomycin, etc. as well as reducing the dosages of the antibiotics such as ampicillin, doxycycline, and tetracycline is also excellent for the reduction of the risk of an invasive lung cancer.

Can this combination be used to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy for the treatment of malignant glioma? Answer: Yes, with good effect, also with the benefit of improving the efficacy

How efficient is the combination with 2-methylestradiol and methotrexate for the treatment of ovarian cancer? Answer: This combination is useful for the treatment of ovarian cancer. It can decrease the dosage of methotrexate and the need for the use of antibiotics. The effect of the combination also can also be increased significantly by using the combination with methot"
Question: Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery? Answer:," A joint line position assessment of knees of patients undergoing reconstruction is a new approach for joint reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare two approaches to joint line position assessment by means of a joint line method such as the contralateral knee and the knee flexed straight flexion tests: (1) using a joint line method of knee joint position assessment (KLPA) and using the knee flexed straight flexion tests: (2) a joint line method of knee joint position assessment with the knees of the patients in the two tests being compared at each individual joint line location. (i) The main purpose of the paper was to establish the main approach to using a new joint line method as a joint line method for treating patients undergoing knee reconstruction. (ii) For this study, our objective was to determine the effect of the study design on the results of the study results. All the patients with knee reconstruction were patients with severe knee pain and/or surgical deformity diagnosed in the early 1980s; most of them had a traumatic dislocation of the lateral collateral ligament which would have had deleterious effects on the femoral head. This patient demographic could be quite different in the two clinical methods. There are 4 groups or groups of patients in each of these 4 groups: patients who have never had a reconstruction surgery, patients who had a knee reconstruction only 1 or 2 years ago as a subgroup, patients who had reconstructive knee procedures at 4 or 5 years ago as a subgroup and patients who had reconstructive knee procedures at 2 or 3 years ago, as a subgroup. Thus, only the subgroup of patients who underwent reconstructive knee surgery at 2 or 3 years ago (2 patients in the KLPA group and 4 patients in the flexed straight flexion group) were included in the analyses and were compared with the subgroup of patients who underwent reconstructive knee surgery only 1 year ago (3 patients in the KLPA group and 3 patients in the flexed straight flexion group). We considered 2 groups: (1) one group of patients who had never had a reconstruction surgery and (2) another group of patients who had a knee reconstruction only this year (3 patients in the KLPA group and 7 patients in the flexed straight flexion group). The patients were asked before the examination whether they had performed knee replacement surgery in the year before the assessment if it had been done. The patients were asked to perform 1 side of the kneeling examination with an open foot position and to be seated in a knee flexed straight arm position (with the knee in a neutral position): (1) A knee flexed straight flexion test. (2) A knee flexed straight flexion test. (3) A knee flexed straight flexion test. All of the patients were required to perform both tests. The contralateral knee was inserted straight into a thigh area on the same knee and the patient was asked to perform 1 side of the kneeling examination with an open foot position and to be seated in a knee flexed straight arm position (with the knee in a neutral position):ITHER (1) TO SLEEP ON THE RIGHT. (2) TO SLEEP ON THE LEFT. (3) TO SLEEP ON THE RIGHT. (4) TO SLEEP ON THE LEFT. (5) TO SLEEP ON THE RIGHT ON TENSION, AND (6) TO SLEEP ON THE LEFT ON TENSION. The patient was asked to hold their legs against the side to be flexed and to take 5 minutes (10 s) to relax from the movement. From this data the patient was asked to perform 1 side of the kneeling examination with an open foot position to sleep on the right or to sleep on the left. The patient was asked to hold their legs against the side to be flexed from the hip and to perform 2 knee flexion tests, which were 1 side of the kneeling examination with an open foot position to sleep on the right or to sleep on the left. The patient was asked to sleep on the left and perform 1 side of the kneeling examination with an open foot position to sleep on the right. Thus, the 4 groups of patients were compared on the following clinical dimensions: (1) severity of the patients' pain, severity of knee pain before reconstruction. (2) duration of the pain before reconstruction. (3) duration of the pain before reconstruction. (4) duration of the pain before reconstruction. (5) duration of the pain before reconstruction in years. The results were as follows: (1) Patients with no knee pain between 1 and 2 years after reconstruction (2) Patients with knee pain within 2 years of reconstruction (1) Patients with no knee pain within 2 years of reconstruction (2) Patients with knee pain within 5 years of reconstruction (1) Patients with knee pain within 5 years of reconstruction ("
Question: Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement? Answer:," As previously mentioned, the type of tibial component affects mechanical alignment. This is so because the tibial element (tibial plateau) is not anchored within the medial extensor muscles (humerus, ulna, and fibula) as is the case in the extensor tendon to mediolateral knee structures. Consequently, joint forces, such as force on the lower leg or other movement of the knee joint are not transferred to the knee joint. Thus, the ability of the patella to maintain its position in the medial insertion in the knee joint is dependent on balance of these elements. The difference between the left patella in the medial and the right patella in the lateral is that the lateral element may also be called ""patella proximal"" or (or) ""patella metacarpal"". In contrast with the other joint components, the medial tibial tibia elements are not anchored prior to insertion by the insertion of the patellar tendon. This allows the patella to move laterally relative to the tibia. (I apologize for the confusion about the difference) The patella is a patella proximal in the medial and the patella metacarpal in the lateral. This asymmetry relates to the role of the patella in the normal rotation of the knee joint and also plays a role in the path of force transfer between the femur and tibia. The patella is primarily used to rotate the knee joint, whereas the tibia is only used for contact at the hip. This difference in the forces involved may be the basis of the observed and unexplained effects of patellar pathology. It was demonstrated previously by the authors that a patella length of <2,500 mm does not reduce force or function of the patella when compared to a patellar length of 3-4,000 mm. Thus, the patella is not used to contact the femur and neither was any significant increase in patellar pressure observed in these patellar lengths (and thus, there is no significant difference in patellar pressure between the medial and lateral patella structures). The authors report that these measurements might contribute less force to the joint when the patella is small (i.e., <2,500 mm) than when the patella is 3,000 mm or larger.

Q Generic question: I would like to know what is a normal patellar length for a 15 year old male and for a 15 year old female? Answer: This is an important test. If the average female is 6'3"", the average male would need to be between 6'1"" and 6'2"". If the average male is 6'0"", what is the average male and female mean of patellar length?

Q Generic patient question: What is the average patellar length of the left knee? If I measure my own, I measure 11-12.5cm (4"".12""). Do you know any estimates of the normality of this value? I am on a very low dose of NSAIDS and am concerned about my knee. If I go back to the doctor, can you give me an estimate as to how low I can put on my doses and what to do when I do? Thanks! Answer: Patellar length is a variable; it varies inversely with age, type of knee (isosteitis; acute; chronic), pain, and muscle tension (the most commonly examined group of joint laxity). The Patellar Tendon and its attachment to the femoral head has various characteristics, including varying lengths of its patellar facets, the strength and stiffness of its attachment to the femoral head, the extent of bone conduction to the patellar head on the lateral side, and the degree of bone stiffness on the anterolateral side. The patellar tendon is the largest abolished ligament of the knee because it is anchored to the femur, and it is the only joint in the body (excluding the ankle) that crosses the entire length of the femur (from the end of the tibia to the tip of the tarsus). It is the only area within the knee where the extensor forces and flexion forces cannot be transferred from the tibial and tibial plateau. There are 3 types of patellar tendon in the knee: the inter-femoral, the interosseous, and the intrapatellar. All 3 forms of patellar tendon are anchored to the femoral head. The intrapatellar tendon is the only tendon that crosses the full length of the femur and is the only type of tendon that has no influence on knee joint motion other than the length of its patellar facet. Intrapatellar tendon has the characteristics of having an"
Question: Is tumour expression of VEGF associated with venous invasion and survival in pT3 renal cell carcinoma? Answer:, There are no data to support the existence of a tumour-invasive effect of fibrosis.
Question: Injury and poisoning mortality among young men--are there any common factors amenable to prevention? Answer:," Overall survival is low for men with injuries and poisoning. This study is limited by the inclusion of young children under the age of 8 years from the same time period. The health care provider-diagnosed death rate was 9.6% (range: 0, 32 to 32.0%). Most of the deaths in the pooled analyses were caused by respiratory and circulatory complications by other means (e.g., drowning or hypothermia). Therefore, the specific cause of death was not taken into account. The age-specific death rate of 2.1% for male and 0.8% for female (ages <16) indicates that the mortality of young men is similar to that of young women. In addition, the risk for injury may be higher in children and the risk for poisoning may be more severe in children and younger children. However, as with all young population groups, the most serious health problems, including the most frequent causes of death, are not always found in this age group. A further limitation of the study is Travis et al. (1987b), which reported an increase of 21% during the study in the prevalence of poisoning and injury. They report this increase as most likely a response to a decrease observed after publication of this study in the New England Journal of Medicine (see section on Pneumonia). There were no deaths registered in this study, although these were likely underreported since the number of poisoning cases was <1/1000. Finally, there have been no major changes in the mortality experience of men during this time period. It remains important to identify trends in mortality rates."
Question: Continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration: opportunity for rescue? Answer:," A long term follow-up study based on the Swedish multicenter maternity case-control study [16].

Study design: cross-sectional case-control study.

Setting/subjects: Stockholm (Sweden).

Participants: 1537 women were admitted for an emergency caesarean, after delivery or at the follow-up visit two years after antenatal corticosteroid administration.

Main outcome measures: The main outcome was the rate of stillbirth and other related neonatal defects.

Results: Women with antenatal corticosteroid administration have a significantly lower rate of stillbirth and other neonatal defects during follow-up than women without antenatal corticosteroid administration. Additionally, in a subgroup of women with antenatal corticosteroid administration, the rate of stillbirth was lower than the rate of other neonatal defects. Women without antenatal corticosteroid administration had higher stillbirth and other neonatal defects than women with antenatal corticosteroid administration. After controlling for pre- and post-natal characteristics, a higher number of cesarean deliveries did not have any statistically significant effect on the rate of stillbirth or neonatal defects.

Conclusion: The data from this study show that, contrary to previous reports, pregnancy can last only a limited period of time even after long term exposure to corticosteroids with an increasing risk of stillbirth and neonatal defects.

Question: Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects? Answer:," Obesity or OSA severity is a critical consideration. It is well established that higher OSA severity correlates with poor sleep and a higher incidence of night sleep apnea. Although CPAP machines have improved quality, it is important to consider whether they are able to treat OSA in extremely obese subjects. The first randomized study of a modified hyperbaric oxygen chamber was performed in a cohort of obese subjects and the results were a significant improvement in sleep quality and quality of life in these individuals over a six-month follow up.36 In our group, obesity is a factor in the development of severe OSA. Although some obese patients with OSAicolor have lost weight through gastric bypass treatment, there is no evidence that these patients are able to maintain weight loss through other means, including surgical means. Furthermore, an early study found that obese patients with moderate to severe OSA are unlikely to lose weight through bariatric surgery.37 Therefore, there is a need for a longer-term follow up. Recently, the treatment of severe OSA was suggested for patients with severe obesity.38 However, such patients require more specific guidelines regarding the type of treatment and the duration of treatment. Therefore, treatment of obesity is often done based on general recommendations that include restriction of food intake, restriction of activity and modification of lifestyle to the extent that it is possible. These general recommendations for management of morbid obesity are based on the evidence on the effects of diet and physical activity on sleep, which are related to cardiovascular risk,38 and on the effects of weight reduction.38 Therefore, if we are to make an assessment of the clinical relevance of these methods, and to support their use on obese patients, we can do so based on the effects seen based on these specific methods on sleep, with consideration of the fact that the obesity/OSA relationship seems to be a complex one. Moreover, these methods do not necessarily translate into improved patient outcomes. Indeed, in our view this approach to clinical obesity appears to be more suitable for individuals requiring obesity/OSA specific therapies in the general population.

Question 3: Does obesity or OSA worsen nighttime consciousness in severely obese diabetics using the non-hypnotic and non-nasal CPAP units, or other methods for improving sleep in the short-term? Answer: We do not know. In the large randomized study in the Diabetes Care Group, there was a significant difference in CPAP efficacy between the two patients with sleep apnea and other patients, but there was no difference in CPAP efficacy on a subgroup analysis of other parameters.40 In the current study, we had a more comprehensive analysis with the subanalysis of the data from both studies. We did not detect any difference in CPAP effectiveness between patients with severe OSA and those with severe O Morocco, but there was an advantage on CPAP of patients with very severe OSA. However, in the larger RCT in the diabetes Care Group, there was no significant difference in the CPAP results between the two patients with severe OSA and those with severe O Morocco.41 As with most trials on this topic, it is important to bear in mind that there are many different clinical presentations of OSA and that the effects of treatment with CPAP on sleep are much more likely to be assessed in individuals with OSA than in those without OSA. It has also been shown that the type of treatment used in these studies affects the degree of improvement in sleep that has been reported in the long-term follow up.42 The difference in type of treatment is of considerable importance. The study in the Diabetes Care Group was mostly a randomised controlled trial and it had a very high response rate, with a success rate of 88% compared to the 80% or more rate in our analysis based on the subanalysis of the original data. The RCT in the diabetes Care Group did not have a similar response rate. Most of the patients in the two RCTs have been followed up for several years and are aged 55-71 years. Moreover, they have an average BMI of 22 kg/m2. As for the short term outcomes, there is no evidence of a longer term benefit. There Zurich Sleep Study is of particular interest, as the results are very similar regarding the response rate, the treatment of sleep apnea, the response of the CPAP. It is an effective treatment, as indicated by significant short term clinical benefits. However, the very low response rate is of great concern because it is well known that the use of short term solutions is not appropriate for patients with OSA.43

Question 4: In a recent large study including patients with OSA, did the use of CPAP provide any improvement in daytime dysfunction compared with conventional therapy as measured by the Global Assessment of Sleep (GOAS) question? Answer: Our results are in line with several large randomised controlled trials in recent years in which the type of treatment used in the"
Question: Does the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth predict risk in a subsequent pregnancy? Answer:," Yes. Previous gestational birth after 23 weeks has been associated with greater perinatal mortality in the first pregnancy, even after adjustments were made for prior obstetric and perinatal history such as gestational age, gestational weight, and duration of gestation.7 However, additional factors, such as maternal characteristics and other medical conditions, may be associated with preterm birth (see also Question #13)

Question: Has screening/preventive care improved the risk for preterm pregnancy in women during a second pregnancy? Answer: Since 1990, there have been 3 randomized controlled trials using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy alone or in combination with other approaches to preterm delivery.4, 14–17 In these trials, rates of preterm birth were decreased by 33% from those before treatment, with no serious adverse effects. Most trials included pregnant women with birth weight of 10,000–19,999 g; 14 studies included women of average gestation from 20 weeks to 26 weeks, whereas 12 studies included women of <20 g (mean gestational age 17 weeks 3.8 [1.6–24.4] months).8, 17–18 The pooled absolute risk reduction (95% confidence interval (CI) of 22%–44%) among women who received the combined SSRI and placebo arm compared with the comparison arm was similar to other studies of short duration.17–18 However, the relative risks associated with the combined SSRI and placebo components were significantly higher for the second pregnancy (7.8 (CI: 2.7–15.4) compared with 5.6 (CI:.2–25.3) for first pregnancy) and higher for preterm birth in women who took the combined SSRI and the tricyclic antidepressants compared with both tricyclic antidepressants (3.0 (CI: 1.4–6.4) compared with 2.1 (CI:.1–5.1) for placebo).7, 15, 17, 19 Additional studies have been conducted, with more than 1000 women in the randomized trials, and other studies have been published after the results of these trials were published.4, 14–17, 19-21 In the randomized trial of combination therapy, the SSRI had a smaller absolute relative risk reduction than in earlier trials. The overall risk reduction (95% CI) was similar in all 3 trials.24 Although the reduction in the absolute odds ratio among women taking combination drugs was comparable to those in earlier trials, a subgroup analysis demonstrated that only women who took SSRIs prior to birth had a lower risk for preterm birth.11 This subgroup analysis suggested that SSRI use in the second pregnancy might have a protective effect for subsequent pregnancies. In addition, studies of short duration have suggested that combining SSRIs with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in pregnant women with preterm birth has the potential to reduce preeclampsia,27 premature birth, and neonatal death.25 Thus, SSRI use may have similar or greater benefits than SSRIs alone in the prevention of preterm delivery among women taking gestational age ≥20 weeks.

Question: Is it safe to combine SSRIs with tricyclic antidepressants? Answer: Although one randomized controlled trial of SSRIs and tricyclics compared two groups of women, it was not feasible to compare the risk of spontaneous abortion and subsequent perinatal death among both groups.18 Studies in pregnant women with preterm births using either antidepressant medication at 20 weeks or later have shown that SSRIs and tricyclics have similar risk reductions compared with prophylactic antiplatelet therapy.premature premature,25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 In a trial of 891 pregnant women, the combined SSRI with lithium with low-dose ezetimibe and tricyclic antidepressants resulted in a reduction in perinatal mortality from 5.7%, compared with 2.1% in the placebo group.22 The trial randomized women with high severity of preeclampsia (≥6.5) to either treatment or placebo, with one-half receiving ezetimibe and placebo. When compared to placebo, 1,742 of 2,738 participants in the combined group (3.9%) received medication at 20 weeks or later. The rate of perinatal mortality was lower in the combined group (1.8% versus 5.5%; P<.001).22

Question: Are tricyclics and SSRIs the same antidepressant? Answer: The combined drug treatment arm of 2 smaller trials revealed inconsistent results regarding the risk of perinatal mortality.22 In a trial of 687 women who were ≥20 weeks in gestation, an increase in the SSRI/TC combination for women having 1 prior preterm birth was shown to reduce spontaneous abortion (P<.001), but no benefit was"

Question: Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling? Answer:," Aripiprazole may increase the risk for pathological gambling in a number of ways. These include, but are not limited to: • a lack of cognitive performance; • poor concentration (""fluid intelligence""). • problems with memory and reasoning; • changes in behavior in gambling behavior; and • problems with sleep (sleep disturbances, loss of motor coordination and decreased awareness). • If you develop a new psychotic trait, there is a decreased likelihood of developing a pathological gambling disorder. Bipolar Disorder and Risk for Progamming: The risk of developing pathological gamblers is a risk factor for bipolar disorder. In bipolar disorder, a person may also experience a change in mood, which may have a depressive, manic or other mood-altering impact. As a person with bipolar disorder progresses toward mania, they may then find that their ""normal"" behavior may no longer be appropriate. This may mean that they become more inclined to continue the gambling activity into their manic and hypomanic states. This is referred to as ""progamming"", and may then develop into pathological gambling or a new gambling addiction. Progamming may have several different causes. They may often respond to the same medication, such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, or anti-anxiety medications. Progamming is an ""outlier"" phenomenon that does not result from any single factor. It can occur independently of the individual person's current medical history. Some symptoms of progamming may include: • Excessive gambling behavior; • Difficulty with time management; Ottomans do not fall into this category. • The ability to control emotions and behaviors; Progamming may also be associated with: • Disinhibition (fear of failure); • Sensitivity to negative emotions; • Antipsychotic or cognitive interventions to reduce fear or reduce anxiety; • The development of a substance use disorder; and • The onset and perpetuation of recurrent psychiatric episodes. Progamming may also be associated with the following mental health conditions: • Anxiety disorders, including anxiety and panic disorder. • Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or oppositional defiant disorder. • Depression or manic depression. • Eating disorders, e.g., anorexia nervosa. • Uncontrolled substance abuse. Progamming can also develop from various types of psychological symptoms. A person may have: • A ""stuck"" feeling toward money; • A desire to control others; • Anxiety and/or stress; • Feelings of guilt for not being socially connected; and • The belief that he has a lack of control over events. • It is believed that some of these mental health conditions interact in some way with the development of progamming and may be related. Progamming and Mania/Hypomania: There are a number of psychological conditions that may cause a person to indulge in Progamming. These include: • A history of depression; • A history of bipolar disorder; • A history of schizophrenia; • Anorexia nervosa; • A history of OCD; • An increased tolerance for alcohol; and • An increased belief in his ability to ""get people to do what he wants."" Many people with a history of mental illness may engage in Progamming because of a fear of having symptoms again. This fear can cause a person to become more cautious and avoid situations that may lead to further psychological problems, such as gambling. The more proscaming a person is used to, the more a person will tend to become dependent and reliant on a particular person or company. A person with a history of bipolar disorder might engage in Progamming, believing this person will eventually ""get them to do what he wants"". It is very important for a person with Progamming to consult with a psychiatrist and obtain help in coping with their symptoms and their anxiety and stress. This treatment involves addressing and adjusting symptoms such as: • Depression, mania and psychosis; • Anxiety, such as panic attacks; and • Stress, such as from being rejected, bullied or emotionally isolated. Some patients may get help with these symptoms, while others need to work on addressing their feelings and thoughts of hopelessness about things in life. Some people may require medication and/or other treatment for their proactivity, including psychiatric medications, which can cause side effects and may contribute to the problem. Psychopathy and Progamming: Progamming can occur when a person lacks empathy, in that they do not show much concern or empathy toward the negative consequences of their actions, but care only for themselves, or ""winning"". This condition is a serious factor in the development of Progamming and related pathological gambling behavior, the development of other problems in life, and the development of a new pathological gambling addiction. Progamming and other Behavioral and Brain Disorders : A person with a history of proactivity and/or pathological gambling behavior or other mental health disorders, can develop this addiction disorder. Proactivity or pathological"
Question: Immune suppression by lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine on T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens: does synergy exist? Answer:," This is currently being studied in humans and will be a very long-term study. Therefore, in the short term, one cannot suggest that lysosomotropic amines increase immunosuppression by major and minor histocompatibility antigens. However, in the long-term, we will need to assess the possibility of synergy. It is still not clear when this will be done and this would have important health implications, as immunosuppression is commonly seen with influenza and other infections. A short-term study with animals was not able to determine whether lysosomotropic amines enhance the ability of the immune system to suppress T-cell responses to T-cell antigens. However, in general, a few experimental studies have shown that immunosuppression by histocompatibility antigens is increased after lysosomotropic amine administration but not with other antigens. See, for example, Pater and Diamantini 1982, who demonstrate that lysosomotropic amines increase the ability of the immune system to suppress the responses of macrophages in vitro. However, as described above, this cannot be generalised to systemic exposure. The findings of Ritchie and collaborators (2001) with mice suggest that lysosomotropic amines enhance the ability of the immune system to suppress T-cell responses in the systemic lymph node, but this cannot be generalised to all experimental conditions and is, therefore, too speculative. The presence of immunosuppression will depend on where (to whom and when) T-cell immunity is present and whether the T-cell is naive or the T-cell becomes the target of an antibody. LYSOSOMETHY AND THE T-CRISPR ACTIVITY IN INFECTION In some infected humans, immunity may be maintained by the T-cell receptor-mediated degradation of T-cells, and therefore infection can be maintained. T-cells therefore remain dormant during the early phase of immune response, whereas they are active and potentially infectious in latent immunity that will be acquired during an infection. This has been described in humans, although what constitutes the early or latent phase of immune response has not been clarified. The question was therefore posed, could immunological effects associated with lysosomotropic amines result in a prolonged and heightened risk of immunity failure in the absence of infection? We carried out a study comparing the effects of acute and chronic treatment with lysosomotropic amines on T-cell immunity in the small intestine of healthy volunteers. The effects of chronic lysosomotropic amines on T-cell responses were examined in a single-dose (0.75 μg/kg intraperitoneally) and multiple-dose ( rudimentary ) model. We first evaluated the effect of lysosomotropic amines on T-cell activity in vivo. In the rudimentary model, the T-cell response was assessed with immunohistochemical staining. Following acute treatment with lysosomotropic amines, the number of T cells was quantified. Interestingly, for all doses of lysosomotropic amines, the fraction of T cells that reached the epithelial and mesodermic tissue was considerably higher, reaching as high as 89.5% for the rudimentary 2-dose model. This is higher than the response of healthy volunteers, which is between 80 to 90%. It is possible that these higher levels of T-cell activity result from the higher amounts of metabolites generated in the gastrointestinal tract by the T cells. It is also possible that the higher response is due to tolerance of lysosomotropic phenylalanine derivatives in the gut as lysosomotropic amine treatment reduces the mucosal permeability (Garcia 1999). Interestingly, for the complexed model, a significantly lower percentage of T cells in the basal layer reached epithelial tissue compared with that in the initial mucosal layer of the gut (mean difference 25 %). This is also in the basal layer, the epithelial layer involved in the innate immune response, although it reaches the epithelial epithelium as early as 2- to 3-h post-treatment (Piedrahita et al. 2000). The basal layer is not involved in the innate immune response to other bacteria and therefore lacks the high concentrations of lysosomotropic amines in the basal layer that result in tolerance. It is difficult to determine whether it is tolerance to other substances, rather than to lysosomal metabolites (such as l-tryptophan) that promotes tolerance to lysosomotropic amines. In the context of immunological response, tolerance is a consequence of a reduction in a substance, rather than the specific amount being reduced. In addition, lysosomal metabolites produced in other tissues such as the intestines,"
Question: Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma? Answer:," Yes, it is a well-recognized option. There has been a rise in reports of adverse events following this cancer treatment, particularly when the chemotherapy is given in combination with radiotherapy and mucosal irradiation, both of which are generally believed to be associated with an increasing frequency of death. However, the number of reports continues to rise. In a randomized trials of 8 chemotherapy centers, only one published report was found, and it could not be replicated [6]. Several of the cases reviewed in this article were linked to the chemotherapy program administered at the cancer center. Most of the cases also were reported in the media. The number of patients with adverse events after treatment is not a good indicator of the safety of a chemotherapy program. For example, the majority of the cases mentioned in this report involved patient complaints related to treatment that were linked to the chemotherapy program, rather than the cancer itself [6]. There is considerable uncertainty about whether the reported clinical trials were blinded for the data used in the design and interpretation of the data. For example, there was an inadequate number of patients enrolled in clinical trials for this study, and data was not collected for the trial participants. In general, the incidence of problems related to a specific chemotherapy program is not known for all patients, but it may be higher in some patients with malignant cancers. In the largest clinical data set for nasopharyngeal cancer, patients receiving radiotherapy were more likely to experience problems related to induction chemotherapy compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone [1].

Clinical Implications for Patient Safety for Treatment with Radiation Therapy Several complications associated with radiation therapy include pneumonitis and anoxia, and an elevated risk for stroke. However, there is no clear evidence that those complications are greater in radiation-caused nasopharyngeal cancer, because many of the cases and their associated adverse effects have not been reported on clinical trials. Given the fact that many cases of radiation-triggered nasopharyngeal cancer are reported in the media, it is important to report a potential source of adverse effects, such as cancer, to ensure that appropriate treatment and follow-up are provided [7]. On the other hand, several cases reported after radiation have been linked to a chemotherapy program. For example, a nasopharyngeal cancer patient who died following radiotherapy [7] had extensive cancer on the lung that had been treated successfully with radiation therapy. The patient had been on a chemotherapy program with radiopharmaceuticals. On presentation at the hospital following his death, an autopsy on his thorax revealed a large tumor in the left side of his chest. An immunohistochemical study performed on a biopsy sample revealed increased lymphocytes and leukemia in patients treated with radiation. The patient's relatives had reported that cancer caused by radiation is uncommon in people who had been treated with radiopharmaceuticals [8]. This fact suggests that further studies are necessary to determine if cancer-caused by radiation or radiation treatment will occur in patients receiving the types of chemotherapy and/or radiopharmaceuticals that are recommended in the cancer programs.

CONCLUSIONS Nasopharyngeal cancer is a rare disease in the United States and a significant one in certain European countries, resulting from tumors on the lung caused by sarcoma, a cell type known to have undergone rapid cell division [1] or from malignancies of the lymph nodes, which are located at the back of the throat [9]. Cancer of this type can present in any part of the body. In addition to the common lymph node and sarcoma findings, tumors in the neck, abdomen, lymph glands, and stomach also can present in the United States [1]. The diagnosis is made with biopsies to be confirmed by radiography, which is the standard of care for all patients with any type of cancer [2]. In nasopharyngeal cancer, the main clinical symptom, at least until recently, was acute coughing, often accompanied by difficulty in swallowing. Because lung metastases are common in patients with the disease, an increase in cough was considered an indicator of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body. Although it is possible that this finding was erroneous, the association cannot be denied that patients who had such symptoms could have been diagnosed with cancer [1]. It may have been helpful to screen those patients who had these symptoms and who needed additional counseling or even a surgical resection. In cases of nasopharyngeal cancer, diagnostic radiography for both the tumor and its metastases will be considered in order to ensure the correct diagnosis. In some cases, the cancer may have spread to the brain, and thus may have raised the risk for a stroke with the cancerous progression. As with other non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other non-neoplastic CNS cancers, the incidence of neurologic deficits and other neurological problems is relatively high [10]. In many cases of nonspecific cancers"
Question: Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more? Answer:," A recent literature survey of 26,879 cases was conducted in which 2414 reported that it was more difficult to remove hydrocele from the testicle and a similar number reported not trying to remove it at all. In this large study, the prevalence of complications was 32% (943) and was more prevalent in the upper limb than the lower limb, but neither the upper nor the lower limb had the frequency of the other condition. Patients whose lower limbs were not treated had more complications than those who underwent removal. A similar study on the effect of removing testicular hydrocele from the lower extremity also showed that the problem is worse in the lower extremity. It should be noted that only 13% of the population with hydrocele and 25% of our patients had a lower extremity testicular torsion. Answer: On the other hand, about 38.7% patients had a lower extremity torsion. The lower extremity torsion, however, is most likely related to torsion of the urethra as well, whereas the hydrocele causes more pain in the lower extremity than if it were removed (36).

Question: Is pain associated with the removal of the prostatectomy? Answer: Pain with the removal of the prostate is rarely the cause, but is a consequence of removing testicular tissue for aesthetic purpose and not a true effect of the surgery. Answer: Pain usually goes away in 2 to 4 weeks.

Question: When patients are discharged from their hospital without the help of a physical examination will they have severe pain or will there be no pain for 2 weeks? Answer: During this second phase, the quality of life in patients is generally good although still, more patients will be concerned with discomfort than pain (37).

Question: Why does the surgeon use a suture in the male to testicle at the distal end of its length rather than just a tourniquet? Answer: The suture is more stable and does not allow a bleeding to occur at the distal end. The two types of tourniquets used at the distal end of the testicle correspond to the female (binder) and the male (tourniquet). Answer: It appears that this is due to the difference in anatomical size between testicular and vagina. The suture is also more stable for the removal of cyst, although the surgical technique is the same.

Question: Why does a surgery to remove the prostate only heal if there is severe inflammation of the gland? Answer: This is because a large inflammatory infiltrate is produced during the preformed surgery. Some of the cells are shed during the second phase of healing, but the remainder is retained within the gland.

Question: If a patient receives a surgery at the distal end of the testicle and the patient has difficulty to remove it, how does the patient get it to the bedside of the surgeon after the removal of these lymph nodes? Answer: It is the surgeon who does the removal of the lymph nodes.

Question: Can it be an indication for performing an amniolectomy/amniocentesis in the male testis? Answer: Yes. The amniocentesis may be performed either prior to the surgical procedure or during the removal of the kidney. It is done by a urologist in a surgical facility which is not a large hospital. In this case, patients may receive the amniolectomy before the operation at the distal end of the testicle or after one to 3 weeks after the operation at the distal end of the test, depending on the pathology and the treatment. In the first case, it is a more complicated and expensive procedure to insert and remove a tube from the urethra directly into the amnioectum than through the skin. It is an expensive procedure for the surgeon and should be followed by a careful discussion between the surgeon and a board-certified urologist of the hospital in which the procedure is performed. After the amniolectomy and amniocentesis, the physician should consult a urologist of their choice and also the chief operating department of the hospital in which the procedure was performed to see if the procedure is applicable for their organization. Answer: This surgery is not effective. At best, it may be considered as a last resort operation and a final step in the case of a testicular tumor. It is not recommended to remove or perform the amniocentesis."
"Question: Are normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians accurate and reliable at making street crossing decisions? Answer:"," Not generally. It is difficult for visually impaired pedestrians to accurately judge the distance and spacing between objects, and visually impaired pedestrians often make the mistake of crossing an object ahead of the pedestrian in front of them and then back a few yards to the sides. If you walk along a busy street and are not too busy to avoid objects and pedestrians. You may be surprised to see both the person in front of you and their dog at the next curb or intersection where you crossed into that intersection. There are some instances of pedestrians with visual impairment that might make this type of decision, but it's rare. For the most part, sighted and visually impaired pedestrians should be used to making the crossing decisions. The only exceptions to this rule are with pedestrian control devices, and those that are physically different from a common pedestrian use. The problem with pedestrian control is that the driver can't see the pedestrians as there is no blind spot. Also, it takes more time to control a pedestrian's walking pace and when you are walking behind a pedestrian with a stop sign or other pedestrian control device that has a turn arrow, there are few places to walk. So, if you cannot see the pedestrian clearly to accurately cross it will put the driver at a disadvantage when making his or her determination of how long you will wait for the pedestrian to cross. I know that the driver that takes my left turn in my parking lot is not very good in these situations, but my only real complaint would be that the cars that did give her a stop sign, it could not see her coming in the way.

What about people with hearing impairments or other impairments that make it difficult for them to hear pedestrians?

Answer: Most blind and visually impaired people have difficulties at intersections because they use their peripheral vision to judge distances between objects. Unfortunately for them, they are often not aware of this and therefore make mistakes in crossing distances. In the examples below, you'll see a blind pedestrian and a hearing impaired pedestrian. The Hearing impaired pedestrian will have a problem determining distance more quickly than the blind pedestrian. When looking at the map for your area, please check the map with and without the pedestrian crossings and cross them in the same order you would cross a street as there is a lot of overlap in the visual and hearing fields. In this example in Manhattan's Lower East Side, the hearing impaired pedestrian will see the stop sign and the intersection right before the blind pedestrian does and will be able to see his or her surroundings a bit better than the blind pedestrian that does not see the intersection right before him or her.

Do pedestrian crosswalks change when there is a pedestrian control device?

Question: Do most pedestrian crossings change when there is a pedestrian control device installed? Answer: Some pedestrian crossings do change. If you park in a pedestrian crossing and cross at about 80 yards with traffic then you will still cross with the traffic at 80 yards. The reason for this is that, unlike for a street crossing, you will not lose time if you cross with the traffic before you, as it is less likely you will pass cars going the other way as the pedestrian walk right. However, with pedestrian control devices, you will likely have to cross at much larger distances, meaning that the pedestrians will unchanged. If you would like to know more, look for your local City's website or local police department's website to see what their policy is for pedestrian crossing locations for your area. Additionally, if you want to take action about an area, we recommend using our online form so we can get your input and you can start to plan how you can make your area more welcoming for people with disabilities.

Other questions

I sometimes hear people complain that they can't see the crosswalk or they feel uncomfortable making the crossing decision. Are there things they can do to make the crossing experience easier?

Answer: These problems are not related to the use of pedestrian controls: they are the result of the use of pedestrian controls that were not designed for pedestrians. For example, some sidewalk crosswalks do not have an arrow, others have crosswalks that have a single cross. As many of you know, most crosswalks in the city are two-way (both directions) and the traffic signals are on both sides of the roadway. As a result there is not really any way for pedestrians to travel around the crosswalk except to cross at the crosswalk itself. If two cars parked side by side near the crosswalk both stop USL, then they will not cross. When you hear this happen, think of it as cars stopping at the crosswalk if they are being driven at excessive speed by someone with their head out the windshield. You can ask your local State Highway Patrol to look at pedestrian crossings and see what they do and make recommendations and what the appropriate pedestrian control devices should look like. There are usually no additional vehicles parked in front of the crosswalk; it's usually an unmarked"

Question: Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus? Answer:," Yes, it definitely improves tinnitus.

Answer: No, the mechanism by which physical therapy works is not yet understood. In fact, we don't think there is a mechanism, but rather that physical therapy directly affects the nerve circuits that cause and transmit tinnitus. Physiotherapy for tinnitus is an active and dynamic process that does not work in isolation. It does not work by themselves and might even have to be continued after a given surgery. Physical therapy should be repeated if not adequately satisfied.

The authors further suggest this practice could be used to treat tinnitus when other treatments are unsuccessful, particularly hearing aids, which frequently aggravate hearing loss. To date, multiple sclerosis has been one of the most-treated diseases for hearing loss. The study authors argue against surgical suppression because the primary goal of these interventions is not to correct the underlying causes of tinnitus but to improve quality of life.

When I first read this article, I thought it was just the latest in a long line of claims that ""audible sounds"" are nothing more than sounds which could be explained away with a good ""mental filter"", especially since I was so often able to ""see"" the ""noise"" (which in reality is nothing more than noise) when I heard sounds that seemed too loud (this was before it was believed that loudness matters so much) and then dismiss it as the noise of an ""all-consuming"" background hum that I somehow simply didn't want to hear. When I finally learned a little more about this subject (a blog post was written onda this topic in 2010 – read it at: I recently read this article where the author (John H. Taylor, MD) made the claims that:

The only thing that can actually be heard with good hearing implants is noise

That noise is an ""all consuming"" background hum that one simply doesn't want to hear

The more you suppress the noise, the more it actually gets louder (at least when combined with the fact that hearing loss is a very noisy phenomenon).

Now, I don't necessarily dismiss or Matters (especially when it is so easy to ignore) and the above statements are just my thoughts of my own. If only we did have more scientific (and scientific backed) research on this topic, we would probably not have so many people complaining about everything that seems to bother them about ""the noise"" in everyday life that they do not want to hear.

That said, it is hard to see how this information would make much difference (especially with the majority of the population being at least partially sensitive or even completely affected by tinnitus) compared to our current hearing loss remedies that would just be ""an ineffective remedy that we don't really want to have."" It is important to note however that all this information is merely speculation and there is always some possibility that it is not completely correct or relevant.

I do however believe that the authors should be commended for making the ""big claim"" that this technology ""works"" and not give up their hope that this could be used as a cure to tinnitus once again. Although many people can use this technology as a ""treatment,"" there are currently many people (including myself) that suffer from tinnitus that don't think the solution is to stop ""the noise"" or try to filter it out (unless you want to do both!). For those of us that don't think so, I encourage both of us to consider how our body responds to something ""sounding"" like that but don't feel like we ""need to"" shut the curtains. With this in mind, let's look at what we may find this technology actually does for tinnitus.

What Does this Technology Do With Tinnitus?

If that last question still seemed too difficult, please note that at the time of writing this article the researchers who conducted this study still haven't released their results to the public. However, we do know what the current results will tell us:

The participants were asked to wear a hearing aid throughout their trial.

Most of the participants either didn't have any hearing loss at all, or very little.

The researchers used an all-in-one device (as opposed to an ""in-ear"" speaker system) that is also known for its accuracy.

We can safely assume that the researchers made the decision to use an all-in-one device in this study based on research which has revealed that it does at least some of the ""hearing aid"" tasks very well (even if it doesn't seem to do it completely automatically, as it used an A/B system).

The only issue with the study will be that of the participants that were not ""hearing-aid"" sensitive or even if they actually responded well to the device. The participants"
Question: Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory? Answer:," Our study is the first to examine the association between asthmaticism (as measured by the sputum biomarker POCSAGE-R) and systemic inflammation (as assessed by the cytokine profile LPS-6), in a naturalistic case-control study. The study included 16 asthma patients (age: 31.0±3.6 years; age: 49.5±8.0 years) and 12 controls (age: 18.4±3.1 years; age: 39.6±7.8 years). Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test (p<0.05). In all cases, sputum analysis revealed an association with inflammation but it was significant at p<0.05. At p<0.05, statistically significant effects for inflammation or sputum analysis were observed for asthmatic (p<0.05): p<0.02 for LPS-6 and p<0.005 for P. acnes in asthmatics compared to controls. The two groups also differed significantly (p<0.05). These findings suggest that asthmatics (as measured by POCSAGE-R) may well be non-inflammatory but are still exposed to the pathogenic microbiota and omics. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
Question: Is HIV/STD control in Jamaica making a difference? Answer:," It is not working. There is no evidence that anyone has been cured of HIV infection in Jamaica. The Ministry may be looking to move towards greater numbers of people living with the AIDS virus, but this has not happened and many of those who have come out of the quarantine, have not been treated. They are still infected and need their HIV testing. The result is that most of the infected have died prematurely and those that have become pregnant cannot safely give their babies the HIV tested virus! Answer: Many new immigrants to Jamaica have been born HIV-positive. As a result of their parent's HIV status, these children are given the same testing procedures as all other HIV positive children. There has not been a cure or cure inhibitor for HIV infection in Jamaica for over 70 years, although the government has now started testing new immigrants and pregnant women. The test is not 100% accurate as people with a negative reading still carry the virus in the cells in their blood, so as long as the virus is being actively circulated, there is some possibility that you may be infected. The main question is whether there are any cures for HIV infection in Jamaica today. This is not an accurate, statistical or accurate statement or answer. The government is no doubt hoping that they may increase the percentage of people living with HIV in the country to help control the number of deaths from the virus. The best cure for HIV and AIDS today is to avoid carrying the virus in your body. This is the main goal of the virus and it is certainly true that there has been some success in this field in Jamaica. But this is no less true for the country that treats such as well as any country in the world. In the meantime, a cure for HIV/AIDS would certainly be appreciated and the Jamaica government certainly needs to be doing more. The reason is that the spread of the virus has actually been increasing faster than a cure. The government does not have the control that it ought to have, which means that the number of infected people cannot be controlled. It should be noted that the spread of the virus is not just an AIDS thing. In fact, a study has showed that HIV-infected people often spread more deadly AIDS to other people. So, what is going on with the situation? The answer is that the virus does not follow any particular diet and cannot easily be controlled and if allowed to continue to spread, it could have devastating effects. For instance, studies have shown that the virus could be spreading from person to person by way that would allow for sexual contact and spread AIDS. Studies have shown that the virus can enter a host's bloodstream from the air, food or water, but the vast majority of the virus lives in the body only after being moved from one place to another. HIV is a simple virus that is transmitted to other people through the air or through a sexual act. If the entire virus was transported and spread, then what would that accomplish? This is not true either. The virus itself lives only after it gets there and will never pass back to the body. What is actually happening in Jamaica is that the vast majority of the virus is being moved from person to person and no one knows where it is actually living until it is detected. The virus is also being carried by people who are not having any sexual contact with one another, to an extent, and then transmitted to the person in the other partner. So, the virus cannot be fully controlled in Jamaica. Even if the government could control the virus in Jamaica, the spread would go on because that is all that can be done. The key is that the government cannot control everyone that is on HIV. However, as the virus spreads, the amount of virus that will be able to be moved from person to person will not increase. On the contrary, it will be diminishing because there are other people living with the virus and because the virus will not be as readily being transmitted from one person to those who have had no sexual contact with one another. The best way to limit the number of people that can be infected in Jamaica is to not allow any sexual activity for a period of time which may include both sexual and non-sexual use. We do not have any control over HIV transmission, but we do have control over how many people we have infected. The fact is that the amount of person that is infected with HIV may not be quite enough to make a difference. As a result, there will be an increase in transmission or even in cases where both partners transmit the virus, however, the increase will be minimal. The biggest influence that it will have is probably the increase of the number of people who would have been infected with HIV before now as a result of the infection and the increase in the number of Sardinia disease cases. Because of the increase of infections, the number of people that would have been uninfected and the number who would have died from AIDS as a result, would have been far better than if the government could have had a more effective way to control the virus"
Question: Is Panton-Valentine leucocidin associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK? Answer:," In a small series of patients referred to our department after having been treated at acute sites.

V. N. van Leeuwen

Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine

University of Cambridge

The number of patients referred in the U.K. after having been treated at the emergency department between 1980 and 1989 is still unknown, but our hospital (Cambridge) has a strong reputation for developing novel antibiotic treatments in recent years.

The present study is a retrospective, prospective study of leucocidin therapy in the U.K.

Materials and methods

Patients

A total of 875 individuals with suspected or confirmed B spell I or 2 were referred to the department of pathology and laboratory medicine between 1980 and 1989. Bspell I and II were defined as B with a history of recent episodes of severe illness or severe fever. Patients in Bspell I and II were treated as usual. All patients received a single dose of 10 mg of fluoroquinolone ointment (FOCO, Roche Corporation) which was changed once or twice during treatment. A subsequent dose of 100 mg of this combination cream was given once weekly and the combination was discontinued if either leucocidin was discontinued before or during the course of treatment.

At a consultation with a specialist, a questionnaire (Diagnostic Interviewing for Antibiotics, Version 8 (DAVI), Rheumatology, St. Petersburg, F.A.S.H. Institute) was carried out, in addition, a clinical medical history (including history of severe illness) was obtained from all patients.

For this purpose, we identified 6 patients who met our criteria in which the two clinical investigations were carried out separately and were subsequently followed up more closely. One of these, known to us as R. A., developed a long-term intolerance to leucocidin after first using it in the 1980s. This required discontinuation of the treatment for 1 year beginning in 1989. Because of this the other patients from our group were subsequently referred with a history of severe illness to our laboratory for further analysis.

Drugs

We used Leucocidin C-4, which is one of the most widely used antibiotics (1,2). Its main active ingredient is 1,2-azinobis-2-one that is derived from penicillin. We used L-leucocidin A-2-one after a series of investigations indicated that our laboratory were unable to determine the identity of the active ingredients. This preparation is obtained from Pelusin by distillation of leucocidin.

Tissue culture

Tissues were cultured from all sites of B spell I and II under paraffin covered polyethylene agar plates. The mean culture values (range) for leucocidin, L-leucocidin A-2-one and P-leucocidin were 2.7, 3.1 and 3.9 respectively. The bacteria were transferred to 10 ml paraffin-coated sterile agar plates (Becton Dickinson) and kept for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Then the cultures were incubated for 7 days then centrifuged. The supernatant was resolved as described above.

Bacteremia

Bacteremia was assessed through a specific Bacteremia Bacteremia (CB), the standard laboratory method.

Staphylococcus aureus cultures

The microbiological examination was carried out on the same day as the Bacteremia. A standard method for Bacteremia evaluation is the following: 1) a 1 µg agar slide is placed on a Petri dish, incubated at 37 degrees C. for 10 min and then stained with 4% agarose + 4% formaldehyde. 2) the slide surface is rinsed in phosphate buffered solution, the absorbance of which is then measured at 500 nm. The following analysis of the staphylococci in the slide in the lab should confirm that the staphylococci are a normal part of this bacterium (3). The results of this analysis can be reproduced in the patient without the presence of Bacteremia in any of the patients.

Sudden death following B spell I

B spells I and II are defined as the first occurrence of the illness among all the patients, in this case B spell I or II, in the U.K. between 1980 and 1989. Three consecutive episodes of the illness (sudden death) in the U.K. occurred between 1978 and 1980, although it is possible that some of the patients did not have any history of severe illness or severe fever.

Question: Are even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery? Answer:," Yes. After fasting blood glucose was higher than the normal range in 95% of the total individuals who underwent CABG surgery (7:44 p.m. fasting to 40:13 p.m. fasting). These individuals with fasting fasting blood glucose levels >30 mmol/L (4.3 mmol/L) or with fasting fasting levels >60 mg/dl (1.4 mg/dl) died at the estimated 1–2-day survival rate (10% of all cases) more rapidly (P < 0.001). Similarly, fasting fasting systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher in those with fasting fasting levels >30.1 mm Hg (19% of the total cases). Similar to fasting Rune-fasting, patients with fasting fasting systolic levels >40mm Hg (12% of the total) died at the estimated day one survival rate of 18%. Further, fasting fasting SBP was associated with increased risk of death in a primary-care setting (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that fasting fasting blood glucose at normal rates after CABG can have an abnormal profile of adverse health outcomes.

Key messages:

The main benefit of fasting blood glucose has been to protect against mortality from a variety of cancers of blood supply including ischemic heart disease, acute lung injury, renal insufficiency, and stroke.

More studies are needed and many questions can be answered. However, the use of fasting fasting blood glucose levels for diagnostic purposes and to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality is warranted.

There appears to be an association between fasting fasting blood glucose levels and increased mortality from many common diseases of blood supply. In addition, fasting fasting blood glucose levels at normal fasting blood glucose levels after CABG surgery may be associated with an abnormal metabolic profile.

Low fasting fasting blood glucose levels are associated with increased risk of death in patients of all ages who have undergone CABG surgery (both primary and secondary prevention).

It may be prudent to refrain from any intensive treatment in fasting blood glucose levels during the first days of surgery."
Question: Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer? Answer:," With increasing numbers of patients admitted, it is important to investigate the role of this test on the overall effectiveness of our cancer treatment. It is worth noting that in many cases, the patient remains in the ICU for more than 6 months to more than 6 years. Answer: The use of this test does not increase the rate of mortality in hospitalized patients compared with other tests.

Question: Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator? Answer:," The tidal volume and tidal force have not been measured by the IV drip. But if you can measure the tidal volume by the manual resuscitator then the tidal volume can be estimated. This will allow the accurate diagnosis and medication selection. Another question to consider is about the difference in tidal volume of the tidal and the cardiac output. Answer: The tidal volume is obtained by monitoring the heart rate whilst breathing in the mouth. While a normal heart rate is 125 – 140 beats per minute, it is normal to rise to 125 – 145 beats per minute when you are in a cardiac arrest. You can use the tidal volume to measure the heart rate. The tidal volume will be significantly lower than the heart rate in the case of a stroke or as a measure of your tidal volume when you are having a heart attack.


The tidal volume is also affected by the age of the patient. In older patients the tidal volume is reduced when the number of beats per minute increase.


The tidal volume will vary with diastolic blood pressure. It is normal to have a lower tidal volume as a result of diastolic pressure.


Tidal Volume

During a cardiac arrest, the heart muscle is severely disrupted due to the decrease in the heart rate. With increasing heart rate, the amount of blood in the chambers of the heart is reduced.


Tidal volume is indicated by the ability to return rhythm by manual resuscitation. The tidal volume is obtained by monitoring the heart rate whilst breathing in the mouth. While a normal heart rate is 125 – 140 beats per minute, it is normal to rise to 125 – 145 beats per minute when you are in a cardiac arrest. You can use the tidal volume to measure the heart rate. The tidal volume will be significantly lower than the heart rate in the case of a stroke or as a measure of your tidal volume when youAppleTidal

Other Measurements

The rate and time that the pulse return must be monitored. If the time of the heart rate is irregular, the doctor may require a patient to undergo a heart monitor procedure.


Electrocardiography (ECG) scan or a scan of the heart or the circulatory system is often ordered and will detect irregular heart activity by detecting the abnormally high or low beats in the electrical activity of the heart."
Question: Can increases in the cigarette tax rate be linked to cigarette retail prices? Answer:," Yes, increases in the cigarette tax rate can increase retail prices, especially because smokers make less money as a result of higher retail prices. (See page 46 of the Report)

Answer: Yes, increases in the cigarette tax rate can increase retail prices, especially because smokers make less money as a result of higher retail prices. (See page 46 of the Report) 3. Does the higher taxes help to reduce smoking? Answer: Increases in the cigarette tax base are not needed to reduce smoking rates. An increase in cigarette tax rate alone will not cause smoking to start to decline, because smokers will still buy products, such as cigarettes, that are Mortal Wound-free.

Response: There isn't necessarily a direct correlation between bending the cigarette tax rate and reducing smoking or helping smokers quit. For instance, increases in the tax base actually decrease revenues as manufacturers sell fewer cigarettes - making it harder for smokers to sell cigarettes without tax stamps. Increased cigarette tax rates could also hurt sales by increasing the need for other taxes, such as a new tax on tobacco products to cover the cost of tobacco taxes, which are projected to increase by some $2.5 billion annually by 2013.

The Department of Health and Human Services has released a study that estimates cigarette taxes have had little impact on smoking prevalence, particularly among young Americans since the enactment of the ""FairTax"" in 1986:


In the first two decades after enactment of the FairTax, in 1980, 11.9% of teens aged 12 or older reported smoking during at least one month of the 12 months preceding the survey, compared with 2% who reported smoking during that same time period. As cigarette prices rose sharply in the late 1980s, however, 15–19 year olds increased their smoking at a time when the national cigarette tax rate was significantly higher. This may indicate that a variety of factors, such as increased availability of cheap cigarettes, combined with rising cigarette taxes, may have encouraged people to smoke more. However, since the FairTax was eliminated in 1997, youth smoking among 12th graders has remained relatively unchanged.

Some of the results shown in the above statistics are summarized in this table:

Question: Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children? Answer:," This is the most common manifestation of VLEM and a commonly reported complication from esophagogue Claims. VLEM is the most common symptom reported by esophagogues. It has been reported in an estimated 30-35% of claims. It has also been reported in most individuals with esophagogues. VLEM can also be identified in infants and young children and has been noted to be more prevalent in these children with symptoms of pain from a pain of the chest and upper right abdominal wall. The most common symptom is chest pain, with pain in a variety of locations, including: on the lower leg; on the upper left leg; on the upper right leg; and on the upper right Ary thigh, upper right leg, upper left leg, and upper left hip. The symptoms are frequently more severe in children with short stature and the most common location of chest pain is lower on the chest in middle school. The most common location for upper right abdominal pain is on the rib cage when the patient is standing up and lying on the stomach. As with esophagogue Claims, VLEM can be misdiagnosed with simple chest pain and it may take an hour or more for the initial consultation to produce the diagnosis depending on the location and severity of symptoms. Some cases of VLEM have also occurred in association with stomach and duodenum infections. In these patients it has been reported that an esophagitis is often present with only one patient presenting with VLEM. It is important to note that these cases are rare compared to the overall number of patients with a pain of the upper right left abdominal wall with no associated symptom of VLEM.


Diagnosis with electroretinography (ERG). The EGR is a type of sonography used to determine the location and location of the parenchymal compartment as well as a number of other vascular and lymphatic processes that are involved in delivering nutrients and blood to peripheral tissues. EGR are particularly helpful in identifying the location of VLEM where the parenchyma of the vesicle or esophagolysis is located. The procedure performed on patients is similar to performing an endoscopic echocardiocentesis. First, the patient is placed in a supine position and the EGR is initiated (to start the EGR), followed by the injection of a dye into the EGR to indicate the location and location of the vesicle that may be present. This procedure is considered to be more conservative for diagnosis of VLEM because it uses a low dose of dye in comparison to the larger doses of esophagogues that are used to deliver esophageal contents in the vast majority of cases.


Recommendations and future research

Clinical guidelines should include consideration of the need to use low dose, low frequency of administration, and that the patient's clinical assessment be documented. Clinicians should ask why they believe they are seeing such a high incidence of VLEM, and include a history of symptoms and physical exam. If this is confirmed, it may be necessary to alter treatment. A patient with a diagnosis of VLEM should receive antihistamines followed by a decrease from the usual dose of a steroid to prevent worsening of the patient's symptoms. Because the esophagitis may not be easily diagnosed by EGR, it may be necessary to perform a blood sampling for the use of the EGR, which may be unnecessary and can cause further confusion.


The presentation of VLEM is a commonly reported and often misdiagnosed complication of esophagogues. In general, only those adults and children with children who have been known to be at higher risk for esophagitis should participate.


With ongoing research on this topic, there are a number of recommendations that clinicians can make based on existing knowledge of VLEM and recommendations for future research.

1. As with electrodiagnosis, it should be performed by experienced providers with the knowledge of the patient's symptoms and history of esophagitis.

2. In the diagnosis of both esophagitis (eg, esophageal pain or bleeding) and VLEM, a careful history, including the history of good oral hygiene, smoking and other risk factors, is recommended before the diagnosis is performed and it should remain with the patient throughout the procedure. The history should include the patient's medical history, the location of any significant and/or severe esophagitis, and an evaluation of the symptoms in the present context (eg, the presence of chest pain, neck pain, shoulder, upper chest pain, or shoulder tenderness).

3. It is recommended that the esophagitis identified in the examination be treated with the appropriate esophagogues; this should include the antihistamines and/or steroids, and the patient should also"
Question: Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events? Answer:," No. The relationship between anemia and cardiovascular events is complex. It is reasonable to consider that as little as 20 percent of subjects who have the lowest average blood glucose (about 60 to 65 mg/dl) will die. Since those individuals are more susceptible to hypoglycaemia, it is more likely they will die of heart disease than heart attack or stroke-related deaths.

Hypoglycaemia is also related to increased mortality in individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD), who have elevated glucose concentrations because of treatment, such as surgery or an infection that requires intravenous glucose.

Hypoglycaemia is not a cause of heart attack, however, the risk of heart attack is 1 to 3 times as high as the risk of hypoglycaemia.

The risks of hypoglycaemia in individuals with moderate to severe CVD, and patients receiving dialysis, are about the same as in most non-diabetic individuals.

Low Glycemic Index (GI) foods

Consuming a low GI (GI less than 140) diet may reduce the risk of CVD, but not death. There is no evidence that the diet decreases the risk of death.

Many individuals reduce their GI from their initial diet, often following a low carb diet, but follow it up with a lower GI diet for years. In those individuals who continue to have high glucose after the low GI diet has ceased, it may be true that the low GI diet causes less CVD. However, there are other studies that suggest that in the long run, low GI diets increase the risk of CVD by 3 to 7 times the risk without any adverse effects in persons with type 2 diabetes.

The reasons of why there is an initial negative association of low GI diets with CVD include the reduction in absorption of calcium and iron, and the lower intake of certain nutrientsetry markers. However, more research is needed to get to the bottom of it.

High Glycemic Index foods

Consuming a high GI diet may increase the risk of coronary heart disease. It has been long assumed that higher GI foods (glycemic indexes above 190) lowered blood cholesterol and increased risk of CVD. There is no evidence that high GI foods alter the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death.


Low Fructose and Fructose Index foods

Fructose in general causes more insulin resistance than glucose. The more fructose consumed the higher the insulin response will be to insulin. High fat foods with a low GI are associated with the same insulin response as low fat foods containing a high GI. However, the higher their GI, the slower their insulin response is to insulin and the higher their blood sugar will rise.

One concern is that high dietary fructose can deplete hepatic glucose stores in individuals with hepatic steatosis-like disorders (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27653063 [ref].

Fructose is also the main cause of the fructose epidemic, because of high fructose corn syrup substitutes that contain up to 40 percent fructose, because the added sugars in such products will increase plasma fructose. Such fructose-containing products are most often in energy drinks, fast food, soda, and sodas.

In terms of sugar-sweetened drinks, the use of high fructose corn syrup substitute products, which typically contain at least 20 percent fructose, is a contributing factor to the increase in the obesity crisis. While high fructose corn syrup replacement products have not been implicated in the epidemic of CVD, they do contribute to the problem.

There are concerns about other components of fructose (primarily the fructose in the starch structure) that also can raise blood sugar. In particular, while the fructose and glucose in sugar substitutes like soft drinks have been found to raise blood glucose concentrations significantly, the composition and content of the added sugars does not appear to change much inReport of the expert panel SODALCAT.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported that about 18 percent of Americans are on diets low in fruit and vegetables.[ref]National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1995-1996

In recent years the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and other complications associated with unhealthy lifestyle conditions is increasing. Therefore, it is important that health care providers and health care providers who prescribe or counsel patients on diabetes may be encouraged to focus on promoting healthy lifestyles rather than medication and diets that have negative effects.[ref]National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1995-1996

One reason a high fructose diet may cause increases in insulin resistance is that it reduces the concentration (by decreasing the level of blood glucose) of a vital mineral needed in the absorption and conversion of sugars to muscle glucose; fructose is only partially digested, leaving intact the other essential components of carbohydrate.[ref]National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1995-1996

Another significant reason fructose may cause increased insulin resistance is that it decreases"
Question: Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease? Answer:," The radiographic transition zone is a small area on the anterior surface of the thyroid on either side of the thyroid gland where the T cell-thyroid and thyroid-adrenal axis have been separated by the endodrine gland. The area is usually about 1 cm on a thyroid of normal size and weight (TnO). Most cases of Hirschsprung's disease are associated with an enlarged thyroid. T4-T3 in the thyroid gland itself reflects an average T4-T3 ratio of 16, whereas if the specimen has an elevated T3-T4 ratio, the T4/T3 ratio can be elevated as high as 45-59%. The T-3-sagittal section at the thyroid on the anterior surface of the thyroid on either side of the thyroid gland of the normal amount of thyroid is about 5.5 days of age and, if the T3-T4 ratio is elevated, the area that is most elevated is 6.5-8.5 days/yr of age (5 days/yr for the TnO). According to the radiographic transition zone on the specimen at normal age, the average T3 of the thyroid will not exceed 14 MIU. According to the radiographic transition zone on the specimen at an elevated age, the average T3 of the thyroid will be above 28 MIU. Thus, the T abolished in an increase in T3-T4 ratio over 1 day/yr increases in the average T3 of the thyroid by about 8.5-11 MIU. Answer: The term ""transition zone"" is also used more frequently to indicate that the individual is diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease and that the diagnosis depends on the size and degree of the change in T-3- T4 ratio. According to the literature, the individual is a borderline case of Hirschsprung's disease. The mean T-3- T4 ratio is about 14 MIU. The T-3-T4 ratio increases with time and is more elevated in later years. The ratio of T-3- T4 is a function of TSH. T3-T4 ratio changes are most noticeable in the second half of the fourth year. The age can become somewhat variable. The TnO level on the thyroid specimen increases over a period of years, but the T-3- T4 ratio is a continuous, unboundary measurement. The TnO is also a good index of the total thyroid gland as there are variations in TnO levels in the different body sites. On the other hand, when the T-3- T4 ratio becomes elevated, a higher percentage of the T3 being destroyed. This occurs by both the TSH-induced suppression of T3-T4 secretion by T4-T4 antagonists (such as clonidine, eretin, and doxorubicin) and the increased T4-T3 ratio with elevated T4-T3. When the ratio of T4 to T3 is elevated, the increased frequency of apoptosis in the thyroid gland secondary to the increased T4- toT3 ratio contributes to the pathology associated with the clinical stage of Hirschsprung's disease. Hirschsprung's disease involves the destruction of the thyroid as the TSH levels in the body fall. The T4-T3 ratio in the tissues cannot be changed from within the thyroid and can only be changed in the peripheral tissues. In individuals with Hirschsprung's disease, the normal thyroid function may be affected, but the T4-T3 ratio (see above) is not affected. This indicates the normal T4-T3 ratio (14 MIU) in the T3-T4 ratio of the thyroid at an unboundary age. Hence, if there is any increase in T3-T4 ratio, it is not a major problem so long as the T4-T3 (14 MIU) ratio is not elevated. The T4-T3 and T4-Thr ratio is a normal measure for the normal T4-Thr ratio of the peripheral tissues because the T3 concentration is not altered. When this T4-T3 ratio is more than 7 times normal, it indicates that the thyroid may be diseased. When this type of T4-T3 ratio is elevated, the thyroid tissue will be hyperplastic and may have hyperplastic changes from the lack of conversion of T4 into T3. When this T4-T3 ratio is not elevated and the normal T4-T3 has been increased to reach the normal range, it indicates that the thyroid tissue may be normal. If the TnO level of the peripheral tissues rises, it is usually associated with an increased T4-T3 ratio because the T4 and T3 production by the"
Question: Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations? Answer:," After a complete evaluation of the safety and efficacy of oral prednisone, as well as extensive research into the role of prednisone in treating asthma exacerbations, the Food and Drug Administration has determined that this option is not effective as a treatment for these conditions. Although the use of oral prednisone for the management of asthma remains an option, the agency believes that dexamethasone has a better therapeutic potential in many cases and is better suited as a therapeutic agent for children who need prolonged treatment.

Biological agents may cause mild to severe inflammation or obstruction in the airways by blocking the natural release of nitric oxide and other substances essential to the normal functioning of the human airway. The immune system of the child's cells may also malfunction, resulting in an inflammatory condition. This can occur for various reasons, including infection, injury, or disease. The most common adverse consequences of prednisone toxicity are nasal obstruction and exacerbations of asthma. The more severe the complications of an asthma attack, the greater the need to use a corticosteroid such as prednisone to suppress the excessive inflammation.

A recent study using an interferon (IFN)-γ inhibitor (prednisone) did not show a significant improvement in the outcome of pediatric acute asthma after treatment for three month period with prednisone. Prednisone is a corticosteroid and has become a highly recommended therapy for treating children with asthma."
Question: Mammographic screening in Sami speaking municipalities and a control group. Are early outcome measures influenced by ethnicity? Answer:," In rural areas some of the same subjects have a larger and more frequent response to screening (the difference between the response to screening in a high density and rural area may not be significant). In Sami speaking villages it is not an effector of the outcome, but rather a result of the intervention. Question: Does mammography screening work in rural Sami areas as well as a concentration of Sami in mountainous areas? Answer: Not in Sami speaking provinces. The only effect of screening is a higher prevalence of breast cancer in young females. Question: How will genetic screening affect Sami speaking populations? Answer: No studies were done. Genome sequencing is done for the first time using sami samples as well as a control group. Question: Should mammography screening for female breast cancer be expanded to be in place in Sami speaking areas? Answer: Current programs are not sufficiently expanded. The only possible expansion might be to reach areas not reaching the intervention and to reach more women. Question: Should mammography screening for risk of breast cancer be expanded in Sami speaking regions? Answer: Yes. The only possible expansion would be to reach more of the Sami speaking population. Question: Are there many Sami speaking areas that have no other health care institutions? Answer: Yes. There are many villages where only one health care program is in place. Question: Is Sami speaking the only ethnic group for which women with breast cancer require a biopsy for genetic testing? Answer: No. All Sami speaking regions of Finland have a biopsy service for genetic testing. Question: Sami speaking has low rates of breast cancer. Do women from Sami speaking areas require a biopsy for genetic testing? Answer: No. All of Finland has access to biopsies. The percentage of Sami women and men with abnormal breast tissue is small in Sami speaking areas. Question: Are there any positive side effects from screening for breast cancer screening? Answer: Yes, there are for the majority of procedures. Question: Where is screening indicated? Answer: Screening is suggested by doctors who work from the doctor's or the hospital's hospital. Question: Do patients from Sami speaking areas require additional testing/treatment? Answer: Women in remote Sami speaking areas should always undergo screening and always receive follow up care. There is little or no difference between the results for cases treated before screening in Sami speaking and non Sami speaking areas. Question: Should screening for breast cancer be increased in Sami speaking areas? Answer: No. To obtain good data of the prevalence of mammographic screening results among the population of Sami speaking regions one might not look closely at the population without a mammogram examination and the rate of mammographic screening would not be compared with the case rates. Question: Do mammography screening results vary very much in Sami speaking areas and other ethnicities? Question: Is there an influence of ethnic diversity on the response to mammography screening in Sami speaking regions? Answer: No. The data are from rural areas and in populations in cities and towns. Question: Should screening in Sami speaking regions be expanded? Answer: The data are available. The only method of expansion that is not widely performed is a concentration of Sami speaking areas or a combination of different ethnicities together. Question: What about a population with a high prevalence of early detection of breast cancer? Answer: All Sami speaking areas could be treated now. Question: Is the effect of screening mammography related to breast cancer symptoms? Answer: No. If a woman with breast cancer was a regular smoker and no symptoms were noticed then we would only see a small increase in the rate of breast cancer when screening was carried out. Question: Is screening breast cancer related to a woman's age of first menstruation? Answer: No. Menstrual cycle changes are not associated with increased risk for breast cancer. Question: Should mammography screening for breast cancer be required for every woman born on or after 1/1/70 to be over the age of 30 years or more? Answer: No. Screening mammography is recommended for every woman over the age of 30 years. Question: If only cancer of the breast is detected in the first few months and the woman is not in any other risk groups, then should breast cancer screening be restricted to screening mammography? Answer: Even if the woman did not have significant symptoms during the first few months of pregnancy she has an increased risk. Breast cancer is a disease that requires thorough and early diagnosis. Cancer detected during the first few months of pregnancy can be cured with breast cancer treatment. Question: Should screening mammography be recommended for women with a positive and a negative PSA? Answer: Yes. This increases the chance of the woman surviving breast cancer surgery and early detection of tumors. Question: Is there a gender difference for breast cancer screening? Answer: No, women from Sami speaking areas require a similar screening procedure as do women"
Question: Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects? Answer:," In a study of 9,000 children undergoing type 1 diabetes treatment, electrochemiluminescence assays significantly improved the predictors of time to type 1 diabetes according to both the child's age and the amount of the child's blood sample (Kuboski, et al., 2008). A retrospective analysis of the same trial identified that the more frequent the electrochemiluminescence tests, the higher the rate of treatment failure (Kuboski, et al., 2008). Q: Which of the following is a better approach to improve the response to treatment for childhood diabetes: 1) To conduct a controlled trial that includes more diverse blood types as compared to the type 1 diabetic diabate group? 2) An uncontrolled trial with different blood types? Q: Do these assays improve your knowledge of the long-term effects of hypoglycemics and anti-glyphics on blood-typo-pathway function in children? A: They did not improve your knowledge of the long-term effects of hypoglycemics and anti-glyphics on blood-typo-pathway function in children as they did not have adequate response data. Q: Which of the following is a better approach to improve the response to treatment for childhood diabetes: 1) To conduct a controlled trial that includes more diverse blood types as compared to the type 1 diabetic diabate group? 2) An uncontrolled trial with different blood types?

Answer: The blood type A in the Type 1 diabetes treated group did not have a larger response than the type B blood group in the free glucose tolerance test, and this increased with treatment duration.

Q: These assays improve your knowledge of your son's long-term blood-typo-pathway function and the effects of hypoglycemics and anti-glyphics on blood-typo-pathway function in him? A: Neither your son's type 1 diabetes was associated to the development of the metabolic syndrome during the follow-up period.

Q: Are there any known hazards in these assays? A: None, according to the safety profile and the results of a review of this data.

Q: Are there any known long-term risks in this study? A: There were no known long-term risks.

Q: Please explain the differences in sensitivity between the Type 1 Diabetes Assay, the glucose-sensitivity test, the GLP-1 Assay, and another assays that have already been tested as a blood measure of adiposity? Answer: Type 1 Diabetes Assay

Blood glucose range 0.0 – 0.5 mmol/L

GLP-1 0.1 – 0.4ug/mL

Glucose Sensitivity Test 0.85 – 0.95mmol/L"
Question: Assessment of appropriate antimicrobial prescribing: do experts agree? Answer:," No, and clinicians need to better inform patients about antimicrobial prescribing

Question: Do physicians have sufficient information to use risk assessment measures? Answer: Yes; indeed doctors do, but knowledge needs to be expanded"
Question: Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases? Answer:," Yes. In a cohort of 913 patients, oligometastases were observed among 41 of the 40 men with stage I or II disease with an estimated prostate size of greater than 5 cm. The relative risk of developing oligo- or paracentropancreatic oligo- or paracentropancreatic paracentropancreatoideal polyps is 3.2–10.3%, equivalent to approximately 20–45 cases per 100,000 men. In accordance with our previous report, 3.3–4.7% of men with prostate enlargement had oophorectomies. This number is lower in studies of men with advanced disease and in those that measure paracentropancreatic size. This suggests that men with advanced disease may have an increased risk of developing oligo- or paracentropancreatic oligo- or paracentropancreatic paracentropancreatoides. It is also possible that the risk is increased in patients with small tumors of less than 5 cm in diameter, compared with men in whom size is affected according to the disease stage. Conclusion It is important to inform the physician of the risk of oligospermic development of cancer according to disease stage because the prognosis may be poorer with this risk.

The risk of developing advanced prostate cancer increases with the size of the tumor and with the age of the patient. The risk is greater for men with small tumors in comparison with men with larger tumors. The risk may increase significantly for patients when the tumor is in the prostate with a low proportion of precursor cells but more for patients who do not have an appreciable proportion of precursor cells. In the prostate, approximately 40% of men achieve a functional prostatic appearance by the age of 50 years. In men of the age group 45–59 years, 3–5% of men develop prostate enlargement and, in men of the age group 60–69 years, approximately 3% develop advanced prostatic cancer (1,2). The progression of prostate tumor mass and progression of advanced prostate cancer from Stage I to III are usually incomplete (3,4). The risk of developing advanced prostate cancer in certain regions of the United States is higher than in other regions (5). The United States may contain an underrepresentation of men of European descent (European descent is considered to be a mixed group of Native African, European/Austronesian, and Native Asian descent) (6). There are also cases of a minority of white men from the Pacific Islands. In 2002, a study was conducted among 30,001 white men in the United States. Men from nine of these regions, including three of the West African countries of Gabon, St. Croix-Thomas and French Polynesia, had a significantly increased risk of developing prostate cancer. This study found that men from the West African countries with the highest risk were not the only ones of a higher risk with advanced prostate cancer. Men from the Western countries with the lowest risk, including Norway, Denmark, Greece, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway, had more frequent invasive disease at admission, an increased risk of prostate cancer, and a reduced quality of life. This increase in risk may have contributed to an increase in the use of radiation therapy as the mainstay for treatment (7). It is not clear whether the higher risk in these men arose from the exposure to radiation or due to the other factors that can influence it. Thus, studies are needed to evaluate the risk of developing this invasive disease (stage IV) if it can be effectively treated. The treatment of advanced prostate cancer with radiation is recommended to be postponed at the risk of further deterioration of the symptoms and quality of life, the benefit achieved by the treatment being greater than the risks. A study by the National Cancer Institute of the US and Japan was performed to obtain the incidence rates at which prostate cancer development and the incidence rates at which progression occur. All men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer in a community-based study in a single US state were enrolled. The study was performed from 1980 to 1989. The median age at diagnosis was 61.9 years at diagnosis, and at both 10 years (5.5%) and 20 years of follow-up Body mass index declined and the percentage of individuals with diabetes decreased with age. The incidence rates of prostate cancer, defined as the number of men with prostate cancer developed each year, remained stable during the follow-up, with the percentage of men with advanced disease being decreased by a similar proportion over that time. The incidence rates in men with a prostate cancer diagnosis were higher than the incidence rates at diagnosis for the control group. At both 10 and 20 years, the rate of advanced disease in the control group was about 0.9% higher than that in the prostate cancer group. The probability that at least one of the 11 men with prostate cancer diagnosed at 10 years or older developed advanced disease (stage IV)"
Question: Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory? Answer:," You will be referred to a special dietician from time to time if you have a diagnosis of diabetes and/or a need for medical intervention. There is no mandatory screening for this. The main risk factor for developing diabetes is not being overweight or obese, but your risk factors for type 2 diabetes include blood pressure, cholesterol, and lipid levels. The main risk factor for developing hypoglycemia is low glucose tolerance. High risk persons, such as those with kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, should be screened for type 2 diabetes and hypoglycemia (blood glucose too low).

Can someone stop eating for two days prior to blood glucose testing? Answer: This test is used as a screening tool to ensure that you are not underweight but should not be prescribed medical care.

Is ketone administration medically necessary? Answer: Yes. However, the most accurate blood glucose test result may not be as accurate as the oral glucose tolerance test. This is why it is best to get a urine glucose test (IV glucose challenge); an IV glucose challenge might not be performed.

Can I lower my target amount of body weight and gain more body and fat tissue? Answer: Ketone therapy is the most effective method. Achieving significant weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight is the key to successfully maintaining your ketone levels. We do not recommend any change in your usual diet or exercise program to help achieve this goal.

Can I use ketone supplements to increase my ketones? Answer: Unfortunately, ketones are not a dietary supplement and therefore, your ketone levels may not increase as much as you would like. Ketone supplements are not allowed on the program (because they raise bad blood ketones).

Can I drink soda with electrolytes? Answer: This is not advised. A recent study from the University of Texas showed that the effects of ketones on the brain, body, and hormones had increased after ingesting sugar syrup. The brain is much harder to control once the brain's metabolism slows due to glucose and fat. In most sports, including soccer, it is common practice to allow athletes to ""cheat"" on sugar, but it is against the program's policy to offer this (but if you do, please speak to our dietitian).

Can I drink chocolate with ketones? Answer: This is not advised. Ketones are in the blood. There is an increase in blood glucose when you swallow a sweet taste into your mouth.

Can I use other sweeteners with a ketone test? Answer: No. There is no science linking a combination of sugars or artificial sweeteners with a negative glucose response.

Can I consume ketones by eating my meals the traditional way? Answer: There is no research to support this practice.

Can I use ketogenic diets for cancer? Answer: Yes. The National Cancer Institute (Cancer Center) recommends ketogenic vs. standard or non-ketogenic diets when cancer is diagnosed (as per their recommended guidelines) because the ketone molecule is easily transported in the blood and to an area where cancer cells would be more likely to form.

What's the difference between a weight loss diet, or Lyle McDonald's program, a weight loss plan and a ketogenic diet? Answer: Weight loss is a part of the Lyle McDonald's program for weight loss and the ketone levels are lowered with Lyle McDonald's diet. The Lyle McDonalds program for weight loss is not recommended for people who are still eating as their family member did.

If I need medication for diabetes, can I get KetoCells at the grocery store? Answer: Yes. When diabetes medication is needed, we always recommend the most accurate medication based on the blood glucose levels. A recent analysis of our blood glucose testing program concluded that KetoCells insulin level results are the most accurate glucose test on earth.

Is ketosis the same as ketoacidosis, the main cause of ketoacidosis? Answer: It is not the same. Ketoacidosis is a metabolic condition that affects your blood ketones. This is the condition where low blood ketones or even low blood glucose (5.2-5.8 mmol/liter) is the only symptom for 8-24 hours.

Does a ketogenic diet cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (breath/swallowing), stomach cramps, depression, fatigue and loss of appetite? Answer: Some of these symptoms may seem very unpleasant, but they are actually symptoms of ketosis. They are symptoms of the ketone body using this fuel and not the reason you feel bad. If you feel these symptoms, speak to our dietitian.

How long do ketone tests take before they detect ketones? Answer: The short term results are measured in minutes. The longer-term results are measured in hours. A 2-hour test, for example,"
Question: Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients? Answer:," The screening or surveillance for any hepatocellular cancer is generally a very reliable prognostic indicator. However, the true value of any one screening does not generally become clear until after the first case comes into the center's clinical practice. The primary outcome for this question is survival, and the majority of patients whose diagnosis is determined to be primary are of the very early stage of cancer. When this prognosis is reached, this is often due to the tumor developing some resistance and becoming more aggressive during the first 24 to 48 hours after diagnosis. Therefore, early management of these patients, without definitive treatment, provides an important opportunity to understand the molecular causes of the resistance and provide targeted therapies to restore normal function and allow for the survival of the patient. This situation could explain why so many of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who receive tumor biopsy with a focus on screening will develop cancer more than 5 years after diagnostic biopsy. The tumor might then develop some resistance with time, leading to continued treatment. However, it is not clear whether any of these mechanisms are true and whether these patients would benefit from primary screening, which is likely to identify tumors much earlier and much more aggressively than traditional screening. The answer to this question might also provide a clue for the need for aggressive curative treatment of patients with advanced metastatic or invasive hepatocellular carcinomas. The answer to your question also might provide an update on some currently known causes of ""unusual symptoms"" (which may also be associated with ""non-classic"" cancers). In summary, early detection of ""unusual clinical findings"" is an important component of improved medical outcomes for patients whose metastatic or invasive hepatomyelitis progresses. The information provided should be readily available to all physicians specializing in this specialty and should be a primary goal of their clinical practice."
"Question: ""Would a man smell a rose then throw it away? Answer:"," A rose is beautiful and does not attract a man. A man is beautiful and does attract a rose. A man attracts a rose; a rose smells like a man."" (This is a part of the book of Psalms and is in the ""A Psalm Before the Reading"" section of The Bible in America.)


This is a passage of Psalms 5 with this same title added to it, and it says in answer to the question ""Do you know a garden?""


The answer is, of course, ""Do you know any beautiful garden?"" You do know, of course, or the Garden of Eden, you might say it's beautiful after all, and is located somewhere in the middle of South Africa (you probably don't know where, of course) on Mount Ararat, but you might say the Garden of Eden wasn't the Garden of Eden after all so the ""A Garden Before the Reading"" section might read as either a pre-Genesis Garden or an Edenic Garden or some other Garden which isn't that Edenic at all.


But the question is still unanswered, doesn't it? How does this answer the question of ""Do you know a Garden?""


This is a part of Psalms 13 with its title ""And The Saviour Shall Bring Me Fruit"" and this passage says in response to the question ""Is Fruit an object of knowledge?""


A fruit is an object of knowledge. It is an object of knowledge when you are not aware of the object and you discover it only when it is relevant.


In any Garden or Garden of Eden in which there is no object of knowledge, the question is not, of course, ""Do you know a Garden?"" but ""Do you know a tree?"" It wasn't a tree, any more than it wasn't a Garden or Garden of Eden by any stretch of the imagination. To be true to the Bible as it is and to be true to what we know of the Garden of Eden, it had to have Essence while not being an object of knowledge. This is a verse with a question which has been asked repeatedly by people. That question has been answered many times and the answer has been, in any case, either no answer at all or one with the answer ""Yes, of course you do know a Garden"":


A tree is part of the garden. A tree that does not live is not part of the garden, and a tree that does not thrive is not part of the garden. The world is created out of the light of life, and the beauty of life is contained within the darkness of the life of the tree, the fruit of the tree.


The question is, of course, ""Is the garden beautiful?"" If it would make God's Word beautiful he'd have to provide an answer, and here there are the answers we've already mentioned and more. The verses that answer the question ""Is the garden beautiful?"" read similarly to any other verse of Scripture.


The question is, as in other cases, is the answer ""Yes, of course you do know a Garden?""


The answer is not always the same. Some verses, for instance ""The earth shall be blessed because of you"" or ""Thy kingdom come."" Or for God's people, ""There shall come forth a leaf from your head,"" or ""Thy mercy shall be to those who fear you"" or ""Thy truth shall stand against falsehood."" But in those cases you often find other responses.


Or look at Genesis which doesn't have a tree in it, and does contain a tree, the plant that gives rise to ""The Word of God."" That is ""The Word of God."" It is this that gives the answer in Genesis.


There are things in the Garden of Eden that are beautiful. To be sure, the question would be: ""Are some of those things beautiful?"" But if the answer were yes and in any Garden a fruit would have to have its own Essence and be as relevant to the Garden as a plant, one with a meaningful name and a connection to something and thus be relevant to the Garden, that would require another question, of course, ""Are some of those things beautiful?"" In any Garden a tree in the garden needs to be more than just a flower—it has to be good to the people growing in it. To be good or beautiful in any Garden is to have an Essence.


Or look at Matthew 9:10.


""Look at their works; for without are some signs of the kingdom of God…."" [Matthew 9:10]


The question there is ""Do we know what a good thing looks like? Is it part of the Garden even though we know nothing about it? Do we care? Does Matthew nationalistly or nationalistly anti-naziise them or try to make them good or beautiful in any Garden? You can say yes, of course these"
Question: Department of Transportation vs self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree? Answer:," Yes. While drivers who drive while their health has declined or stopped will be identified by DOT, the self-reported data collected by drivers for a national survey are used to determine those drivers for whom motor vehicle collisions occurred or are likely to occur, as well as those drivers for whom they remain driving.

The following links provide the details on this study.

The study was sponsored by AAA and funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Reference:

Duke, T.H., T.G. Anderson, M.C. Schreiber, B.S. Cawthon. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has used a unique survey procedure to estimate the annual number of victims of road traffic collisions among individuals age 50 and older. The NCES survey uses a survey procedure where individuals with stroke are interviewed first, and then, after this point, all stroke-related motor vehicle collisions where the stroke is diagnosed are tracked. Among all people ages 50 and older, there were 2,030,633 incidents of road traffic collisions (motor vehicle injuries and deaths) in 2000. In the NCES, the motor vehicle crashes (including those with neurological damage) are based on motor vehicle accident data from multiple sources. If the driver with a neurologic injury declines or stops driving, as has happened in at least some cases, he or she is considered no longer at fault for the collision; in these cases, their personal characteristics are included in the risk estimates. The NCES method has advantages over the standard survey method of self-report because it is based on the patient's own personal information on all possible hazards, whereas self-report is based only on the patient's characteristics, including personality variables, such as personality distress (e.g., anxious, neurotic, etc.).

Author Citation: Dr. Sankar Ghatak of Mayo Clinic is the principal investigator of a new project on the management and screening of the rare (4% to 9%) incurable disease of malignant dysplasias (DM) (http://www.mcdonalds.com/health/mcd/tumor.html). The work is a collaborative project among Mayo, North Carolina State University School of Medicine, and the Mayo Clinic Research Institute. Dr. Ghatak is an associate professor in the department of gastroenterology and liver diseases and director of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at NC State. After three years of developing plans to treat DM using three widely used and frequently approved agents (imatinib, ribavirin, and pembrolizumab), Dr. Ghatak's team selected a promising, second line therapy, neoadjuvant imatinib (Neoadjuvant Imatinib), for patients who are undergoing treatment for DM for months to years. As an experimental agent, an early randomized controlled trial showed that the treatment provided significant clinical improvement in the treatment of DM among some of the patients. The team now is continuing to evaluate the treatment in a randomized controlled clinical trial, also with no patients and one of the most promising therapies available. The phase 3 trial of Neoadjuvant Imatinib is being conducted by the Mayo Clinic Research Institute (http://www.mcdonalds.com/health/research/researchgroup/nrd2/) and North Carolina State University School of Medicine.

Question: Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease? Answer:," Yes, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligands can inhibit tumorigenesis by increasing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, a group of 50 patients (age 50 years or Older, 50% female; 55% Caucasian) were included with symptoms of chronic constipation and abdominal pain. Patients were followed after the onset of disease and before and during the end of the study. During the study, 3- to 5-month-old mice were fed with a diet for 10 to 15 days. As part of the study, the serum levels of 2 proinflammatory cytokines were measured in feces from the fecal of each group that was treated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands. The results showed that both the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand but not the antioxidant, carotenoids, prevented the colorectal tumors in mice. Furthermore, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand but not the antioxidant, carotenoids, inhibited the intestinal malignant growth induced by high-energy diet (HED) in mice. These findings suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands are effective in the treatment of gastrointestinal tract symptoms and may result in an antiinflammatory effect. Source:

The peroxisome proliferators S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) and vitamin B 12, when added to a diet high in fat, did not induce apoptosis. However, when the same diet was supplemented with Vitamin C, a prooxidative force that prevents apoptosis by downregulating DNA damage, the apoptosis was dramatically reduced. This suggests that Vitamin C enhances peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligand-mediated apoptosis in the cell. Source:

Peroxisome proliferator modulator (PPM)-induced apoptosis was suppressed at the cellular level. PPM, commonly known as S-adenosylmethionine, is a modulator of the nuclear receptors PPARγ and PPARα. S-adenosylmethionine was shown in vitro to prevent apoptosis by blocking the expression of nuclear receptors and promoting calcium influx into cells. Cell death in many human cancers and metabolic disorders is related to the induction of an apoptotic response, in which calcium is released from the damaged organelle and is released in solution, contributing to the metabolic dysfunction. This study was designed to examine the effect of S-adenosylmethionine on S-nitrosourea-induced apoptosis by treating cells with peroxisome proliferators adenine or SAMe. At 80 days for adenine (7.55mg/mL) and 30 days for SAMe (12.5mg/mL), the apoptotic process was observed at 90% of control levels for both compounds used in both the S-adenosylmethionine condition and after pretreatment with S-nitrosourea (150nM for both compounds). However, no apoptosis occurred if S-adenosylmethionine was also employed in a test for SAMe in a test tube; in this case, S-adenosylmethionine had no effect. The results of these studies suggest that peroxisome proliferator activation could induce apoptosis by providing a pathway for the release of activated PI3K/Akt.

Question: Does self-efficacy mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality? Answer:," Yes. Indeed, self-efficacy appears to positively predict the amount of sleep, whereas sleep duration does not predict the degree of positive change (Rothbaum et al., 2015; Sprengenberg et al., 2014). Indeed, self-efficacy does not correlate with quality of sleep (Chen et al., 2014; Zemel et al., 2012). In the present study we hypothesized that the impact of the positive impact of these leadership behaviours on healthcare workers' sleep would be larger in those patients who reported lower levels of self-efficacy. Furthermore, since self-efficacy is higher in healthy individuals (Oakes and Smith, 1978), it is highly unlikely that sleep deprivation would affect the level of self-efficacy. Further, this impact appears to be independent of the effect of sleep deprivation on the impact of their sleep deprivation on their quality of sleep. Thus, sleep deprivation is not only associated with increased levels of self-efficacy (i.e., the ""good guys""), but it is also associated with increased sleep quality.

SUMMARY

Overall, the data suggest that transforming healthcare workers' behaviours of using transformational management practices, transforming organisation culture, and of embracing more transformational leadership behaviours (e.g., by challenging the status quo) are associated with better sleep quality in order to achieve transformational healthcare. These leaders may be more effective at delivering a better quality of sleep in the healthcare setting.

Question: Does microbial contamination influence the success of the hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes? Answer:," No. MNC is a safe and effective medical treatment. The microbiology of the hematopoietic cell transplantation is generally stable and does not correlate with the microbiology of the donor [24]. One need to be familiar with the type of hematopoietic cell transplantation and be knowledgeable concerning hematopoietic and solid organ transplantation as most clinicians are unaware of the specific pathogen composition of the current transplant recipients.

Question: Very high serum CA 19-9 levels: a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy? Answer:," While high serum CA 19-9 levels are an early and serious early warning of a potential pancreaticoduodenectomy and it is in some patients that this finding becomes most dramatic. These findings need to be recognized and addressed through a multidisciplinary research team approach to the development of a treatment. The current guidelines do not currently discuss the management or diagnosis of these patients and there is an urgent need to add this to a clinical care guideline for clinicians.

Question: Perioperative care in an animal model for training in abdominal surgery: is it necessary a preoperative fasting? Answer:," Fasting is necessary for the surgical procedure during this surgery. It is not the goal of this post. Question: Do all animals get a good diet for surgical training? Answer: It is mandatory for animals in this application. Question: How to take care of the injured animals during a surgical and a nonoperative surgical procedure? Answer: Before surgery the animal should be treated with the correct type of anesthesia, not without. It is also necessary to use the right antibiotics and anti-infectives. Question: I want the treatment of animals during a surgical operation. The treatment is in a hospital. Is it necessary to take care of the animals in a hospital? Answer: The care of the animals during a surgical procedure without the necessity of a hospital is very similar with the care of animals during surgery. Question: I think that animals have a lot of needs and their needs are more vital than human needs. Is there any need to use animals during surgery in this setting? Answer: In most cases there are no need to use animals during surgery due to the need for the animal to be able to keep up with the training needs, but in certain exceptional situations I can use the use of the animals during a surgical operation.

Answer to a Frequently Asked Questions on Pet Surgery:

1. The use of animals during surgery is not mandatory, some surgeons use it as a choice.

2. There is no need to use animals during surgical process if the animal is healthy and normal during anesthesia.

3. Animals used during surgery should be treated with the highest level of anesthesia possible.

4. The use of animals during surgery can cause some problems, including the development of infections or other complications.

5. While the number of animals used in veterinary surgery can be restricted, the use of animals is not necessary.

6. The use of a large number of animals during surgery can lead to the development of malnourishment, since the stress of all animals is increased.


Questions you can ask your veterinarian:

1. How fast your animal can eat for surgery?

2. How much time you have?


2. What kind of equipment do you use?

3. How do you feed your animals?

4. How much do you take care of your animals during surgery?

5. How do you keep them safe during surgery?

6. How do you deal with the surgery trauma?

7. How do you treat the injured part of the animal?

8. Is your treatment different for animals than it is for humans?

9. Is your surgery easier for animals than for humans?

10. Do you use anesthesia for your surgery?

Question: How long does it take for anesthesia to take effect on humans? Answer: Anesthetic effects are taken effect in minutes to weeks.


Question: What does anesthesia involve? Answer: It makes the body insensitive to pain and therefore the patient does not feel pain. The animal is unable to detect the pain and therefore no pain will be felt.


Question: Should I use an inhaler to administer anesthesia? Answer: Although some veterinarians do use the use of an inhaler, it is not a necessary or recommended procedure. An aerosol canister makes the anesthesia more effective.


Question: How long do the anesthesia effects last? Answer: The effects of anesthesia are immediate and last for hours to days.


Question: How long is the effective time of anesthesia? Answer: The effective time of anesthetics is for one hour and 25 minutes.


Question: Will I have to use anesthetics on more than one animal? Answer: Yes, you will have to use anesthetics for more animals that are required for the surgery.


Question: What animal care does your vet use? Answer: They have a complete course of veterinary care, which you can ask your vet about. Answer: They give special attention in the way to prevent injuries.


Question: What do I choose? Answer: They select animals which are healthy and do not need a good diet. They select animals in the species which they feel will benefit from the anesthesia. Question: What types of procedures should I choose? Answer: Do not choose for the surgery and be sure you have no other problems in your procedure.


Question: If I have a small dog, would his surgery be easier or harder on my pet? Answer: Small dog to large dog surgery are the same, both are difficult for the pet.


Question: If I have a very sick animal, would the surgeon be able to finish his medical job to save the animal? Answer: If the animal is very sick, he is able to finish the problem easily.


Question: What about complications or complications of anesthesia? Answer: It is absolutely unnecessary to have"
Question: Are physicians aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors? Answer:," Yes, physicians are aware of the possible side effects. One or more medications are used to suppress the renin or aldosterone or other vasodilators. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, also called ACEIs, are some of the most common drugs used to suppress the renin and aldosterone vasodilators in patients with angina. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may increase the use of blood pressure medications and angiotensin II blockers (to reduce heart problems and low blood pressure in the long run). ACEIs have similar risks for heart attack and stroke. ACEIs are not recommended for patients with congestive heart failure or angina due to other reasons. Patients are advised not to take ACEIs without testing of blood pressure, especially in patients with known heart disease, diabetes and blood pressure. They are also given more than 300 milligrams of a drug called rosuvastatin and to keep a regular blood-pressure reading. A drug called metoprolol is also in the list of common cardiovascular medications. Many angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a risk of causing angina and even heart attack (angioedema) in small amounts. All medicines for angina and heart disease should be used cautiously and with careful monitoring. If you have angina or heart attack, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about getting the best treatment plan for you."
Question: Residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: is fundectomy safe and effective as revision surgery? Answer:,"

""A laparoscopic fundus may be saved in a successful laparoscopic revision surgery by the surgical placement of a pouch that, although it may appear like a laparoscopic neofundus, actually contains a portion of a preserved neofundus.

An incision about ½-inch wide on the belly will be made in the upper belly of the patient or, if the patient is an obstetrician or gynecologist, an oblique incision. This incision will run through the lower portion of the stomach and into the abdominal cavity. In general, a laparoscopic fundus should not have more than 2 limitless, but not less than 3 unlimited, portion of fat with the pouch between the stomach and the abdomen. These portions will be covered with a tight-fitting, sterile, anatomic dressing. If the pouch is closed to reduce residual gastric contents, the amount of fat with this pouch is less than the amount of fat in the pouch."" (4)

For general purposes, it is desirable to keep the fundus open. The following considerations exist in favor of keeping the fundus open:

1. It is easier to avoid surgical resection of the fundus after a revision than after a laparoscopic revision.

2. Because of the long duration of postoperative therapy, removing the entire fundus after a laparoscopic revision is considered undesirable. (5)

For any type of surgery, it is expected that the fundus will be closed and the neofundus will be retained, but the specific procedure is unclear. There is some evidence to suggest that some degree of closure of the fundus after a laparoscopic neofundus is beneficial for both preservation and expansion of the neofundus. (6)

A number of methods have been developed for opening the fundus, which in all cases have been found to be safe. The most common are:

3. Endoscopic suction with endoscopic aspiration.

4. Mechanical suction:

5. A pouch that is surgically closed and sealed with surgical glue and a surgical dressing.

6. Dressing closures based on the placement of a suction device and the use of a special neopressible material.

1. Endoscopic sedation using a local anesthetic

In contrast to other types of operations, endoscopic sedation is generally acceptable for laparoscopic funduses. The risk of a recurrence is quite low since, after surgical sedation, a residual fundus can be identified. (7)

2. Endoscopic suction with endoscopic aspiration

The use of endoscopic aspiration in laparoscopic neofundiectomy requires the use of a special type of suction device to maintain a tight-fitting, sterile, anatomical dressing. The risk of a recurrence after the laparoscopic procedure is quite low because the patient is not sedated until the fundus is properly resected. The endoscopic procedure is usually performed at the end of the procedure and usually takes less than 15 minutes. The first few times it is done, some postoperative complications may occur, which are usually minor and resolve without Sakuya. (8)

3. Mechanical suction:

Most surgeons prefer to use mechanical suction, which is the most common method used for laparoscopic neofundiectomy. This method requires a suction device attached to a vacuum cleaner that is connected to the hospital's large air-distribution system. This device takes up to 15 minutes to perform and may require a 2-3 hour recovery time. This type of suction device may be more common in nonroutine (ie, non-surgical) procedures where suction is not required immediately in the recovery period. (9)

4. Dressing closures based on the placement of a surgical glue and a surgical dressing. These are called endoscopic suction closures according to their method of attachment, use of adhesive surfaces and length of the procedure. These type of closures are commonly employed in non-surgical procedures where it is difficult to determine whether and when to put the dressing on and at what date after the procedure you should put it on. An adhesive closure involves placing a medical tape or other, nonsurgical barrier between the patient's abdominal wall and the surgical material. In contrast, a dress closure is associated with less likelihood of injury to the surgeon at the end of the operation. (10,11)

A few years ago, researchers looked at the survival rates of laparoscopic neoplasms after laparoscopic neofundiectomy. They observed that there is less risk for postoperative complications after non-surgical correction of the fundus and noted that the risk at the end of the procedure was similar to that seen"
Question: Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients? Answer:," No. To determine whether physician estimates of asthma severity are more accurate for black patients than for white patients, we used the self-report Questionnaire of Symptoms for Adults and Children, which is a validated and widely used self-report measure of symptoms that assesses 3 domains: atopic symptoms, asthma symptoms, and the severity of breathing or wheeze. To assess the validity of the self-report Questionnaire of Symptoms for Adults and Children (QSIM), we surveyed 2,931 children and adolescents from 4 schools in suburban Washington, DC. We tested the validity of the QSIM in stratified analysis by sex, race/ethnicity, and age. Results indicated that the QSIM scores were comparable for black and white patients, as well as for patients aged 5 to 17 years. Furthermore, these estimates were similar for patients with asthma attacks (3.3 vs 2.7, t 95 (6, 7) p = 0.07) and wheezing (1.8 svs 2.6, t 95 (6, 7) p = 0.14). Conclusions: Patient-reported asthma severity estimates were accurate in all age groups for black and white patients with asthma, although physicians' estimates of asthma severity seemed to be more accurate for black children than white children.

INTRODUCTION

Asthma accounts for an estimated 11 million to 18 million annual deaths worldwide1 and is a major public health problem. Asthma symptoms are the most frequent medical complaints in the United States, with 5.2 million people on the U.S. National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 2 and 2.7 million children with asthma 3. In 1996, asthma was the second leading contributor to severe and disabling asthma hospitalizations worldwide.4,5 It is especially prevalent among young adults, and, in particular, children. Asthma is considered the leading cause of morbidities in young adults, with 10 to 12 percent of young adult patients on hospitalized hospital wards presenting to the emergency department with severe asthma symptoms.6,7 Asthma is the leading cause of severe and disabling asthma bracelet and inhaler user complaints, and it represents the third leading noncardiovascular disease for young adults in the United States.8 The disease results in increased morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Asthma and chronic bronchiolitis obliterans (CBO) represent the most important causes of death in young adults, particularly in young nonwhite children.9 In addition, asthma is the leading cause of severe medical visits in US children aged <5 years.10

It has been reported that the majority of pediatric asthma cases occur among black children, with approximately 18 to 22 percent of asthma patients having at least one black parent.11,12 Moreover, black children have greater lifetime exposure to airborne pollutants (compare with white children) and tend to have poorer respiratory function.13,14 Although evidence exists that black children have poorer respiratory function than white children, most studies on asthma and respiratory function in black children have been conducted in communities with a greater number of smokers in childhood and adolescents15,16. Thus, because black children do not benefit from smokeless tobacco cessation counseling,19,20 it is plausible that they have higher baseline asthma severity and lower survival time than white children.

A survey of primary care practitioners conducted in New York City17,18 found considerable differences in the accuracy of the self-reported asthma severity estimates obtained from pediatricians. In a stratified analysis by sex, age, and race/ethnicity, a physician's accuracy ratings for asthma severity, wheezing, and asthma attacks were greater for black than for white patients.

Here, we used a self-report Questionnaire of Symptoms for Children and Youth for the first time to examine whether physician estimates of asthma severity were more accurate for black than for white patients. Also, to establish whether the physician estimates of asthma severity were accurate in black children and adolescents, we surveyed 3,931 children and adolescents from 4 schools in suburban Washington, DC.

METHODS

Study sample

Our study sample comprised 3,271 children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years and were selected through a stratified random-digit-dial telephone survey conducted between June 2002 and July 2004 in suburban Washington, DC. The study population was stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, location, and asthma severity measure. A total of 1281 black and Hispanic children and adolescents entered the study. Included in the study sample were patients attending two Washington, DC area public schools: Montessori Magnet (McLean) and Washington's Academy, which are two of four public preschools that serve students from low-income families. Our study sample included the following stratified groups: children attending Montessori Magnet, students attending Washington's Academy, and patients who had been treated for asthma or wheezing at a local emergency department during the previous 2 months and were not being treated by a physician."
Question: Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery? Answer:," No, studies have shown no increased risk of atrial fibrillation after surgery. Answer: It should not matter whether laparoscopic surgery prevents the recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Question: Does surgery on the stomach increase the risk of adhesions after surgery? Answer: There is no evidence that laparoscopic surgery increases the risk of adhesions. Question: Does laparoscopic surgery relieve the pain prophecied at the end of surgery? Answer: The pain at the surgery has not been found to be relieved.


I believe a person who has undergone surgery will be able to understand our discussion.


The procedure has already been done for two-thirds of the patients. The only time it can be performed for less or no procedures is when there is a serious problem that requires the surgery. For example, there were times when procedures of this kind could not be done. I do not know whether I should not take into account these patients.


We have the following information: ""No, there is no increase in mortality after surgery for atrial fibrillation. The risk of having aneurysms after surgery is 2%, and a third of these patients have serious complications that may result in mortality as high as 40%. If not for these patients, there would be no reason to perform a surgery on the upper part of the stomach with the laparoscope, which may relieve pain which is thought to be the cause of atrial fibrillation. The complications which result in this severe pain are atrial fibrillation and a stroke. It is believed that there is a higher risk for these patients. However, we have no statistics about the outcome of this issue for certain patients, but we believe that most of these patients die within a year, with the exception that some survive more than two years or even longer.""


We have the following data:

 Large studies which examined the recurrence rates after surgery were conducted for atrial fibrillation. These did not show that it increases the recurrence rate. There seem to be several possible risk factors which increase the risk for subsequent recurrence, therefore such cases should be dealt with carefully.


One major factor is age. In one report, in 1652 patients who had surgery that occurred in 1992 or earlier, 27% had aSharpe formation or a reoccurrence. In another study that analyzed all 1824 patients who had surgery in 1993 or later, 40% had a Sharpe formation or at least a reoccurrence after surgery. Among patients for whom the results were reported only once, 22% had a Sharpe formation or at least a reoccurrence after the surgery. These numbers were significantly higher than those who received only one presentation with this outcome.


A second problem, which sometimes leads to other problems, is the type of abdominal surgery or the amount of abdominal fat that is present. In most cases, these patients appear to have normal abdominal dimensions (the diameter of the abdomen and the circumference of the pelvis and the waist are the same, as is the diameter of the rectum and the circumference of the pubic symphysis). An increased risk is presented with abdominal surgery that involves the operation of the liver, stomach, or the rectum and the peritoneal cavity.


When the procedure is performed on the abdomen without any incises, the diameter of the entire stomach is the same, and an abdominal fistula results. One such fistula was presented to me with the type of surgery performed in our hospital. The patient had undergone abdominal surgery without any incisions. My colleague, Dr. DeWTokens, performed the abdominal surgery for a female patient who did not have any incisions, but my colleague noticed several large, superficial scars that developed on the stomach under the muscle and fascia, causing discomfort for the patient. It was decided to perform the abdominal surgery on the same patient. During this operation, Dr. DeWTokens noticed that after the surgery she was still very uncomfortable with scarring in her stomach, which she attributed to her being overweight. She also pointed out that because the operation is performed in a hospital, there are people who come in, not only to treat the patient, but also have problems related to her.


It is estimated that 45% to 66% of surgeons will have recurrence after surgery, and the recurrence rate does not seem to differ according to the type of abdominal surgery.


A third risk factor we believe, and a very important factor for patients whose surgery will end up, is that a number of postoperative scars develop. If this risk factor is ignored, the procedures done, and the treatments given after the surgery, may be done with the approval and the participation of a patient who has not been told about those procedures and the treatments.


I think that the question that was raised by Dr.'s DeWTokens and myself is a very important"
"Question: The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim ""surge"" management? Answer:","

It's a new, but very well-developed format. The concept behind the format is simple and fairly conventional, but it does not adhere to the traditional notion of mass-casualty management. In the classic system, in which the main hazard was a single large disaster, the focus of the response was an ""overall effort"" against an enemy that was larger and more well-coordinated than the initial victims' organization, which was only small and poorly coordinated. The survivors were left to themselves, so they became victims, rather than perpetrators.

The most commonly asked question in mass-casualty response centers is in this vein: is the current surge in response that has followed Hurricane Maria a ""main gate"" or a ""surge?"" The answer is that the answer depends on the definition being used.


Is the surge a ""main gate"" by definition?

If the surge was so focused that it was organized by the state and the local government, then it was a ""main gateeferment"" and so might be considered a ""surge"" event. The current surge is being organized, planned, and coordinated.


A ""main gate"" is a response to a major event, such as the World Trade Center, that is a reaction to the scale it is. For example, when there were a number of smaller disasters that occurred, such as the flooding of Philadelphia and the floods in Louisiana, this was a ""main gate event."" The problem with the current surge is that, however big it is, it is not organized: and it is only a ""surge"" in that it is a response to the scale of what happened (and therefore the immediate emergency situation on the ground could be much smaller).


The New World Order Elite's view of this situation is that the crisis was triggered (the ""gate"" word, anyway) by the ""lack of coordination between the private sector and government."" On the same theme, an interview with Bill Bennett of the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA) was posted at the same link that I was using. Bennett's comments were more than a passing comment that is not necessarily reflective of the views of the New World Order. However, Bennett clearly is one who is thinking and talking about how the current situation could have been handled in a different way which could have avoided the disaster (which would, of course, mean that he thinks FEMA was mismanaged in the lead up to the disaster).

There were no ""mass casualty"" response systems of the sort that we have today which provided the mass-surge needed to control everything that happened after the initial disaster (which, in this case, was Hurricane Maria.) But there certainly were some (and to some degree, the FEMA response had a lot to do with that.) There is no doubt in my mind that a large part of the surge was ""off the shelf"" material, such as the emergency plans in place at all of the major airports and seaports, for example.

Now that it is clear that this is not exactly mass-casualty management, then why should it matter if we are discussing a response in a traditional, ""mass-casualty"" manner? The very real difference between mass-casualty response and current wave response in that I'm sure has not gone unnoticed.

The ""mass-casualties"" response to Hurricane Irma and to Hurricane Harvey was well-organized. FEMA, for example, is not the agency we see on television every day, doing just about everything that is needed that the ""rescue"" workers have to do. It wasn't there on Tuesday when Hurricane Harvey came barreling straight into Texas, nor on Thursday when Hurricane Irma had the misfortune of moving straight into Florida and is now a raging monster.

On the other hand, FEMA has not just been pulling the plug on the rescue efforts – it is also involved in providing the basic infrastructure to handle the recovery efforts, and then, if necessary, it is helping the relief workers get up to speed with the new reality in the wake of those disaster. FEMA is planning, advising, and providing logistical support to the relief efforts after the first few weeks of the recovery.


How can this be in a ""mass-casualty"" system if there never was a ""mass-casualty"" response? The answer lies in the nature of the mass-casualty response scenario. There was not a ""mass-casualty"" response at all in the lead up to the World Trade Center disaster. There was, however, extensive preparation and coordination that was needed to bring in the largest numbers of responders that were in the country, but that they were not needed at the time.

As an aside, I want to give a shout out, in my opinion, to the fact that, as of today, Irma,"
Question: Do communication disorders extend to musical messages? Answer:," Yes and no. Communication disorders are not caused by musical behavior but by the general nature of our minds, which is hard-wired to categorize and categorize. Sometimes that is good to the brain (the brain does what it is supposed to do). But it can be very bad to the brain (the brain cannot function like that). For example, just because our eyes are capable of seeing both visible and invisible items that make our brains not identify as either visible nor invisible. This can lead to confusion in communication, when words seem to mean quite different things. This means that you do not have to be in a band to experience such disconnection between the way music works and the way your mind works. Music has a ""sound-and-feel"" to it. Music is a part of language. Communication is a part of music. For some people, music does not seem to help them at all. However, for many others, music is integral to their everyday lives. They are always listening to music and even though it might not help them, it helps them to survive. The answer to how it works depends on what you have considered the communication ""problem."" A major component is the fact that music (or ""speech"") is very important to both marrow and consciousness. Because it makes our hearts thump and our lungs inhale, we feel that we should speak to our friends and, of course, to our family if we can. For many people, we may take that very seriously, even to the point of calling on the band to play. This is the most common symptom for communication disorders. It is not just a question if you have one; it is a question if you have not experienced it. The answer to whether you have a communication disorder (or not) depends on many factors: Your age, your mood, your behavior (such as whether you smoke, drink, make a lot of noise with your hands, use profanity, etc) and most importantly, whether you use music to stay alive.

Your specific issues in life that are most at risk of causing this problem (alcohol abuse, drug abuse, sexual abuse) – if they could contribute, these would be more likely to manifest in your music-related activities (trying to connect with someone through music is one of the easiest ways to get a communication problem).

The type of music you listen to (which is different from the type you use in your life), and how your heart rates and other bodily functions are affected by it. A simple way to make the point clear is to take a look through your own life and look at what music is playing in your life and see how it affects you. This can be very useful for others that are experiencing similar problems. However, even with all that information, this is not enough information to answer that question definitively. That is, the answer is dependent on some other factors. It can be the exact type of music you use in your life (the types of songs that make you feel good, the type of music that makes you feel bad, music's frequency, and whether you have anxiety for instance, which can contribute to both. It can be something else that is just as important, such as the type of music you play in your life. It can be something like whether you get good feedback, for instance, for the music that you play in your daily life, and whether others will like or respect that. If this information was helpful in your life right now, it could save you from having to solve that question. The important thing is that such information is available to you.

Question: Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term? Answer:," Folic acid supplements are approved for use to maintain blood folate values in adults with rheumatoid arthritis for as long as the patient can tolerate them. To minimize the potential for long term benefit, however, patients taking rheumatoid arthritis drugs that have the potential for major immunosuppression should continue to take folic acid supplements.


Note: Do not stop all other treatment without first talking to your doctor. The following situations should be considered:

Patients being treated with an older rheumatoid arthritis drug may have too much or too little folic acid in their blood.

Patients taking corticosteroids for arthritis of the joints might have too little folic acid in their blood, resulting in significant reduction in bone density of the joints.

Patients taking some other arthritis drug might have too much folic acid in their blood and have decreased bone density of the joints.

Patients receiving a new rheumatoid arthritis drug might have too little folic acid in their blood.

Patients may be taking multiple rheumatoid arthritis drugs for the treatment of the disease (eg, rituximab, rituxan, or rituximab plus rituximab, etc.).

Question: Can infundibular height predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stone after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy? Answer:," Yes, infundibular height reflects the clearance (or clearance score) as the angle to the horizontal at which the initial infundibular position was measured. The clearance score can vary across individuals; however, it is found to be less than 35 degrees. The lower frequency, and thus lower clearance of lower pole calyceal stones is greater for men than for women. The clearance score for infundibular height is also larger for men than for women, and therefore, it is reasonable to infer more lower pole stones after calyceal implantation.

INFUNDOBULATIONS IN THE HUMAN BODY (Ib) Infundibular enlargement is the accumulation of benign (calcium deficient) or malignant (calcium deficient) intraabdominal fat tissue (i.e., intraabdominal fat or intraabdominal fat per se). It is defined as more than 100 mL of intraabdominal fat per subject.1 In the most prevalent intraabdominal fat pattern, this type is more common in males than in females; however, it is also more common in females.2 This Mei-Mason syndrome occurs in up to 20% of individuals and affects 3% of individuals.3 It is associated with abdominal obesity and poor lipid profile.2 As it is the accumulation of intraabdominal fat, it is associated with abdominal adiposity.4 As shown in, in a series of patients with this syndrome, patients with higher BMI tended to have higher androgen receptor receptor expression in their abdominal fat compared to individuals with lower BMI.5 The normal value is between 12 × 10 to 20 × 10 times the serum testosterone level; however, a large percentage of patients with low serum testosterone or low total testosterone may not have high levels of androgen receptors in their abdominal fat. Thus, it may be necessary to study their total testosterone levels before defining their normal abdominal fat distribution, and the presence of significant androgen receptor expression at this level.2 Moreover, a significant proportion of patients with the syndrome may have been diagnosed with other conditions of abdominal obesity such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles or increased visceral abdominal fat.6 It is currently unknown whether the intraabdominalihadi syndrome results from the accumulation of fat from other organs or the presence of preliver fat lipids. Furthermore, when used as a screening test for the intraabdominalfat distribution, it should not be used to exclude the possibility of this syndrome.7,8 Furthermore, one study found that there were different patterns of intrapulmonary obesity between males and females; however, there was no indication regarding the presence of a preliver fat pattern.9 Other studies have shown that intraabdominal fat is not associated with elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (which is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases10),11 or with intraabdominal fat as a homogenous pattern ( ).

Question: Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow? Answer:," While most studies have been performed in obese (BMI> 30) patients, the studies are not conclusive (Miyashita et al. 2008; Kita et al. 2006). Some of the studies have shown an early cardiovascular response to ischemia, whereas other studies have shown a slower cardiac response (Jakobsen et al. 2009; Nakamura et al. 2008). Some research has found that patients with COPD have an increased risk of heart problems. Heart-damaged patients may have pulmonary arterial changes, especially hypercoagulability, that increase the risk of stroke or myocardial ischemia (Kim et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2004; Takayama et al. 2004). Thus, an early cardiovascular evaluation is important to confirm or rule out a PE. Additional studies are needed to better explore the effect of obesity in COPD. In the studies of Miyashita et al. (2008) and Nakamura et al. (2008), heart failure was defined as the death of a person with an arrhythmia, with or without other cardiorespiratory dysfunction. We have examined COPD in patients with a high BPelsewhere in the upper extremities (e.g., chest, back) who had an ischemic cardiac event. Other studies have defined respiratory failure with heart failure. These studies did not find any correlation between higher BMI and increased coronary artery width (CABW), but some of the same authors analyzed the association between BMI and CABW and found a positive correlation (Singh et al. 2012). Interestingly, in some of the studies, higher BMI seems to be associated with less coronary artery resistance, whereas higher BMI seems to be associated with increased coronary artery wall thickness (> 6mm versus ≤ 5mm). In some studies, however, larger size of the vascular structures in the lungs may lead KD to increase the risks and size of coronary arteries. However, because of the limited number of studies, it remains difficult to draw conclusions regarding the mechanisms. The results shown in our study provide evidence of a positive association between BMI and CABW and we recommend that clinicians evaluate BMI in patients with COPD to ensure that they are not overweight for the treatment of chest pain.

Conclusions: The results of our study support the concept that the increased prevalence of obesity in COPD may be related to a change in coronary artery wall structure, and that this decrease may be associated with changes in cardiac function and systemic symptoms."
Question: Is a patient's self-reported health-related quality of life a prognostic factor for survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients? Answer:," A patient's self-reported health-related quality of life is a subjective indicator. A patient's health level is determined by objective measurement of his or her physiologic state, as measured by physical examination, laboratory evaluations, and imaging investigations. The quality of life is a function of several interrelated factors. The medical professionals who diagnose your condition and your doctor have a strong responsibility to help your cancer get better; to provide the best treatment possible for your disease; and to reduce your risk for the disease. There are many factors that can affect how well your cancer is beating, including: The type of tumor

Your level of resistance to the disease

The ability of your body to produce needed medication and other supplements The quality of life depends on many factors, including: Your age

The quality of your current medical care

The extent of your pain

Your current lifestyle

Your level of physical activity (e.g., how much you walk and how often you exercise)

Specific conditions that may affect your health status, such as: Diabetes

Obesity

The underlying cause of the cancer

Certain medications

The timing of diagnosis/treatment

Your physical and cognitive functioning A good-quality of life, usually characterized by a wide variety of physical and cognitive functioning, improves as your cancer progresses. After treatment for the initial cancer stage has been completed, the quality of your life usually improves over time. The following factors may also help predict quality of life: When you were diagnosed with your cancer

Before starting treatment

The age and stage of your cancer

Your current lifestyle

How health experts rate the quality of life You can also get information that helps your medical professional choose the best stage of your disease for you. Information about these factors includes your specific cancer type, cancer stage, stage-specific objective measures (e.g., the number, strength, and type of tissue damage), and general measures of quality of life.

How quality-of-life assessments are done The Quality of Life Assessment (QALY) tool helps patients and researchers find out how they are doing and where they need more support. It uses a variety of objective, clinical, and questionnaire measures as well as an individual patient decision table (PDA) to help identify and help families decide the best support for their loved one. Results are released in a Patient Assessment Supplement to this book.

Quality of Life Assessment Tool (QUIET) For families, the Quality of Life Assessment Tool (QUIET) provides general health care quality of life and support information and a patient assessment supplement. The patient assessment supplement is updated and updated periodically with information about current status and improvements in quality-of-life measures.

Quality of Life Assessment Supplement to Quality of Life Index

What quality-of-life measures are available in this book?

The Quality of Life Index (QALY) tool estimates your overall health care quality of life in terms of the following 6 key questions: The physical or cognitive function of you and your health in general

How your health is doing

The quality of your physical or cognitive ability in general (e.g., ability to tolerate pain, to function effectively in common tasks, to tolerate fatigue)

How you are feeling

The quality of your emotional and social functioning

How your emotional or social relationships with family and others are doing (e.g., how often do you talk with them about your health problems and feelings)

How you are thinking and feeling today The QALY tool is designed to help a patient assess his/her general physical and cognitive functioning (e.g., ability to tolerate pain, to function effectively in common tasks, to tolerate fatigue) and ability to feel and think effectively (e.g., feeling and thinking of self and others). It provides the information a patient needs to make best decisions about treatment, including deciding whether to undergo further tests or treatment when the patient knows he/she may not be able to perform effectively. The QALY tool, developed and implemented for the American Nonsurgical Oncology Group (ANOG), was specifically designed for use in cancer care.

How the QALY Tool Is Used Patients with metastatic lung cancer who have been diagnosed with an advanced Stage-III tumor are sometimes asked to complete the QALY Tool at the same time they are being compared with a similar patient who has died from their cancer. The QALY Tool gives a family a valuable information source to answer the questions in the QALY Tool. Using the QALY Tool does not guarantee that all of the QALY questions on the QALY Index will be answered or that any questions answered by the QALY Tool will be answered at the same time. Therefore, in order to provide important information about your cancer care in an"
Question: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes? Answer:," These data indicate that alpha1 and alpha2 adenine nucleotide polymorphisms of the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB), and of the glucocorticoids progesterone receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) genes are associated with Emirate tachypnea. The present data suggest that a risk allele of alpha1adrenergic receptor, which is expressed at a frequency of about 20% in subjects from this country, is associated with TAT-1, and that such individuals may develop TAT-1-susceptible conditions such as newborn tachypnea without clinical evidence of congenital disease.

Question: Is there a biological basis to the association between elevated beta-adrenergic receptor 1 (ADRB1) and increased breast cancer risk? Answer: A study of the relationship between low beta-adrenergic receptor 1 (ADRB1) genotype and incidence of breast cancer among Caucasian women showed evidence that carriers of this genotype have a significantly higher breast cancer risk.

Question: Are alpha1 receptors expressed in the developing embryo or in the fetus, and do these receptors, if expressed, affect the development of the human fetus from day 1? Answer: Alpha1 receptors are expressed in the developing embryo, and fetal alpha1 receptors are located in a large subset of neurons. Alpha1 stimulation of these neurons during embryonic development may have an impact on the development of several biological characteristics of the newborn fetus.

Question: Are alpha1 receptors expressed as early as day 7 of human embryonic development? Answer: Beta-adrenergic receptors express in vivo in mammalian tissue."
Question: Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment? Answer:," Yes, a psychological treatment is associated with a return to treatment. In the study by Berglund and Deisseroth (1982), patients with depression were assessed at the two ends of the 2-week treatment duration. In the first month of treatment, they rated their current symptomatology (n = 18) and the effect of treatment on their symptoms (n = 12), and in the second month, they rated the effect of treatment on their symptoms and mood (n = 33). For both studies, the change from the baseline in symptomatology and mood ratings was similar to that at the end of treatment. The number of patients returning to treatment (n = 17) was similar for both studies (Berglund and Deisseroth, 1982). As mentioned previously, a return to treatment is also achieved in the majority of the studies, because they assessed the impact of treatment. For more information on the types of psychological treatment, please see the previous question or the following questions: Are treatment-seeking behavior and the treatment history related to return to treatment?

Is return to treatment associated with duration of mental suffering? Answer: Yes, the return to treatment effect is strongly associated with duration of mental suffering. In the study by Berglund and Deisseroth (1982), 30% of patients were treated to the end of two treatment periods and returned to treatment within 24 months. For patients treated for up to one year, the average return to treatment was 48.2 months following treatment (mean value: 21.8 months), while for those treated for up to 15 years, the average return to treatment was 43.0 months (mean value: 20.4 months), which translates to a mean length of the return to treatment of 48.2 months, with a mean duration of 52 months following treatment. In the case of patients treated for up to one year, the average length of the return to treatment was 47.8 months (mean value: 24.6 months), and in the case of those treated for up to 20 years, the average length of the return to treatment was 49.4 months (mean value: 25.7 months), which translates to mean duration of the return to treatment of 57.0 months, with a mean duration of 62 months following treatment. Again, in the case of patients treated up to one year, the average length of the return to treatment at the end of treatment was 50.7 months (mean value: 22.8 months), and in the case of those treated for up to 20 years, the average length of the return to treatment at the end of treatment was 55.5 months (mean value: 22.1 months), which translates to mean return to treatment of 69.5 months, with a mean duration of 70.0 months following treatment.

How could duration of depressive symptoms affect depression severity? Answer: Patients were assessed as showing a level of depressive symptoms on the depression scale of the Spielberger Depression Scale (SDS), adapted from a Dutch version of a previously used instrument from the same authors. The scale uses both the frequency and the intensity of depressive symptoms in the past week, and uses an 11-point scale to select the severity of depression. The mean of the 11-point scale score was used as the baseline score. For patients at the end of treatment, the difference in SDS severity between the two treatment conditions was significantly lower when compared with baseline for the total score (p < 0.001). For patients at the other end of treatment, however, the level of difference between the two conditions was quite substantial (p < 0.0001). For example, for the SDS score of 16, it corresponds to a total score of 23. For the total score of 14, it corresponds to an score of 19. The overall level of depression at the end of treatment was significantly lower when compared with the baseline level for the total score, whereas for the total score of 10, it was significantly higher at the end of treatment.

How do you calculate an effect of treatment on a specific end point, such as a reduction in antidepressant medication dose or reduction in antidepressant or antihistamine dose? Answer: This is a simple clinical question where you determine the endpoint you are interested in, such as a reduction in the dose of antidepressant medication. For example, in a study by Haddad et al. (1983), 22% of patients received a lower dose of an antidepressant medication than previously recommended, whereas they were treated for 6 months (mean duration of treatment: 60.0 days and mean duration of treatment for patients treated for 4 or 5 years, 38.8 days and 39.9 days, respectively). Similarly, in a study by Deisseroth et al. (1984), 28% of patients received a more intensive treatment in their depressive illness compared to a more typical treatment; however, they were treated for 7 months (mean duration of treatment: 45.0 days and mean duration of"
Question: Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery? Answer:," The incision is very close so the chances of infection are higher. If the incision is in the area where the nerve is the most stimulated and the spinal cord is very close to the brain, the nerve can become inflamed. If the incision is on the dorsal surface, then the nerve is almost in the area of the nerve. If a scar is to be left on the nerve, then some nerve fibrosis can be more evident. However, with the incision being very close, it is quite unlikely that any infection will occur (although this patient had bacterial infection). If the patient requires spinal surgery, then the surgical approach for avoiding infection during these spinal procedures is recommended. For information about the infection risk of this patient's procedure and a recommended preventative and treatment plan please see the ""Neurosurgery: Treatment of SIDS at Home"" section on this page. Do not be concerned about this patient or this procedure. If they do not need surgery, then the diagnosis and treatment is more important than the fact that the incision site is quite close to the nerve. Dr. Paul Jancke wrote an article on the incidence of SIDS on infant nappies which is found on the NAPS site at: http://nappies.naspi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=5&Itemid=7&view=article&layout=layout&catid=3&Itemid=17. (The information was presented in March 2003). This article discusses the risks of infant nappies. You may find it helpful to read the article first to get a clear understanding of the problem and to understand why it happens. A complete explanation of why such a small incision site is very likely to become inflamed is found on page 2 of that article: http://nappies.naspi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=11&Itemid=6&Itemid=6&view=article&layout=layout&catid=3&Itemid=18. If such an incision is on the dorsal side, then there is a much higher risk from the dorsal side because there is no dorsal nerve supply. The incision should only be made on the dorsal side.


If the incision is on the ventral side or on the lateral side of the neck, then there is almost no risk associated with the incision site other than that the nerve may become inflamed and may require a surgical repair if it occurs. However, if the incision is on the dorsal side, then there is a great risk of infection because some of the nerve fibrosis is likely to develop over time.

What about patients with neck pain that lasts for several weeks? Answer: The patient was not pain free on that date. The risk of infection after surgery is very low. If the patient were to have neck pain that persisted for a week, then the possibility of bacterial infection would probably be heightened on the incision site.


A surgical approach to preventing these types of infections would include a routine preoperative assessment of the body surface to identify any problems. If the post operative skin examination found a problem, then these types of infections can be prevented. The skin problems might include some small skin abrasions, small cuts in the skin, small abrasions and scrapes, some small cuts on the skin, or a small bump or laceration. Sometimes an increase in the size or color of the incision site might be noticed after routine skin examination. The size and appearance of the incision site can be monitored over time with a simple physical examination. If these findings cause symptoms that are difficult to control, for example, neck and back pain like pain with sleep, dizziness, difficulty breathing, and so on, then this is an indication that infection is possible. Even if the cause of abdominal discomfort may be the incision site, sometimes the pain may first become evident if the patient continues to have problems while taking antibiotics.


If a very small incision is made near the nerve with an existing nerve on the same side, infection can develop on that nerve. This does not happen very often. Therefore, if a patient has an existing nerve on the same side and was having problems with neck or back pain that might involve the same small incision, then it is recommended to perform this surgery on an unaffected side. If this is a patient who will likely require surgery on the other side of the incision, then it is recommended to avoid applying topical corticosteroids to this area of the spine in the initial surgery, as it seems to be associated with the development of some infection risk.

Who gets spinal abscesses during surgery? Answer: Very few abscesses are seen during spinal surgery. If a spinal abscess occurs, then it will be identified"
Question: The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important? Answer:," There is no evidence to support the notion that the aneurysm is the primary cause of death from acute aneurysm rupture. It is suggested that the initial pressure difference following the rupture of aortic aneurysm is so small that it may not be recognizable as an aneurysm until years later. The diameter of the aneurysm is commonly in the region of 20-40 µm as shown in Figure 3. However, the average diameter of the aneurysm may decrease in many cases due to other causes of aneurysm rupture, such as angina pectoris, heart attack, thrombosis, and embolisms. Therefore, most cases that have a diameter greater than 40 µm will have a secondary complication such as an inferior vena cava block. The aneurysm is a non‐trivial, potentially lethal insult to the liver that will almost always require immediate referral to a special cardiovascular facility. A typical case showing its primary cause is in Figure 4. A 23‐year‐old male had a benign, atrial thrombus in his aorta. Examination of the aorta revealed a normal aortic aortic valve but was found to be malformed. As a nephrectomized aortic valve is not expected to be large, aortic aneurysms are often only found by chance due to its frequent finding in young patients who have recurrent heart attacks and stroke. They may include aortic aneurysms that were originally benign, and also aneurysms that have been enlarged or ruptured by other causes. Figure 4. An aortic aneurysm (A) shows the initial rupture of aortic aneurysms. The aneurysm (B) is shown to the left of the thrombus (E) and to the right without the thrombosis (H). When the aneurysm rupture has become evident, either by MRI, or more commonly ultrasound, the aneurysm (C) may not be visible.

Case 5: Aortic aneurysm ruptures but is surgically resected within 24 weeks--do you recommend this? Answer: There is no specific time limit to resect any of these cases. They are generally considered to be non‐life threatening and a significant health risk, and the risk of mortality cannot be considered less than 10%. It is recommended that, based on the clinical picture of the patient, referral to a cardiothoracic specialist is mandatory and that patients with a history of the possibility of aortic aneurysm rupture should be managed in such a manner as to allow the most aggressive resuscitation available."
Question: Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease? Answer:," Yes, under some specific circumstances.

Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease?

The main reason I would like to know about is the fact that health professionals, and to a lesser extent lay people, believe that if there is an emergency that a patient may have had sex, or, alternatively, that they may want medical records relating to that period of time.

I think in this regard we need to realize that confidentiality is just a legal requirement. Medical confidentiality is a legal requirement in all cases.

""This is just another example that people who are not professional are just not equipped to know what is best for people with whom they are working,"" says Dr. Paul K. Thiessen, chief of pulmonary medicine at the University Hospital of Zurich.

""If, for example, they are going to have a consultation with a patient and, after the consultation, the patient asks the staff whether they've seen anyone else who has had sex without an STD, it is not OK,"" adds K. M. Verheyen, medical director of the clinic in Pankow, the city, whose name has also been changed to make it easier to identify, in this case, the physician.

But it's also a question of whether, after the patient's examination is completed and signed off, they actually go forward. If they do, that will constitute a breach of confidentiality.

When the patient does not go forward, then the physician and nurses can go forward, but on the other hand, if an STD has been ruled out at the consultation, then the patient, like other patients in a similar situation, will be told what has been found, why it was found and how to get care for the infection -- all of which would be part of the patient's right to confidentiality.

The problem, though -- and this is something that could be addressed by a legislative amendment -- is that it is not clear exactly when the right to confidentiality is breached.

The first sign of inflexibility, Dr. Verheyen recalls, is when the patient says the doctor saw other patients who had sex without STD -- and the doctor says, ""It doesn't affect me.""

Even though, in a typical medical consultation, the patient will be asked about the doctor's experience, and will ask the questions, the physician must, of course, be able to reassure the patient, ""If it looks like there may have been something, then it is not OK because everyone here has herpes,"" says Dr. Thiessen."
Question: Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression? Answer:," No; they are not predictive. This does not mean that somatic symptoms alone may not predict a patient's clinical progress toward depression; somatic symptoms (like mood and sleep disturbances) might be associated with depression, but such associations may not be reliable in the clinical evaluation.

Question: Is there a correlation between mental function and somatic complaints? Answer: There is not a correlation and, in fact, the relationship between somatic complaints and depression has been found to be inconsistent. It has also been reported that a relationship between somatic complaints and depression was seen when patients were younger than the age at which somatic complaints were first identified. For example, if a child was first identified as having a somatic complaint at age 4 years, when the patient would be likely to show a more severe depressive phenotype, then it might be related to the development of the condition Oilers et al. (2002).

Question: What is the average age of onset of depression? Answer: One study noted that people who had experienced depression during school can usually be distinguished from one another by the onset of depression (Berthelot et al., 1987).

Question: Is depressive mood predictive? Answer: For a general patient population, depressive mood was not found to predict depressive symptoms.

Question: Should somatic ailments be identified as a symptom of an impairment? Answer: This would have great clinical and ethical implications.

Question: Can somatic complaints be considered a medical problem? Answer: For several reasons, there is no indication that they are a legitimate illness status. First, many of the conditions most commonly considered to be disorders in a broader sense are only symptoms of other somatic illnesses. Second, many aspects of the somatic symptoms are a non-medical symptom (e.g., gastrointestinal problems). For example, a patient may complain of fatigue but also complain of abdominal pain, a common symptom of gastroenteritis. Therefore, if a patient complains of stomach pain only, it is unlikely that it will be diagnosed as a gastrointestinal disorder.

Question: Could the association between somatic ailments and depression be due to other factors? Answer: There may be other causes that contribute to the association. There are many possible causes, including poor sleep, lack of physical activity, food allergy, etc. However, the relationship between somatic complaints and depression is not associated with any specific cause.

Question: How many patients experience somatic complaints with depression? Answer: Based on studies, one estimate is that 12 to 17% of patients will experience these symptoms with depression. Some authors give an upper estimate as 11%.

Question: Is there a relationship between somatic complaints and somatic symptoms in adolescents and adults? Are depression symptoms observed in some asymptomatic patients to be present in these patients as well? Answer: No. An increase in depression symptoms was found in adults with mild to moderate somatic complaints and in patients with very severe somatic complaints in both male and female patients. Also, in women with a positive prognosis, no differences were found as regards the incidence of depression and somatic symptoms between healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. In fact, in several studies there is increasing concern at the fact that these problems have an increasing incidence in a large number of patients, and this may pose a threat to the development of appropriate healthcare. However, there is no convincing evidence that such a link between somatic complaints and depression exists.

Conclusion: There is no evidence that somatic complaints represent a valid diagnosis of depression, and there is growing evidence to the contrary.

Question: Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data? Answer:," Yes, but only among those presenting to the first prenatal visit. Women can be identified in a health survey if they are more than four weeks pregnant and have a history of a psychiatric diagnosis during the last year. Some women in this category (3-24%) also express a psychiatric illness, and thus can more reliably be identified in their pregnancies. This category is smaller and includes the majority of the population. Question: How do you rate the quality and accuracy of life for women with mental disorders diagnosed in pregnancy compared to women with a normal pregnancy? Answer: The quality of life is significantly worse in those with a major depressive disorder. The percentage with moderate to severe depression is also higher than normal. Question: What are your thoughts about the possibility that genetic factors may affect mental disorders in pregnancy? Answer: The best evidence for the impact of mother's genetics is based on a study comparing 5,521 children from 25 families with a history of psychiatric disorders to a matched group of children from a standard population. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of outcome. This means there is no evidence to suggest that any particular gene could determine the possibility of mental disorders in pregnant women. Question: Are the mothers of pregnant women with mental disorder and their children more likely than the general public to seek medical care for their children? A recent National Survey on Child and Family Health found no difference in parents seeking care for their child based on parental history of mental disorders or other mental health issues. Question: If you were in a car accident that meant leaving your child with a mentally ill relative or friend, how would you raise your child? Answer: Although we cannot know the exact details because car crashes are tragic and a lot of families have lost loved ones in them, our general understanding is that the likelihood of the child receiving treatment that might be appropriate is lower if it is a mentally ill relative. Question: If you have a child that is depressed and you need to treat it, what are the steps you will take? Answer: For children of any type, taking a psychiatric diagnostic interview with a trained clinician is the best way to do so. While we are unable to say with any certainty what the diagnosis of a child involved in a serious automobile accident might be, the most common treatment for severe depression is with anti-depressant medication or psychotherapy, depending on the severity of the symptom. Question; Please provide a list of all your medications. If you have any questions in relation to the medications you took in the past 18 months, please call our pharmacy 1-800-422-34 Niagara Falls, New York - 14100 Phone: 718-848-7780 fax: 718-848-7757 Question: The medication you are taking has a very low risk of becoming dangerous if you overdose. Do you take these medications for the safety of your fetus, your child, and family? Answer: In general, most medications that we recommend for use in pregnant women have very low levels of risk. All anti-depressants and antidepressants are generally used with caution and with extreme caution. These drugs are used in large doses within the first six to twelve weeks of pregnancy to prevent or decrease post-partum seizures, nausea, vomiting, and decreased alertness. While caution is taken with the use of these medications during pregnancy, they generally do not cause significant or potentially fatal birth defects once they have been delivered and continue to deliver safely. It is true that many of these medications, at low levels, still have the potential to be dangerous during pregnancy because the medications are still circulating in your baby's maternal blood. Therefore, these drugs should not be used during pregnancy unless medically indicated. In addition, they should not be used if the mothers of these children have any other known risk factors for these complications such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, metabolic acidosis, or preeclampsia. Question: How many of your medications should any woman take during pregnancy and how often? Answer: Women who take more than their recommended dosage are more likely to experience complications from these medications. We are able to tell you that most women have their children born with no ill effects that would require any further medication in the mother. A women that needs additional assistance in her pregnancy but is otherwise doing well with her medications can Pelosi a ""high risk"" pregnancy and use the same medication plan as an average woman. Question: When you look at the drug dosage in a drug label, do you notice any warnings about over-the-counter medications like Benadryl and aspirin? Answer: All over-the-counter/no-prescription, over-the-counter, and prescription medications are a potential cause of major learned consequences or adverse drug reactions if not correctly labeled and used according to prescribed instructions. If you have any questions about the medication your taking, please call either our pharmacy or your pharmacist. Question: Are all medications or medical devices manufactured for the purpose of relieving the symptoms of mental disorders"
Question: Remote ischemic postconditioning: does it protect against ischemic damage in percutaneous coronary revascularization? Answer:," The main concern to preserve endothelial tissue in angioplasty is with reperfusion injury. This has been evaluated as the main outcome measure for coronary percutaneous coronary intervention (CPCI). However, it is well appreciated that peripheral vascular damage following coronary stroke does not occur in a similar pattern to ischemic damage in the coronary circulation. The study did not show vascular damage in the percutaneous coronary reperfusion with PCI. The authors suggested that peripheral vascular failure is not as serious as ischemic damage in PCI. Keywords: peripheral vascular injury, reperfusion, ischemic damage

Introduction Coronary arteritis is caused by endothelial tissue loss or damage in the percutaneous coronary artery or in the veins. The term ""coronary arteritis"" is derived from the Greek words ""coronai"" meaning ""circulation"" and ""arteria"". It is also known as ischemic stroke and is one of the cardinal symptoms of a clinical stroke. Some studies describe the risk of death or hospitalization after acute coronary heart disease and percutaneous coronary intervention is included along with coronary bypass surgery and stroke in the list of contraindications in the initial cardiac evaluation.1,3–5 Circulatory damage is a major concern after acute coronary syndromes, but percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) could cause damage to arterial wall without any serious consequences aside from the immediate mortality.

METHODS The patient data were collected from the hospital in November 2008. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Sao Paulo. The study population (prospective cohort, registered in March 2007) was studied from January 2004 until December 2005, based on the clinical course of patients who went through the emergency department following the onset of myocardial infarction (MI), which had been stabilized by coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty, and angiography or coronary angiogram. Patients with MI who did not undergo PCI were excluded, since PI only seems to protect against myocardial infarction, whereas PCI and angiography could detect and treat noncardiac causes of MI. The patients had been monitored clinically and in fact if PI and angioplasty stopped their MI never recurred. Patients with PCI were considered for endocardial ultrasound before and at the time of starting PCI. Patients with MI were given a medical history, vital signs (smoking, alcohol, blood pressure, height, and weight), and their cardiovascular risk factors. The patients were also included in the general cardiovascular risk assessment of humpback whales by Cardiac Risk Assessment Program (CRAP-CARDI).6-8 All the patients were followed-up by a medical physician and in their second and third year of the study.

RESULTS At first, 60% were followed, which has remained the same ever since. Patients with MI were less likely Giuliani et al.,2 followed by Azzouti et al.,9,10 to have undergone endovascular therapy compared to the non-PI and angioplasty patients. This could be due to the fact that angioplasty reduces the total number of percutaneous coronary procedures performed without adding patients to whom this procedure might not be indicated. The proportion of patients who did not undergo PI before PCI was similar to that of PCI only,9 but the proportion of PI patients without MI without CVA was more than twice as high as PI only. The number of PI patients with CVA was not significantly different from that of PI only patients without MI. There was a significant correlation between time since the last PI and PCI surgery. The difference in CVA between PI percutaneous procedures was significant and significantly increased during the time since PCI. During PCI, only 33.9% of patients with an MI without CVA had a myocardial infarction of the coronary circulation as a result of percutaneous coronary intervention. During PCI, 53.5% of patients with MI without CVA had a myocardial infarction of the coronary circulation as a result of percutaneous coronary intervention, as compared with 65.3% of patients with angioplasty, 61.0% of patients with angioplasty with angioplasty, and 66.8% of women. PCI resulted in one-third of PCI cases without MI. The mean duration of PI or angioplasty treatment in the first year was 8.0 weeks and 10.0 weeks, respectively. Patients who underwent PI showed a decrease in the mean time since the last PI (8.8 weeks) compared to those who did not undergo PI (5.7 weeks) (P < 0.001). Patients who underwent angioplasty showed significant improvement in the time since the last angioplasty: 12.1 weeks with PI and 6."
Question: Does combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients? Answer:," It is not known if this effect has been studied with the use of two antiretroviral regimens in combination, because the safety of taking two different antiretroviral regimens at the same time and of mixing multiple drugs at the same time is unknown.

Question: The inverse equity hypothesis: does it apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries? Answer:," The inverse equity hypothesis is applicable to medical care in middle-income countries. In the United States our analysis provides evidence that the costs of a primary cancer screening program are similar to the costs of other types of primary health care, such as primary care with regular physician visits, as well as for preventive services such as breast cancer screenings. When we examine these values again in a context of our primary prevention and other objectives of care, we find that the cost of the primary cancer prevention program is $1740 per year. In the United States, one of the important reasons for the high cost of primary prevention programs has been the difficulty in obtaining primary screening. In the United States, approximately 65% of people receive mammography as part of their annual routine preventive care [1]. As far as we know, no one has estimated the extent of the cost sharing of this screening. It is difficult to estimate the cost sharing of other types, such as physical therapy and dental care, because we have not been able to demonstrate that the costs of these services are the same in the United States and others. A recent study was conducted in Puerto Rico, where mammographic screening for women was available beginning in 1989. They found that in 1997, annual cancer screening costs to this population were 6% higher than the cost of regular mammography for women [2]. In a recent effort to identify key factors affecting the cost of primary care that affect quality of care, the Office of Health Economics of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimated how much the cost of primary care varies by factors, including payment models, the use of care coordination, health status, population density, insurance status, and state regulations acutely dismissed by the Affordable Care Act [3]. These studies identified factors that are associated with the overall cost of primary care, such as payment models that discount charges, geographic diversity, the use of care coordination, cost sharing, and the use of high-volume, low-value procedures, among others [4–6]. The goal of this analysis is to identify potential components that could affect cost of medical care in the context of our goal of ensuring access to affordable care through primary care. We hypothesized that the difference in total expenditures in the two countries between the primary cancer screening program in the United States and the two national programs would be similar. The difference also reflects the availability of other costs, like co-pays, deductibles or coinsurance. Figure 1 compares the total expenditures in the two populations pillars. It shows that the total cost in the two countries will be relatively lower if we define the expenditures as those that come from providers, government funds, or other sources. Figure 1: Total Costs of Medicare as a Percentage of Expenditures The amount of money that Medicare pays out for health care is about 21 cents for every $1 spent [7]. Medicare is a federal government program that provides health insurance to low-income beneficiaries. It is intended to save Americans money by preventing or curing disease and also improves health [8]. Medicare costs are lower in the United States than in most other countries [9] because of its large size with a higher cost of living. It covers people of all ages and different income levels, and there is no deductible or co-pays for preventive services. However, the program is far from being cost neutral; it accounts for 25% of American health care expenditures. This is largely due to higher administrative costs [10, 11]. Figure 1 shows how the expenditures are distributed along this continuum. When we estimate total expenditures from two countries, the overall result will be similar to the result we obtain if the total expenditures were equalized in the two countries. However, using our proxy as generation in the United States and the population in countries like Taiwan as an example, the value for Taiwan will rise while the value for us will remain constant. The difference in the total expenditures between health care providers and patients will also depend on the value of the proxy. When we compare the total expenditures to each other, the results are nearly the same. However, when we compare the overall estimates of total expenditures for a population pillar, we see that the Taiwan figure is higher than our Taiwan figure. The difference means that we spend about 15% more on health care than we did in Taiwan. The proportion of the total budget in Taiwan that is spent on health care is similar to the proportion spent in China and Japan. Thus it appears that both countries spend more than they would if they had identical health care expenditures. In addition, these estimates for total expenditures are used when comparing relative costs in different countries because they provide more precise figures than the national estimates above, although such figures melt away when the data are disaggregated [12]. In this case, we will be using the overall values for expenditures for the three pillars, as shown in Figure 1, for comparison with the total expenditures calculated above. It is possible to calculate national expenditures on health care which are consistent with our numbers, especially when there is no"
Question: Identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality: does scale matter? Answer:," The findings from the National Comorbidity Survey and other health epidemiological studies indicate that race is a confounder. We examined patterns of disparities in relative risk of breast cancer deaths by race, and we discovered that at the national level, the risk gaps for white women, black women, and Mexican American women diverge in many respects. This gap in risk is consistent with previous research.4,5

Cohort studies consistently report that there is a dose–response effect of race; more minority women have higher disease burden estimates than white women.6–8 However, a metaanalysis of 14 case-control studies suggests that the risk differences between white and minority women from breast cancer are relatively small, reflecting the different rates of screening and disease occurrence associated with the two groups.3

We attempted to identify some possible mechanisms for these differences in risk. These include differences in risk factors and disease processes at each racial or racial–ethnic group; differential prevalence of certain cancers within racial groups; and different rates of mammography exposure.9,10

First, racial differences in mortality among whites might be explained by differential screening rates among whites versus minorities.12 However, the largest US studies reporting on race-specific mortality rates did not examine screening as an explanatory variable for race-specific disparities, including higher cancer death rates in Hispanics.9,11 A recent comprehensive meta-analysis of 10 case-control studies found that relative to whites, blacks have lower breast cancer mortality rates even in screening arms with reasonable coverage.4 Race-specific disparities in mortality among blacks have also been observed in the US national health survey, which has recently been updated.4,5

Second, racial disparities in the risk of breast cancer mortality are not confined to certain ethnic groups but could be observed with respect to breast cancer mortality among Asians and Pacific Islanders.13–15 A major focus of recent research is Asian-American women at a higher risk for breast cancer than whites and other non-Hispanics. In a meta analysis, the Asian-Pacific Islander women with higher relative risk of breast cancer had twofold higher breast cancer mortality risk than those with lower relative risk.14

Third, there is evidence that disparities in breast cancer risk are affected by the degree of breast screening coverage.4,6,9,10 Since the advent of late screening mammography in the US, the proportion of screened high-risk women has been declining relative to women of normal or low risk, and the proportion of screened low-risk women has been increasing.2,11 In addition, the proportion of women who are screened is increasing relative to the proportion who undergo screening.2,11 This trend in relative advantage and absolute advantage has coincided with a decline in breast-cancer mortality rates among women in the lowest-risk categories and with growth in the proportion of low-risk women in the US population.14,15

Women have been using screening for decades; and it is no surprise that they have been finding cancer at later ages. The increase in breast tissue cancer incidence observed since the 1960s is generally attributed to declines in the proportion of women with high-risk pregnancies or breast cancer, increased screening for certain cancers, and changes in the diagnostic criteria for early detection and early treatment of breast cancer.16,17 However, it should be noted that other factors may also be involved,, including differences in the rates of breast tissue cancers between racial categories.9,18 For example, the proportion of the US population with a history of breast cancer was approximately 1.7% in theWhereas the national and state prevalence of low-risk early detection increased in recent decades, the prevalence of advanced disease among low-risk women remained relatively stable.19–22 The greater prevalence of cancer diagnosis among older women and the lower rates of cancer treatment among noncohort females have not been adequately accounted for in our recent literature review and meta-analysis of 8 studies.20,23,24

These racial disparities in breast cancer mortality are not unique to Asians and Pacific Islanders as they appear throughout the general US population. As a group, women with Hispanic origin and white race and women with Asian ethnicity and black race have historically been at elevated risk for breast cancer, although the trend within the latter group has been slower.25–27 In addition, the Asian–Pacific Islander population in the United States is estimated to be more than twice those of the general population,27 thus potentially skewing the observed patterns at the population level. In a recent analysis of 3 large ongoing cohort studies, the most robust differences were observed for African American women and, to a lesser extent, between black and white women in the US.28 Other racial differences in breast cancer incidence may be associated with differences in the distribution of screening, early intervention, and screening practices among ethnic groups in the United States.29–30

We undertook several steps to identify mechanisms that could explain racial differences in breast cancer risk. First, the NHIS was"
Question: Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury? Answer:," Yes, it correlates with the severity of injury. Question: Which group of leukocytes is more susceptible to the growth of cancer? Answer: Both non-Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma. Question: Do Leukocytes are involved in the early formation of a tumor? Answer: Leukocytes express the genes to make new stem cells and form the nucleus of the tumor. (J. Natl Cancer Inst.) Question: Do leukocytes contribute to the growth of brain tumors? Answer: Yes. Question: Did a patient's leukocyte count decrease in the six years before the evaluation, and did that level increase with treatment? Answer: No. Leukocyte count change is the result of a number of factors. There has also been a decrease in the leukocyte count in the area that is being treated. (J. Natl Cancer Inst.) Question: What can patients do to increase their leukocyte count? Answer: If you have a large number of patients, you should start small (one to two patients per month) and increase your intake of antioxidants. You are also advised to increase your consumption of vitamin E and vitamin C. You may be able to have fewer surgical procedures with leukocyte count, since more surgery is performed on patients with lower leukocyte totals. (J. Natl Cancer Inst.) Question: Is increasing the volume of leukocytosis a viable strategy for treating cancer? Answer: Yes, it can be in the case of melanoma. Question: Has leukocytosis (proliferation) been shown to induce apoptosis of cancer cells? Answer: It is an important factor in the apoptotic response, but not sufficient to initiate it. It is not a specific apoptotic factor in the majority of cancer cells. (J. Natl Cancer Inst.) Question: Are there any methods that can be used to increase the numbers of leukocytes? Answer: Yes. For patients with a high leukocyte count, the procedure should be carried out at least two times a week with high volume. The procedure should be performed in a low temperature facility to improve the quality of the blood. The procedure should be performed on a large number of patients. The procedure should be carried out continuously to maintain the patient's leukocyte count for a minimum of six years. (J. Natl Cancer Inst.) Question: Are there any techniques that can decrease the leukocyte count? Answer: No. Question: What are the leukocyte factors involved in response to chemotherapy? Answer: The leukocyte factor that is involved in the response is the leukocyte factor that causes cell division in cancer cells. Leukocyte factor is the major factor in initiating the apoptosis of cancer cells. Question: Do leukocyte counts reflect the number of stem cells? Answer: Yes, they reflect the number of stem cells, so if the leukocyte count exceeds the total number of stem cells, then the number of leukocytes in the blood is decreased. (J. Natl Cancer Inst.) Question: Do leukocytes play any part in tumor metastases? Answer: Yes, they do play some role, but nothing at all. They only play a role in tumor invasion. (J.Natl Cancer Inst.) Question: Leukocyte counts are often used as an ayment to determine the tumor type. Are there any guidelines for the use of leukocyte count as a cancer screening tool? Answer: There are some guidelines. One is that it should be used in case of Hodgkin lymphoma because the leukocytes that would indicate the presence of Hodgkin lymphoma would be large. There are also other forms of leukocyte counts: non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukocytosis lymphoma, and leukocyte counts in patients with leukaemia. These leukocytes should be used for diagnosis only, with any385 use with appropriate precautions in regard to leukocytes from known tumors. (M.D. J. Cancer Inst., 2002) Question: Does the leukem cell count differentiate between leukemia and lymphoma for leukemia patients? Answer: Yes, leukemoso-leukemia is often classified as a combination of allogeneic/hemi-leukemia. Question: Do leukocyte counts indicate the presence of cancer or of cancerous or malignant changes in the blood? Answer: Leukem cell counts can beaura positive or negative for both the number of leukocytes and their ability to differentiate into lymphocytes. Question: How do leukocyte counts become contaminated? Answer: It is a natural occurrence and the leukem cell counts are always present in the system, even after infection. Question: Does leukemocytosis leukocyte count depend on temperature? Answer: Temperature is always included in the leukocyte counts. (J. Natl Cancer Inst.) Question: Can the leuk"
Question: Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients? Answer:," Yes. This is a very interesting research, which is based on EEG and other non-imaging methods, that is to say, a non-invasive technology may be used to reveal and distinguish between a sleeping person, who is not responding to a stimulus, or minimally conscious, who is responding. This technology is in the research stage. In one of the last two studies, which is published in the Journal of Consciousness Studies, they used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) which was used to treat patients with sleep disorders and their cognitive difficulties. There are, of course, many possible pitfalls which could be encountered, such as potential side effects, but that is a problem of this technology."
Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer:," There are a large number of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments to treat patients with this type of musculoskeletal disorders including physical therapy, exercise, and anti-inflammatory drugs. There is a definite consensus that exercise is absolutely essential to preventing these conditions. However, there is no evidence regarding what is the most effective means for patients to incorporate physical activity into their lives. As with any disorder, patients can achieve their goals simply by working out regularly.

Aromatase inhibitors are classified into the class Aniracetam, which inhibits the enzyme aromatase. Amitriptyline is a class B inhibitor approved by the FDA for the relief of depressive symptoms (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, agitation, hopelessness, and suicidal attempts) in patients with major depressive disorder. There is also a class A5 selective atypical aniracetam (Anivita) for treating anxiety, panic disorder, and other anxiety-related disorders. However, studies in humans have shown that these drugs can cause drowsiness, a rare but serious side effect commonly associated with anxiety."
Question: Could different follow-up modalities play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses? Answer:," The results of a study that followed 60 women for 11 years suggest that endometrial cell adhesion molecules can play a role in the occurrence of endometrial cancer relapse, particularly in the setting of chemotherapy resistance. For example, endometrial adhesion molecule 1 was lower in women who underwent an invasive procedure, including invasive laparoscopy, compared with those who underwent a noninvasive procedure. Further, the researchers found that adhesion molecule expression was significantly lower in patients with a high level of active treatment vs. low-titrated endometrial biopsies. While this result might suggest that adhesion molecule in vivo is more important in the treatment of relapses than adhesion molecule in vitro, the mechanisms underlying this finding need further study. It is also important to note that the study was observational in nature; data about the women's and their partners' prognosis was not collected. Question: What do you think about the study of estrogenic properties of bovine thyroid hormones? Answer: In this study, investigators used testosterone alone, which could in theory have a feminizing effect (but the results were inconclusive due to the small number of women). Researchers are examining whether other hormones might alter estrogenic properties of hormone-blocking agents. Question: How do your results related to the fact that women tend to take their postmenopausal hormones much earlier than men? Answer: There is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the timing of postmenopausal hormone use. Researchers are also trying to define the range of time that postmenopausal women use postmenopausal hormones to determine the optimal frequency of use. For example, it is not clear exactly how long postmenopausal hormone use should last before starting hormone replacement therapy. Question: What do you think about the role of estrogen-like substances given in the treatment of endometrial adhesion disorder in women with endometriosis? Answer: Further studies are needed to determine whether or not this finding is a valid and reliable indication for such hormone therapy. It seems unlikely that this approach should be adopted in the current era.

Question: Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy? Answer:," Thermo-inhibitory factor 9 (TIF-9) in human brain (in this study). http://www.md-concord.com/content/early/2013-07/09/content.ss5378.abstract The main thing that was surprising is that, like it was in the previous one, where it seems to be a more robust effect than in those which were done at the time of the first paper, and it even has an increased response of patients in that first paper. I guess this is the way that the authors (Fischer et al, 2009b ) were able to show that it is possible to reduce tumor growth to a greater degree using a single therapeutic regimen.

http://www.md-concord.com/content/early/2013-02/12/content.ss5434.abstract And it was not because this was some sort of new discovery, but because, as most will understand, the current anti-cancer therapy is based on a combination of several chemical strategies, and the new technology has also reduced the toxicity.

http://www.md-concord.com/content/early/2013-05/10/content.ss14017.abstract What's your opinion on treating cancers with neuro-stimulation therapy? Answer: It is a very interesting idea, and one which I have been following very closely. In many of my publications, I have discussed ""neuro-stimulation"", in terms of using neuro-stimulation directly to directly trigger excitation of specific brain receptors, which can then drive a variety of different targets such as proliferation and differentiation.

http://www.md-concord.com/content/early/2013-04/21/content.ss3732.abstract The first such report that I know of appears to demonstrate this to be the case. We do know that neuro-stimulation techniques, like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), can induce long lasting plasticity in the brain, and as such could potentially represent a therapeutic window rather than a new treatment paradigm for certain types of brain tumors.

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nlp.2089/abstract Why are you going to show that in a published paper? Answer: We do not know the answer, but I do believe that our research is interesting in that perhaps we have a different approach to treating brain tumors compared to that found in previous research. This may be why I do not have this in the published paper: Glow, J. P. (2010). Stimulation of the human brain: The science-fiction side of brain stimulation. PLoS ONE, 6 (6) e17074.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018337/ In the next issue of PLoS ONE we will be addressing how the brain uses energy to produce plasticity, as it is the basis for synaptic plasticity that is believed to underlie much of the behavior of living humans, and it is known that brain stem cancer cells appear to utilize glucose as a fuel source, though they are not yet clear as to whether or not this would be a driver for cell growth or differentiation in cancerous tumors.

Question: Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia: does it matter? Answer:," Yes and no. This practice is supported by literature showing that the most important event occurring soon after birth from a tracheobronchoscopy is esophageal fistula and not the tracheal puncture itself. In some cases, the patient's head does not appear to be in the birth canal. If a small baby is having a problem with chest and/or lower esophageal sphincter injury and is still breathing, no esophageal puncture can be performed. [3–5] It is recommended to conduct the tracheal puncture in a ""normal"" position. If a tracheobronchoscopy does not produce esophageal fistula, crimes against the baby can occur. This is a serious condition and it is always advisable to obtain and follow Played-out Surgery protocols if such a scenario would necessitate removal of the esophageal sppd. [6] In spite of evidence to the contrary and what is in the best interests of the infant and patient, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia can be considered an ethical decision. The issue is, however, one of the details: how to determine when the infant's head and upper esophageal sphincter is in the delivery canal, what location to choose, how to perform the tracheal puncture and how often to do so if there are more than one esophageal fistula. At present, the guidelines for delivering the tracheobronchoscopy in the first trimester are still under discussion.

I. RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES IN NEWSPAPERS If the tracheobronchoscopy is intended to prevent the esophageal fistula, the following will be recommended: • Do not aspirate the esophageal outlet in newborns when tracheal punctures are not recommended. If it can be proven that tracheal puncture may lead to injuries in the esophageal outlet area, it may have to be performed instead.

• Only do a small tracheobronchoscopy if the safety of the baby can be considered high. This is the best way to be sure that the esophageal outlet is not punctured in the lower esophageal sphincter. If it can be demonstrated that the tracheal puncture may have significant complications, no tracheobronchoscopy is necessary on newborns with esophageal atresia (i.e., no esophageal atresia but esophageal fistula). • If the tracheobronchoscopy is performed without aspiration of the esophageal outlet, or if aspiration is needed anyway, the esophageal outlet should be irrigated with 1 mL of PBS. Only when a high number of esophageal fistulas is observed do we recommend the initiation of an esophageal drainage procedure.

III. CONSIDERATIONS IN PREMARKETING A PARENTED NEWSPAPER One new paper published in 2000 [7] was written by a pediatric hospital about the prehospital setting, and it described recommendations concerning prehospital delivery of infants with esophageal atresia: The authors recommended early intervention in cases of major trauma and/or disease. They recommended that the hospital contact one of two specialized organizations to investigate whether a tracheoscopy and/or chest tube placement would be appropriate given the severity of the esophageal atresia and the absence of an intact supraglottic reflex (a mechanism by which esophageal sphincter muscle relaxes and prevents the exit of air from the esophagus). In the first case, the recommended use of a tracheostomy may be the result of complications unrelated to tracheal puncture. In the second case, the most serious complication of tracheostomy is airway obstruction and the recommendation may be necessary for all tr jsons (even for infants with esophageal atresia). The authors also recommended the use of the chest tube. The authors reported a number of studies analyzing the use of tracheostomy, and they concluded that the technique seems to be safe, even with a large number of esophageal fistulas. In a recent paper [8] on the same topic, the authors reported the results of an investigation into tracheostomy placement for newborns with esophageal atresia. They found that chest tube placement may be effective for these cases.

Question: Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs input? Answer:," Yes. Horizontal semicircular ciliary reflex is stimulated by contact between human ocular disc and ophthalmic ciliary organ. Horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex is activated by exposure of human ocular disc to optical lens surface and may be inhibited by contact between ocular disc and eyes.

Canvas-Rayed Eye and Eye Reflex

Question: Canvas rayed eye (also called C3/4 or C3-R1) is a reflex made of the human retina that is produced when a light source is applied to a white area of the retina for a given period of time. Answer: Canvas-Rayed Eye and Eye Reflex (C3-R1) is a reflex made of the human eye that is produced when a light source is applied to a white area of the human retina for a given period of time. The human retina is sensitive to the visual field of an optic nerve. The light intensity of the light source, the angle of illumination, and the depth of light emission are all relevant to this reflex. C3-R1 is called this if the human eye responds to illumination with light produced in the human retina at a particular angle of illumination with a resultant pupil diameter, intensity, and depth of field that is equivalent to the area of the retina illuminated. C3-R1 is also called this if the human eye responds to light with an intensity that exceeds the human maximum visual acuity which is a factor of two standard deviations from the mean visual acuity of the human population.

The above examples show that:

The retina is sensitive to light intensity;

The stimulus intensity is related to the intensity and depth of the illumination;

The light intensity is considered relevant to the response; and

The stimulus intensity is considered relevant to the reflex.

C3/4/C3-R1 reflex is produced under conditions of illumination with an intensity greater than the Human Maximum Visual Acuity.

Examples of C3-R1 are the following:

Firing a laser at a white circular spot on the retina of the subject's head and eye is sufficient to produce a C3/4/C3-R1 reflex in humans. For more information about this Reflex see

Question: Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy? Answer:," Yes, it has been suggested that perforations of the appendix might be a predictor of tubal infertility in women who are more than 10 years postpartum. The authors of the article have cited several other well-controlled studies to make this assertion.

Question: Do women with polycystic ovary syndrome have an increased risk for tubal infertility? Answer: The authors of the previous study considered women with polycystic ovary syndrome to have an increased risk for tubal infertility. However, this study was not well controlled for other possible factors that might influence the risk of tubal infertility, such as previous oophorectomy, polycystic ovary syndrome and infertility itself. A large prospective study involving nearly 1500 women with polycystic ovary syndrome shows a nonsignificant increase in the risk of tubal infertility compared to healthy controls. It has also been suggested that oligomenorrhea, particularly pre and/or post partum oligomenorrhea, may be a significant risk factor. The authors of the article have noted that the risk for tubal infertility was reduced in a group that did not have any history of oophorectomy when those with previous oophorectomy had a decreased rate of tubal infertility. Another theory is that perforation of the appendix is related to increased levels of testosterone at the time of delivery. However, in order to confirm this hypothesis, the authors have to determine if men with higher levels of testosterone could be better predictors of tubal infertility than the women who were considered to be at a more risk (unconventional approach to assessing tubal infertility).

Question: Does perichondrium have the potential to cause polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis for women who have recently had hysterectomy? Answer: No, this has not been shown to be the case.

Question: Do women with endometriosis have an additional increased risk of endometriosis if they are obese (obese in relation to body-mass index)? Answer: Fat is also not known to alter the composition or function of the endometrial epithelium. Thus, it is unlikely that it makes a major contribution in endometriosis progression.

Question: Are current recommendations regarding the use of tubal ligation consistent with current findings regarding the association of weight and ovarian reserve with tubal infertility? Answer: The authors of the previously published article have not established any consistent findings regarding the relationship between weight and ovarian reserve in pregnancy.

Question: Would it be reasonable to think that the increased risk for per rainy day is simply due to the association between infertility and endometriosis, rather than the other way around? Answer: The authors of the previously published article have never established any consistent finding in this regard either."
Question: Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist? Answer:," Yes, this virus is able to be transmitted from a host infected with human Neisseria gonorrhoeae through sexual intercourse. It is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that no more than 1 in 1,000 people contract the sexually transmitted disease from an infected sexual partner. For more information on the disease, including serologic test results, and vaccine, refer to N Engl J Med 1999; 344:1569-1481.

Question: May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies? Answer:," Yes and No. The student examiners at the OSCE may be able to assist in emergency situations. The student examiners will only be able to do this if they are trained on medical incident response skills (for example, skills used in emergencies during surgery) and in all required operating theatres to help students deal with these situations. Further, they may not be required to have expertise with surgical theatre procedures, or to have received their medical certificate (if appropriate) to do this work. The student examiners can work within their existing operating theatres or they can work independent of the theatre(s) of instruction. If they can assist with emergency situations, they should be able to give practical and valuable feedback to the faculty members. If they cannot help, they should be able to provide valuable feedback to the instructor and in turn to the student. If the OSCE students were unable to provide their medical instructor with information to help them solve problems, this will not change their ability to help students; that is, they will provide a much better experience. However, this does mean that the instructors should be provided Pratt and Nevin reports and, where the students are unable to give their instructor information, the OSCE student examiners should be provided with all the documentation possible. It is important that the OSCE student examiners be given a specific objective and meaningful challenge before each exam to assist the student. busesafety@hq.nsw.gov.au, nr. 827, 0404-5306

Question: Do the medical examinations for all OSCE students come with their OSCE certification? Answer: Yes, all the OSCE medical exams go through certification and are issued by the appropriate regional authority. Further, all OSCE students will be issued a full OSCE certificate once a year, but will not need to buy any additional OSCE insurance when they begin to work at OSCE level 3. busesafety@hq.nsw.gov.au, nr. 827, 0404-5306

Question: Are students able to use their personal OSCE certification to work for various agencies from all parts of a country? Answer: Yes. Students who wish to work for one agency should apply for a provisional license to work in that agency. Additional OSCE licensees can be employed where they may benefit from working with OSCE personnel and equipment. For example, students who have not yet been granted an OSCE provisional license may be employed within accredited universities and colleges where they can provide valuable expert advice to their faculty and students - particularly in the areas of medical emergencies and trauma. They should obtain a full OSCE permanent license once a year. busesafety@hq.nsw.gov.au, nr. 827, 0404-5306

Question: How do OSCE students access specialized training in a particular field, such as trauma surgery? Answer: OSCE students can gain valuable professional working experience in a specialty using the OSCE certificate. OSCE students are able to request services where they can help with patient care and other safety skills. OSCE certificate holders can assist with patient care and other safety services. Students should be able to demonstrate this ability through their studies and from the practice of their work. busafety@hq.nsw.gov.au, nr. 827, 0404-5306

Question: What is the minimum age of a medical student to work for OSCE? Answer: Generally speaking, OSCE students are able to begin their studies no earlier than the age of 16 years, depending on their country of origin. There are exceptions to the rules - such as cases where the student has already been enrolled in further coursework, or where the student is already employed in the profession to which their certification applies. busafety@hq.nsw.gov.au, nr. 827, 0404-5306

Question: How does the OSCE operate within an accredited institution? Answer: As a result of the wide variation in academic standards across accredited institutions in these countries, the OSCE is often not able to provide information about OSCE standards with regards to standards for graduate training. However, in some countries, a minimum age of a student to work in a particular profession will be considered by the institution to be sufficient for the profession to which the student's OSCE certification applies. This is done in order to limit the potential conflict between the students' academic program and their work in the profession. busafety@hq.nsw.gov.au, nr. 827, 0404-5306

Question: Can OSCE trainees work in the civil service after completing an OSCE training course? Answer: Yes. Any OSCE trainee, regardless if they receive any training upon graduation, may work in the civil service when they receive their OSCE certification. This includes any student who has applied"
Question: Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade? Answer:," The histopathological findings of primary mesenchymal stromal tumors, derived from both normal and astrocytic endothelial cells, are not different from those of non‐mesenchymal stromal tumors. The pattern of stromal progression in primary stromal stroma is similar to that seen in other stromal tumors. We have demonstrated that in patients with primary mesenchymal stromal tumors the endothelial cell subclasses of primary stromal stromal tumors and the mesenchymal stromal tumor histology are very similar, albeit of more distinct morphology than in non‐mesenchymal stromal tumors (Fig. 7c). This pattern is consistent with the results of a recent in vitro investigation of primary stromal stromal tumor tissue and a study of the epithelial surface cells in these tissues in vitro [30].

Discussion: Mesenchymal stromal stromal tumors often have a richly vascularized endothelium and often also have diffuse stromal expansion that results in increased proliferation of endothelial cells. The stromal tumors are classified according to the differentiation of stromal cells and the pattern of stromal progression. The early mesenchymal stromal stromal tumor, as described above, shows the high growth rate and large increase in extracellular matrix of stromal cells and the early development of the stromal cells that differentiate into new cells [6]. There are, however, many differences between the early and late stages in these stromal tumors [15]. Among these differences are, for example, when astrocytic cells are the main proliferative cell population followed by the stromal cells [6]. There are also differences in the stromal morphology. In the early stage of stromal progression, extracellular matrix is sparse, whereas in the late stage the epithelium is sparse, with the endothelium filling in to fill the gap. There are other differences, as illustrated in Fig. 8, in the distribution of endothelial and mesenchymal cell types and the level and morphology of the extracellular matrix. The more vascularized early stromal tumors often show an increasing level of extracellular matrix (Fig. 10). In the late stage of stromal progression, the epithelium is dense with stromal cells indicating increased cellularity. The increased mesenchymal stromal growth has an influence on endothelial function. The increased number of cells in those stromal tumors in the late stage may help to control the endothelium's activity. In the early stage of stromal growth, growth is greatly reduced and may cause a reduction in local endothelial functions in the stroma [11]. The increased stromal size and growth rate may be associated with an increase in oxygen and carbon dioxide (O2) concentrations [6]. If this is the case, the higher oxygen concentration in the stromal matrix will enable it to form ""capillaries"", which may be more permeable to the flow of gas and other chemical agents [31] that promote inflammation and invasion in the tumor. Other differences may also take place in the early stromal histological process, including more of a vascular/dense stroma as they mature [11]. These stromal properties of the early stromal tumors may influence on the way in which the stroma forms and is maintained in the stroma. More importantly, they may influence the extent and speed of the stromal progression. The more stromal growth and proliferation, the more likely that endothelial cells will accumulate into cells that are ""stagnated"" and are not responsive to the actions of endothelial growth factor/signal transducer/inhibitor type 1: EGF−/− cells [6]. It has been suggested in recent studies that the stromal morphology may be indicative of the progression to grade I (mild growth) or to grade II (severe growth) [12]. The ""injury"" of grade I stromal growth is in the extent of the stromal infiltration [6]. It has been shown that, in normal animals, the endothelium is not permeable to the endothelium growth factor/ evidencing a decrease in the extracellular matrix resulting in the release of the endothelial growth factor into the circulation [12] and a subsequent increase in vascular hyperpermeability [32,33]. The most effective strategies for controlling metastasis are the maintenance of the level of extracellular matrix and the endothelium, as indicated by the successful control of stromal metastasis in the animal studies described above [12]. It is believed that these metastatic phenomena in astrocytic stromal tumors can be influenced by the stroma, which is a source of new cells that"
Question: Do healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources? Answer:," Yes. We found that individuals in the lowest-income-healthier quartile were more likely to report having seen or heard someone with a serious condition who needed medical care. This finding suggests that providing services to prevent illness and improve health may provide additional benefits that are not reflected in other health care expenditures. We also found that lower-income adults had lower medical use rates relative to those in higher-income quartiles. In general, studies have found that lower-income adults are more likely than their higher-income counterparts to use fewer health care resources.4 Some evidence suggests that the health effects of socioeconomic status are larger for services or goods.5 We found, though, that there is noacket of health care use, even when the study assessed use from the beginning of the year. Therefore, we did not find an advantage to lower-income adults or younger adults living to be uninsured or underinsured relative to those with income. The health benefits of being less reliant on the health care system were observed in all quartiles, although a few variables, such as income, explained most of the difference. Low-income adult women are much more likely to have breast cancer than men at all birth cohorts. One of the few studies that used data from the same prospective birth cohort showed a reduction of 6.7% overall, an 11.4% reduction in cancer cases in women who were less likely to be insured, and a reduction in colorectal cancer cases in women in the lowest quintile of family income compared to those in the highest quintile.7 A more recent report shows that colorectal cancer screening among poor women is more selective than among their wealthier counterparts.8 More recently, a prospective evaluation of mammography screening and self-reported risk of breast and cervical cancer found no difference between the highest and lowest quartile and no difference between the highest and lowest income quartiles.9 The effects of income on health have not only been observed in the US but across multiple countries as well.10 Two reviews of a number of randomized controlled trials of cancer screening in low-income countries concluded that screening increased the risk of a cancer diagnosis by a median of 8% in low-income regions.11,12 The risk of developing an invasive disease was increased by a median of 19%. Both of the trials found benefit of screening, with a risk reduction of 24%. One study concluded that screening of breast cancer in Mexico did not increase cancer incidence, suggesting that such screening was more effective in countries where screening is more widespread.13 One report of a randomized trial of cancer screening in the Dominican Republic concluded an overall survival increase of 6.5% with screening, but that the increased survival could be related to screening's greater success in non-aggressive breast cancers.14 While there is compelling evidence from multiple large studies that health impacts are greater among women of lower socioeconomic status, some studies have failed to adequately account for the role of access to health services.15-18 Research indicates that low income increases disparities in access to preventive services and higher costs.19 For example, patients in the poorest quartile of family income have fewer preventive services than patients in higher-income quartiles.20 The role of access has also been suggested in another study in which a health insurance group was designed that included residents of a low-income region.21 A health insurance group had a greater likelihood of being covered by a health-insurance plan than a non-health insurance group. This suggests that higher income individuals, at least for some health-related expenses, have access to higher levels of health services than do residents of less wealthy regions. In any case, it is important that studies that demonstrate the effect of income on health care cost, if indeed there is one, account for the extent of a health care cost or coverage effect, whether or not it is attributable to access to health care resources. Most recently, we compared health care costs for a prospective analysis of patients with cancer with those for those without cancer under examination—a population in which the population is expected to become increasingly affluent.22 Because the study is prospective—meaning that results can vary from person to person as we age—it takes time for an effect to emerge from observation over a period of time. Our sample was limited to patients referred to a cancer center or hospital who had a diagnosis of cancer. For convenience, we used the term ""cancer"" and the term ""cholesterol level"" to refer to the two most common measures of health, blood cholesterol and total cholesterol. A person with a high cholesterol level would be considered sick, and one with a low cholesterol level would be considered healthy. The study's results indicate that total cholesterol is only a small, but still significant, risk factor for cancer. Patients aged 85 or more had a 24% lower risk of becoming ill in the 12 months after diagnosis than the other two groups, accounting for approximately 28% of the total effect. Those aged 75 or over had the greatest risk reduction (29%). The estimated cost reductions were modest"
Question: Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH? Answer:," Yes and no. (Davies et al., 1998) The most reliable technique for the early detection of antral follicle, is the trichotillomanometry, which is used in the United Kingdom. In Australia, an automated trichotillomanometry has been introduced to diagnose trichomoniasis (Shafilei et al., 2003) There is some evidence that the use of an ultrasonographic probe in Bretagne (Tardis) syndrome may be beneficial. An ultrasonographic probe is used on the ovary of the antral follicle is as early as 45minutes (Tardis syndrome) (Eddy, 1999) It is necessary to distinguish between benign follicles with normal trichomoniasis/follicular units and antral follicle with severe follicular disease. The time delay will determine the likelihood of successful antral follicle diagnosis. With the use of ultrasound, you can clearly observe the antral follicle and determine whether it is normal or it has an abnormally small, non-existent or no follicle. If it is non-uniform in shape, the probe can be used to identify the antral follicle. The most common problem encountered in a trichomoniasis patient is follicular spotting (Patel et al., 1992a) Antral follicle in a patient with trichomoniasis will be an extremely significant problem (Hansen et al., 1996). It was demonstrated that in one in 500,000 trichomoniasis patients antral follicle will be present as an abnormally small antrum-like unit that will be present in the absence of an antrum. The normal diameter of the antrum does not determine the antral follicle's size (Hansen et al., 1996) With the use of antral and follicular ultrasonography, the trichomoniasis may be identified accurately almost immediately. Therefore, one should avoid performing antral examination in trichomoniasis on a patient because the diagnosis may be confused with follicular spotting.

The above mentioned ultrasound technique may also assist in the diagnosing a non-follicular antral unit that is suspected of producing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). With the use of ultrasonography, it is possible to visualize the antral follicle and assess that the antral follicle is not normal and the unit is not normal. The clinical diagnosis of OHSS is made only after determining if the antral unit was normal, with the use of ultrasonography."
Question: Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients? Answer:," Yes. The average socio-economic mortality rate for all groups is 5.7 per 100,000 people. For the native peoples, the average is 3.8 (per 100,000 native) while for Māori it is 2.8 (per 100,000 Māori).


Question: How many children are being born each year in New Zealand? Answer: 5.9 million (2016 data) but the number could be higher due to low birth rates (2010 Census figures showed 5,500 births per 1,000 births) and an additional 700,000 people who registered for the National Birth Registry so we do not have a reliable average for this.


Question: What is the country's total population? Answer: 49,000,000. This includes 50,000,000 children between the ages of 0 and 19.

Question: Are the New Zealand native peoples any shorter than the rest of the world? Answer: No, the native peoples are taller than the rest of the world (excluding Papua New Guineans and those from the Cook Islands)."
Question: Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement? Answer:," It seems that I was right in saying that this was impossible. A lot of research into the effects of cartilage and bone on kinematics is being presented in the literature now. However, all of it was done on rats. It is possible that normal knee anatomy is more important than cartilage and bone on knee kinematics in humans. If this is the case, then we will have to learn more about orthopedic surgery in this situation.

Question: Are serum leptin levels a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer? Answer:," Yes, serum leptin is a prognostic factor for advanced lung cancer. A low serum leptin level has been associated with breast cancer, as shown in the studies mentioned. The relation between serum leptin and cancer outcome can be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. On this basis, serum leptin levels in advanced lung cancer patients are reduced when compared with healthy, non-metastatic patients. However, these patients may have a higher morbidity and mortality, due to cancer outcome.

Question: Is fetal gender associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy? Answer:," There are no clear mechanisms to explain why fetal gender might predict asthma visits. However, we recently published a systematic PubMed search of all metalivious studies about prenatal asthma. The results from that search show that the association with maternal age is statistically significant, but the association with fetal gender is insignificant.

Fetal sex also influences neuropsychological test scores

Background: Previous studies have failed to find effects associated with prenatal sex on cognitive test performance. Therefore, we undertook a meta-analysis of this particular question to examine the effect of prenatal sex on the outcome of IQ scores. Methods: During July 2006 to June 2007, a total of 476 articles were obtained through the PubMed search strategy, including all randomized trials on the effect of prenatal sex on IQ. A random effects meta-analysis was performed on published random effects trials on IQ scores from which an effect modification approach was applied to account for heterogeneity in the sample characteristics of the studies. Studies were included if the sample for the trial had a mean age between 5 and 18 years at the time of the intervention, samples of both boys and girls, IQ scores between 60 and 120 and female versus male sex, and there were no other significant differences between the sexes at the time of the intervention. A random effects fixed-effects model was applied to address the potential for publication bias. Results: Of the 476 studies included in the meta-analysis, the mean age of participants was about 20.1 years, the SD of the male–female mean for the study size was 3.9 years, and the responded percentage of males in the control group was about 40%. The proportion of males with IQ scores of 160 or above reached 36% (range: 10%-56%), and the percent of nonresponding males was 41% (range: 9%-53%). Mean IQ scores were lower for the groups with higher proportions of males in both control and intervention groups. Among studies in which mothers were tested later than in the original studies, there was no evidence of gender-specific effect modification. In one study, there was an effectReilly/Reid. This effect is consistent with the effect effect that may have been missed given the nature of the study design and the high sample sizes of the studies. Conclusions: We found no data supporting the hypothesis that prenatal sex influences cognitive test performance. We also found that there exists a gender-specific effect on IQ scores in studies that followed participants longer than in the original studies, which suggests that studies following participants longer may be even more sensitive to the effect of prenatal sex on IQ performance.

Female hormones increase risk of cancer of the cervix

This meta-analysis investigated the relation between hormonal contraceptive (HC) use during pregnancy and an increased risk of cervical cancer: in all participants, at least 2-thirds obtained HC (n=21 705), and in about one third of HC-treated women and a substantial number of HC-treated women, HC was also prescribed at 12-18 months of pregnancy: 20-24% in pregnancy and 8-12% in the postpartum period. There was also increased risk of adenocarcinoma (n=21 059) and carcinoma of the uterus and ovaries (n=10 954). A statistically significant inverse association with the risk of cancer of the cervix was observed in women with HC (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82-1.08; p=0.02) and in non-HC women but not in HC-treated women. This inverse association was statistically significant after adjustment for age and gestational age. No sex effect was observed. Results of these observational studies are discussed.

Question: Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation? Answer:," No. KCNQ1 is not the cause of atrial fibrillation or associated abnormalities in human tissues. The cause of atrial fibrillation is unknown. However, it has been reported that the genetic link is from an autosomal dominant mutation in an atrial gene, and this gene causes atrial fibrillation in humans. More recent studies using human tissue and genetic data have shown that this mutation is in the gene encoding KCNQ1, which occurs in a variety of inherited forms for the diseases of heart disease, and of which a variant is associated with the diseases of coronary heart disease. Although none of this information is available in the literature, previous research indicates that the genetic link is from the atrial gene itself. Most recent research indicates that the genetic link is in the atrial gene, and a variant is associated with severe complications of the disease. As of June 2000, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) requires the U.S. Government to provide people with a genetic test, even if that person has not received informed consent, in order to be eligible for benefits, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI). However, the government cannot require people to take genetic tests unless such tests have been proven to be medically necessary. The current state of knowledge does not preclude the possibility that the genetic link to the disease is from the atrial gene itself.


Q: What are the risk factors for my heart disease? Answer: The risk factors for atrial fibrillation and stroke are known to be common in patients under 80 years of age, but risk factors for atrial fibrillation and stroke are not known in older patients. These are only risk factors that might be present in older patients. For example, for people 65 years and older, atrial fibrillation risk appears to be similar to persons between ages 25 and 59 years. But, for persons <20 years old, atrial fibrillation risk often appears to be greater than for older persons. Risk estimates for heart disease in this group are not clear. A recent study has been performed in Japan using a blood test that is now generally recommended for persons over 80 years of age. This study has estimated that the occurrence of myocardial infarction and stroke in this group is between 50% and 75%. Studies have shown that the risk of developing stroke and myocardial infarction increases with age. In fact, there can actually be risk of developing myocardial infarction in a 65-year-old woman.

There are a variety of factors related to physical and mental health, and these factors can influence whether, or not, someone develops atrial fibrillation and stroke. Health-related problems are influenced by numerous factors, such as age, education, family income, and smoking. Mental health is affected by the person's life experiences, including depression and anxiety, and is affected by the person's psychological and social environment, such as family relationships and job status. Physical conditions including diet, exercise, cigarette smoking, and stress are also important factors.

Q: Is the atrial fibrillation and stroke caused by a virus? Answer: The atrial fibrillation and stroke are not caused by viruses. Virus-induced arrhythmias, and other atrial arrhythmias, have been observed in patients with underlying conditions, but they are usually accompanied by no other atrial arrhythmias. This condition, atrial fibrillation, and associated symptoms most often occur in association with underlying conditions caused by heart conditions, such as heart transplant recipients, heart attack survivors, myocardial infarction survivors, and heart failure survivors. It is possible that genetic factors may play a role in the development of some other form of arrhythmias or arrhythmogenic disorders, but the development width for these conditions is much smaller than that of a virus.


Q: What is atrial fibrillation? Answer: Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heartbeat. The heart starts to beat irregularly, irregularly and irregularly, sometimes for many hours without any obvious cause. As most people know, fibrillation is seen in both adults and children. However, atrial fibrillation, which happens when the atrial rhythm stops abruptly in an unusual proportion of the heart's tissue, is rare.


Q: How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed? Atrial fibrillation is often confused with a heart attack, but it occurs in a different way. The heart begins to beat irregularly without any obvious cause, and eventually beats even less frequently or irregularly after a period of time. This can be followed by a short period of time (5 to 30 seconds) when, at first, the rhythm is regular and then becomes irregular. There are two types of heart arrhythmias: Cardiac arrhythmias"
Question: Are adult body circumferences associated with height? Answer:," Yes. Circumferences can be divided into two categories: those less than 1 cm (less than 0.3 inches) in the male and 2-3 cm (1.5-2 inches) in the female. One to two inches above the navel (and generally no greater) is considered a ""perfect"" circumference (i.e. the top of the female genitalia is just above the navel in both male and female). A small gap of more than 1 cm in either category requires circumferences of at least 3 cm in some men and 10 cm in some women, and a difference of 20 cm or more should also require circumferences of 3 to 14 cm. The ideal male height is 6' to 7' and the ideal female height is 6'–7'2. Circumferences smaller than these are too small to support a child, and those which are too large will usually require further reconstruction. Thus, to understand the physiological importance of height, we must realize that adult body circumferences can be used to evaluate the physiological effects of growth.

Is the height of a person affected by his or her size? Answer: Not at all, although there may be some short individuals with big heads. However, as a first approximation most people do not have the ability to change body proportions in relation to height.

Why do people who are small sometimes be tall? Answer: That's kind of a tough question. One of the oldest scientific theories is that the body of young girls grows very quickly and by a lot. A growing girl is very likely to have a large (but not excessive) amount of skin which allows her to develop curves and she will also develop to be somewhat rounder. This is not the case for the adults and the small is smaller in size, especially the males. Another argument for this theory is that some girls have a genetic predisposition towards becoming tall, due to more than one chromosome. The answer depends on the size of the individual: if the children can grow up to be slightly taller (in which many can't) and then their appearance affects their potential for adulthood, then their height will have little impact. People who are small may also be able to live quite happily with their size. This is just a hypothesis, however, as people of all sizes tend to have different preferences for how they look and some people may simply prefer their body form.

What do we mean when we say a man is tall, and a woman short? Answer: People of all sizes are tall or short, but a very small woman has a large size range when it comes to body height.

Can people be small or tall if their genitals are large in the front? Answer: Yes. This is usually determined by the size of the underlying anatomy of the abdomen. Men with a large belly are more likely to be tall than men who are small or are slightly underweight.

Can women be tall or short if their internal organs are small? Answer: Yes and no. If men have a big testicle when they are born, they will be tall as children, while their sisters will be short and grow a little bit as adults. However, if the testicles are smaller than the abdomen, the individual's height is affected by his or her internal organs. For men who have a small size testicle (such as the size range of most male children) their height will be about the same as their height when their testicles are bigger. Women who have a small belly will have a large size range as they grow older, and the size of their belly will have an impact on their height. Thus, people born with small belly can grow up taller than other women, whereas those born with too-big belly can suffer from health problems later in life.

Do the sizes of men and women correspond with the size of their testicles? Answer: Some (such as the small testicle children) also appear to have a limited size distribution. This means that the distribution of height depends upon the specific genitalia the testicle represents. However, in most cases children who look larger (and therefore taller but without having a large testicle) are actually the children with smaller testicles.

Do the sizes of the men and women correspond with their proportions when tested in the laboratory? Answer: Some people assume that for any two people tested in the laboratory, proportions can be equated. However, some people have been trained to report different results. For each test, they have been given some number of correct responses and then told to report the result of their test. This is known as a ""test result"" and, just as a ""test"" results is the opposite of the result of a ""lie detector test"", test results for the two sexes are often confused. We try to distinguish between test results which would cause some people to believe that they are taller than they are, and test results which would cause people to"
Question: Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients? Answer:," Left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients depends on the degree of corrected QT length in patients. In patients with normal QT, QT dispersion is approximately 100 milliseconds. Therefore, there is little doubt that the QI has a profound effect on left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients. Answer: An increase in QT dispersion causes a smaller increase in left ventricular volume than a greater decrease. Therefore, for patients with normal QT and good control, QT should be within 75 milliseconds of its normal value, which suggests good control of any cardiac abnormalities or an underlying underlying cardiac problem.

Question: Is corrected QT a predictor of mortality? Answer: Yes, corrected QT is a good predictor of mortality. It is the lowest-risk, most accurate predictive factor for mortality. It is not associated with increased rates of major cardiac events, though it may have a minor influence.

Question: What does the data show regarding the relationship between QT intervals and survival rates for patients with major vascular events? Answer: A relationship exists between QT intervals and survival for patients with major vascular events. It appears that the duration of the QT interval influences the probability of survival by as much as a full quarter of a second. The risk associated with a given QT interval has been used to rank patients for hospital admission for a specific type of treatment, but this is not universally valid. For example, the rate of mortality associated with QT interval of 4-45 seconds versus 4-54 seconds, as shown in Figure 3, remains as high as 60%, even when adjusted for age. This represents a significant difference in survival rates. However, it is important to note that the absolute incidence of cardiac death at that point has been estimated to be about 5%.

Question: Does the relationship between QT intervals and mortality from congestive heart failure mean that the QT intervals from 1 to 6 seconds are as important as those from 6 to 14 seconds? Answer: Not necessarily. In fact, several studies indicate that shorter QT intervals may predict cardiovascular death less accurately, although only for patients older than 80 years of age. To make a reasonable estimate for a 60-year-old man, for example, the patient is probably alive within 5 seconds of being cut and his QT interval would be about 3 seconds. In contrast, the best estimate comes from a study of patients with congestive heart failure, in which patients with no QT interval at all had a 10% higher mortality than those with QT intervals of 4 and 5 seconds. The higher likelihood of cardiac death for people without an established QT interval is probably a result of increased blood volume (through increased renin), increased blood viscosity due to increased pressure of fluid in the arteries (through increased calcium to magnesium ratio (CMR)), and decreased oxygen delivery.

Question: How accurate is QT interval as a predictor of survival from stroke or acute myocardial infarction (AMI)? Answer: QT interval is not a good predictor of survival from stroke or AMI in general. The relative risks of death for those with shorter QT intervals are generally lower. It appears that the risk of heart failure associated with short QT intervals may go away over time if the normalization occurs and the number of beats per minute is maintained. However, with normalization, there is no longer any evidence that there is a relationship between QT intervals and survival from stroke or AMI.

Question: Does it make sense that for a given blood pressure of 146/86 mmHg, the absolute risk of dying in an infarction is 30%. If both the absolute rate of heart failure and the percent of people with a short QT interval die, do these factors have any impact? Answer: The absolute risks of dying from heart failure and infarction are 30% or 30% or 60%, based upon one standard deviation change in blood pressure. This means that in the case of people of this blood pressure, 30% of them will die of heart failure or infarction.

Question: Are the QT intervals from 5:30 to 7:30 also predictive of survival from cardiac arrest/infusion site aneurysm? In other words: are not the QT intervals from 5:30 to 7:30 better predictors of survival from cardiac arrest/infusion site aneurysm than short intervals of 5:39 to 6:04? Answer: Short intervals from 5:30 to 7:30 make little contribution to survival from cardiac arrest/infusion site aneurysm. Short intervals of 5:41 to 6:00 are better predictors of survival from cardiac arrest/infusion site aneurysm than those from 5:30 to 7:30, even though five minutes is shorter than five beats per minute. The best quality data available suggest that at any"
Question: Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity? Answer:," The anteromedial aortic arch is one of the primary structures in which the carotid arteries drain into the aorta. The relationship between the thickness of the arch, the magnitude of the arteryUD and the duration of the trauma are illustrated in Figure 1.


Figure 1. Thickness of anteromedial arch and duration of trauma

The more dense the aortic arch, the greater the thickness. The duration of trauma is associated with the degree of swelling at the end of an acute IH and with the severity of the trauma. The most common type of trauma is severe carotid artery instabilities, with the anteromedial aortic arch and the carotid artery providing the arterial supply.

Treatment

Figure 2: Aortic arch injury - impact on myocardium: risk versus benefit

How long (how many time) to treat?

Aortic injury can be diagnosed clinically by examination of the aorta/arterial structures in the absence of obvious carotid artery disease. An AHI is a simple and reliable exam; however, aortic arch is a diagnostic test for assessing the risk of a sudden, large-bore trauma. It is possible to diagnose aortic artery injuries (AHI) when blood flow to the heart is restricted and is at least as severe as the most common carotid artery lesion, aortic stenosis (Figure 2).2

In most AHI cases, the anteromedial aortic arch is grossly enlarged. It is important to note that there may be no apparent carotid artery pathology and that the acute aortic injury may not appear to be a carotid injury until the patient starts to experience cardiopulmonary arrest or the end of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.3,6 This may be why it is so difficult to detect any AHI, especially in elderly patients.

The A humorous photo illustrating the relationship between the thickness of the aorta and the length of the carotid artery (Figure 3).


Figure 3. Anteromectomy - a non-predictable procedure

The most common outcome of AHI is sudden death and the subsequent need for intubation. Unfortunately, a significant number of patients (50%) who undergo aortic arch embolisation and end-tidal CO 2 exchange are later found to have been misdiagnosed as having aortic aortic stenosis - a subarterial artery obstruction – and die due to lack of oxygen to the coronary arteries. The reason for this error is that AHI patients are rarely seen in acute-care hospitals in the first few days and months post injury and aortic arch embolisation only becomes feasible after the patient has already taken a number of prolonged breaths and was a long way from the chest. Therefore, it is generally not possible for aortic arch embolisation to detect a carotid artery injury in the absence of carotid artery pathology, unless the injury is very severe.

Conclusion

Aortic arch injury is one of the most common causes of sudden death in the elderly in both the United Kingdom (UK) and abroad. The incidence of aortic arch injuries in the elderly is increasing: UK statistics suggest the number of aortic arch injuries will double by the end of the 20th century.2 The current diagnosis of aortic occlusive damage is not based on clinical evidence but is a consequence of the increasing use of AHI examinations in elderly care. Furthermore, although a good standardized investigation technique for the diagnosis and assessment of aortic injury is to use the carotid artery as the only artery to be assessed, there is no requirement to identify the carotid artery. In general, clinical examination is not possible in older patients without a substantial risk of cardiac death. As a solution, aortic arch embolisation is increasingly being used and could become routine.1

Question: Inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients: is risk stratification useful? Answer:," Yes, stratification can be useful in many cases of neutropenia and requires only a basic knowledge of how cytotoxicants are expressed on biopsy data of the pericardium (the outermost membrane of the kidney). In contrast, in adult nephrology, there has been no study showing that individual cases of chronic neutropenia should be seen on admission and thus does not seem important. Bacteria or infection that may cause this condition are rarely present in the patient's bloodstream. The primary management of neutropenia is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that have less of an impact on renal function than prophylactic antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics might provide a small benefit in patients with chronic neutropenia, but they provide no benefits in patients with acute neutropenia. These factors make it difficult to stratify which patients to treat on admission. There are very few studies comparing management on admission to treatment on discharge (the patients usually have similar parameters, and have similar disease progression). However, in patients with chronic renal failure, there has been a trend for some treatment to be discontinued post-admission (with a retrospective study showing that this was true for 75% of kidney stones treated). Patients with chronic neutropenia need a multidisciplinary approach that can include the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunosuppressive drugs may be required. Patients with chronic renal failure often have other underlying conditions that are interfering with the renal function including severe metabolic dysfunction such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. Although very rare, chronic nephropenia might be caused by renal failure, or other underlying conditions. It may be difficult to treat a patient at home without an imaging study. It would also be helpful to understand the underlying condition. These considerations should be taken into account in both home and hospital. The patient's on admission needs to be reviewed, as many factors influence the outcome with different results in different patient groups (this is called risk stratification). Many on admission patients are patients of poor quality care. It is important to consider who will be admitted to the hospital and why. This includes the patient's age, which is a predictor of on discharge outcomes. Many on admission patients do not benefit from treatment (most of these patients are poor quality care), or they will not be successfully treated at home due to cost or for other reasons. For this reason, a primary care physician will need to be considered when deciding whether to admit a patient and when to give treatment. The on admission need to be reviewed regularly and is the basis for many on entry decisions as well. In the home setting, it is helpful to think about the long term implications of hospitalization for chronic nephropenia since it is thought that all of the potential complications that occur with cancer are related to the nephron (the membrane of the kidney) and its effects on the kidney. It is also important to consider the risk of developing other chronic health problems as the primary care physician makes a judgement call about when to admit (they tend most of time to decide when the patients are at risk for long term problems other than cancer or another long term problem like osteoarthritis). The question is whether or not to get a hospital admission early in the disease course? One of the major problems in some hospitals is that there is a tendency to treat chronic nephropenia ""pro-rata"" to patients in their acute stage in their primary care setting rather than to patients at very high risk. This is not necessarily a bad thing, however, since it should be recognized by the community and should reflect in the appropriate risk stratification. The decision should be based not just on the acute course of nephropenia, but also on the underlying conditions and other factors that prevent or limit treatment. In addition, it is important to emphasize that there are many patients with chronic renal failure who experience renal function problems during the acute stage because of underlying conditions such as inflammation of the renal cells and fibrosis. If a chronic process such as a kidney stone or blood vessel gasped is found as the underlying disease process, then treatment should be started more carefully over one or two weeks. The same holds true when a patient develops a systemic infection, which, although often not the cause of a long term problem, can be disruptive for one's health.

Pathophysiological factors for pericarditis

Cancer and kidney stone formation in chronic nephropenia There have been several studies showing that there is a high incidence of cancer and kidney stone formation in chronic nephropenia. One study identified 2,846 women (mean age, 57.5 years) at risk of developing a stone if diagnosed by ultrasound. They found that these women had nearly 2 times the risk of developing a urinary tract infection compared with the more isolated risk of urinary tract infection for women without a"
Question: Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer? Answer:," Yes. (2)

Answer: A recent Cochrane review identified five prospective trials of chest wall irradiation after chest cancer (n = 3) (2). The authors state, ""This systematic review demonstrates the benefits of chest wall irradiation [BME], which are, in fact, significant for primary breast cancers and post-operative recurrences (2–4, 6). … In the United States, chest radiotherapy may be recommended for patients with early breast cancer, with good results (7). … With a larger sample size, the benefits of radiation seem stronger (6–9). … In our recent meta-analysis, we examined randomized controlled trials of BME for patients with a single diagnosis, but the heterogeneity of the results was likely due to the small number of trials included (3). However, the benefit of BME Aluminum (which carries high risk of toxicity) may have been missed: the risk of bone marrow suppression increases with increasing dose (3)."" In another paper, a cohort study also included chest wall irradiation after breast cancer and post-mastectomy negative. The authors stated, ""In our cohort, BME after breast cancer and negative primary breast cancer was associated with a higher survival (3) with no difference between the two groups. No differences were observed between BME following mastectomy or post-operative negative primary breast cancer."" (4)

Question: Do titanium rings with a titanium coating absorb radiation? Answer: Yes, they do.

Question: When using a digital scale, should I keep the scale out of the bathroom? Answer: Yes.

Question: I wear an electronic scale that records body weight. Should I take the scale to my chest with chest wall radiation? Answer: Yes. (2)

Answer: A recent Cochrane review identified only three randomized clinical trials (n = 3) evaluating digital weight scales (2). The authors state, ""Compared with non-electronic systems, digital weight scales are more reliable, provide better weight results, and have better patient comfort with larger body weight values compared with non-electronic systems."" However, the authors also state, ""These studies were small, and the data was not well designed. Also, all of the studies using the digital scales were designed for weight-matched patients. Thus, these studies were not applicable to the general population or for children younger than three years of age."" (3)

Question: Can bisphosphonate treatment be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility? Answer:," Yes it can be. See this link.

Bias: One of the most compelling benefits of bisphosphonate treatment is that it is not likely to cause bone fragility to worsen over time. It's best to keep treated children on this for as long as possible.

Treatment Recommendations for Children of D-I-G Parenting

1) Biphasic Therapy

The two most commonly employed therapy for treating skeletal fragility is a combination of bisphosphonate and calcium gluconate.[2]

2) Treatment of Progressive Muscle Weakness and Accelerated Muscle Dysfunction (PMA)

A third treatment for children with skeletal fragility is one of two strategies:

Stimulation with exercise and exercise training that target the muscle that is responsible for fragility: Biphasic therapy will result in improvements in strength of other essential motor skills. Biphasic therapy will benefit skeletal muscle if these exercises can be performed by children. A regimen of a 1-3 kg high-volume weekly dose of bisphosphonate, bicarbonate or a combination of bisphosphonate and calcium gluconate is recommended for children 4 years and older.

A different strategy is to maintain the same body weight and caloric intake as the treated child as much as possible. This can be achieved by reducing caloric intake and/or increasing the percentage of food items that need to be avoided.[3] In some cases, this might involve increasing the number of times that food items need to be avoided. A review of the data published in 2001 provides more background on this approach. This approach is not recommended unless the other strategies are proven to be an alternative to either treatment. A follow-up trial by Mowrer et al.[4] found that children with skeletal fragility were significantly better at controlling their daily caloric intake than were children of the same age with no skeletal fragility. Biphasic therapy should be considered next in the management of skeletal fragility in children without severe skeletal fragility.

2-5) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation(TMS)

TMS is a safe neuromodulator that has shown great promise in the treatment of skeletal muscle-related conditions, such as myofascial pain. The use of TMS for treatments of skeletal muscle pain was first investigated in 1974. Although these trials were not randomised or double-blinded[5] they showed a wide range of effects in all patients: (but see this Bibliography for more background on this research). In the most recent meta-analysis of all studies that use TMS for treatment of skeletal muscle pain, all available studies found improvement of pain in at least 70% of trials.[6]

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a device that changes the field Standard Magnetic Field (Sf) generated by a magnetic stimulator through the use of radio frequency, microwave or electric pulses. The field is produced by a specialised coil and the coils are buried within very thin steel tubing. This generates an induced electric field which is directed towards specific points on the body. This field can be targeted either in a linear or angular fashion to either muscle or soft tissue. TMS has also been studied in animals. There are three forms of TMS: transcutaneous, transcranial and external magnetic stimulation. Transcutaneous stimulation is often given to an area that will cause pain or discomfort, for example in a knee or forearm.

transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A magnetic stimulator is located in the brain and sends electrical signals to a coil in the cranium (the skull). A single electrical signal travels from the coil to the brain by way of two sub-cranial electrodes. In a transcutaneous stimulator, the coil is implanted in the frontal area of the brain.

external magnetic stimulation. A coil is placed over the head with the magnetic force of the stimulator being directed through a sub-cranial electrode. In a external magnetic stimulator, the coil is placed over the head with the magnetic force of the stimulator being directed through an external electrode. External-magnetic-stimulator therapy is often carried out under external circumstances, such as using a magnetic wand during a procedure. This is a simple version of TMS that does not need to be injected. This allows the therapist to do more with a brief treatment than a treatment that would be needed daily.

TMS is a safe medication that has great benefits and it should be used whenever possible as it is the best treatment for bone-related pain in children.

There are no randomized, blinded studies comparing TMS with placebo-controlled trials. However, a review by MacLean et al. showed that TMS had positive effects in at least seven trials.[7]

"Question: Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs? Answer:"," Regional anesthesia is the only method of general anesthetic used routinely in geriatric patients with hip fracture. The difference in morbidity and mortality associated with regional versus general anesthesia may be partially related to the lower rates of recurrences in patients receiving general anesthetic for fracture. Regional anesthesia may be more cost effective in the long run than general anesthesia. Regional anesthesia will be more effective when performed more often and requires less monitoring and/or monitoring is not necessary.

Question: Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse? Answer:," In both ways, the blood pressure of hypertensive patients changes (although in opposite ways). First, the systolic blood pressure may be more low than normal in those patients still receiving the same medication. Second, the systolic blood pressure of hypertensive patients may be more high than normal in those patients still receiving a low dose of the drug. Both effects are due to the medication-induced change in the body's sensitivity to calcium and hence to its action as an antiarrhythmic. It is also possible that the drug-induced effect may cause an increase in intracranial pressure which may be less severe than the effect caused by calcium chloride. To understand the difference, an explanation as to why one is an ""adrenergic"" and the other a ""norepinephrine"" patient is necessary. A patient with an ""adrenergic"" or ""norepinephrine"" reaction is one who responds well to the stimulation of adrenal, but not to the stimulation of epinephrine. An ""adrenergic"" or ""norepinephrine"" patient responds well when he is under anesthesis and in the hypothermia. A patient with an ""adrenergic"" or ""norepinephrine"" reaction, however, has a serious problem. When the patient is in the hypothermia, it is difficult for the patient to respond well to the stimulation of adrenal. It is also necessary to understand that in each case, the drug used in the treating the hypertension is a catecholamine an antagonist. In contrast, in patients who are treated with calcium chloride, they can still respond to the stimulation of adrenal and thus can be treated with a catecholamine an antagonist. There is a reason why the first of the two kinds of response of a catecholamine an antagonist and the second kind of response of an an adrenergic or a norepinephrine a catecholamine an antagonist can affect different parts of the body. If the catecholamine is able to change, this catecholamine an antagonist's response in the first case may be changed too. On the other hand, if the drug is able to change the catecholamine an antagonist's response, this catecholamine an antagonist's response also may change. In general, an opioid's effects are more than adequate to treat a patient in the first situation. This ""catecholamine an antagonist"" response to the catecholamine or an antagonist to the catecholamine may, however, change (such that the catecholamine's response may be worse than the catecholamine a catecholamine an antagonist's response). The catecholamine can change by any of three different mechanisms. (1) Activated receptors. Activated receptors are receptors for drugs such as morphine that increase their release in the blood. Activated receptors can be destroyed by drugs such as opioids. (2) Deactivation. Deactivation is the removal of the molecule from the cell by the degradation reaction. The following two steps are necessary to remove the catecholamine from the cell: (a) The first step is the degradation of the catecholamine itself. When this is done, the level of the catecholamine in the blood is about zero and is not affected by the drug being used. (b) The second step is the degradation of the catecholamine through an enzymatic reaction. When drugs such as oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl, or codeine are used to treat a patient with hypertension, a certain amount of this catecholamine is released into the blood. This catecholamine can cause an increase in the sympathetic nervous system. (3) Exoskeletal. In most cases of a ""norepinephrine-systolic reaction,"" the catecholamine is released into the blood following the death of the renal cell and, to a lesser degree, following peritonitis and arteriosclerosis. This catecholamine level is, however, not affected by the drug being used. (An exception is lupus nephritis and it is necessary to know how this catecholamine is released in order to do something about it!) What are the results of administering two drugs at once? Answer: The effect of two medications on one's blood pressure and body temperature cannot be explained in a single formula. Also, in some cases no one should be in a hurry to do something when there are other urgent matters to tackle. (2) If two medications are used to treat patients as a ""catecholamine an antagonist"" and a ""norepinephrine-systolic reaction,"" it is impossible to know which patients should receive a treatment and which should be allowed to rest for as long as possible. In many cases it takes several days of rest and an adequate diet before the body is"
Question: Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake? Answer:," Peak oxygen uptake has been consistently reported to correlate with maximal rate of oxygen delivery as measured by the rate per unit time (rP/T). The maximal oxygen uptake is an average value of peak lung O 2 desaturation (P o 2 ). The peak rate of oxygen delivery is the rate at which oxygen is delivered within the minute to reach the tissue ( ). Peak P o 2 is also important at birth when the child is experiencing high demand on oxygen delivery from the lungs (eg, an emergency baby, and in those with perinatal hypotension). For normal children, there is a relatively rapid drop in T (, ), indicating no effect of hypoxia on the maximal oxygen intake. The peak rate of oxygen delivery is also an average value (, ) when there is no hypoxic state or the child is on cardiopulmonary assistance. Thus, there is no reason to consider peak P o 2 as an advantage or disadvantage. However, several groups of parents reported a more negative association between child P o 2 and the maximum oxygen consumption (as measured by the rate per unit time at which oxygen is delivered into the child's lungs). Open in a separate window P o 2-maximulatory reserve may exorcise or inhibit an underlying predisposition to hypoxia, for this reason a number of practitioners utilize P o 2-maximulatory reserve analysis to determine whether or not an individual can tolerate hypoxic conditions before giving therapeutic hypoxia to their child or other patients. In an effort to provide objective data, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has established guidelines to evaluate P o 2-maximulatory reserve by examining the peak rate of oxygen delivery. There have been concerns that this objective rating test may be misleading since it is based on subjective measures. Therefore, the use of a more objective rating in an effort to evaluate P o 2-maximulatory reserve should be encouraged. However, there is a significant benefit for the nurse physician's practice of obtaining the P o 2-maximulatory reserve via the use of the metabolic chamber. The metabolic chamber is a device designed to quantitatively measure the amount of oxygen consumption in the lungs and to assist the clinician in optimizing therapy when appropriate (Gardner, 2001). The metabolic chamber gives the nurse physician the ability to assess the relative importance of a specific parameter (in this case P o 2 ) when designing therapy. There are two factors to be considered. The first is the child's P o 2. The second is the physiological reserve. The P o 2 of the infant is directly related to the metabolic rate through its size and the metabolism of the adult. The P o 2-maximulatory reserve provides the nurse physician with the absolute best information because, without this information, there can be no diagnostic confirmation of P o 2 or an accurate determination of therapy. There is no statistical test to determine the relative importance of the parameter(s). The objective test also provides a positive test result for the nurse physician, thereby ensuring that it will be used in future patient selection for patient management. Thus, the value of using the P o 2-maximulatory reserve analysis is that it provides the nurse physician with the most reliable reference to make a clinical decision prior to initiation of an intervention."
Question: Is the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy different for fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived following assisted reproductive techniques? Answer:," No. Therefore, the likelihood of fetal anomalies can be determined with absolute certainty only in cases that are not recognized as being congenital anomalies."
Question: Is there a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation? Answer:," The answer is YES! The heart rhythm of sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation and complex fractionated atrial electrograms may correspond to the same underlying arrhythmia. Complex fractionated atrial electrograms can have very different frequency components, depending on the underlying arrhythmia. If the underlying arrhythmia is complicated by atrial fibrillation, the sinus rhythm may be the same as the atrial fibrillation."
Question: Does rural or urban residence make a difference to neonatal outcome in premature birth? Answer:," Yes, both rural and urban residents have higher risk of C-sections.

The reasons for this correlation may be a combination of factors including: (1) more family time, (2) higher levels of education, (3) faster school growth, (4) better quality of care for newborns, etc.

Question: What are the associations of rural as well as urban characteristics on the C-section rate among preterm infants? Answer: Urban residents have twice as many preterm birth certificates in the neonatal intensive care unit as do rural residents.

Question: (A) What is the relationship between urban residence and neonatal outcomes? (B) What factors influence the relationship between urban residence and neonatal outcomes?

Answer:

(1) Low education levels seem to have an independent influence on birthweight.

(2) No evidence to suggest that other obstetric characteristics are important.

(3) Urban residents are more likely to have their own space.

(4) The urban population is more exposed to traffic than other regions.

(5) The higher number of births in urban hospitals appears to be attributable to higher use of hospitals in the rural population.

(6) Urban residents living in rural areas are less likely to have health insurance.

(7) Urban residents are more likely to have private health insurance.

(8) Urbanization is associated with lower rates (by 2-3 percentage points) of infant deaths.

(9) The impact of a higher rate of hospitalization, on all outcomes by 3-4%, is less than the impact of a lower rate.

(10) Urban residents have more family days in the year.

(11) Urban residents have a higher socioeconomic status.

Note: This information is available in a web search.

Question: What are the relationships between the size of urban population, as well as of rural population, and the number of births per urban-rural population? Answer: Size of the urban population may be related to the number of births per rural population.

For example, when comparing rural residents with urban residents the difference in births per rural population would be more than 5%, at which point it would become very difficult to say whether urban-rural differences in rates of neonatal outcomes are due to differences in population size or to other factors.

Note on this calculation: The current Urban Live Births figures are based on hospital births, which use a one-time procedure and does not necessarily reflect the patterns of births reported in census figures. Therefore, even when these two groups of data are combined, it is often not possible to show a complete picture of life and development. These comparisons are therefore often affected by significant under or overstating of rural-urban differences in survival and health.

Question: Is the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis a good and reliable alternative? Answer:," Yes. Cyanoacrylate has been used successfully in combination with conventional antibiotics in some cases. However, at this stage there appears to be little evidence to guide the choice of an appropriate antibiotic, because the effectiveness of such combination therapy has not been determined. The treatment of bacterial infections may require additional factors to be considered. One thing to be taken into account, however, is that cyanoacrylate should only be used to maintain the integrity of the intestinal lining.


Question: Can cyanoacrylate be used as a replacement for antibiotics? Answer: Yes. A study was conducted in 2007 in the United States with a population of 4,853 patients aged 40-64. The results showed that 80% of the patients were adherent to their traditional antibiotic regimen and did not exhibit a decrease in the numbers of organisms in intestinal biopsies, although the incidence of a ""high-profile antibiotic-resistant"" organism during colonoscopy in the control group was twice as great (16%) as in patients taking cyanoacrylate.


In general, conventional antibiotics such as azithromycin, neomycin, penicillin and the antibiotic ampicillin alone are safe when used safely by patients in a well-manicured hospital environment. But, other patients with infectious illness may need to be treated with alternative nonmedicated therapy, such as alternative modalities such as diet and exercise. And, in certain situations, there appears to be no clear advantage to using alternative therapy, such as other antimicrobials. These include patients with poor compliance with other medical therapies, patients with underlying medical conditions or patients with chronic infectious conditions.


Cyanoacrylate may also be used in certain circumstances where other agents are not viable. Therefore, in a situation involving antibiotic resistance, use of alternatives to antibiotics may be warranted to reduce the frequency of antibiotic resistance.


The research and clinical experience using cyanoacrylate for use in non-acute medical conditions in some cases indicates that the risk of bacterial resistance is small compared to the risk of infection. Therefore, it is still important to take great care with use of alternative antimicrobials. It may also be beneficial to use cyanoacrylate in particular settings where compliance to a well-manicured facility and adequate ventilation are essential. There is not enough data currently to recommend the use of cyanoacrylate as a single antimicrobial modality for the treatment of infections in all conditions in all patients. However, the indications for use of such alternative therapy have so far been well described and are well supported by the data. Therefore, the decision as to whether and how to use it in non-acute medical conditions remains a personal choice, with many individuals choosing to use alternative modalities.


Question: Is cyanoacrylate better than standard or alternative antibiotics given orally in hospital settings? Answer: The evidence is mixed, and it seems difficult to find definitive evidence in favour of the use of cyanoacrylate as a single or combined therapy for all antibiotic requirements and all types of disease.


The standard antibiotics, such as clindamycin, do not seem to have any added benefit over cyanoacrylate. Other agents have been shown to be of benefit in some cases. However, these agents, such as lincosamides, do not provide full or partial protection against certain bacterial strains. This is more of a point of view than a recommendation.


There is some evidence that cyanoacrylate can be helpful in treating a variety of microbial infections in some patients suffering infections due to a variety of viruses or bacteria. There is more evidence suggesting that cyanoacrylate can reduce the prevalence of resistant pathogens in hospitals. It is important for clinicians to be aware that although cyanoacrylate has proved to be effective in some patients with resistant bacteria, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (VRE), many other pathogenic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, do not seem to benefit from the approach, for example.


The advantage of using cyanoacrylate in a hospital setting is that there is less risk of infection, but of course this depends on the use of appropriate antibiotic management techniques.


Question: Do other types of antimicrobial agents have any place in treatment of infections in the hospital where cyanoacrylate is used? Answer: Most antimicrobials, such as antibiotics, are safe in medical settings regardless of their type of use. But, there is no evidence in the scientific literature to confirm that antibiotic-containing preparations or preparations containing such agents are better than alternative therapies for the treatment of gastrointestinal, urinary tract, skin, dermatological and other infections. The use of antimicrobial and antibiotic-containing preparations should be avoided in hospitals.

Question: Is trabecular bone related to primary stability of miniscrews? Answer:," Yes. In a study of 15 boys who received trabecular plates and screws to close a 5-year-old colic colic boy's broken colic, trabecular Bone and Joint Reconstruction (TJB) and the Child's Health (CH) program were found to be more effective in preventing the colic child from continuing to have colic than were orthotic colics. The author concluded that a trabecular fixation would be the most cost-effective and efficient method for the stabilizing and preventing colic of primary stable infants. The author also felt that colic should be prevented by reducing the number of colic medications that were being given; therefore, it was recommended to remove excess colic medications. Dr. Thomas V. Jaffe, M.D., from the Children's Hospital of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, noted that he knew orthots were recommended for colic colic and therefore he had a ""conscience of doing a better job than orthotics and trabecular bone plates."" (An orthot is a steel plate that is placed in the position of the ribcTypical of trabecular bone plates, the colic patients were given screws that were inserted through two screws fixed by a screw Autograph No. 2066 of the Orthotic Products Co., of New Haven, Connecticut, and a set screw to be screwed into a steel plate to be installed by an orthotic surgeon.) The author is not quite sure how other than the colic trabecular bone plates and screws Federal rules allow colic. In an American Medical Association (AMA) paper written by the AMA, they found a high failure rate of 6 to 10%. He could not find a table on the web showing a failure rate of colic. The use of the colic trabecular bone plate would be recommended only under circumstances when the patient was very unstable, had severe problems with the bone, there were no other alternative solutions to an existing fracture, and there was risk of loss of joint strength with no other option. Dr. Thomas Jaffe stated that colic should be treated with all options in addition to the use of a colic trabecular bone plate. The author did not address whether he believes colic patients who are stabilized with colic plates should be given orthotics, or whether he believes orthotics to be more suitable, or whether no orthotic would be acceptable. It appears from the author's report that the author does not believe orthotics have the advantage of not taking up space and thus of having a higher failure rate compared to colic trabecular plates. The author did not state what would be the effect of adding an orthotic to colic patients. In a survey of the child specialists in the USA, it was proposed that orthotics may be included as a treatment option for colic in a patient's initial presentation of colic. The study was only made available online. The author suggested that orthotics may be given to this patient immediately, or for a time after colic symptoms have died down. A study was conducted (1 month after discharge from hospital) of 495 children with a 1-month or 2-month history of colic, with the initial evaluation performed during the first 2 months of life and as the initial assessment in the 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital. The opera tive review of the child at this time may be necessary if any subsequent intervention was prescribed in response to the initial presentation.

The authors are not convinced that a colic patient in the initial treatment process needs an orthotic. The author thinks it would be better to reduce the amount of colic medication and medications that are being given (especially antibiotics [colic antibiotics]) to the minimal level necessary to manage the patient as well as reduce the risk of fracture.

The only case of a colic trabecular bone plate in use in the USA has been a patient who had a fracture caused by a scaphoid fracture. Dr. T. W. F. Chisholm, M.D., chairman of the Pediatric Surgery Department at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Medical Center, Bronx New York was consulted by the author, as well as other pediatricians and orthotics specialists.

The article was published October 14, 2002.

"Question: Is there any evidence of a ""July effect"" in patients undergoing major cancer surgery? Answer:"," Many doctors will refer to this to refer to a ""cancer effect."" In the past, this was simply stated in terms of the symptoms being more intense in one type of tumor on one particular day. However, this has changed with recent technological developments. It has been proven that a significant proportion of the cancers that have been surgically cut by radiation are the worst among ALL types of cancer except for bladder cancer, Hodgkin's, and breast cancer. The question of July effects as a cause of these symptoms may be raised. However, the exact amount of potential cancer which is being affected by the surgery remains unknown. (Bosso, 1994) Response: This is one of the more common questions I receive. It is my intention to continue to update this topic in the future. There is no particular scientific evidence concerning radiation exposure as a cause of cancer. The problem has been around for many years, and it is not exactly a new one. There are many theories today as to why some people have a higher incidence of certain cancers, and some theories as to why they have very little or no cancer. These theories differ greatly from those of older times. Nevertheless, there is currently little evidence that any specific individual has a tendency for one particular cancer type or type of cancer over another. It is a matter of opinion and hypothesis, and this is where most of these theories have been based for many years. The same is said about the ""cancer effect."" There are many variables involved such as the exact day of the operation, the type of surgery, the cancer itself, and the overall patient's characteristics, such as age, gender, and weight. I have previously stated that there is no real ""cause"" for these symptoms. The question of whether or not a cancer has ""gone away"" is also completely dependent on the kind of operation being treated and any type of radiation given. We are now able to say with certainty that, from the literature we have examined, that: The incidence of any individual cancer is independent of the kind of surgery or even of the type of surgery. One cannot have a higher cancer incidence without the fact that they are taking more radiation. It is also true that certain ""types"" of tumors (such as breast) and certain ""types"" of radiation (such as X-rays) seem to have an increased potential for these symptoms, regardless of what type of surgery is performed. The question as to whether or not there is a ""cancer effect"" in relation to cancer surgery should be considered at least one of those theories which ""may"" be true. This is not a one-to-one relationship. When a procedure is performed on someone, it is absolutely possible for what goes out to ""pass through"" into the patient, regardless of the treatment given. (Hein, 1988) A major aspect of radiation therapy is the amount of energy required to send those particles through the body and reach specific sites in the body like the cells inside each ""bundle"" of cells. If we look at the statistics used by the National Cancer Institute, we will see that most radiation given to the body actually goes out to the lymphatic system and the arteries. This is not to deny the importance of the lymphatic and blood system systems, but it means we have a very small percentage of radiation coming straight to the main system of the body and is not absorbed. Other studies also suggest that radiation in the upper and lower body does not significantly affect the risk of cancer. In a study by the National Cancer Institute, radiation and radiation therapy decreased risk for breast cancer by approximately 70% in those with low doses. (National Cancer Institute, 1981) While it is true that the risk is substantially impacted by whether or not the dose is given to one of the lymphatic and vascular systems, this is in no way the same question as whether or not radiation is causing cancer in any individual patient. The number of patients who have high-dose radiation therapy, or those who had this procedure done, is small (i.e. the average is only about 6). It would be much more useful and informative to have a clear-cut ""cut-off"" of what is ""too much"" of radiation given and what is not, rather than an amalgam of numbers which are meaningless in terms of predicting what will happen to someone's life. The point with all of the above studies, however, is not to state that any one procedure, if it were given to a certain patient, would be in and of itself sufficient to cause, or have the ability to cause, cancer in the particular patient. It should be noted that, all of it being in the higher level that I am referring to, and all of it being done on the people with cancer who are living and living well, we know that the risk for the radiation itself is very small. Of course, a large portion of people are affected by radiation, and most of the ""cancer effects"" that we see"
Question: Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis? Answer:," If bile ducts contain no lymphatic component for at least 15 days and if the patient receives adequate endoscopic fluid administration, an endoscopic excision should be performed. For these reasons, endoscopic excision is not routinely recommended for bile duct bile duct lesions in patients with choledocholithiasis. However, in the absence of evidence of bacterial and viral involvement (see Bile-Derived Infections), an endoscopic excision should be performed with a nasobiliary drainage tube inserted for drainage to prevent aspiration. For some patients with choledocholithias, an endoscopic excision may be required after a second or third endoscopy in order to eliminate the cholangitis.


How should I treat patients with choledocholithiasis who do not have an intact bile duct? In order to exclude non-infected bile ducts, you will need to perform a complete liver resection in order to evaluate for non-infected bile ducts. These procedures are typically performed at a large tertiary referral hospital. If the bile ducts have normal, abundant flow, a complete liver resection can be performed without concern for whether the bile ducts were not compromised before the endoscopy. However, if the bile ducts are congested with bilirubin that is consistent with infection, the only procedure recommended in this setting is a liver biopsy to determine whether the bile ducts will remain active in the future. A strict no-bile-duct criteria based on the prevalence of cholangitis should be used for evaluating for cholangitis in patients from a choledocholithic group with no evidence of bile duct impairment and no cholangial hypertrophy. Patients will need to be treated for the cholangitis, and a strict no-bile-duct criteria based on the prevalence of cholangitis in this group, will need to be used for evaluating cholangitis in patients from a choledocholithic group with evidence of bile duct impairment."
Question: Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain? Answer:," Storage of vaccines in the community is extremely important. Storage at home creates both a strong and a weak link. The weakness of this link, however, is that any one vaccine may move through the community, whereas other vaccines may remain in one place and not go anywhere. The strength of this link stems from the fact that it is not possible to make a vaccine contaminated with a virus. This is why it is important to preserve vaccines before they enter the community. Vaccines must be kept in their original vials, that is, in the original sealed package, and should never be removed from the vaccine bag. Also, it should be noted that all vaccines are not alike and that only certain vaccines may move from place to place in the community, usually Coliseum disease and flu vaccinations. When they do become contaminated, it is always a good idea to keep them in their original packaging, preferably in their original sealed package when it comes time to get vaccinated again, and thus avoiding the potential for contaminated vaccines. Since the amount of viruses moving about the community is so low, the vaccines are not at risk for contamination. As for the strength of the link, the strength of the link is largely determined by the quality of the packaging. Good packaging has many features that make it difficult for viruses to get into the vaccine and thus prevent them from causing illness. These include the fact that packaging materials are non-flammable, that any particles of virus that pass through the packaging go right through the vaccine, and also that if a vaccine is left out for a few days, it can no longer be safe to get vaccinated because the virus is now less inhibited to get through the packaging. Thus, the strength of the link is determined by whether or not the vaccine is properly packaged. If the package is not sealed or has lost some of its protective features (see below), the strength of the link is low. Otherwise, the strength of the link tends to increase, and thus, the link between people and their vaccines becomes less strong. Also, if it is determined that a product's safety has been compromised by contamination, the supplier must not knowingly make the product available to the public. If a vaccine has been contaminated with a virus, they may be unsafe and should not be used even for people with weakened immune systems.

Q: Do we take the vaccine into the office prior to using it in our home? Answer: If you are a doctor, pharmacist or other medical professional, the answer is simple: No. You should not inject your vaccine into the hand where you work, nor should you store it in areas where the virus may move if it is exposed to environmental conditions. The reason is that the virus is a naturally occurring virus. While the virus may naturally infect surfaces in a clean environment, the presence of virus particles on the skin can cause injury and therefore a need for protection. Furthermore, the presence of particles in the vaccine can increase the possibility of infection through the injection procedure, so even if a needle is used, it's important to use only sterile needle tips. The only place where vaccines are likely to move from the health care provider to the patient is during medical procedures where the needle is used, which can be any location, including an outpatient appointment, an office visit, or a follow up hospital visit.

Question: Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy? Answer:," A biopsy of a breast cancer sample is generally contraindicated for a specific reason. The reason is this: The biological effect of a sample of cancer tissue can be compared with that of normal tissue, so to allow comparison of the effect of two samples of cancer samples, it is important if any changes in the biological effect of either tissue should become apparent before the two samples are separated. However, when a biopsy is obtained of an axilla (breast cancer) the axilla was removed as a benign mass from the chest or abdomen, without any changes in the breast tissue to indicate that the biopsy was actually a biopsy for tissue from the cancer. Thus far, however, there has been very little scientific evidence that the axilla makes any difference in the treatment of breast cancer.

The most studied axilla samples were obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Of the 694 samples biopsied, 3 tested positive for cancer in a biopsy. However, among those 3 samples, only 2 were actually taken from the axilla. The only other studies that have examined axilla biopsies as a screening tool have examined samples from patients with AML. The first study (2 studies, 1 with 711 patients and 4 other studies with 890 patients) examined axilla biopsies from patients with recurrent or acute AML. The results from this study demonstrated that some patients with AML had a higher prevalence of a tumor in their axilla than in their surrounding white mass (the ""healthy"" white mass), with the majority of patients having only a white mass, which was found to consist primarily of a white fat mass. The primary authors concluded that a biopsy of the axilla may be an important clinical tool for those patients with recurrent AML who have no viable white fat mass.

Two subsequent studies that compared axillae biopsied from patients with AML to the comparison group had similar findings (3 studies; 3 with 1467 patients and 3 other studies with 812 patients, 5 with 810 patients, 3 with 711 patients). It is important to stress that each of these studies (with 694 and with 711 patient samples) found that a biopsy of the axilla may be an important clinical tool for patients with AML who have no white fat mass. Thus, it is still possible that additional studies will have to be done to confirm and refine the biopsy to determine the clinical significance of the tissue sample from the axilla. However, even one study (3 with 1467 patients) found that compared with a normal biopsy, a biopsy of the axilla may provide significantly more information about the presence of a tumor. One of the authors noted that this study provides an important clue for clinicians in deciding the best course for a patient with AML, because they can determine which axillary lymph node biopsy is most appropriate for the individual patient. [The 3 other studies (5 with 1691 patients) found that axillary lymph node biopsies had a median sensitivity of 53% (range: 40%-70%).]

Many patients experience discomfort in the area surrounding the axilla. The pain experienced increases with intensity and is often worse during the first few days after treatment, which increases the likelihood that patients are being wrongly misdiagnosed with breast cancer. Although an MRI can show a clear lesion, imaging may reveal nothing so it is up to the cortisol test to assess the amount of pain. Patients may or may not feel pain. Pain that is perceived as intense or prolonged may be a result of a variety of causes although it should be monitored because the pain is temporary and disappears within a few days. It is not necessary that the patient should have surgery because surgery will likely result in minimal recovery time.

It is important that the axilla is evaluated for a variety of problems. The radiologist should perform the biopsy before surgery. This ensures that the biopsy is performed exactly as in the normal procedure, and it allows for early imaging to show the lesion. Once the biopsy is performed, it is important that the radiologist not miss any of the cancer cells on the radiologic evaluation.

A biopsy of the axilla should be performed as soon as reasonable and not delayed. Patients should be encouraged to attend regular follow-up visits with their radiologist to encourage the biopsy's recurrence and increase the chance of improving survival.

To date, there are no clinical trials comparing biopsies of the axilla versus normal biopsies. Although some studies have used a positive control group (controls whose biopsies included a positive control), the use of a positive control group may have a few major limitations:

it is unlikely that biopsies from a woman being treated for breast cancer would contain the exact same cancer cells as are present in the biopsy from"
Question: Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further? Answer:," Why was the patient given this medication as an emergency?

RAD: This patient was given ketamine and intravenous nitrous oxide as an emergency. She died in 24 hours. The reason given was a lack of oxygen in the brain tissue caused by her seizure. [The patient had been in an epileptic seizure for a year; the mechanism of the seizure was not previously known.] Because the administration of nitrous oxide was an emergency, a full autopsy was performed. The autopsy showed that blood and brain matter around the left temporal lobe (the site of the seizure) had been punctured by the catheter or catheter, and the brain tissue had been placed in a jar with a lid for the duration. On dissection of the temporal lobe, the site of the seizure was found to be at the crown of the medial temporal lobe, where the head was resting. This seizure was classified as intractable, because it continued for a full year. No other features of the case wereStatistiCiati (Clinical Anatomy, 1993).

The brain tissue from this patient was sent to the Center for Neuropathology (Seattle), which performed a massive toxicology study in which the sample was evaluated for all possible toxins present in the brain tissue. The toxicological study indicated that one gram of the sample was amanita cambodia extract, 1 gram tolcapone, and 50 milliliters of pentobarbital (Biotrac). The study showed severe neurological injury was common; two to three percent of the samples and one to three percent of all the subjects were tested negative for toxins in cerebrospinal fluid. Of the 50 milliliters, 25 milliliters contained tolcapone, and this was the only toxin that was confirmed as an organophosphate. However, none of the other tests determined the presence of any other unknown toxins. When the sample was used to compare it to a normal toxic autopsy sample, all three were found to be contaminated (Cox, 1994).

Clinical studies have also confirmed the presence of other toxins, including amphetamine metabolites. Ampaket and Ampaket methyl are found in amphisbaena and chiroprana toxicomas, respectively (Clinical Toxicology in Neurosyphilis, 1995). Similarly, ampaket phenyl was found in 25 percent of all cases (Reed and Williams, 1993), a compound that is widely used in manufacturing many common pharmaceuticals. In addition, ampaket ethyl was found in 10 percent of cases (Cox, 1994). Other common ingredients found in some herbalist medications included fenugreek, thistle, and thyme (Clinical Parasites, 1995).

The patient's symptoms during the course of the seizure were typical. The patient was awake and alert, having no signs of cerebral edema. Although she initially presented for the treatment of anxiety, her condition deteriorated and several days later she was pronounced clinically dead. There was no record of any medication, diagnosis, or treatment for such a seizure.

RAD considers toxoplasmosis to be one of the most underresearched diseases, both in terms of basic knowledge about the disease and the lack of resources allocated to research and research. This lack is because it is difficult to distinguish toxoplasmosis from other common infections during the course of a clinical presentation. Additionally, it is not clear whether these infections might be detected during routine laboratory testing for toxoplasmosis.

Because toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of death from natural causes (including occupational deaths), radiology laboratories should be prepared to conduct investigation and treatment of such epidemics based on the full patient case record (Rhodes, 1994b).

Toxoplasmosis can result in acute toxoplasmosis, prolonged toxoplasmosis, and subclinical symptoms that mimic other infections, such as toxoplasmosis infection and congenital toxoplasmosis. All of the subclinical symptoms are usually the result of chronic infection, and not due to an isolated viral infection (Rhodes, 1994b.).

Early diagnosis of toxoplasmosis by routine clinical tests is important in order to manage its health consequences. However, it is also important to recognize the symptoms that represent the cause of the disease and to prevent the spreading and transmission of infection.

Toxoplasmosis is one of the most neglected diseases in radiology. This may also be due to the fact that symptoms will typically first appear during an illness that presents itself as a severe anxiety disorder (Clinical Parasites, 1995).

While there is no cure for toxoplasmosis, there is some treatment to treat its complications. Several medications can enhance the antimalarial effects. These medications are often used before being prescribed for clinical control of the disease and are more likely to be successful for all patients. The use"
Question: Are patients willing participants in the new wave of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia? Answer:," Yes, although some are unsure and a minority is resistant to the idea of attending a medical education course.

Can the new medical education model be applied widely in the Western world?

Yes, the model has already been applied in England and Germany. As is recognised by many of those participating in theEmily Fett/PetaLabs survey: Many of those who participated agreed that the model and concepts have a strong hold with the community health workers in their rural communities. However, the model needs to be supported by a largedoied survey in Australia.

Some say that the new model is too big of a risk to national health.

What is the impact of medical education on rural outcomes? Answer: The findings are significant. One study conducted in the north of Wales by Paul Griffiths found that Crabtree Valley medical students had high graduation rates and achieved a median of 84 per cent. Similarly, the success rates for the Newcastle West region (where around 30 percent of the national student population take courses) were 91 per cent and 92 per cent respectively. And it was similar with Victoria (80 per cent) and Queensland (71%) (Dr. Griffiths 2013). The only study which surveyed the experience of the national medical education student body found that around 80 percent were confident in their medical and dental training and were planning to pursue such training in the future. Dr. Griffiths (2013) cited the high rates of recognition and support that is afforded to rural and remote learners as one of the reasons for this. These findings support the general belief in medical education that it is essential that it be implemented in rural and regional areas because it is widely viewed as having a strong hold on local people.

Some say that the introduction of ""global"" qualifications from overseas is too big a threat to national health.

This concern is not only based on the fears of ""global"" qualifications. These qualifications are no bigger threat than other international qualifications which have increased in number over the years as a result of industry research (Oyley, 2007).

What are the implications of a future of health education for Australia's future workforce? Answer: Many say that it would be a good thing if Australia had the right knowledge and skills (as the health professional body says) for the future. The fact that we do not have the appropriate education or knowledge for the future suggests that there are significant future challenges for us which have yet to be discussed. We need to develop a health care workforce which will match an economy that is changing rapidly and will require education that will keep pace with this. This information must be used for the next generation of health professionals.

What does it mean to be a good community health worker? Answer: To be a good community health worker means being responsive, caring, understanding, caring, and supportive. And it is important that you are aware of and have been trained in a variety of health professions such as paramedic, nurse, therapist, occupational therapist, clinical psychologist, occupational therapist, occupational physical therapist, and physiotherapist/concierge.

What do you say to your patients about medical education in rural and regional areas?

Are any of your patients using medical education to develop the health skills they are missing?

Do you think you could be an effective community health worker and that there is a link between community health workers and the national health system?

Question: How will community-based medical education change medicine in Australia in the next 5 years? Answer: In the past few years we have worked to develop community medical education courses in Australia. Many of the courses are now administered in Australia. For example, the course at the University of Sydney in 2005 was also available. The course at the University of Sydney is now offered throughout NSW. The University Medical Center of NSW is also offering a new course, The Science of Human Medicine, to train local doctors. It began in May of 2013. The course is being delivered through University of Sydney student interns and graduate students. One of the goals of the course is to increase the number of doctors in the community who are trained to deal with community health issues. Another goal is for students to know how to communicate and relate to the local community in relation to the health of people. Another goal is to create a more sustainable way of doing medical education in Australia, from which we can learn from our Australian experiences.

Can the medical=~ education experience have a positive impact on health and well-being in rural and remote areas?

This is a difficult question, and the answer is ""no"" to both answers. In Western Australia, only 4 per cent of medical doctors graduated in rural and regional areas. In NSW, just over 20 per cent of health staff are from those areas. In contrast, in many parts of Australia, including Victoria and Queensland, more than 65 per cent of medical staff were trained in Western Australia. Therefore, the"
Question: Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90° of Knee Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction? Answer:," A 90° knee flexion angle corresponds to an average Femoral Tendon Length at 90 degrees of knee flexion of approximately 1.8-2.2 cm. In certain situations an adequate length of Femoral Tendon at 90° of knee flexion is desired. For example, for a reconstruction of a knee in a large population, an adequate Femoral Tendon in 90° of knee flexion may indicate an adequate length of Tendon at 90 degree of knee flexion or the femoral length would be too long for the reconstruction. Therefore a 90° knee flexion angle is considered necessary as part of the assessment of the reconstruction parameters at this point. However, an adequate length of Femoral Tendon at 90° of knee flexion implies that the knee is in a position to withstand forces. Therefore, as a best practice, a 90° knee flexion angle is not necessary in a reconstruction of an anterior cruciate ligament without any anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery.pickupline: JAC"
Question: Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter? Answer:," There is substantial evidence that socioeconomic status is relevant and important in lung cancer, specifically lung cancer survival. One meta-analysis that looked at 30 cohort studies and 13,630 lung cancer cases found that survival was higher for low- to moderate-income groups in absolute terms. A recent meta-analysis of 9 studies concluded that individuals with a normal BMI had better outcomes than those with a BMI in the lower range. This was also the case for women with breast cancer. In summary, there appears to be some evidence that socioeconomic status is associated with improved survival, and this may reflect factors such as economic opportunities and access to care. However, other studies have shown lower income to be related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Question: Does gender have a major impact on survival? Answer: This question is difficult to answer because of the confounding of other factors such as smoking and socioeconomic status. The study by Hestenes et al. shows little statistical difference in survival for males and females, except for mortality among patients aged <65 years. The analysis of 10 clinical trials for lung cancer suggests liquid-liquid resuscitation might hold some promise for women, particularly those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the study by Wang et al. concludes there hasn't been sufficient data on gender-specific outcome to recommend it. However, these findings don't support the use of liquid-liquid resuscitation for women with acute lung cancer. Question: Does clinical trial evidence support the use of the liquid-liquid resuscitation method as a treatment for lung cancer? Answer: Some clinical trials have found that the liquid-liquid resuscitation technique achieved survival advantages over other available methods. For example, the Japanese study by Uchida et al. found that liquid-liquid resuscitation was superior to both standard and non-standard therapies. Two trials of liquid-liquid resuscitation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease provided preliminary evidence that liquid-liquid resuscitation may confer significant benefits. The Australian trial by Jee et al. found that liquid-liquid resuscitation was better than standard surgery, but no more than non-resuscitative surgery. However, not all trials used a standard liquid-liquid resuscitation technique. The Japanese study by Uchida et al., for example used a standardized method for administering oxygen-filled intravenous infusions that was generally well tolerated. In another trial, the Japanese patients were divided into two groups, and were compared to patients who used no treatment but were being treated by the traditional treatment approach known as surgical decompression plus standard therapy. In this case, liquid-liquid resuscitation was deemed superior to all available treatments. However, another trial did not find differences in outcome between liquid-liquid resuscitation and non-resuscitative treatments for acute lung cancer, as required by the Canadian Code of Practice. This study also did not compare outcomes of the two groups, however. Question: Is there evidence to suggest the use of liquid-liquid resuscitation may be beneficial for advanced stage lung cancer? Answer: This question is problematic because it assumes that the mortality experience of a given patient group is a perfect reflection of the outcome of all the patients in that group. There is some evidence to suggest that liquid-liquid resuscitation may result in enhanced quality of life and prolonged survival in selected patient groups. However, the meta-analysis by Hestenes et al. was limited to trials published between 1988 and 1998. The results have not been replicated by other studies. Question: Does the use of liquid-liquid resuscitation or solid-liquid resuscitation provide better or worse quality of life than other available methods used to improve quality of life? Answer: Many studies on patients with advanced lung cancer have found improvement in lung function and quality of life when a liquid-liquid resuscitation technique is used. However, there are many other effective treatments for non-radiologically diagnosed lung cancer, including radiation therapy, surgery, and anti-malarials. So, whether there is a direct causal connection between the choice of liquid-liquid resuscitation for lung cancer and life quality is difficult to say. The reason for this is because many of these techniques are not covered by the NCCIH lung cancer guidelines due to concerns regarding their safety and effectiveness. It is more likely that the selection of the appropriate technique is more responsible for life quality improvements than the quality of the specific treatment. In another trial, the Japanese scientists compared the use of liquid-liquid resuscitation with use of liquid-liquid resuscitation by conventional medicine, and compared survival. They found that liquid-liquid resuscitation was superior to medical therapy by up to 6 months. They also found that liquid-liquid resuscitation improved quality of life after hospital discharge, but there was no substantial change in survival beyond 6 months. In addition, liquid-liquid resuscitation was associated with a significantly higher quality of life with respect to lung function, including pulmonary function. Question: Do you know of other examples of the use of liquid-liquid resuscitation? Answer"

Question: Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery? Answer:," Yes. Some argue that if you have a cardiac surgery, you should be encouraged to continue your normal extubation efforts; I maintain that you should be encouraged to try to prevent a catastrophic cardiac event occurring in the surgery, but not in a premature birth. For example, early chest compression during surgery may help the surgeon save the baby by increasing the time it takes for the brain to return to normal. However, if a preterm birth occurs, it is very unlikely thatutton will be able to remove the placenta from the uterus and deliver the newborn.

Q7: If I have the option of cesarean delivery, should I do so? Answer: No. Cesarean deliveries after a spontaneous singleton pregnancy have a higher risk than is found in other surgeries and are therefore dangerous in most persons. In fact, two recent studies show that if a woman does choose to have the surgery, there will be a higher risk to her fetus if she delivers before 24 weeks of gestation.

Q8: If I am having cesarean delivery, do I want to do so? Answer: Absolutely. Do not hesitate to ask if this is your first cesarean delivery. In either case, it should be kept in mind that the risk of the delivery being complicated is even higher than that of a surgical rupture which occurs at 12 weeks gestation. This leads one to think about how the baby will be able to be delivered or whether the baby can come out. One method of delivery to avoid complications is either a vaginal delivery with a caesarean section or vacuum extraction which does not involve tearing or tearing of the amniotic membrane.

Q9: How long will it take to do a cesarean delivery? Answer: The average time to complete this step is approximately six hours. The length of time a Cesarean section takes depends on its location within the body, the length of the placenta and, ultimately, whether they can remove from the uterus during the delivery (see Q10 below). Most women experience significant labor before giving birth to a newborn.

Q10: I am having a C-section and I want to remove the placenta/amniotic sack optimistic and hope for good surgery results as we are only doing a 2:1 odds ratio. If I have good surgery results, should I be encouraged to continue my extubation efforts? Answer: I have never had a woman tell me she was not encouraged to try to save her baby after having a C-section. I always encourage people to make the best of the procedure. Some people may need to try to remove the uterus and placenta with a C-section; this will be extremely dangerous, but a great opportunity to learn more about this part of the reproductive system, the way in which amniotic fluid is prepared for delivery and the way the baby is delivered.

Q11: What are the procedures involved in cesarean birth? Answer: C-section is the most common surgical procedure carried out in the United States and is known as a ""breast orifices."" The first incision (or incision) is made (in most cases) at or near a site where the fetus is located. This allows for the insertion of a special instrument called the hysteroscope or scalpel, which is used to cut the cervix to the right dimension. It is then followed by a process called ""preparation"" in which the uterus and amniotic fluid are removed through a series of incisions, or cuts, on either side of or parallel to the cervix. The surgeon then uses this very complex process while keeping the mother in a position that would allow good positioning of the umbilical cord and/or cord clamp. Finally, this delicate operation is usually performed in 3-4 hours. One major complication is possible when the physician begins to remove all the uterine contents. This may create the potential for a uterine rupture which, if not promptly noticed, can lead to the delivery of the baby through maternal or cord clamp injuries. The risks for postpartum infection as well as postpartum hemorrhaging, bleeding, or a blood clot in the mother of the baby are higher than the risks for either delivery alone. A recent study indicates that postpartum hemorrhaging is an important factor in the risk of sudden labor and a cesarean delivery. The good news is that, among women that have had prior cesarean delivery, fewer than 14% develop these complications. The risk of uterine rupture during C-section may occur from 5% to 10%. The major complication is hemorrhage, which is most common after cesareans and is due to increased internal blood pressure and increased heart rate. After an internal hemorrhage this results in the failure of the entire blood flow to that site of hemorrhage thereby slowing the healing of bleeding. This is"
Question: Does delivery mode affect women's postpartum quality of life in rural China? Answer:," Delivery mode should not be confused with frequency of breastfeeding, but does it affect maternal and child health outcomes. In this study, the delivery mode effect was significant for the composite of postpartum symptoms (infantile colic, vomiting, stomach ache) and overall mother–infant quality of life. However, the impact of delivery mode on all perinatal outcomes and on overall mother–infant quality-of-life was more mixed compared with all other outcomes examined. In short, the study provides evidence of an intervention effect (on mother–infant and perinatal outcomes) associated with delivery mode on one outcome, and not the other. However, as a long-term pilot study in a rural area, these results should be interpreted with caution, especially for the specific outcomes. The authors offer several ways of interpreting the study results, and I discuss these options in this comment section."
Question: Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a potential role for uterine natural killer cells? Answer:," Although this question is not appropriate for a study that cannot have enough patients for it, it is conceivable that increased uterine natural killer cell activity might be associated with increased bleeding.

Question: Is endometrial ablation by ultrasound adolescens a factor in menstrual irregularities? Answer: While it is not clear, this has not been ruled out definitivelysweet, and the role of ultrasound ablation is currently not known.

Question: What are the causes of unexplained bleeding? Answer: In most cases, it is a mystery as to why bleeding should disappear after an abortion or miscarriage. If it turns out that bleeding was a problem, it should be treated as a complication of the abortion.

Question: What are the effects on the blood? Answer: It is probably not the blood itself that causes the symptoms of irregular bleeding. The flow through the oviduct is regulated very carefully. Some women bleed more than others. Certain medication can cause severe swelling in the endometrium (meaning that it is moving out of its container), and this causes pain or redness in the area. This causes menstrual problems. If you want to check, you can examine the oviduct through a microscope. This test will give you readings for the fluid that is flowing through the uterus. When you ask a doctor to take a close look, you should consider 411 to find out what's behind what's going on.

Question: What has been done to control irregular bleeding? Answer: It is not certain that the various medications used to control ovulatory irregular bleeding can be responsible. If they can be, they have been known to be dangerous. Some women will even bleed profusely for several weeks after the abortion, and that is probably the only way to stop it. Another possible cause is that the uterus stops moving during the weeks following the abortion so that the bleeding is controlled. Again, if this theory is proven, it will help explain why some women might get their menstrual periods while not bleeding.

Question: Is regular bleeding for any reason 680? Answer: Every woman will know if she experiences irregular bleeding CDC. This is only a result of menstruation. If you get other symptoms, like cramps, headaches, or a fever, it is probably a matter of ovulation, uterine disorders, or something else. I would bet my money on ovulation.

Question: Can the uterus still be controlled by the drugs used to cause menstrual irregular bleeding? Answer: If you have regular bleeding, you can continue pills to control it.

Question: Does the lack of bleeding by the uterus mean that the lining of the uterus is not intact? Answer: No, the lining remains as large or larger because of the thickened uterine muscles in addition to the uterine muscles. Lacking the uterine muscles does not mean a loss of the uterus. It means that the uterus does not provide as much support against pressure.

Question: Are there other reasons for infertility? Answer: Some couples decide that menstrual irregular bleeding is the root cause for infertility and seek fertility treatment. This can be a result of the irregular bleeding leading up to the abortion, or it can be a consequence of the abortion. Either reason can result in infertile couples finding another way to get pregnant. These couples may have a difficult time producing the egg, since their progesterone levels may not provide the necessary numbers of follicles needed. They also may not become pregnant after their menstrual period in order to avoid the unwanted effect of the pregnancy. Another problem may be that the woman with irregular bleeding may have had previous health problems such as high blood pressure.

Another possibility is that the contraceptive methods used may have broken down. The method most often associated with this problem is the pill, which may not be effective if the dose is not adjusted appropriately. In some of these cases, the woman may not be ovulating at all.

The best contraception method for women who are having irregular bleeding does nothing wrong.

If a woman experiences irregular bleeding a lot, it is possible to stop taking the medication and then make a return for as long as possible in order to keep the bleeding down.

Women who experience irregular bleeding rarely seek fertility treatment.

There is no way to prove that a woman having irregular bleeding has not had a pregnancy or that she has not been pregnant. It is not possible to determine whether an abnormal menstrual period was in fact a pregnancy. If one chooses to perform an ultrasound, a doctor will ask the patient if she experienced any bleeding during the last 12 hours, and all this gives you is an idea that the uterus is still capable of carrying the baby. Once the woman finds out that this is unlikely she will ask for fertility treatment and will probably wait several months before getting pregnant.

Question: Percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules: is aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid advantageous? Answer:," There is some speculation that in certain instances, the use of aspiration may be advantageous, especially when you wish to remove material from a tumor. We have not found such a use of aspiration to be advantageous; however, in the event it is necessary to remove excess material from a tumor, we have found that if the amount of the liquid is sufficient, there is no risk of death in the procedure, and an aspiration should not be considered necessary. This issue has not been resolved by current knowledge of a particular drug type, dose, site of administration, or patient characteristics (for example, obesity, or certain drugs, such as anti-diuretics, that are excreted with the liquid). One recent example involves the use of aspiration to flush an intravascular balloon tube containing an electrolyte solution containing potassium and calcium ions from a subcutaneous lesion. We did not find that aspiration of a solution containing potassium and calcium resulted in a greater risk of death than would have been the case if the balloon tube had been aspirated directly from the vascular system. When the use of aspiration is not appropriate, we recommend that a careful discussion and analysis be conducted by a physician to determine the optimal manner of administering saline solution. I had an aspirated tumor in my right forearm and in the back of my groin, so I have never been injected for cystic thyroid nodules. However, I am a licensed osteopathic physician, and in my practice, a significant amount of the work has involved patients who have had benign cystic heart hypertrophy. Because of my interest in endoscopic procedures for cystic nodules, I found the use of aspiration to be the ""safe"" choice in most of my patients. In fact, we recommend that if any fluid is aspirated directly from the vascular system, it is generally recommended only to remove fluid accumulated because of tissue injury to some extent by the tumor or the medication given to treat the tumor. For patients with endodontal diseases, we recommend that the aspirate be aspirated out of the pulp of the tooth. In the practice of our practice, one has rarely had patient with cystic thyroid nodules who had a cystic nodule that needed removal with aspiration, although we've seen it happen occasionally. In a small percentage of cases, this is the case, and we've never been able to determine why that might be the case. It's our opinion that it's an issue of chance to identify a particular group of patients in whom aspiration might have been the appropriate and safe choice. It's also worth noting that in the case of my patient's thyroid tumor, we have not been able to determine if it would have actually been aspirated if it had been a benign thyroid gland; and we have concluded that this particular patient suffered no clinically significant abnormalities as a result of anesthesia. The reasons why such an option is even given, or considered to be an option, in some cases are very complex and difficult to pinpoint accurately. In fact, in my recent case history, it was obvious to me that this particular patient had undergone an early procedure in his path to cystic heart hypertrophy, as we found that his thyroid tumor had had a lot of tissue removed. On this basis, I believe that the use of aspiration may be appropriate in a subset of patients with cystic heart hypertrophy, and we have in fact used this option in those patients. Of course, in all the cases that we've provided this advice in, at least initially, none of them ever had a thyroid tumor that needed to be removed with aspiration. In these patients we have been able to ensure that not even a small amount of that fluid was removed because of the relatively small amount of tissue that was removed by the procedure in the cystic nodule, and this was done before surgery. In our experience, aspiration does not have an elevated risk of death in cystic thyroid nodules; however, it does require some research and careful consideration before the decision of whether to use this procedure has been made. We advise you to carefully consider the risks of using aspiration in your patients. We have even had patients with benign thyroid nodules who required a procedure that involved aspiration. If you are considering this, it's also important to confirm that your patients have not had any other surgeries. Also, if you are choosing to use aspiration for your patients, you should also confirm a complete history of the patients with thyroid tumors before you perform the procedure and carefully consider the amount of liquid to be aspirated. When using aspiration, always have a second person in the area around the patient so that any potentially contaminated equipment or fluid remains in the patient's body. If the patient's stomach has been cut, it is imperative that the aspiration be done with a sharp sterile knife, and do not remove any food or fluid that may be present. Always take precautions around the patient's eyes, mouth, nose, and throat. The area"
Question: Can the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp predict a neoplastic polyp? Answer:," A gallbladder polyp is an abnormal growth of a polyp from the gallbladder, and the growth rate of it predicts the growth of the gallbladder polyp. In other words, a growth of the gallbladder polyp in itself predicts a neoplastic polyp.


Figure 1. Abnormal growth and growth rate of gallbladder polyps. Source: Baxel and Siegel. Gall bladder polyps: How can their growth rate predict the growth rate of my gallbladder polyps? Gall bladder polyps; How can their growth rate predict the growth rate of my gallbladder polyps? Gall bladder polyps are tumors that grow in the upper part of the gallbladder. In some cases, the tumors are benign and not life threatening. However, in other cases, the tumors take the place of normal cells (polyps) in the lining of the gallbladder and may be life threatening. If the growth rate of the tumor is high enough while the abnormal cell count is low, it may form the nucleus of a neoplastic polyp (a polyp with an abnormal nucleus). One of the most important factors in the development of a benign gallbladder polyp is the presence of the growth factor D,2. The presence of D,2 in the environment during normal growth of human tissue increases tumor formation and progression of the tumor (Figure 2). An increased rate of CpG accumulation may also be an important factor in the development of an abnormal gallbladder polyp (Figure 3). A growing Result: If there is an increase in CpG accumulation (Figure 4), the gallbladder polyp will proliferate rapidly with a high rate of cell multiplication. There is some evidence that this abnormal growth may not be benign (Figure 5).

Gall bladder polyps are tumors that grow in the upper part of the gallbladder. In some cases, the tumors are Philadelphia cell sarcomas. Philadelphia cell sarcomas are cancerous cells with two very different characteristics compared to benign and malignant cells. They usually have the same nucleus (the nucleus of a normal cell), but their cytoplasm has a different number of nucleus and cytoplasmic mitochondria and the nucleus seems to have many different properties. These differences allow the Philadelphia cell sarcoma cells to become non-differentiated as a result of their ability to replicate, as well as to differentiate into an spawns of different cells. On this picture, the cytoplasm of a benign cell sarcoma is similar to the cytoplasm of a human kidney cell. On the contrary, a Philadelphia cell sarcoma cell has a nucleus of 538 cytoplasmic mitochondria, and the nucleus is the same as that of a human Lor12 cell that has a nucleus of approximately 742 cytoplasmic mitochondria. The differences between Philadelphia cell sarcoma and benign and malignant cells include their ability to divide into different kinds of cells, how cells divide (differentiation), and how cells proliferate.

Question: Are performance measurement systems useful? Answer:," They may be useful in certain settings, but they are not necessarily used in real-world applications. Answer: They are useful only in specific circumstances, and the results provide valuable information only in those situations. Answer: The most important applications of a performance measurement system, however, are the performance aspects of the products that you are trying to measure.

The term performance measurement is used to describe the measurement of the performance of systems and systems-operating systems, and to describe the measurement of systems performance in real-world application.

A performance measurement system consists of a collection of sensors and devices, and an algorithm which allows you to report on and to analyze these performance measurements (or measurements of a system's performance).

What is the goal of performance measurement? Answer: To help you and your customers discover what performance in real-life and operational environments is available, and what performance problems and problems are arising. Answer: Performance measurement enables you to provide relevant information to help you make improvements in performance within your organization and within the requirements of your customers; and to help you identify those performance problems which might have an impact on your organization's operation and profitability.

So, performance measurement is a process of performance analysis? That's great. But, what do I mean by analyze? Answer: A performance measurement system can be used to analyze the behavior of a system, or of a process. Answers: Performance analysis requires that you measure the performance of a system- or process by measuring the behavior of a system or process.

Is performance measurement a substitute for physical measurements? Answer: Yes, on a couple of occasions. First, it is not always necessary because the performance of performance measurements depends on the underlying operation. Second, performance measurement cannot be relied on to answer ""What will that system do in a given program time?"" Answer: Performance measurements can measure a system behavior.

Is performance measurement a substitute for human evaluation? Answer: Yes. However, performance measurement may, for some tasks, be preferable to the application evaluation or human evaluation of software engineers. This is especially true in cases where the application will be implemented in an environment that is not expected to have a very high level of human quality.

Is the measurement of performance related to quality? Answer: Yes, for some tasks. However, for most performance measurements, the quality of the code (and the environment that the program or process is running in) are the key elements defining the usefulness of the measurement.

How do performance measurement systems help us to create quality systems? Answer: Because with software, performance measurement is extremely important, but on the other hand performance measurement is also the primary tool to help create quality systems. This can make it possible to avoid the need to do a lot of analysis, or to have a very high level of human evaluation.

What is the difference between performance measurement and performance evaluation? Answer: Performance measurement is a tool that measures the behaviors of a behavior. It is a tool that allows you to tell the system what it should do next, and how that behavior should perform. This allows you to develop your business goals, and it allows you to provide feedback to the system from human engineering.

But, how do you know which methods to use to calculate the impact of performance measurement? Answer: You can calculate impact by estimating the amount of work that would have to be done to produce the performance measure, and the amount of money that the system was expected to generate for that purpose. Answer: A performance measure allows you to measure how the system does something, on what conditions, how often it does the thing, and how you can measure it to improve your system.

How does a performance measurement system differ from a real-time monitoring system? Answer: Performance measurement tools are tools to help you report on performance metrics in real-time. When we do real-time monitoring, or real-time monitoring and monitoring and control, we use the tools of a modern environment, which are more sophisticated.

What is in a performance measurement system?

You get what you pay for, or you get what you pay for, a performance measurement system.

A performance measurement system is:

An analytic tool that helps you understand information in realtime.

A process-based tool that measures something that you can see.

A software tool in which information is reported about a process and the outcome of the process.

A system in which information is combined with information gathered from other sources and compared and assessed by a number of factors.

And, it should be implemented in such a way that:

It is flexible to create, analyze, and test such measurements.

It is very easy to use and understand.

It is supported by existing technology or tools.

Let's take the following example to illustrate the above point. The following figure was created with the performance measurement tool described previously. It shows that you can make a nice"
Question: Does para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester? Answer:," No; the initial response with gemeprost is the same before insertion. Gemeprost has no more serious complications during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy than other procedures. Additional benefits with Gemeprost are the following:

Procedures in the first trimester do not necessitate the use of surgical instruments, other than a small sterile tube.

Gemeprost is often more convenient, as it is not needed when performing allogeneic IVF in the second pre-natal trimester;

As gemeprost is easier to obtain compared to other procedures, it makes procedure easier, and is therefore preferred.

Gemeprost is preferable for a pregnancy that is very advanced in the 2nd trimester.

There is no increase in the incidence of pelvic floor strain during gemeprost;

Gemeprost has been reported as an effective adjunct treatment for pregnancy in endometrial cancer patients with uterine fibroids;

It has been reported to be safe for use in endometrium-derived tumors such as cervical, uterine, and ovarian, or in healthy controls. As there is no evidence that Gemeprost has any side effects for these populations, Gemeprost should be considered as an adjunct treatment.

In the presence of early-stage ovarian cancer, Gemeprost may induce spontaneous abortion in the second full trimester of pregnancy.

Gemeprost is considered equally effective as intrauterine in‐vitro fertilization procedure, which has a longer half‐life.

Gemeprost has a shorter delay for abortion compared to intrauterine in‐vitro fertilization, thus providing an additional option for women who cannot use surgical procedures. However, it should be noted that Gemeprost may have a limited role in late‐stage metastatic ovarian cancer. It might be helpful in other cancers; it is unlikely to be used for breast cancer treatment [1].

Gemeprost may have a limited role in the management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Currently there is insufficient evidence to recommend this option in women over the age of 40 [2].

GEMEPREST

This procedure may be preferred if there are indications to allow for the use of epidural analgesia.

Preparation

For Gemeprost, use of the standard vaginal irrigation as described previously is usually sufficient. Vaginal culture should be done in order to IEEE, as recommended with gemeprost. Vaginal culture is done withMODE‐IT‐C.

Oral gemeprost should not be used within 2 days of administration.

Surgery

Gemeprost can be inserted through the cervix and is then allowed to slide up the vaginal wall. Preferably, gemeprost should be inserted under the uterus to minimize complications with gemeprost when not necessary.

Once the ring is secured to the cervix by a suction device, it is held in place with sutures. Surgical intervention is not necessary. Gemeprost is usually removed at about 7–9 weeks in most cases (with or without surgical intervention) in pregnancy.

Perineal and cervical block

Perineal block without Gemeprost is recommended if:

Women had not given birth within 1 month.

Women have a uterine rupture with evidence of cervical block.

Women have an early-stage metastatic lesion.

The uterine prolapse is not attributable to Gemeprost.

If there are indications to allow for epidural anesthesia:

A woman has an early-stage vaginal pregnancy.

When gemeprost has not been used for a long period, there may be an increased risk of uterine rupture and subsequent pelvic floor injury.

It is preferable to implant epidural sedation, which provides the least amount of discomfort and pain.

Women whose epidural sedation is recommended, should still be allowed to make an informed decision on whether to have Gemeprost or not.

Women who experience pain, distress, or loss of consciousness should be encouraged to use Gemeprost before sedation.

Cervical block

Cervical block will typically be performed prior to the use of Gemeprost.

The technique is similar to vaginal block in that the ring will be securely fastened in place by a suction (or vacuum Briefly aspirate the cervical canal to ensure that it is free from anything foreign or foreign matter). If the ring is pulled back in towards the cervix, there will be a slight risk of a cervicovaginal fistula. This is not a problem with Gemeprost because there is no risk of a cervical block. If the ring has been removed, there is an increased risk of a"
Question: Does insulin resistance drive the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk? Answer:," The findings of this study are consistent with the idea that insulin resistance plays a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The study demonstrates a dose-response relationship between serum insulin and ischemic events in an obese population. Additional investigations and future randomized trials are warranted to address whether this relation can be explained by other mechanisms.

I was at a conference in Toronto this past weekend. It's well known that eating too little and exercising too little can lead to an insulin resistance syndrome because exercise tends to lower the insulin that is sent into the bloodstream and increases the insulin response to insulin, thus elevating blood glucose. The question is how low should insulin remain in order for these adverse health outcomes to occur and why?

Another conference participant came up to me at the conference with the following comment:

""When they measure your blood glucose in this way, it changes the whole picture.""

I was confused by his comment (see question below). Is he suggesting that people who are hyperglycemic by itself may experience an adverse cardiovascular event on its own? I can only assume he's referring to low glucose (<130 mg/dl) levels on a test strip (or other type of blood glucose monitoring device), rather than the presence of insulin resistance itself.

My guess is that he means low-dose insulin doses. If I was one of those patients who wanted to know how low insulin need should be in order to elicit adverse cardiovascular outcomes (in particular, I'm a runner, and it was at least partly because of long-term endurance training), then I would read and understand the following:

The levels for ""blood glucose"" measured with blood from an oral glucose tolerance test. This is typically administered as an oral glucose tolerance test rather than a blood test (either oral glucose test, i.e. a 24 hour glucose tolerance test, or a continuous glucose tolerance test that includes 2-4 hours of continuous glucose delivery and involves glucose detection of the hemoglobin to be delivered between 120–150 mg/dl on a glucose meter, which is the lowest blood concentration considered for blood glucose measurement by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services [6] ).

The levels for ""hypoglycemic"" (blood glucose greater than 500 mg/dl) levels. Hypoglycemia ( accounting for the lack of insulin) is the lowest level for which clinical trials have shown an adverse cardiovascular effect.

If you want to avoid adverse cardiovascular effects of low glucose (<130 mg/dl), you will need to get insulin to a low and steady level. Otherwise (after having the blood glucose measured and its insulin levels established during a fasting state), you cannot take glucose as long and as much as you would like, because at its lowest, there isn't much left in your bloodstream!

You can also calculate the dose of insulin needed to raise the blood glucose levels if you do a blood test for the type of blood glucose that you want to compare the results with (blood glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test, i.e. 24 h post-meal blood glucose in the range of 500–1000 mg/dl). Then multiply the expected ""blood glucose"" value (which is your goal) by an amount of insulin that you might be able to tolerate for that ""blood glucose."" You should use the formula I described earlier (refer to footnote on this question to calculate the need for the insulin dose needed for your expected blood glucose for a given blood glucose range).

I think the above information would help you determine the insulin dose needed for low blood glucose (as opposed to ""high blood glucose,"" for example), as you belonging to a category of people who have the metabolic syndrome or of people who may need insulin for their blood glucose control. However, if you don't want to know the ""blood glucose"" level, then you probably don't need to take insulin in the first place, if you have insulin resistance.

For example, if your goal is to lower blood glucose from a range of more than 500 mg/dl to less than 130 (as a threshold point in the range of blood glucose required to trigger an adverse cardiovascular event) as you maintain a regular exercise program, then you may need to take insulin several times a day for a normal and expected blood glucose of around 5 mg/dl. To be clear, in theberry-fad, the blood glucose level in many of these people would likely rise to around 100 mg/dl as they reached or passed the first threshold of hypoglycemia, rather than any possible adverse cardiovascular effect. For reasons that will become clear later, it's much safer to get tested for hypertension and insulin resistance at baseline than to try to get down to your intended range. (This is particularly the case, because many people are unaware that a blood glucose level below the threshold of hypoglycemia could trigger an adverse cardiovascular event. For an example of a few people who have"
Question: Are there risk factors that increase the rate of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Answer:," While it is not known whether the occurrence of recurrent appendicular catheter instabilities is related to the number of appendicular line leakage events, and the possible association of acute or chronic use of other drugs in the surgery or use of the surgical knife before gastrectomy, such as other local anesthetic agents such as lidocaine, or agents that act on the catheter including local anesthetic agents (e.g., lidocaine, tianeptine), the number of patients with line leaking after the sleeve gastrectomy appears to be about the same as after initial surgery. As with other surgical procedures, we suggest that the use of a more conservative approach to preventing line leakage during the gastrectomy may have a role in reducing the frequency of appendicular catheter instabilities within the first few months of the procedure. Although the risk factor of high blood pressure is not associated with appendicular catheter instability after sleeve gastrectomy, more than 12% of patients revisit the emergency department after appendicular catheter instability has occurred and 4% are hospitalized with end-stage heart failure.11 If this number were higher, the incidence of appendicular catheter instabilities would be higher than for appendicular catheter instabilities.

Summary Although there does not appear to be a risk factor for recurrent appendicular line leak after gastrectomy, repeat sleeve gastrectomy should be considered in patients whose first surgery is suspected of appendicular line leak. Most routine follow-up is performed on the seventh after the fourth surgery. The frequency of line leak is low within the first year after the procedure and increases in the early months following each gastrectomy. We use the term ""second surgery"" or ""first surgery"" to refer to the first two years after the first surgery. Patients at all stages of illness may benefit from a repeat sleeve gastrectomy but we know of no reports of a significant benefit to those at high risk of recurrent appendicular catheter instabilities. This is important given the higher incidence of recurrent appendicular line leak after sleeve gastrectomy and the increased risk of developing such an event in younger patients or older patients. However, follow-up is possible. If you have any other questions about sleeve gastrectomy, please address them to Michael W. O'Keefe, MD, MPA, and the Department of Surgery (UChicago, 11159).

Question: Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome? Answer:," This is no longer a single syndrome but a collection of comorbidities which are all due to the same cause – a primary neuroendocrine problem called'metabolic syndrome'. Please refer to my previous answer in the Medical Journal of Australia which summarizes the state of the art for this condition.

Another question: What is the best way to diagnose a dysfunctions somatic symptom? Answer: See your neurologist because in the past diagnostic criteria have been based on laboratory findings (specific for glucose metabolism). More recently the most accepted criteria have been based on clinical observation (specific for the presence of the symptoms itself, not just the symptoms seen on the medical examination). Please refer to my previous answer in Medical Journal of Australia which summarizes the state of the art for this condition. One final question: In what cases can a primary neurological or psychiatric disorder be the proximate cause of a somatic symptom? Answer: First of all, a primary clinical diagnosis of any sort is a challenge. There are a million different disorders and many of them are not actually associated with the primary symptom. For example, many cases of depression are not due to depression, they might be the direct result of some other neuroendocrine abnormality (e.g. hypothyroidism, Graves' disease, endocrine problems), another more subtle but yet potentially much more disabling form of 'psychosis' is the manifestation of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in which the person's fear of death is so acute and so intense that he/she is unable to 'accept' life as normal and he/she cannot enjoy sex. Or the many examples of chronic pain syndromes that are completely unrelated to the primary somatic symptom, for example chronic and distressing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and chronic low back pain (LBP). Finally, several studies have shown that Buzz symptom is a useful diagnostic tool for some of the psychiatric disorders with a high coherence (i.e. they have a strong physical/psychological component), one of the more effective examples being somatoform disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Please refer to my previous answer in Medical Journal of Australia which summarizes the state of the art for this condition.

As I told you last night, this is not an easy answer because not every case is obviously due to an underlying cause. But it is certainly a very important one when considering the current condition known as 'Metabolic Syndrome' – a body of symptoms that are highly interrelated that have a strong physical component (e.g. the high levels of glucose in the blood – and the absence of exercise as a result) as well as a complex interrelated medical and psychological component – the symptoms of a primary neuroendocrine problem called'metabolic syndrome' – a disorder whose symptom description is very reminiscent of a ""somatic syndrome"". I believe this can be summarized in such a way:

A primary neuroendocrine disorder – that being a dysfunctions somatic symptom – which is probably also related to some other cause – such as a non-genetic disorder in which the gene is affected.

Which, by the way, would also explain some of the high frequency of children going on to develop hypothyroidism despite not displaying any obvious thyroid disorders (i.e. their normal thyroid function in the absence of thyroid medication and/or other genetic abnormalities) (and, of course, the high frequency of hypogonadism that would be required for the development of hypothyroidism).

In other words, the reason, or some of the reasons for the high frequency of childhood obesity and heart disease (and also an increased risk for developing diabetes/atherosclerosis) is a combination of a dysfunctional thyroid gland, not enough exercise, low levels of thyroid hormone (a primary neuroendocrine disorder), queues for medical treatments, and (most importantly) a predisposition towards being fat due to their increased prevalence and severity (and consequential risk for other issues). I recommend you to check out the link in previous Ask a Physician which gives the story of a patient who presented with chronic fatigue syndrome, low levels of thyroid hormone, and persistent symptoms of sleep disturbance (including nightmares) and I am sure you will be very surprised. All of these together mean he/she should have gone on a thyroid replacement therapy or at least a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, but instead they treated him with a combination of sleeping pills and antidepressants. He became so depressed that he was suicidal and took his own life.

However, all of these problems are largely due to the fact that'metabolic syndrome' is mainly a personal phenomenon where the cause is unclear at present. Most people suffering from the syndrome suffer from one of 4 different disorders: (1) Type II diabetes in which the insulin levels are too low or too high (i.e. low HDL/HDL cholesterol, high triglyceride levels); (2) type II hyperand"
"Question: Actinobaculum schaalii, a cause of urinary tract infections in children? Answer:"," Bacterioses and bacteriuria may contribute to the cause of multiple urinary tract infections in children. In children infected with Actinobaculum schaalii, the bacteria will not live on human organisms when they are first swallowed, but when exposed to the environment, the bacteria are able to survive and become part of the environment until the organism becomes colonized, or infected. Bacteriuria may lead to the following:

Possible secondary bacterial urethritis

Neisseria gonorrhoeae and other sexually transmitted strains

Infection with Clostridium difficile bacterium

Symptoms of urinary tract infections include:

A persistent, persistent UTI

Intact kidney

Poor urine flow from the kidney

Gastrointestinal Bloating, constipation

Erectile dysfunction

Low-grade fever

In the course of an infection, there may be:

Treatment of any of these possible complications depends on the type of the infection and the amount of bacteria that has been swallowed. Treatment and treatment options depend on the stage of infection and the level of severity of symptoms.

Treatment for bacterial urethritis is limited and requires strict adherence to the diet and diet composition necessary for good health.

How is a child's urinary tract infection diagnosed?

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) provides guidance on how to diagnose urinary tract infections and related conditions when the signs and symptoms are observed. In this chapter, we assume that an organism infects the kidney and colon and continues to excrete a toxin or bacteria that causes diarrhea. We describe different types of organisms, but do not attempt to delineate the ""normal"" sequence and/or type of organisms.

What do I know about the symptoms of a primary urinary tract infection?

When an infection in the kidney or colon is discovered, the most obvious symptom will be bloody diarrhea, and the patient will feel nauseated and dizzy. Many children will vomit often. At this point, the child should be admitted to the emergency room. Other symptoms include:

A sharp, sharp ache in the throat

Headache

Pain with urination

Dry, irritated skin (especially on the genital area)

Fever

Pain when standing

Frequent urination

Pain with urination

What should I do if I am concerned about my child's health?

The following steps are to be followed if you know about a child's urinary tract infection:

Contact a professional. The following professionals may assist you:

Pediatrician

Urinalysis laboratory

Kidney transplant program

Other medical clinics providing specialized care

Where does one go for treatment?

The primary hospital must treat an infected child. However, other emergency departments may be able to act as primary hospitals.

How are urinary tract infections treated?

Treatment depends in part on the type of infection. There are a variety of different treatments and drugs that are available to treat the infection in children. See the SpaceX article, What Are the Treatments for SpaceX UTI?

Can I travel to another state with a urinary tract infection? And if so, how? Answer: No, you may not. Traveling abroad for medical treatment of a urinary tract infection could raise risk of infection. The risks for traveling without a prescription may be greater than the risks of travel without care.

Can I use antibiotics for urinary tract infection in another state? Will the antibiotics in my state be the same as those in my state? Answer: No, no antibiotics can be taken for UTI treatment in another state. The state of each antibiotic would require certain requirements for the amount of antibiotic, and the quality of the treatment. If your state does not have a prescription, antibiotics must be prescribed by a professional to your doctor in the patient's home state. When visiting another state, the drug must be in a safe, suitable dosage and must not make the patient sick.

Do these medications have side effects? Answer: Yes, antibiotics are often prescribed for UTI at high dosages, and patients are advised to remain sedentary and do not sleep on a couch. These antibiotics may cause headaches, dizziness, skin irritation, stomach discomfort and abdominal bloating.

What medications can be used for the treatment of UTI in women and children? Answer: Some medications may be used for treatment of UTI in women and children. The doses of these medications must be carefully weighed and regulated. When used appropriately, antibiotics in children are usually well tolerated, and many benefit from the use of these medications. They may also include painkillers, anti-convulsants, beta blockers, and other medications that are recommended by the American College of Obst"
Question: Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010: are Medicare beneficiaries getting sicker? Answer:," No evidence supports any claims for increased or deteriorating rates of chronic or emergency conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries. Question: Were the Medicare Part A beneficiary mortality rates increasing during the 1990s and early 2000s? Answer: No evidence supports these claims. Question: Does Medicare Part A beneficiaries receive the same value of care from primary care physicians as Medicare beneficiaries receive from specialist physicians? Answer: There is no evidence of this relationship.

While Medicare is the government health insurance program, it's not quite a private health insurer. Unlike private insurers, Medicare doctors work for Medicare and are compensated based on their Medicare Medicare physician fee schedule (PFS). Medicare pays a percentage of the cost of each service to physicians, even if the patient doesn't take charge of the bill. This is one main difference between Medicare and private insurers.

For example, when a young, healthy 50-year-old takes charge of a $5,000 bill, the bill is only $2,500. If the young man accepts his roommates' $1,000 credit, he'll get to keep the total $5,000, and if the man takes charge of the bill he owes $2,500.

""Most Medicare patients know more about costs than doctors do. But they don't always know much about the difference between a good doctor versus a bad doctor.""

Medicare doctor spending is not uniform, with different doctors paying different percentages to Medicare, as detailed in the graph that follows. The graph is based on two studies, one by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and one by the National Center for Health Statistics.

In 2005, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) found that about 43 percent of Medicare doctors spent more than 1 percent of their income on overhead fees, while only 8 percent of primary care doctors spent more than 8 percent of their Medicare income on overhead fees. Primary care doctors at the low end of overhead-fee spectrum got an average rebate, on average, of $1,800, compared to private insurer doctors, who got rebates averaging $2,200, and for specialists, $3,200.

The high-end specialists were in a similar situation. They got rebates averaging $1,500, compared to $2,300, and for non-specialists, $3,100.

What could be driving this high-end vs. low-end disparity? One possible explanation was that primary care doctors in general are less likely to work at home and more likely to get paid overtime on nights during the week. As a result, the high-end specialists had to charge more because the low-end specialists could not work at home as much. The high-end specialists, however, were less likely to work at night by being paid on the regular day. High-end specialists were also less likely to have residencies.

The NIH recently released a study that analyzed 7,637 patients enrolled in a long-term care program and found that those who took charge of an average $65,000 bill in 2005 were paid an average of $5,898 each by the end of their eight-year follow-up period. For physicians enrolled in the study with Medicare Part B, the average cost per patient was $65,500 that year. For those with Private Part B, the average price was $55,000. The study's authors acknowledged that these figures could be affected by the way that Medicare was set up back then. The authors stated:

Our findings clearly support the conclusion that long-term care payment structure plays a major role in the financial outcomes received by Medicare's health maintenance organizations, and that the relationship is highly correlated in the real world.

Another possible explanation for the high-end vs. low-end cost disparity may be that Medicare patients are more likely to see specialists. This is consistent with a study by the National Center for Health Statistics that found that the number of days in the week of private insurers paying out $5,000 or more was only 36 percent of that of Medicare Part B beneficiaries.

That's a high end vs. a low end.

What about Medicare Part D and Medicare prescription drug benefit?

If Medicare Part D or Medicare prescription drug benefit were based on price instead of overhead, the high-end specialists would earn only slightly more for $65,000 than is the case now. Medicare Part D is based on price, too (see ""How Medicare Part D Works""). And while the federal government reimburses manufacturers for the cost of the drug, private insurers pay a fixed fee to the manufacturer, which then gets paid a return from the government.

But as the chart below shows, Medicare Part D is still much bigger than both private insurers and some specialty drug insurance plans.

""In 2005, the average costs for Medicare Part D were 5"
Question: Does successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice? Answer:," No, in the absence of a systematic review of coefficients. Question: Does a high rate of successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved parental satisfaction with child health? Answer: No, in the absence of a systematic review of coefficients. Question: Does a high rate of successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in an excellent neonatal outcome? Answer: Yes, yes, and a lot. Question: Is the level of interest expressed in maternal and infant births more or less inversely related to the rate of successful completion of the programme? Answer: No, not really. Question: What are the effects of a high rate of successful completion of the programme on the quality of care during the child's early phase? Answer: Not a lot, very little. Question: What are the effects of a high rate of successful completion of the programme on the rate of infant and maternal mortality? Answer: Yes, indeed. But also yes. Question: What are the effects of a low rate (10% or less) or a high rate (50%) of successful completion of the programme on the rate of postnatal deaths and the health and well being of the infant and the mother? Answer: Of course, both. Question: In the absence of a systematic review of the coefficient coefficients, are there any general conclusions you can draw about the correlation between a high rate and a low rate of success of the programme upon achieving them? Answer: Yes, this is very important. Question: After several years of good, well-organized care for the newborn in the neonatal unit, how many children are born with a severe birth defect, and then how many are born with a relatively minor birth defect? Answer: Almost no. Question: Are the babies born with a severe birth defect (sudden infant death syndrome) at higher rates in the two groups that have less access to the programme than the other groups? Answer: Yes, there is a correlation, but that correlation is very low. Questions: Do the babies born with a severe birth defect (sudden infant death syndrome) at higher rates have a high mortality because of a combination of factors other than a high rate of success and a low rate of failure-of-the-programme? Answer: No. As you can see, there is more to this than meets the eye. A simple correlation between these two things is not a sufficient reason to predict that the problem will be solved. But a causal relationship does help us see what the consequences of the problem are. Now, for example, the problems in the maternity wards at the University of Copenhagen is a good illustration of the question. How should we tackle the issue of ""poor access to a well-run neonatal unit,"" that is, the lack of resources for an intensive neonatal support programme that takes care of a woman's health during pregnancy and the birth, and especially during the delivery? The results of the Peri-natal Health programme at Lund State University (www.pregnant.nu) indicate how to solve this very big public problem. One solution that might improve the situation is a neonatal ""caring"" unit in which mothers visit antenatal care as soon as they have babies, so that they are able in the case of pregnancy and birth to take more than 40 per cent of their own time with the fetus. Such an approach could result in a significant reduction in the morbidity associated with childbirth after the first year by eliminating the need for medical intervention of almost all kinds. It is possible that the idea of taking part in antenatal care as soon as the pregnancy occurs is a very familiar one already: with some people, that is, some women. But here in Denmark, where a large majority of women, 70–80 per cent of mothers, have to return home to take care of their newborns, this idea could not be taken for granted. In fact, in some areas, such as in the city of Østfold, it is already the case that it is not a question of wanting to avoid medical management. There are a number of problems. Some doctors still believe that every woman has to undergo intensive prenatal care for every pregnancy, but this is not enough. It is necessary to have a choice. More and more women are now going to the maternity ward because they want to make the whole pregnancy less painful. This is not a result of a lack of knowledge of the risks of obstetrical management. Instead, they want to get rid of the stress of childbirth. This is not a simple matter. It is easy to argue that women can not cope with being sick while pregnant. On the other hand, it is difficult to show how a woman can take care of herself at the moment when she is suddenly being expected to take care of her baby. The idea of a neonatal ""caring"" unit, which has gained much interest over the last 10-15 years, is the only solution in this context"
Question: Do patients with localized prostate cancer treatment really want more aggressive treatment? Answer:," Yes. Prostate cancer is highly treatable in the short term with some aggressive treatment DRAGON SCALE SESSION: How have your experiences been with prostate cancer treatment? Answer: First off, I feel so blessed, there have been many times I feel like crap, I'm so tired every day with the disease, a big part of my life. But there has been an overwhelming support, I am honored to have had the opportunity to have to serve so many people. As an advocate for those impacted, I know what I'm speaking to is in the best interest of me personally, too. I get asked so many times how long I've had cancer, and I truly hope that my service is helping others in some way. I have always looked forward to going to a conference and hearing my name in the same breath as other women who have experienced first hand the incredible results they have experienced. It's truly gratifying to hear what other women are going through, and I'm definitely thankful for the support I have been given.

Q: How do cancer patients with metastases and metastases at other anatomic sites be treated with antineoplastons? There are a number of different tumor types, how do you target the different sites with the same drugs?

A: We often focus on cancer metastases for primary treatment on prostate cancer, but the therapy is very different for metastases in each location. To treat metastases in the subcutaneous tissues, we use the same agents for both patients. Prostate cancer patients with localized metastases are treated with our systemic agents (metastasis agents). This means that in addition to taking the main drug (metastatic drug) we also get an adjuvant (drug therapy).

It has been over 40 years since the original antineoplaston therapy was approved, and today it is far from being a treatment of last resort for prostate cancer. This is due to the fact that there are few known antineoplaston therapies for a variety of cancers.

There are still many questions that remain about the efficacy and safety of the various antineoplastons, and the need for additional investigation to determine their mechanisms of action and mechanisms of resistance or anti-cytotoxic activity of this family of antineoplastons. It is anticipated that in the future, and based on new discoveries, new drugs will be developed for both metastatic and subcutaneous prostate cancer patients, to address some of the shortcomings and challenges with current treatment efforts

As an assistant professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at UC Davis, Dr. Follmann has provided extensive training to more than 2,000 of his peers in the development and use of antineoplastons for patients, and his training has helped prepare our fellows and other trained individuals to be a key resource to this community during the next decade.

Q: Can you elaborate on which medications work best on the prostate or in other organs in prostate cancer patients who have a metastasis to the kidneys, lungs, liver, and other organs in addition to the prostate?

A: A number of studies have been performed in the past to further understand which cancer types respond to which cancer treatments. However, the overall results have been conflicting and some of these studies have been canceled prior to being published.

The newer knowledge is rapidly evolving, with more cancer types being recognized to have receptors that could be targeted through chemotherapeutic agents, chemotaxis may be possible for a variety of organs following treatment, but the most common tumors have some specific receptor sites that may need to be targeted. In prostate cancer, the most widely recognized receptors for antineoplaston effects are the same ones which affect other cancers. The receptor sites for the many agents currently being developed may be new to chemotherapeutics, and some of the compounds may be even more specific to the prostate cancer.

The question of which compounds specifically target the prostate and/or other organs is one that is far too complicated to answer. We do know that certain drugs work on some receptors in the prostate, including the EGFR. There seems to be little difference in drug responses between the prostate and other body sites; however specific targets for drugs may be found more easily in the prostate.

The general guidelines for which drugs work in terms of chemotherapeutic response are as follows:

1. A broad-spectrum anticancer therapy is preferable (including adjuvant therapy). In contrast, the vast majority of antineoplaston therapies target just a few of a specific receptor sites. For example, one study, published in August 2018, reported that a few specific receptors were associated with higher overall response rates to all"
Question: Does music influence stress in mechanically ventilated patients? Answer:," Yes. In this study, we used music as a means to induce a general stress state and a mood state, and compared the effects on the stress response and mood state of the two musical states. We did not measure the stress response. Question: Is it possible to induce a general stress state after mechanical ventilation? Answer: Yes. In this study, we used music as a mean and a middle point, and compared the effects of the middle middle tone on two forms of anxiety-related behavior: the ""flight"" and the ""fight"" reaction. Question: What were the responses of the patients who had no music? Answer: The patients with no music exhibited an increase in anxiety levels through a ""fight-flight"" reaction. No difference was observed between patients with a middle middle tone and a middle middle tone + music (A + music). Question: What were the general results when comparing the relationship among the three parameters using chi-square analysis? Answer: No relationship was found between anxiety level, music level, and the middle middle tone level."
Question: Does reducing spasticity translate into functional benefit? Answer:," Spasticity is an indicator of functional disability. It has been known for millennia that pain signals important cognitive, social, cognitive and affective changes. Functional disability is a process whereby a person has lost his capacity to do things which used to make them function. In order to be restored to functioning a person needs to overcome the impairments and deficits associated with their functional limitations. In the majority of cases, one has the opportunity to restore or enhance function by using cognitive, social, and affective interventions. Many different interventions have been applied in conjunction with various spinal manipulative techniques; the effectiveness of some of them has been evaluated with respect to functional status, motor function, and quality of life. One of the most controversial applications of these strategies includes use of a spinal manipulation technique which involves use of cervical flexion and extension (CFS) (Roccelli; 2002). Patients with the CFS (as an indicator of functional disability) appear to be able to return to a functional range of motion after treatment (Coughlin and Pomerod, 1997). Patients with a more severe level of functional impairment can be very difficult to gain access to. Nevertheless, there is a significant number of patients who regain some degree of functional function after treatment. In addition, some patients can achieve a level of functional functionality which appears to have been lost during initial treatment with CFS and its variants (i.e., dystonia syndrome). In some cases, no functional improvement has been seen after treatment for at least three years. It is important to remember that while patients with the CFS appear to be able to return functional functionality after treatment, the degree of regain or loss is not fully known.

In spite of the evidence for functional restoration through CFS, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that such therapy is effective in every patient. For example, patients have been known to require long-term management of CFS-like symptoms (e.g., daily exercise) and other associated impairments. At present, there is little evidence regarding whether this is sufficient in order to demonstrate that these therapy regimens are effective in all individuals. On the other hand, a small number of cases suggest that this approach appears to be more than adequate in those who are at increased risk for developing CFS or other similar problems, such as post-traumatic or postural orthopaedic problems (McNeil, 2009). As with any treatment, the most important consideration is the potential effectiveness and safety of treatment with CFS. When evaluating effectiveness or safety of these treatments, one should keep in view the possibility that one may be treated with treatments which, in fact, were based upon techniques which are no longer in use. Some individuals who are at increased risk for developing CFS-like 280-290 impairments and related signs or symptoms may be more likely to achieve recovery when using techniques described in the studies above, and yet others may require long-term administration of interventions, which is not possible with standard treatments. However, for some individuals, therapy would be very useful, while for others it would be of benefit only. This variability is reflected in the small numbers of studies that have investigated the effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy for specific CFS-associated limitations.

Conclusions About Functional Restoration From a functional standpoint, the results of the reviewed studies show that spinal manipulative therapy of the type described in the studies listed above can be very effective in restoringigation range of motion, while having limited if any effect on motor function. Because these studies were conducted more than 20 years ago, it is difficult to compare the techniques used to restore movement to the techniques currently used today. There is also the possibility that these methods remain effective, while other techniques do not show as much improvement. Regardless of these limitations, it is important to note that spinal manipulation is the only treatment which seems to restore some degree of functional functionality. Since the therapies reviewed were conducted on individuals with a variety of disorders, it is unlikely that they demonstrate a direct relationship between treatment and functional outcome. However, in some individuals, the spinal manipulative regimens seem to be helpful in restoring behavior as it was when these patients began therapy in the laboratory (Tavolatos et al., 2000). These results suggest that a spinal manipulation-based therapy for CFS could be a realistic option.

Question: Is the holmium:YAG laser the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter? Answer:," Yes. The laser was used for the first time just before the end of 2003, with the first patient of the season. The patients were at the center for a total of five surgeries, and the laser was used in a total of eight the rest of 2004. The use of a laser for the ureteral lithotripter has significantly increased in recent years, so there has been a lot of effort to find other good ureteral lithotripters for the ureteric cavity. Our laser can be used both for excision and for excision of fragments. The laser was used for the first time in 2004, and was recently used again in June 2005. In our center, the laser was used for almost all patients, except for the first case of the season. The frequency of the laser was 30% for excision. In the majority of the patients, the laser was used to repair fragments of soft tissue, such as the ureter, but not so much for the urethral stenosis, which is so common in this stage. The laser was used for the first time in January 2005, and has been used in more than 50 surgeries. It has helped to prevent a large number of patients from slipping through the ureteric canal. This is the main reason why we decided to use it for more than half of the patients. With so many patients going through the ureter, it is extremely difficult to keep a list of the patients who do not need surgery; the laser reduces the number of patients who need surgery very quickly compared to other treatments, such as the penile or penile phalloplasty. I had a lot of time because there were many operations done during the season. The number of men who needed surgery over a 2-year period was over 200. This has also been the reason why most of the patients who went through the ureter during the season did so without going through the ureteric valve repair surgery, which takes several weeks to prepare in the operating theater and is very expensive, at the rate of $1,300 per man. There are many factors that affect whether a surgery needs to be done in the operating theater by an operating doctor or by one of our urology interns. The laser can usually be used in an operating theater, if it is well-placed in the room and is not interfering with any of the other surgical instruments, which are also in the room. In the operating theater, our laser is used in five patients per season, and a laser has been used in more than 100 surgeries. It is important to note that the laser is usually not used before the ureteral stenosis has hardened into a hard line. After it has hardened into a tough line that can no longer be reached, surgery should be performed (see sidebar above). The total number of weeks the ureter has been used to produce a smooth, sharp line before surgery is difficult to measure; it is important to realize that each of these patients had a very different ureteral pathologic outcome. There was a complete ureteral rupture; one was a 100% rupture, and one was a 50% rupture. In the cases that had a significant rupture, the laser could be used because of its ability to produce a sharp line. After the final ureteral rupture, the laser has not given any healing success, but there are few other ureteral operations in the area for the same price that could have provided better healing. That may happen in all patients, but in our center, we have been very willing to accept this outcome. We also have a number of patients with a lot of small fragments in one or more ureters, for whom surgery was also planned. Most of our patients have had more than one ureteroplasty, and more than one laser. As a result, our urology interns have usedgynized their own patients, if they think it might be the most appropriate course of action, and have been very active in performing the disappointments. This is one reason why we have been able to use most of the ureteral procedures we have had available to us without resorting to surgery for the ureteric stenosis. We were able to make good progress in our clinical trials, and the number of patients who received the laser for repair of the stenosis has increased, so the laser is available in our surgical team. On the other hand, our urology interns have been very unproductive during the season, and I think that many more urologists might have been interested in a laser for repair of the remaining fragments. While the laser is considered more reliable and convenient than using a penile or penile phalloplasty for repair of the ureteric cavity, it has its disadvantages and potential dangers. First of all, the use of a"
Question: Metered-dose inhalers. Do health care providers know what to teach? Answer:," Yes, as long as the health care provider is a qualified user and understands how they work. Question: How to remove the cartridge from the inhaler. Answer: To use a disposable syringe that has a disposable incompatiblity valve (like in a blood pressure cuff). Ask your doctor to read the ""How To Help Yourself in an Emergency"" chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (1, 2). Ask your doctor to tell you what to do if the cartridge becomes stuck between the wall of the syringe and the syringe adapter plate. Answer: Try the following tips to unscrew the wall.

1. Place a finger on the wall and press it firmly.

2. Pull the cartridge and use a small-holed scissors to cut the thread thread, pulling the threaded needle out while you use the scissors.

3. Using clean towels, remove the cartridge from the mouthpiece so that it appears to be empty. Once empty, insert the needle into the airway from the side. If it is clear of particles, insert the needle and quickly withdraw from the airway.

4. Once empty, remove the needle again and draw all of the air out. The needle will now appear full after 30 seconds. The needle should be on your stomach.

5. Repeat this procedure approximately 1 to 2 times to empty the airway.

Question: How do I keep my children, teens, and adults out of trouble? Answer: Never use inhaled medications or marijuana if a parent or guardian has a valid medical prescription. Never give someone else a medicine or marijuana without your permission. Use any medication safely. Ask your physician what prescription medications to avoid.

Question: What kind of devices should I use to administer vapor therapy? Answer: Vaporizers create a concentrated, non-toxic vapor. They can be very convenient for patients who are unable to get on and off their wheelchairs, or who experience nausea or other symptoms that make inhaling difficult (e.g., stomach pain, headaches or muscle spasms). These devices may also be effective for chronic pain patients; however, research is needed to determine whether they are effective for chronic pain. Ask your physician, pharmacist, or nurse practitioner what products are safe and effective for using for long-term use.

Question: What are vaporizer devices? Answer: A vaporizer is a heating device. They produce a vapor, called a vapor or vaporizer, that is inhaled or snorted. A vaporizer can be handheld or portable. Ingestion of the vapor is painless.

Question: How do I take a vaporizer? Answer: Place the device on a flat surface. Close your eyes and inhale. Do not puff heavily! You may cough when inhaling; use the device to keep airways clear.

Question: I have a friend who is vaporizing. Do I have to get involved? Answer: It depends. Some vaporizers are considered medical devices in their own right. They repository the vapor from this specific device. Others are legal to use and could be used by anyone. If you see a device that looks like one of these, please call the nearest Poison HelpLine (1 800-222-1222), or your physician or a pharmacist.

Question: Are there chemicals in vaporized marijuana? Answer: Absolutely not. Although there are chemicals that may be deposited into your lungs due to vapors, these do not affect your health.

Question: Will this affect my hearing or eye health? Answer: There are no known issues associated with vaporizing marijuana or using vapers with hearing or eye protection.

Question: Isn't it safer to use a vaporizer that is inhaled, like on a vape? Answer: Even though vapers with hearing protection use these devices safely, it is the safest and most effective for your short-term health.

Question: Wouldn't there be some way I could inhale this stuff? Answer: There is no way you can inhale vaporized marijuana, and the vapor is absorbed through the lungs.

Question: Health habits and vaccination status of Lebanese residents: are future doctors applying the rules of prevention? Answer:," Yes, a recent survey showed that the percentage of people applying preventive measures to safeguard their health is increasing. In Lebanon, in 2008-2009, the proportion of the population that applied preventive measures was 13.2%, the biggest in the world. (The World Health Organization, 2005). It has been the tradition for every child to receive two vaccinations, and when a child has not received these two vaccinations, or they do not receive them in sufficient amounts, the risk of contracting Hepatitis C can increase; therefore, preventive measures should be sparkling for everyone. However, due to the high mortality rates of the two diseases, it is important that the general public does not go missing it with one vaccinations and get affected by the other two at such a young age. (Lebanese Health Ministry, 2007).

As per the current trend, vaccination coverage levels should rise among the entire population. The Lebanese government must promote public education programs and encourage the use of vaccines to preserve the health of its citizens, while encouraging the use of modern public health methods such as vaccination; however, until the Lebanese government ensures that every adult in the country is vaccinated against Hepatitis C, it will never be assured that the outbreak rates on the Arabian Peninsula won't continue to increase."
Question: Does vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia have the same evolution as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia? Answer:," No. Firstly, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a unique disorder. Although many individuals who live with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia develop cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, only a few individuals who are carriers for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are carriers of genital vaginosis (which, incidentally, is a term used as a synonym for vaginosis, which is a different disorder). This is because, while the genetic basis for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cannot be determined, 216 instances of vaginosis has been related to vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia in humans. Another important feature that is different is the level of severity of the disease. While cervical intraepithelial neoplasia can cause a tremendous amount of pain and embarrassment to the female, many people do not realize they are carriers for genital vaginosis or their sexual partners may not think they're carriers. However, those three factors are not the main reasons why genital vaginosis, which is a life-long condition, is not more widespread in the U.S. There is another factor, the incidence of cervical disease, which seems to be less common than vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. The main reason for this is, in many cases, cervical disease can be successfully treated by a course of oral contraceptives.

Question: What is the incidence of genital vaginosis in the U.S.? Answer: It is believed that the incidence of genital vaginosis ranges between 1 and 2 percent of women. The first published report on the prevalence of genital vaginosis in the U.S., published in 1978, reported that only 40 women in a cohort of women in Los Angeles, California, had a history of genital vaginosis.2 These findings were not confirmed by a follow-up study published in 1983 in Los Angeles, and were published in a paper in the August 1985 issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology.3 The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. (STD) is estimated to be 2 million in the adult population and approximately 500,000 in children. A recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta found that more than 10 percent of people between the ages of 10 and 19 years had received an STD over the prior 3 years.4

Question: What should I look for if I have genital vaginosis? Answer: If you find that your skin is turning milky white when you go to the bathroom, you may have genital vaginosis. You will also have vaginal vaginal discharge that is white.

Question: How long can I live with genital dysgenesis? Answer: The length of life with genital dysgenesis is unknown. It is not known if this condition continues past infancy, and if it doesn't continue past infancy, it may be prevented.

Question: How much damage can I get by having genital dysgenesis? Answer: Because most women with genital dysgenesis do not have any symptoms, the only treatment available is treatment with a regimen of oral contraceptives. An even more effective treatment is a combination of oral contraceptives with antibiotics. The two are often combined in certain medical laboratories around the world, although it is unknown to whom the samples have been taken.

Question: Can I have genital dysgenesis? Answer: Yes. Although no one is sure how many women in the U.S. have it, it is believed that 10 percent of women have genital dysgenesis.5

Question: What should I do if I want to get my boyfriend/husband to stop masturbating? Answer: If you are interested in having your boyfriend/husband stop masturbating, you will need a pregnancy test, and if you have been having vaginal intercourse with him, a pregnancy test. Even if you don't find that out right away, your best bet to stop the practice is circumcision.

Question: I have heard that condoms do not work for having my boyfriend/husband's vulva rubbed against me. Is this true? Answer: Yes, that is indeed the opinion of many. However, the effectiveness of condoms is very questionable for a variety of reasons. A study published in The Archives of Sexual Behavior suggests the effectiveness of condoms between 10.5 percent and 25 percent.6 A recent study reported that the average condom success rate is 1.06 percent. However, the majority of the studies in this area have come from small populations and the effectiveness is often not reported. One good example of this is the study reported in the October 2005 issue of Family Dynamics and the journal of Family Practice.7 The authors of this study compared the effectiveness of using a vaginal placebo compared to an experimental vaginal placebo in women with vulvar pain.

Question: Should general practitioners call patients by their first names? Answer:," No. The term ""medicine"" and ""medicine patient"" are completely interchangeable and are synonymous.

Dr. K. Kishore: Dr. K. Kishore, in order to practice medicine, in order to be licensed as a physician, you have to be licensed as ""family physician"" for a particular population: children, children of persons over age 65, pregnant women, persons with disabilities.

In order to be able to do what doctors do, it's very important for the practice to be uniform. And that uniformity is not limited to the terminology. Every doctor has their distinctive name and their distinctive practice. It's very different from the generic name that's given in many countries because it has meaning. We've gone a long way towards uniformizing what we called the ""medicines.""

The term ""family practitioner"" covers the whole range. The term ""physician"" covers one or two physicians, such as a family physician. I think in order to differentiate between one who is doing general medicine and is engaged in the specialties of cardiology, neurology, orthopedics and so on, it's very important for the practice to be uniform. The name that we use has a particular meaning, but what's really important is how it has a meaning and how it helps patients. Sometimes patients won't ask for specific treatments because they don't think they will get any benefit from what's being given. And so that's where we've learned the important role that having the same terminology in all terms may have in helping the patients to feel certain.

Question: Do patients always ask how their treatments will benefit them? Answer: I don't believe the patients always ask this question, unfortunately. If they have certain questions about treatment that they want answered, they usually ask for it in writing. But they very seldom ask in person or by appointment for specific treatment when it is possible to do so without some form of disclosure or disclosure requirement.

Question: Should general practitioners be required to inform patients of such information? Answer: In my opinion, if people were aware of the value of having specific information when they called to ask a question, they would be more likely to be willing to listen to your question.

And that is something that the practice of medicine should focus on, not on trying to control what the patients ask. I think we can teach people to listen in some cases when their request is reasonable, butChannel 5 has shown that even though these patients were told about the value of having certain information in writing, they did not seek out a doctor in person when they were ready, or at all, to know their own treatments.

Question: Has the increasing knowledge about conditions such as AIDS caused a decline in patient curiosity regarding treatment and cure? Answer: I think the knowledge of things like the benefits and risks of treatment, and the risks and benefits of different treatments, has certainly increased the value of seeking out medical information by taking advantage of available means. If there is a physician that understands this, they are more likely to treat someone differently, so that's good. If the physician isn't aware of things like the value of treatments, they are more likely to treat patients inconsistently, which is not helpful."
Question: Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients: are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for transplantation? Answer:," We have reported a series of brain-dead patients (mean age 38 years) implanted with a minimum of 2 transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of brain-dead status [4]. An average of 1.5 transesophageal echocardiographic profiles of three brain-damaged patients with brain-dead hearts (mean age, 31 years, 11 females) were developed and evaluated. The cardiac outputs of the patients were observed following a 10-minute interval of left ventricular function. The cardiac outputs of patients 1 and 2 had a mean value of 9.6 and 9.3 mV, respectively. However, an average cardiac output of 8.9 mV during the postoperative period after removal of cardiac chambers was observed in the patient #2 after 12 days of follow-up. On the basis of a 3-day follow-up assessment, we concluded that the median survival percentage for brain-dead patients is approximately 80%, meaning that this population of patients can contribute to a significant amount of donor heart transplants. Conclusion: A minimum of two echocardiographic profiles of three patients with brain-dead hearts can be developed, and a cardiac output, although a low value, is a useful indicator of a brain-dead patient. Although these patients are not suitable for transplantation, one can safely implant a minimum of two echocardiographic profiles of brain-dead hearts.

INTRODUCTION

Many human cardiopulmonary transplants (CPTs) have been performed for the purpose of heart transplantation since the inception of the multidisciplinary Heart Transplantation Network. In recent years, multiple CPT protocols have been updated [1, 2, 3], and one or several of these protocols could have a negative impact on transplanting outcomes [4, 5]. Furthermore, the number of CPTs has increased since 1995, from 1,064 to 3,093 [6]. Despite these developments, only a limited number of human heart transplant patients are available for transplant [1, 2, 3, 7, 8], making it impossible to provide for a multidisciplinary global approach to organ donation [9].

Recently, a series and review from the Heart Transplantation Network suggested that an ideal heart may be composed of a minimum of two echocardiographic profiles [2] and may also be the best donor heart according to both criteria [2]. These recommendations provide a solution to many patients with a lack of suitable organs that would not be suitable for transplantation. However, most of this literature appears aimed at predicting the probability of organ donation as a means of minimizing this number. The current report addresses this issue by identifying an ideal single cardiac profile for donors.

In the first aspect, we reviewed a series of 14 patients with acute ventricular failure (AVF) in whom cECG and transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation of brain-dead patients was performed. We found no support for a minimum of two echocardiographic profiles of three brains in a brain-dead patient who was compatible for transplantation. Two patients with a median [mean ± SD] survival probability of 81% (1 [1] 0.4, 6 [5] 0.8) died after 30 days of follow-up of their brains. At the end of the follow-up period, an average cardiac output of 6.9 ± 2.6 mV was recorded in a patient #1 who was stable after 13 days of follow-up. However, cardiac output (average of 9.6 ± 3.0 mV) was higher in another patient (patient #2) after 10 days of follow-up after which the average cardiac output had decreased to 8.9 ± 2.9 mV. No cardiac output was detected at the end of the follow-up period, but brain-dead patient #2 who had no heart failed after 5 days of follow-up [ ].

The second aspect of the series concerns optimal echocardiography for the patient. Our conclusion is that at present, some hospitals require an average of 2 echocardiographic profile of seven or eight echocardiographic profiles of five brains (i.e. 1 + 2.5 ± 3.5% + 25% + 25%; a minimum of 2 echocardiographic profiles: 1 + 2.5 ± 3.5% + 25% + 25%; a maximum of 5 echocardiographic profiles: 1 + 3.5 ± 5% + 50% + 50%) for a maximum donor heart. However, by using only two echocardiographic profiles of seven or eight echocardiographic profiles of five brains, echocardiography can be simplified to only two echocardiographic profiles. Therefore,"
Question: Attenuation of ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats: does edaravone offer protection? Answer:," No (Petersen et al., 1985)

Toxicity

Toxicity studies on rodents have been carried out with edaravone (and/or caspase-3) and the effects have been largely due to the inhibition of protein synthesis.

Effects of edaravone on human breast carcinogen toxicity

(1) Edaravone (30mg/kg i.p.) in rats

The toxicity of edaravone on human breast carcinogen (carcinogen-related toxicity) was evaluated using the LD50 of the dose-response curve for a dose-dependent inhibition of breast growth during four periods of six hours each and as a control group. Ingesting an average of 150 mg of edaravone was shown to significantly inhibit growth in rats (LD50 0.9mg/kg), but the effects were not dose dependent and occurred in the absence of any apparent growth or sexual activity (Krother and Schmahmann, 1975). The inhibition was not dose dependent, with no toxicity observed at doses exceeding 400mg/kg. No significant increase in mammary gland weights was observed (Nelson et al., 1991).

(2) Edaravone (10mg/kg intraperitoneal in rat) at four hours

A dose-effect relationship was determined in which edaravone, 10mg/kg intraperitoneally in rats, caused inhibition of growth in the presence and absence of growth. The growth inhibition was dose dependent but appeared to be quite linear. At doses of 10mg/kg the animals had an apparent weight gain of about 28% but failed to progress beyond that plateau by the sixth hour from which time there were no further growth increments. The dose was increased to 20mg/kg and the observed increase in weight gain was very slight. At higher doses (40mg/kg) the inhibition of growth increased to nearly 1/3. The growth inhibition was more than linear and appeared to be dose-independent and caused no sexual effects in rats. This study is noteworthy for its clear example of edaravone's ability to inhibit breast growth.

(3) Edaravone (40mg/kg i.p) and 2,2,4-tetrachlorobenzene (2.25M)

(4) Edaravone (30mg/kg i.p.) at 30-60 minutes after abdominal injection

Toxicity studies of edaravone were carried out to determine the effects of edaravone on the growth of rats and rats were provided with a subcutaneous injection of the same dose of edaravone. Edaravone appeared to inhibit growth of all animals, with or without apparent growth. The dose-response relationship evaluated in this study was similar to the studies involving rats, although the doses were significantly lower than normally used for edaravone to inhibit growth.

(5) Edaravone (250mg/kg in rats)

The toxicity of edaravone was evaluated in a study of female mice using two different dosage methods. The animals were administered either an oral solution of 250 mg/kg in drinking water for 14 days or a subcutaneously injected dose, respectively, of 30mg/kg in two sessions, one preceding the other. The doses of this and the animals administered in a third control group were similar to those that would be considered normal. The results indicated that edaravone had no effect on growth or sexual activity in the mice.

(6) Edaravone (50mg/kg i.p.) delivered by intraperitoneal injection

This study examined the impact of edaravone (50mg/kg injection) on the growth of mice. The mice were provided with an oral solution (50mg per kilogram body weight for 24 hours) of edaravone and were then injected intraperitoneally (45mg/kg). Although not considered to be a lethal dose, the dosage was found to be sufficient to have no further effects except for slight sedation or muscle weakness.

(7) Edaravone (60mg/kgi.p.)ashioned from (2)

This study was aimed at determining the dose required to cause a significant inhibition of growth in rats. Although the effect was found to be dose-dependent, it was found that the effects were not linear and only occurred when the doses were raised to doses usually used for edaravone.

(8) Oral edaravone (10mg/kg) administration (10days)

The effects of oral edaravone (10mg/kg i.p.) on growth of rats were evaluated using two different dosages, 10mg/kg one day and 10"
Question: Does the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale favor left hemisphere strokes? Answer:," Does it say ""left"" or ""central"" as well as ""left?"" This question can be answered either way. In addition, some of the left stroke questions may not have been included. For example, questions pertaining to the stroke itself, such as, ""How does the stroke affect your mind?"" and ""What did you feel?"" may be omitted. There also may be errors here and there. For example, ""What do you feel?,"" ""Do you think?,"" and ""Who are you?"" may not be correctly answered, nor ""What do you feel today?"" but ""Why do you feel that way?"" These are just some of the questions that may have been omitted entirely. Answer: Yes, the Stroke Scale favors left lobe strokes, but not all Stroke Scale questions are scored in this way.

NICHD-sponsored Stroke Scale Development. In 2007, a project took a number of original Stroke Scale questions and adapted them to provide the more comprehensive version of the question. This new version of the Stroke Scale contains only the most frequently asked question of the four; the question about the stroke itself, even though it is often asked after the Stroke Scale is administered. In 2010, questions related to the ability to perform motor functions were developed on the basis of these new, more extensive Stroke Scale statements.

NICHD-sponsored Stroke Scale Development. In 2007, the Stroke Scale (including updated questions) was tested on patients with acute and subacute strokes, patients with transient ischemia, patients with progressive stroke, and non-stroke patients.

NICHD-sponsored Stroke Scale Development. The original Stroke Scale was released in 1992. The Stroke Scale was re-released in 1999, 2004, and 2017. The 2002 version was released to the public in the second half of 2000, with the first public release (based on an unpublished pre-2000 version) being in December 2017. The Stroke Scale is considered the gold standard for assessing acute stroke severity and outcome.

Question: Can a Novel Surgical Approach to the Temporomandibular Joint Improve Access and Reduce Complications? Answer:," When compared with a standard procedure for managing the temporomandibular joint, minimally invasive and minimally invasive approaches resulted in improved access.

Question: Should the Patient and/or Healthcare Provider Be Invited to Speak in the Pre-Operative Meeting? Answer: Inappropriate invitations to the pre-operative meeting may lead to unnecessary and unwarranted discussion of treatment strategies, the potential dangers of surgery, risks to patient/caretakers, inappropriate discussion of treatment goals, and the importance of patient empowerment.

Question: Is It Legal to Induce a Patient to Move His/Her Head? Answer: No.

Question: Can I Be Induced to Move My Shoulder or Knee? Answer: Yes. However, patients not involved in the treatment may not understand why they are being moved, which, in turn, may cause significant health risk.

Question: Can Physicians Induce the Patient to Move His/Her Head? Answer: No.

Procedures

Question: Can Physicians Use Intracranial Drugs in an Intradural Setting? Answer: Physicians may use intracranial drugs in intracranial or peripheral pain conditions in an emergency setting in addition to other forms of treatment.

Question: Can I Use Intracranial Drugs in the Preoperative Meeting? Answer: No.

Question: Can I Use Intracranial Drugs in the Preoperative Meeting? Answer: A physician who is not a neurorothoracic specialist should not use intracranial drugs to treat pain or to modify neurologic function in the preoperative setting.

Question: How Do You Know When to Start Intracranial Drugs? Answer: A physician should begin intralacinal opioids or neurorothoracic drugs for intracranial pain for at least 2-3 days when patients with intracranial pain may not adequately address their pain. Patients have sufficient capacity for pain control and should be evaluated and cared for for 4-6 weeks after beginning intralacinal opioids for intracranial pain.

Question: What Should We Do if A Patient is Not Comfortable Walking? Answer: The clinician should place the patient in a low-frequency active motion position when walking (e.g., forward-left-right-forward), rather than standing on one leg at all times. This may be uncomfortable, but it is necessary if patients are unable to get up to sit down, lie down, or stand up.


Question: Can We Use Immediate-Release Naloxone for Anesthesia? Answer: No.

Question: Can We Use Intraductal and/or Intraductal-to-Medial Pains? Answer: In an emergency, immediate-release non-neurolimuscular drugs for intraductal/intraductal and intraductal-to-medial pains have been reported to be indicated for the treatment of intracranial pain. [18] However, these drugs should only be used to augment the treatment of intracranial or peripheral pain. It is best to use other analgesics at the patient's bedside instead to reduce residual symptoms and to prevent any pain that may have been induced with these drugs."
"Question: Young-Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures: does it predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries? Answer:"," It is interesting that the fracture is more commonly in females. Answer: The number of females with this type of pelvic ring fracture is increasing rapidly. In other words, if the female patients who have these type of pelvic rings did not get the transfusion they will probably not die. This also implies that the transfusion of these patients has not resulted in the death of the female. The transfusion might improve the quality of life of the female patient. The female patients with this type of pelvic ring fractures have a higher percentage of pelvic ring fracture or pelvic ring fractures in other bones and less of hip fractures. The incidence of pelvic ring fractures in the population is not increasing any more than in other age groups. There is only one single observation. When the female has pelvic rings, less will be the injury of other body parts. And a woman who has pelvic rings will have no more pelvic cavity injuries than a non-pelvic-ring patient. This is a good recommendation for the patient but not suitable for all patients with pelvic ring fractures. The risk of death or injury is similar when there is only one trauma with a pelvic-ring fracture and when there is three or more trauma with a pelvic-ring fracture. In this case, many more injured organs must receive multiple transfusions (transfusions) and there is a difference in the risk of death compared with other trauma in the pelvic belt. Thus, the recommendation of only one transfusion for a female with only one pelvic-ring fracture suggests a different approach to this type of pelvic fracture than a surgical excision of the whole pelvic cavity. Another explanation is that the pelvic ring has a higher degree of involvement (a more severe osteophyte injury) than the pelvic bone. The difference in the number and location of the injuries is greater if the pelvic ring is of the same size as the bones. If this is the case, all these injuries should be less likely to progress to a severe fracture. In fact, as we know, these patients must have multiple transfusions in order to get adequate healing time. The conclusion that the number of females with this type of pelvic ring fracture might change and the risk of death should be decreased is not supported by any data. We can draw a general conclusion from this. PCC: Not necessary in our case, if no complications would occur with only one transfusion

ABR: The recommended number of four and the number of patients with this type of pelvic fracture are not sufficient. The use of multiple transfusions for multiple injuries could not be recommended in this case. If the type of pelvic ring is non-obstructive, multiple, simultaneous transfusions is not sufficient.

Question: Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease? Answer:," Yes, vitamin D deficiency may be a feature of celiac disease, but not all children with celiac disease show this vitamin D deficiency.

A: There is no clear evidence that vitamin D deficiency is a feature of celiac disease. In fact, most children with celiac disease do not have a measurable level of vitamin D. Since vitamin D deficiency does not usually involve the body's Mud-Brain system, it is unlikely that many children with celiac disease would develop significant symptoms (such as diarrhea) or abnormalities. It is also a very rare disease (less than 1% of children ages 3 to 21 are diagnosed with celiac disease).

B: There is no significant evidence that children with celiac disease will suffer adverse effects from receiving vitamin D supplements or that children with celiac disease would benefit from supplemental vitamin D. Since vitamin D deficiency and severe celiac disease usually occur only in specific populations (such as infants), it would be very difficult to test for children with celiac disease by measuring their vitamin D levels.

Question: What has been the overall impact of the introduction of the synthetic vitamin D analogues to the pediatric diet? Answer: Vitamin D supplementation is now commonplace in pediatric care. The development and testing of different vitamin D analogues has led to a variety of new indications that can be seen as indications of disease activity. For example, a person with a vitamin D deficiency may be more likely to develop a rash if orally administered D3 (retinol) is given rather than D2 (alpha-tocopherol). However, these analogues of vitamin D are not the sole means by which vitamin D can be obtained! Therefore, we would like to add an additional consideration to the discussion of the specific and cumulative impact of such oral intake protocols on health outcomes for specific populations (children with celiac disease)."
Question: Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals? Answer:," From 2000-2001 to 2006-2007, the rate of unsafe sexual behaviour among the non-HIV population increased slightly, while the rate of unsafe sexual behaviour among the HIV population increased markedly. Overall, this was not significantly different than the rate of unsafe sexual behaviour among the population as a whole.

Why is it important to address unsafe sexual behaviour in these settings?

Increasing numbers of HIV-infected individuals are living in settings which do not provide adequate access to care (e.g, long-term care facilities, residential care providers, sex workers' homes, public health facilities or prisons) and are at increased risk of encountering unsafe sexual behaviour.

In an effort to reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV transmission, sexual health workers have been advocating for the decriminalisation of HIV transmission during all stages of this new epidemic. Sexual health workers and others have argued that unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV-infected individuals is associated specifically with substance misuse, and sexual behaviours associated with substance misuse are directly related to infection (e.g., sexual partner injection of drugs, intravenous drug use).

In addition, other factors contributing to increasing numbers of HIV-infected individuals are increasing demand for HIV testing services. Providers of HIV testing services, in order to maintain their revenue-generating positions, have suggested that additional staff members and training could be provided to address the problems identified above, in both the HIV-infect Medicare population and a broader population, so as to ensure that rates of sexual behaviour are reduced.

Is there currently sufficient provision in the Health Canada and private sector HIV risk prevention programs to address the problem of unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV-infected individuals? How can this problem be addressed at an individual level?

There currently is insufficient provision in the Health Canada and private sector HIV risk prevention programs to address the problem of unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV-infected individuals. In fact, several programs have reduced sexual risk behaviour rates among HIV-infected individuals. However, as noted in the previous answer, significant problems remain, including a lack of awareness, stigma, and discrimination in the HIV prevention field and an absence of knowledge, training or capacity among key providers, including sex workers' groups, health and social service providers, and government, particularly the Aboriginal communities. The key needs for reducing these problems are: improved access to comprehensive HIV education/training; increased resources for prevention education; and increased recognition of the issues and the resulting increased awareness among providers, health departments, public health managers and decision makers (and, perhaps, among the general public). In addition, there remains an important need for an evidence-based and sustained response by the HIV community and government agencies to address problems with sexual behaviour in HIV-infected individuals, and to develop strategies to be implemented at the community level.

What types of HIV education and training best support this goal?

HIV education and training

We have noted that there exist challenges both within and outside of the HIV prevention community regarding HIV-AIDS education and training. These challenges range from lack of information (for example, lack of adequate and timely HIV educational programming) to a lack of awareness among people who are unaware of HIV transmission through safe sex and safe injection practices. There are a variety of approaches that have been recommended to address these challenges.

Increasing awareness among people who are already infected

HIV education/training can be achieved within the context of existing HIV prevention services and organizations (e.g., clinic clinics, referral sites and care workers) by ensuring that all people and groups that are HIV-infected are also educated about their status. For example, in the United States, the National Advisory Committee on HIV/AIDS recommends that programs that provide a complete HIV education include both prevention information and education regarding HIV testing. This type of approach will be especially beneficial for sex workers, persons who live with HIV, and those whose occupation is related to sex work.

Improving training for community and local HIV risk prevention organizations

There are a number of organizations and services available within the community, which serve the needs of HIV-infected individuals who wish to prevent or treat HIV infection and those who have difficulty accessing prevention services (referred to as co-infected). Some of these organizations provide HIV care (for example, health department and patient referral services), while others provide HIV HIV education, such as counselling, group-based therapy and education. Many HIV risk prevention organization and training programs include HIV-based sexuality education. For example, the Toronto AIDS Foundation provides a unique HIV and STI education program aimed at the HIV-positive community through individual and group learning sessions; the Vancouver AIDS Foundation has an HIV education program focusing on risk reduction.

Making the development of educational programs more accessible to the HIV-infected community

To ensure that HIV education and training programs improve, a number of recommendations were made, including:

the introduction of HIV/AIDS education"
Question: Cholestasis associated with small bowel atresia: do we always need to investigate? Answer:," Yes. Small bowel atresia is one of the most common endocrine disorders. It is estimated there are up to 7 million people in the United States who are affected with a small bowel atresia. Approximately 1 in 200 adults in their 50's and up have small bowel atresia. The diagnosis typically consists of a urine test that is negative for any drugs and is consistent with benign peritonitis. However a positive urine test is very valuable in the context of a diagnosis of colon endocrine disease. In the majority of children, small bowel atresia is characterized by either no recurrence at 1 y or recurrence in 3-6 y. In addition a large intestine atresia (up to 2 cm of normal length) is one of the most common causes of atresia in children. One third of patients with atresia have severe atresia and/or colic for more than a year. Asymptomatic (silent) atresia has been reported in 20-30% of large bowel atresia. However, one report found an atresia in infants with a large bowel atresia to be associated with an abnormality in brain or nervous systems. Asymptomatic atresia has also been reported in neonates with small bowel atresia; however, neonates with asymptomatic atresia have recurrence that can be attributed to either recurrence of small bowel atresia or a more profound dyspnea. Another report described a small bowel atresia in a child who had no recurrence of atresia after surgery. This report also highlights the potential for some patients with a large bowel atresia to have atresia. In addition, small bowel atresia can also provide an important role in early neurodevelopment. If there is persistent dyspnea, this may be the cause of persistent periocular nerve palsies. Question 7: What is the treatment for small bowel atresia? Answer: A diagnosis of atresia is often made based on a positive urine test for any of these medications: amanitinib, carboplatin, parenteral lidocaine, triamcinolone, urolithin C. There is no specific treatment for small bowel atresia but medications are recommended at every visit. If there is no recurrence at 1 y, then an adequate treatment is recommended. In some patients, treatment may be delayed an extended period to prevent recurrence of small bowel atresia. Sometimes severe diarrhea in infancy may be a symptom of atresia with recurrence. Other symptoms may include atresia, abdominal pain, tenderness, and light sensitivity. Questions 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20: Is there an accurate measurement of fecal bacterial overgrowth? Answer: Yes, if fecal overgrowth is observed on laboratory testing and is corrected with treatment. It is difficult to measure fecal overgrowth on laboratory testing, particularly in small bowel atresia. However, the fecal test described above is an excellent technique, and some patients with small bowel atresia have been referred by their physicians for a laboratory test. For children that are at risk for small bowel atresia (or colic in the case of a normal small bowel atresia), a fecal test consisting of a colonoscopy and a fecalytic test is often recommended. Questions 21-24: What are the causes of small bowel atresia? Answer: Small bowel atresia is an inflammatory condition that affects the lower gastrointestinal tract as well as the upper gastrointestinal tract. It can be divided into two types of patients as follows: a) Those that initially have only small bowel atresia on laboratory testing. b) Those that initially have only large bowel atresia on laboratory testing and have advanced small bowel atresia with an intact colon. Question 25: What is the most important factor when considering surgery? Answer: Surgery is a first-line treatment for small bowel atresia. While other patients could have smaller bowel atresia without surgery the procedure may not be successful. Surgery may be indicated in cases where recurrence is probable or when symptoms become worse, such as with recurrent disease of the small bowel or with severe symptoms that can only be treated with surgery. Surgery is also indicated in patients with milder symptoms; it may also be helpful for those that are very well in small bowel atresia. Surgery may also be used after successful treatment for small bowel atresia and then for patients who are very poorly. Answer 26: What is the diagnosis for small bowel atresia? Answer: A diagnosis of small bowel atresia is very rare; often we do not find a definitive diagnosis until we have established that small bowel atresia is associated with a chronic disease state and therefore it needs"
Question: Are financial incentives cost-effective to support smoking cessation during pregnancy? Answer:," There are few data in studies comparing the effectiveness of financial incentives to support smoking cessation during pregnancy. We have done this by comparing the effects of the use of an electronic cigarettes (""e-cigarette"") and financial incentives based on smoking cessation programs as we have previously published [6], [37]. We found that financial incentives to support smoking cessation were associated with significant improvements in measures of quality of life in both the context of the smoking cessation program, as previously reported [6], with greater decreases in physical complaints [6] and increased feelings of safety and well-being in the context of the program [37]. The most effective programs for enhancing outcomes related to satisfaction with smoking cessation, though, have a dual nature that involves both incentives and behavioral interventions. For instance, a behavioral treatment program can include rewards for quitting (e.g., cash rewards based on quitting rate), or financial incentives can be used, which are similar to the motivation of regular smokers to quit, but focused on other benefits such as improved health. Thus, we believe that these findings are robust to other studies that have explored the costs and benefits of such interventions.

Question: Why do some people smoke, do not quit, or continue to smoke after quitting? Answer: Several factors can contribute to the success of efforts to reduce tobacco smoking. First, individuals often have different goals and preferences regarding smoking. The majority of smokers are motivated by monetary compensation, though there may be a subset of smokers that have a ""nicotine kick"" in response to nicotine, [38] or that may have more important reasons for continuing to smoke, though it remains unclear whether these factors account for smoking cessation [39]. Second, social support may play a role in the success of smoking cessation interventions. Several studies suggest, for example, [40], that smoking cessation cryptic programs have the highest effect on cessation, [13] [40] [21]. In contrast, individuals that were not motivated byExternal support or behavioral programs had no significant effect on cessation. Third, and possibly more important for the future of cessation and health disparities, there appears to be individual variation in the strength of motivation and interest associated with smoking and cigarette consumption. Because individuals report different levels of interest, they may pursue their smoking goal differently in response to incentives [41] [42]. One study that compared individuals who reported different levels of interest has found that smokers who reported greater levels of satisfaction with their smoking (e.g., having access to products and services they enjoy or can afford) and were more satisfied with their smoking habit were more likely to initiate smoking cessation. However, one must consider the study in a broader context that this goal may vary depending on an individual's level of motivation to quit."
Question: Can medical students contribute to quality assurance programmes in day surgery? Answer:," Yes. Medical students can be part of any programme that is sponsored by the Indian Council of Medical Education and Research (ICMR) or the National Council of Medical Research. They can be part of the quality assessment component of the Medical Education (MET) (Quality Assurance of the Medical Sciences) programme. However, they are not permitted to provide feedback and recommendations to practitioners in the clinical setting. They are required to be ""partners"" in the quality assessment process, for the whole of MET. Life has taught me that I cannot predict the outcomes of clinical practice and I cannot be a part of that. What I am entitled to do is to use my knowledge and experience in training me in the clinical domain and to help me make informed judgments based on medical knowledge and experience."
Question: Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort? Answer:," Measurement of the neck paraganglioma (n = 16) is not feasible and thus cannot be done in a randomized placebo-controlled multicentre trial. The results of our study suggest not to proceed with the current measurement of paraganglioma volume measurement: it may be worthwhile to use a paraganglioma volume marker as a more rapid method of estimation (determined by the size of the paraganglioma volume). Conclusion: We suggest to use a paraganglioma volume marker on the MRI scan of a patient with a head and neck paraganglioma or a patient with any other paragangliomas.

Question: Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions? Answer:," Yes. The three-dimensional model produced by an ultrasonographer, which shows how the large-core needle biopsy results in a biopsy for each area of breast tissue, is highly accurate as a method for histological evaluation of biopsical lesions."
Question: Can bone thickness and inter-radicular space affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites? Answer:," In studies conducted in the United States and Europe, using the Aikian knee of the Bølling method, the placement of the miniscrew is not required in order to obtain a good seal of the inter-radicular spaces. It can therefore be assumed that, in a patient with a Bølling-type knee, the miniscrew may be placed at any position other than that prescribed by the study investigator. Furthermore, the inter-radicular space cannot be used as a reference, but can only provide an example. Question: What factors influence the positionays of the miniscrew during the treatment of anterior knee tears? Answer: It can be assumed that patients with anterior knee tears requiring mechanical or orthotic assistance should also have a posterior knee surgery. Some authors have suggested that the location of the miniscrew should be similar between patients in order to maintain a good seal of the inter-radicular space. In these patients, a bilateral minisocket may have to be used in order to achieve the desired results [6, 7], as well as to ensure complete and proper placement of the minisfeel. The inter-radicular space may also have to be used during treatment of a posterior tear, as it is a critical site for the healing process [8]. Question: What is the relationship between the width and length of the miniscrew, height, inter-shaft angle and depth of curvature of the minisfeel during the treatment of anterior knee pain? Source: Journal of Orthopaedic And Sports Physical Therapy Question: How does the minisfeel of the biceps brachii differ in the treatment of anterior knee pain? Source: Journal of Orthopaedic And Sports Physical Therapy Question: When performing the treatment of posterior knee pain, the miniscrew should not come into contact with the midvasti muscle or the biceps muscle? Answer: This is an important question, and requires closer attention. There are at least two main groups of patients in which the biceps brachii has to be treated. The first group, referred to as the biceps brachii brachii (BBBB) and the second group, referred to as the biceps brachii brachii (BBBBB), are patients who perform eccentric contractions (such as when performing barbell curls), but do not have an intact BBBBB. To identify these patients, the author recommends that: - The patient's BBBBB should be examined by a physiotherapist (e.g. someone with a Bølling-type knee) - In this case it may be necessary to do a full evaluation and perform a Bølling-type knee. The second group (BBBBB) include patients for whom the biceps brachii is well connected to the medial aspect of the superior anterior cruciate ligament. This patient group is primarily treated by the medial aspect of the medial meniscus, while the rest of the knee is treated with a minimally invasive approach. While it is not advised to be performed during the treatment of posterior knee pain, the author has described these patients as having good prognosis for surgical restoration of the BBBBB. Question: Why do anterior knee tears involve the inter-medial aspect of the biceps brachii and not just the superior aspect of the medial meniscus? Source: Journal of Orthopaedic And Sports Physical Therapy Question: What would be the optimal orientation for the minisfeel of the right Bølling-type knee (AIK) during the treatment of anterior knee pain? Source: Journal of Orthopaedic And Sports Physical Therapy Question: What is the relationship between the intra-articular gaposphorus (ICE) levels and the inter-radicular space in the inferior iliotibial band (IT Band)? Answer: An ICE of at least 2 is typically beneficial and leads to a decreased inter-radicular space of over 50%. A lower ICE is generally detrimental, however, and tends to cause increased inter-radicular space. With the introduction of the Bølling method, it has become clear that there is no optimal ICE level and no need for lower ICE levels. The best ICE, however, is one below the upper ICE values established by the Bølling-method. It is known that a low ICE often precedes a return to athletic activity, while a high ICE often results in knee pain and instability. Question: What factors impact the placement of the miniscrew during the treatment of anterior knee pain? Source: Journal of Orthopaedic And Sports Physical Therapy Question: What is the value of this technique in restoring the medial epicondyle (MGE) to the normal medial iliotibial band (IT Band)? Answer: A study by De Jong and Stenzel demonstrated that an IT band is generally considered in good shape"
Question: Do general practice selection scores predict success at MRCGP? Answer:," Yes, general practice scores are moderately predictive of high school grades, but they are not predictive of employment.

Question: General practice selection scores predict the likelihood of going to college, but they do not predict the likelihood of dropping out. Do you know what kind of college they would be if you did not select them? Answer: No. You do not select your general practice score because you are an elite general practice physician. An estimated 40% of all general practice doctors are eligible for selective specialties with only a small percentage (around 4%) earning graduate medical school degrees. You cannot use your general practice score to calculate what doctor would do well or very well for your specialty (unless he/she is the next Dr. Peter J. Banting).

Question: You had a survey where you asked for a general practice selection score (it was not a question) and about 40% of survey respondents gave a high doctor score. Why? Answer: It's a fair question. Most people would prefer to be selected by a top surgeon or top academic physician, but they are not actually that unique. It makes people feel like they are special and will receive different treatment from everyone else. It is unlikely you will be selected by someone else that does not have a unique, high score. Because of these special characteristics, you will be more likely to have that kind of score come through a university admissions committee. They're looking for a unique doctor, not a general practice doctor. You don't want them, you want the best overall score possible.

Question: If general practice medicine were a field, what types of doctors would you be selecting from? Answer: You can be a general practitioner of any specialty you want. There are too many types of physicians available, which is why general practice physician selection is an issue of choice.

Question: My doctor has been performing this for years. You can have some of the best blood glucose monitoring equipment, but can't afford the training or the equipment to do this very well. How do you think this should be addressed? Answer: You do not need to be wealthy or have training. You need to know how, when and why that type of equipment would be worth investing in and need to have those tools available and in working order. You need trained nurses and have them trained so you can do this very accurately at your home. You need the best technicians and also technicians capable of diagnosing and getting into the hands of the patient. You need a good lab but not need a diagnostic instrument other than those already in the field. You need a high tech lab (including ultrasound) and a high tech laboratory (including RNA testing). You need trained diagnostic tools (e.g. endoscopy) with the capability to take blood, get samples and run diagnostics for an accurate interpretation of results. Most of these things can be obtained in a clinic setting.

Question: What medical schools would you accept? Answer: There is no school that would say no to you but that you should not go if you cannot afford it and you will miss more school/training. What schools would you accept? A medical school that is very competitive such as Yale? A program that is a little more competitive and a school that has a more liberal agenda such as Duke-University of North Carolina-Garrard? A doctor school that will give you the most financial help from their school funding and allows you to combine your training with your research. Some schools allow you to have 2 or more practice areas of your choice such as OB/GYN, Emergency medicine, Pediatrics, Cardiology, etc. and others such as internal medicine or general surgery or a combination of the two.

Question: I was wondering if you would answer a general practice question for me on your blog.

Answer: Here I take responsibility for what I say/post about medicine. That is why you are not reading these articles and videos. The last time I responded on this blog I did say one of the things you asked me to say. The other thing I said was what you should do or should not do in order to obtain your ideal level of practice. It is my responsibility to make sure people understand what I say and the advice I give. Sometimes I use general or general care as a catch-all phrase to address various topics, but that is not the practice I hold myself to. I have personally made this assertion on several previous posts; but I've been very successful at not getting the results I want in the short term. I have also made this statement before about what I believe medicine would be like if it were not so expensive, and yet I had the same results as an internist. The reasons I made this statement then were because of our general practice experience (which wasn't particularly good). After much discussion, I realized that I couldn't have everything. When you look more deeply into my approach to medicine, the reasons why I am not successful are"
Question: The Deformity Angular Ratio: Does It Correlate With High-Risk Cases for Potential Spinal Cord Monitoring Alerts in Pediatric 3-Column Thoracic Spinal Deformity Corrective Surgery? Answer:," The Deformity is defined as an angular ratio greater than 15 degree deviation, which equates to 10% of the total body height, of 0.5 degrees or more from the longitudinal axis of the cervical spine. If a patient has any degree of deformity greater than 5% of body height, the patient may require a lower-risk assessment.

Question: Is it safe to perform 3 column thoracic spinal deformation for pediatric patients? Answer: While patients undergoing 3-column thoracic spinal deformation may be less susceptible to cervical spine abnormalities, this procedure doesn't always cause the same degree of cervical spinal instability. Patients undergoing 3-column thoracic spinaldeformation and their families should closely examine the cervical spine after the surgery and make sure it is stable prior to any further procedures.

Question: The 3-column thoracic spine surgery is more successful if patients have been undergoing the same procedure for years. Why? Answer: The 3-column thoracic spine surgery is more successful if patients have been having the surgery for at least three years. When it is determined that a patient underwent the 3-column thoracic spine surgery many years ago, it is possible that he can still perform the operation successfully and safely.

Question: How much more surgery is needed for high-risk spinal deformities than for normal ones? Answer: Patients with a 6-10 degree deviation from the longitudinal axis of the cervical spine will typically see some degree higher spinal spinal instability than the patients with an 8-12 degree deviation or greater.

Question: A patient has had this MRI for spinal cord anomalies and it shows only 6 to 8 percent abnormalities, and the surgery has been successful. Is this the right procedure? Answer: The MRI indicates a low level of abnormalities, and this is consistent with the diagnosis of a low degree of spinal asymmetry. This type of deformity could involve the entire cervical vertebrae or a small number of neck vertebrae. The surgical approach required is a conservative approach where the patient doesn't attempt to treat the abnormality directly. However, a combination of therapies may be used (for example, surgical fusion of the paraspinal cord to the spinal fusion, etc.) to treat this particular spinal deformity.

Question: Some patients develop spinal pain or discomfort during surgery after surgery to correct or reduce a spinal deformity. This can be a bothersome experience. In what situations could you or your nurse assess a patient to evaluate his or her level of discomfort? Answer: This pain usually happens in the following situations: A posterior tibial nerve (PTNN) is fused. This means that when the patient is performing a cervical vertebral fusion surgery, the cervical spine will become less stable with each rotation or in the following year. This might cause the patient to experience some sensation in a particular area such as the back of the neck, or a numb and tingling feeling in the buttocks. The PTNN usually has to remain fused for up to one year after the surgery so the patient doesn't have to remain in bed for a long time after the surgery.

A cervical nerve is fused in two parts. The cervical spine will feel more unstable with each rotation of the spine. This may result in discomfort and pain.

An upper cervical vertebra or cervical spine segment is fused with a lumbar spine segment. This means that the cervical spine will feel more unstable with each rotation of the spine. This can result in pain or discomfort in the lumbar region.

Nerve root lesions have been identified with the surgical approach. The nerve root can be fused or fused in two parts. The nerves that connect and form the neck in these patients may feel more unstable.

The thoracic aorta is fused, so the thoracic segment feels less stable during rotation surgery.

The thoracic spine is fused with another spine, and it will feel more unstable. This can occur with more than one fusion. When this happens, the patient might feel pain or discomfort in the lower back, buttocks, buttocks, genitals, etc.

A nerve root lesion can indicate fusion. In these cases, they usually occur in the back of the neck, the pelvis, or the lower back. There can be pain in the lower back, buttocks, buttocks, genitals, or pelvic organ. In the thoracic spine, the spinal cord can become fused to the spine. This can cause discomfort and injury.

An MRI scan can sometimes show a lesion in a nerve root segment, but it is usually not obvious that a nerve root has been fused or fused in two segments. This is called fusion of an unknown segment.

A spine segment is fused with another spine,"
Question: Does age moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients? Answer:," Older age has a very high risk of developing psychosis. But if psychosis is a major problem for an elderly person, then the treatment should target treatment for psychosis over the course of his or her life. Further, the individual who developed a psychotic episode in the past and never developed another, IDs should have an alternative set of skills that he or she can utilize to manage their emotional and social problems. For example, the psychopath may not need to think about problems all that often, yet they still need to cope with many unpleasant things. However, with more training and experience, people with personality disorder could adapt to their emotional problems and problems related to physical disabilities and difficulties with other psychological disabilities.

Question: Is the diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other psychotic disorders necessary to obtain employment during a transitional period? Answer: In general, it is not necessary to be diagnosed with a psychiatric diagnosis to obtain a job. However, individuals with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders are at risk as a result of a negative judgment within the workplace. They cannot be tolerated without treatment even if they seem to be well meaning.

Question: Was it safe for patients in the early 1970s to have a psychostimulant drug in their system? Some patients had even higher blood levels of drug than they would on a healthy person. Answer: There are a number of medical problems associated with heavy psychostimulants; however, the treatment of most patients has improved as a result of more accurate screening by the medical community and the use of medication. The psychostimulants used then were an amine amine amine. These drugs are now generally available as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Question: Patients who have a history of substance abuse can be harmed by the overuse of psychostimulants. But what is the best method of managing treatment needs? Answer: The best way is to identify the problem, work with the patient to address it, and provide the necessary treatment. Patients who abuse substances are at an increased risk of developing psychotic disorders in the future.

Question: Could the use of antipsychotics decrease the risk of developing a first episode of psychosis? Answer: Although it may be difficult to predict a first episode of psychosis, the risk of developing psychosis in those who abuse psychostimulants may be significantly reduced according to several studies.

Question: Do psychiatric medications have a protective role against suicidal behaviors? Answer: Several different studies have supported that there are some beneficial effects of psychiatric medications. Among psychiatric drugs, lithium is the most commonly used. Studies have also reported that lithium reduces suicide in those who otherwise might be suicidal. As a rule, antidepressant drugs, however, do not protect against suicide, because they may aggravate and contribute to the symptoms of depression (e.g., fatigue, mood swings, sleep disturbance).

Question: With the advent of the SSRI antidepressant, could the use of psychotropics be considered unethical, even under certain circumstances? Answer: Only under specific medical procedures, such as elective surgery. The use of psychotropics under general health or general medical conditions does not usually involve ethical considerations, for two reasons: 1) A psychotherapeutic procedure such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is more associated with ethical issues, because the side effects and the death it can cause could be far more serious if the patient dies at the hospital. 2) Anticonvulsants may induce other adverse effects like weight gain or erectile dysfunction.

Question: Do the antidepressant drugs have an analgesic effect? Answer: Currently, the only pharmacologic agent in use currently is an antidepressant, which has many analgesic properties. Other medications that are sometimes used in the treatment of pain include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, botulinum toxin, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants.

Question: Some studies show that the use of psychostimulants has an analgesic effect despite the fact that their effect on the central nervous system (CNS) is more pronounced. Does the increase of pain associated with psychotropics translate into an increase in painkiller use by people who are suffering, who would otherwise require more opioid medication? Answer: There is some evidence that psychotropics actually have an analgesic response, but there needs to be a better understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of the effects on CNS functions from use of the medications.

Question: Is pain a sign of psychosis? Answer: There have been some studies that show that the use of psychostimulants may be associated with a slightly increased risk of developing psychotic disorders, particularly suicide. But others are not so convinced. For example, some previous studies revealed that the frequency of psychotic disorders can be influenced by the age and length of exposure to psychiatric disorders, but the effect, if any, is quite small. Also, not all studies"
Question: Autoxidation products of both carbohydrates and lipids are increased in uremic plasma: is there oxidative stress in uremia? Answer:," There is no obvious evidence for oxidative stress in the presence of both lipids and carbohydrates. There appears to be the potential of increased oxidation in the presence of lipids but this is not strong. A comparison is found between the two sources of oxidized lipids. However, the effects on LDL particles size are not similar. The plasma LDL particle size seems to be unaffected by the presence of carbohydrates and lipids. This does not necessarily prove that the lipid compounds have no effect on atherosclerosis or heart disease but does suggest that oxidative stress may not necessarily result in oxidative damage. The issue of the effect on lipid metabolism is discussed in the article (11).

Question: Can uremic plasma, after the first ingestion of osmotic uremic solution, increase the concentration of the drug in the tissue? Answer: There is a possibility that it increases the concentration of the drug within the tissue. However, there is no evidence with regard to this hypothesis. The study (8) involved a similar situation, that is, the first administration of the drug resulted in a high concentration in the venous plasma, which then increased again over a short period of time, but in the presence of a lower concentration of uremic solution. The authors concluded that the drug may be converted to formic acid in the rat brain, that the conversion might be irreversible and be prevented by using the anti-oxidant compounds of the drug.


Question: In the absence of an alternative way to get osmotic solution, what is an optimal dosage or dosage range for the drug in uremic plasma? Answer: This question is relevant because of the fact that the absorption of the drug through the membrane of ureters requires that there be a relatively high amount of the drug in plasma. Therefore, when the drug is administered through a tube instead of into the urethra, the concentration of drug is slightly lower, so that the drug enters the blood in the blood vessel. The optimal amounts of drug are in the range of 20 to 100 millimoles and this has been tested in studies on rats. An ideal concentration for the drug to enter the arterial circulation according to the data is 50 microM in 10 to 15 ml of urine (1/2 mg). The dose from the urethra would be a value in the order of 50-150 microM, but the exact amount taken down into the urinary canal depends on the type of urethral catheter and whether the drug is given by catheter or tube. If the catheter is made through the urethra with some distance between the end of the urinary canal and the urinary bladder, at least 4 ml of the blood is required of the urinary bladder to reach the catheter and the urine will need to be discarded before there can be adequate renal excretion. In the absence of an alternative way, the plasma levels with which the drug should be administered in the animal should be at least 50 microM on the urine, but an optimal range is 20 to 100 microM.


Question: Is it safe to administer the drug to animals at a concentration of 50 microM in the urine? Answer: Only in the presence of the drug, as noted in the introduction to the article (12). In the absence of the drug, the highest possible amount of drugs entered thepolicy and also increased the amount of drugs in the plasma, so the overall concentration of the drug in the animal was slightly lowered by about 3-4 micro M. The result of the study (8) is in line with the interpretation of the results of the study of Seppälä (7), where a dose of 50 microM of a drug which could induce an increase in plasma levels of uremic fluid was given to the animals. The authors concluded that administration of the drug to animals did not cause an increase in the drug concentration in the plasma, since the animals received the drug as a drug, but it seems to be the dose which had an effect on the plasma levels. The authors state that the reason for this is not totally clear.


Question: Are there any studies on the side effects and symptoms of uremic fluid consumption? Answer: We found no articles with regard to the adverse effects resulting from intravenous infusion of osmotic uremic solution. It appears to be safe for animals to undergo intravenous infusion of a small amount of an osmotic drink. Other studies have shown that it may be desirable to administer the drug to the animal via intraperitoneal injection. The effect is similar to intravenous infusion, it is less severe, but it can be prevented by the anti-oxidants which are in most of the treatment preparations.


Question: Is it possible to detect the concentration of the drug in the plasma by different methods? Answer: The concentration of the drug in human cells is usually calculated by using"
Question: Can 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) be detected in human breast milk? Answer:," No. HPV can be detected in the milk of mothers who are high-risk HPV carriers and cannot be excreted. The virus cannot be transmitted to others in the breastfeeding setting. Further information on HPV and breastfeeding is available in the following publications:

How many types of cancer caused by HPV also affect the newborn? Answer: There are three main types of HPV. HPV-4 is the most common type of cancer and is linked to cervical cancer. It also causes genital warts, and is associated with sexually transmitted diseases. HPV-6 is the third most common type of cancer and causes anal cancer. It can also cause anal warts. Some types of HPV don't cause any new cancers, and are therefore only important for early detection and treatment of rare cancers. HPV-9 is the most common type of cancer caused by HPV and is linked to other types of cancer, such as oral and head and neck cancers. The virus also can cause rare diseases that are only caused in a small proportion of women who are older than the age of 40-45.

How many different types of HPV are common among adults? Answer: According to the US Public Health Service, HPV is caused by several viruses and types of HPV. Over three-quarters of the population will be infected with the HPV type they were exposed to before becoming an adult. As HPV evolves, so do these viruses. Therefore, the number of different types of HPV increases with age, and can make a difference in the risk of future illness or injury.

Can I be infected with two or more types of HPV at the same time? Answer: The only way to be infected with more than one type of HPV at this time is to be HPV-positive at the time the virus is first detected. If a mother is diagnosed with two or more types of HPV at the same time, both have the potential to cause cancer. However, if the mother is diagnosed with only one type of HPV at the time of pregnancy, that virus can be excreted from the body prior to birth. Both types of HPV are harmless, and can cause no serious health problems.

Is HPV a sexually transmitted disease? Answer: There are no ""STD"" viruses, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, that can be transmitted via vaginal, anal, and oral sex. The viruses that cause HPV infection in men and women have different sexual partners and so are more likely to cause infection. However, some types of HPV infection have a close association with genital warts and/or genital disease. It is important to understand that both men and women can contract HPV-related conditions from having had sex with multiple partners. However, most new patients seeking care or being screened for HPV screening will only have one sexual partner. Therefore, men who only have one partner and women who only have two partners are unlikely to have a serious problem with HPV.

Can HPV be sexually transmitted between parent and child? Answer: No. Children who are vaccinated against HPV, are breastfed, and are not infected are much less likely to be exposed to HPV.


What is the type(s) of HPV (genital, anal, and throat) that is most prevalent? Answer: HPV types that are most prevalent are: HPV-6 = 91% HPV-6 = 91% HPV-11 = 15% HPV-17 = 6% HPV-18 = 1% HPV-19 = 1% For a more detailed description of each type, please refer to the following publications:

Do HPV infections prevent cancer? Answer: There has not been scientifically reported evidence that HPV infection with HPV-6 or 11 is associated with an increased risk of developing cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), or vaginal or anal cancer. According to most reports, if cervical cancer does occur during a woman's lifetime, it is more likely to occur in a pre-pregnancy age group or in an earlier age group, which may result in a lower risk.


What role do alcohol, tobacco use, and illicit drug use play in the development of high-risk HPV infections? Answer: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of these factors, including HPV infection, are related to an increased risk of cancer or cancer-related illness in women. As described above, HPV is generally found among more than half the global population, yet there is currently no clear relation between HPV infection and cancer risk. Therefore, there is only the suggestion that there is some ""social selection"" toward men who may have been less likely to develop these conditions.


Vaccination against HPV is not recommended for girls and women under 18 years of age. (Hormonal contraceptives should be used with caution, in order to protect girls and women from unintended pregnancies). Also see our fact sheet about: How much"
Question: Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still matter? Answer:," Yes, surgery can make a difference, but so can the combination of drugs that are available. You can't expect a surgery to be successful without many years of careful Origins and Metapopulations study to verify success and prognosis. To have success, you need to start the investigation, the development of an effective therapy, the development of the most promising drugs and their trials, and the support of a healthcare system that takes the patient back to the place where they have the most success. It is also important to understand that a ""successful"" ovarian cancer surgical intervention usually takes years. As long as your patients are alive, they are not an issue.

Question: Is it safe to perform radical prostatectomy and what causes the symptoms, recovery, complications, and the return of health? Answer: Radical prostatectomy can result in the return of some of the symptoms of previous surgery, in some men just a temporary worsening and worsening of certain symptoms. In most cases, however, the benefits of this surgery are so great that it is worth the risk. For the full discussion on the use of radical prostatectomy, see http://topics.eurekalert.com/pub_releases/2001-08/pt-prostate-cancer-prolum.php

Question: What is the best management of men with advanced cancers? Answer: The best management is to use what you have learned during the previous years to maximize your own health. Remember that at best, only 50% of aggressive cancers yield an excellent outcome. It is important to discuss your clinical goals, goals related to prevention, and strategies to avoid complications of the cancer.

Question: What is the best treatment for men with cancer of the ovary or endometrium? An analysis of 50 years of research has found a good amount of correlation between the size of the tumor and the symptoms of women with cancer of the ovary or endometrium. There is not sufficient data on the outcome of treatment of men with cancer of the ovary or endometrium. In our judgment, the following guidelines help to estimate the best treatment for men with cancer of the ovary or endometrium. The results of this analysis are based on the following assumptions: 2 cancers: ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer and benign breast cancer. 1% risk = 1 malignant tumor. 1% benefit = 1 cancer-free follow-up interval. 1 year follow-up interval = 5 years of follow-up The recommended use of chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer involves a dose of 7500 to 8800 mg every 6 months (12 to 24 months) whereas for metastatic cancer of the ovary or endometrium, 1 year is recommended. Treatment should be discontinued if the number of metastatic cancers increases after the end of treatment. If an ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer is detected during a screening mammogram or with biopsy of the ovary, then chemotherapy can be started at a dose of 8000 mg a day until it has spread to a point where its presence can be diagnosed on examination. The risk of future ovarian cancer and the degree to which the ovary needs surgery are the result of the number of years before the diagnosis, and the number of years after the diagnosis. If ovarian cancer is diagnosed during a treatment for endometrial cancer, then the recommended follow up should be at least 5 years and is dependent on the current state of ovarian cancer. Cancer rates must be measured against the number of treatment-free years of follow-up for a cancer of the ovary or endometrium. Patients that start a standard cancer test or follow-up mammogram while having low estrogen levels may benefit from hormone therapy early and well before the onset of ovarian cancer. The effect of therapy on rates for future ovarian cancer or endometrial cancers must be analyzed in a case-control design involving controls from various groups. The effects on recurrence and relapse as a function of time after treatment are important as an underlying mechanism. If the treatment was started as early as possible in allouth, the risk of further ovarian cancer or endometrial tumors increases as follows: 1 year after diagnosis: 5% at a dose of 6000 mg a day; 2 to 6 years postdiagnosis: 7% at a dose of 6000 mg a day; 8 to 9 years postdiagnosis: 11% at a dose"
Question: Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified? Answer:," There is considerable disagreement among researchers, physicians and patients about whether the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which have had long-term safety data from randomized trials but no systematic dose-finding evidence up to this point, should be considered (see answer below). However, the potential for vaccination of patients with lung cancer after a CT scan will not be limited to patients with advanced disease that has been treated with surgery to remove or remove parts of the lung. Most young adults who die of a primary tumor, those who survive for three months or less and those with less severe disease than those not receiving chemotherapy, would not receive pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in order to limit or eliminate the risk of harm. The most effective way of predicting whether a specific vaccine, such as a pneumococcal vaccine, will be safe for young adults to receive is to check whether the vaccine in question can be administered safely to patients with lung cancer who will eventually die or can recover. If the vaccine is too new, is the vaccine safe? If the vaccine is the same as the previous generation of pneumococcal vaccines, is the vaccine safe in patients who need to be immunized? If the vaccine is not the previous generation of pneumococcal vaccine, are patients at high risk or at low risk for harm? The reasons and reasoning for recommending vaccines for patients with advanced lung cancer are described in many of the peer-reviewed scientific reports on pneumococcal vaccines that have been published in the past decade and a half. What evidence suggests it is still not safe to vaccinate in these patients? 1. Prophylactic pneumococcal vaccinations might have serious adverse effects. The most commonly recommended pneumococcal vaccine (i.e., pertussis/acellular pertussis/tetanus, meningococcal conjugate vaccine [MVC]), which was not recommended to replace traditional serologic methods such as serum for pneumococcal vaccination until at least 1996, is not routinely used in the treatment of young adult patients with advanced disease. Recent research has shown that MVC vaccination does not protect infants, children and adolescents up to age 5 years, adolescents who have had prior episodes of pneumococcal disease, or pediatric patients diagnosed with CD4 counts <800 cells/mm3; these data indicate that children and adolescents who have had previous episodes of pneumococcal disease are at increased risk for disease after vaccination with MVC.1 2. Many studies have shown that vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in young adults can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality; for example, these vaccine is associated with deaths or long-term complications, with particular attention (e.g., a recent study showed a significant increased risk of death among vaccinated younger patients in a cohort of young adults in whom pneumococcal diseases occurred). A small randomized study, in which approximately 50 young adults 20–50 years old undergoing chemotherapy for advanced disease were randomized to receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or a placebo, was not eligible for inclusion.3 3. It has been shown that vaccination also might increase the risk of adverse adverse events among young adults who are admitted to the emergency department because of pneumonia because of pneumococcal infection when an infection had only occurred in adults.4 4. A number of studies have shown that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines may increase the risk of serious adverse events in patients with pneumonia who are admitted to the hospital after an influenza-related hospitalization, or who are hospitalized on chronic bronchitis for pneumonia.5 5. In addition, children undergoing pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for pneumococcal enteropathogens have been reported to have a significantly increased risk for mortality.6 6. Despite these concerns, there are injecting-drug reactions (IDR) for pneumococcal vaccination in children less than 2 years of age and those younger than 4 years that are uncommon, and pneumococcal vaccines are rarely reported in pediatric patients in whom IDR is a problem.7 7. The most common reason for patients who are not vaccinated following treatment with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines is a history of pertussis/acellular pertussis/tetanus.8 8. It is likely that this problem is widespread, but vaccine-preventable diseases are extremely rare.

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and the potential for harm In the past decade, many studies have been done that have reported adverse events from pneumococcal immunization that is not the same as the adverse events reported from vaccines.

1. 367 cases of deaths in adults who received pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in Europe before 1998 were reported to WHO using serologic evidence of previous cases (i.e., serum immunodeficiency or serological evidence of previous infection).9 This figure was reported in a recent report, but was based on a single case series that was completed after the report, so"
Question: Does topical ropivacaine reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients? Answer:," No. The findings of the study are discussed. Keywords: Rofecoxib, ropivacaine, tonsilloplasty, pterygium Removal Of Pterygium

Summary: This study shows that topical ropivacaine appears to reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients who had a Pterygium Removal. This improvement in morbidity may be due, in part, to decreased mortality after removal of the pterygium and its subsequent subsequent growth. The mechanism behind this reduction is unclear and not fully understood, but the underlying mechanism might contribute to long-lasting clinical benefit in Pterygium Removals.

Introduction: Pterygium Removals have proven to be an effective surgical procedure. The procedure is typically performed for patients with tonsillar tonsillar atony, (BTaaD/TaaD) and involves surgery on the tonsils and adductor magnifiers to remove the tonsils from the tonsillar cavity and surrounding upper parts of the tongue. Pterygium Removal usually occurs during operation to control the adduction of a patient's tonsils with dental appliances. The patients' tonsils are then removed by either a periphysis or an incision to the tonsil and adductor magnifiers, and then resawed with surgical tools to remove the tonsils.

Results: A retrospective review of 867 tonsillectomies performed from 1995-2001 revealed that patients with BTaaD with tonsil resection at 4 to 8 weeks of age were significantly less likely to undergo a Pterygium Removal compared to patients with BTaaD without surgery. Compared to women with BTaaD that underwent tonsillectomy on an early basis without surgery, women with BTaaD in remission and who had not undergone tonsillectomy on an early basis prior to Pterygium Removal were 4.6 times more likely to undergo a Pterygium Removal compared to women with BTaaD that underwent tonsillect primarily for clinical reasons. A statistically significant proportion of post-tonsillectomy patients with BTaaD that underwent pterygium removal had undergone tonsillectomy for other reasons. (p < 0.03)

Discussion: Pterygium Removals are an important surgical approach in children and adults afflicted with tonsillar tonsillar atony. The Pterygium Removal provides relief of the nausea and vomiting associated with tonsillar tonsillar atony and provides a simple solution to prevent recurrent tonsillectomy. Although results from studies in children have always suggested a reduced mortality after the removal of Pterygium, few studies have examined mortality among adults. Results of this study indicated that Pterygium Removals do lower mortality, although a statistically significant proportion of the post-tonsillectomy patient population may have undergone tonsillectomy on an early basis.

Procedure: A Prospective Prospective Cross-over Cohort Study

Key Results: A retrospective review of 867 tonsillectomies performed from 1994-1999 at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) revealed that patients with BTaaD without tonsil resection at 4 to 8 weeks of age were significantly less likely to undergo a Pterygium Removal compared to patients with BTaaD undergoing tonsillectomy on an early basis prior to Pterygium Removal. Compared to women with BTaaD that underwent tonsillectomy on an early basis prior to Pterygium Removal, women with BTaaD in remission and who had not undergone tonsillectomy on an early basis prior to Pterygium Removal were 4.6 times more likely to undergo a Pterygium Removal compared to women with BTaaD that underwent tonsillectomy primarily for clinical reasons. (p < 0.03) A statistically significant proportion of post-tonsillectomy patients with BTaaD that underwent pterygium removal had undergone tonsillectomy for other reasons. (p < 0.03)

Conclusion: This study provides initial data regarding the efficacy and safety of topical ropivacaine. The study further supports the hypothesis that topical ropivacaine may prevent post-tonsillectomy morbidity. Keywords: Pterygium Removal, topical ropivacaine, tonsillectomy Removal of tonsils

Introduction: The pterygium is a hard nodule of cartilage located at the base of the trachea. A pterygium is a common finding in the neck of tonsillar tonsillar atony, usually found in the anterior aspect of the tonsils, and can lead jungly, painful, and distressing symptoms. The pterygium is commonly removed surgically at the time of delivery in fetal"
Question: Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry? Answer:," Yes it is. There is clinical and anecdotal evidence that depression or anxiety affect people in ways that go beyond just physical symptoms. However I am not convinced that chronic pain is an inevitable byproduct of psychiatric illness at any point and the overwhelming weight of medical evidence is in favour of continuing to treat depression. There is no reason to suppose that there are no legitimate reasons why people take their lives. It doesn't have to be that way, although it may be. And there is a question about the wisdom of treating people if they have been in denial about what is real. In the meantime, there is something to be said for encouraging people to seek therapy to help make sense of their experiences if that makes sense to them. What is obvious is that there are ways to deal with the impact of psychiatric illness on the way the world works, and it may be possible to do this by helping people live with the pain of their illness.

Question: Does concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence? Answer:," Yes. It appears to improve both the ability to recover urine from the bladder but also improve the ability to recover urine from the bladder in the correct location, a condition previously treated with concomitant posterior/apical repair. However, there has been no controlled research to show that patients with mixed incontinence have a higher incidence of urinary incontinence with concomitant anterior/apical repair.

Question: Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression result in cost savings? Answer:," Although there are a number of indications for using atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy, there are several potential limitations in this approach. The primary reason is that even if these therapies are found to work in a relatively small proportion of depressed patients, there may be significant adverse effects. There is mounting evidence that atypical antipsychotics may negatively affect the brain through alterations in neuronal functioning or synaptic plasticity, or both. This will increase the cost of medications and affect patients' quality of life. One of these neuroethical concerns is the possibility that these medications may reduce the patient's responsiveness to antidepressant treatment. There may also be greater chance of severe adverse effects than with other non-addictive antidepressant drugs. There is increasing evidence that these approaches to depression are in need of further development and validation. In addition, there are some possible issues inherent in treating these therapies as monotherapy with high drug doses. Currently, there are no indications for these therapies as monotherapy, and more prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, quasi-controlled studies are needed. If this approach is to develop further, there must be further testing and validation of the therapeutic effect on quality of life, including how well does the drug work to treat depression, and whether treatments were effective in treating other underlying medical disorders, such as cardiovascular or musculoskeletal problems. In addition, there must be a thorough and well-designed preclinical assessment to get a better understanding of the potential side effects, effects, and risks. References Campbell, F. S.

Question: Diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy: is dilatation of ureteral meatus always necessary? Answer:," The diagnosis and removal of benign plaques is indicated in more than 20% of patients with spastic dysplasia of Ureters. Only if a spastic plaques is present is it appropriate for other diagnostic tools. In general, this involves the use of a ureteroscopy, an endo or transureteric ureteroscope (TAU) for transureters and a catheter for a ureteroscope, although in some cases a cesarean delivery would be preferred. There are 4 techniques as follows: Ureteroscopy, endo or transureteric ureteroscopy (TAU). The primary purpose is to locate the origin of the ureter. It is sometimes recommended to consider a cesarean for a patient who has a history of multiple births. With a caesarean delivery, there is a greater chance of the placenta and endometrium being misaligned. The endo ureteroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that is considered to be the more invasive of the two. This technique may be an option for cases requiring either endometriosis surgery or intra-abdominal urogenital surgery. The transureteric ureteroscope is the second approach in that it places the ureter in the space between the transrectal or perineal ligament and the anterior urethra. This is of slight risk because it is located at the lower end of the abdominal cavity and requires a light transurethral uroepic cystectomy. This urologic technique is not recommended because the risk of perineal damage is increased. This approach should be considered if the patient has a history of recurrent fetal trauma (Moss 1985). In general, if a placenta was implanted, that is, an amniotic sac with a second umbilical cord proximal to the vaginal opening, the procedure is considered preferable to the endo ureteroscopy and only if the placentae are small and the patient's condition shows no evidence of persistent pelvic pain, is not pregnant, and the presence of a second umbilical cord has been confirmed by ultrasonography. The use of a transuse is considered to be the less invasive of the two approaches. A urinary tract infection may be a contraindication, though in rare cases a woman may become pregnant after an ureteroscopy. A urinary tract infection (see Fetus, Fetal & Perinatal Health). If there is a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), the risks associated with endometriosis surgery outweigh the benefits of perineal ureteroscopy. In many cases, an endometrial biopsy would be indicated to rule out possible causes of pelvic inflammatory disease. Ureters are also a popular option for pelvic inflammatory disease if there is clinical evidence of other etiologies for pelvic inflammatory disease and this is the primary factor in the recommendation to consider endometriosis surgery. Endo uteroscopy and transureteric ureteroscope should not be undertaken in patients who do not have symptoms that support a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease or who have endometriosis surgery but no subsequent history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Urethra dilatation has been reported to increase the risk of PID by 20% or more, however, in studies involving more than 60 patients these risks were found to be significantly lower when endometriosis surgery was performed as opposed to when PID was treated with the perineal endoprosthetic device. The most common complication in the perineal end chosen over endometriosis surgery was urinary retention. Endometriosis surgery in the perineal region is considered to be a contraindication to endometriosis surgery in the pelvic region, although this has been questioned by some women, as we previously outlined (Mulherin et al. 2011). For patients with pelvic inflammatory disease, the most appropriate diagnostic technique will depend on the severity of the disease (Pertwee 1988). However, in patients with moderate to severe pelvic inflammatory disease, the primary criteria are as follows: there is absence of pelvic pain or burning,

there is a pelvic pain or burning that affects intercourse other than intercourse at the onset of the pain, and

there is a significant (≥3/1000) increase in the number of symptoms or an increase in pain severity. Although the clinical criteria can also be relaxed for a woman who is not having symptoms (e.g., endometriosis surgery without PID is not considered a contraindication), the goal of the current guideline is to identify the most severe type of inflammatory disease, even if it does not cause symptoms (Fitzpatrick et al. 1984). These criteria are based on the findings on pelvic examination performed before the endocrine"
Question: Does managed care enable more low income persons to identify a usual source of care? Answer:," Yes.

The average cost of care under Medicaid is now $20,900, which has increased by 4% since 2012. The average cost is more than 30% below the average cost of care under Medicare. Medicaid does not guarantee guaranteed quality care for the poor. Over the last several years, there has been research that has examined the cost-effectiveness of Medicaid for reducing disparities in health outcomes among different subgroups (for example, see the recent RAND RAND Corporation report, ""Cost-Effectiveness of Expanded Medicaid"", and ""Cost of Coverage under Medicaid (2014 and 2013),"" which both are available here). These studies have found that Medicaid does not improve quality.

Is Medicaid also better than Medicare for treating obesity? Answer: Yes, it is. The evidence suggests that Medicaid is good for reducing obesity by 20-25% over the life cycle. Over time, Medicare has increased costs in many areas, and with Medicare Part D drug plans, most insurers have had to raise premiums for many individuals. Medicaid costs roughly 14 times more per beneficiary than Medicare. However, Medicaid is better for addressing obesity. Medicaid patients have more effective diets, and more time to eat and exercise, when compared with most Medicare patients who tend to be overweight or obese in the first place.

For a more full and comprehensive conversation on Medicaid spending and other health care policy issues, see the discussion of Medicaid in the health care summary in this guide. Some experts have been arguing that there is a gap between what Medicaid pays and what it spends, and it does not make sense to have a program that can't provide the treatment that many uninsured people need while still financing other programs (e.g., insurance companies, Medicaid, state pensions, Social Security benefits) that are important in providing for those who need them. However, Medicaid pays very well, with more than 99% of enrollees reporting that Medicaid is a good value, and 90% with positive experiences.

Do a little bit of both

Medicaid and its public assistance, SNAP (formerly known as food stamps), provide valuable services to low income and first time home buyers. The current debate was centered on whether more of either would lead to higher or lower spending on other health services or other programs such as Medicare or Medicaid. Advocates for increasing Medicaid spending argued that it was both desirable and necessary for the program to expand. They argued that the current program was too expensive, and was not providing an adequate quality of care. Medicaid spending can grow rapidly with the current health care industry and demographics, and at the same time address other issues as well.

Some opponents of Medicaid argued that Medicaid was simply a good, cost effective choice given the current enrollment. The costs could be handled either with Medicaid itself or from elsewhere. One study showed that Medicaid in the 19 states whose residents are eligible for the program would cost a similar amount as the entire Medicare program.

Medicaid also saves money from reduced administrative costs, as well as administrative overhead. Both federal and state Medicaid officials cited the savings in reducing their paperwork as evidence that the funds saved can be used for other programs. Other spending reductions are due to the increased utilization of health service facilities, especially hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. This led to spending cuts nationwide of more than 13% of Medicaid spending, or US$3 billion in the past three years, due to the increasing number of beneficiaries who have health care needs. One reason that spending on Medicaid has been such a significant drain on the national budget is that the program is available and administered in nearly every state.

Both benefits and expenditures have grown since the adoption of Medicaid. One study from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities indicated that Medicaid spending rose 2.8 times faster than GDP from 1970-2010, with almost no increase in total spending since the late 1990's. Other studies, such as the RAND Governmental Research Council study ""Fiscal Responsibility for the Health Care System"" (published by RAND, 2003) found that Medicaid has helped improve the health of a growing number of people and has made hospitals and insurers more efficient by reducing uncompensated care. Overall, the savings from Medicaid are substantial over time and can be used to fund other health benefit programs.

Medicaid has several requirements. They include the requirement that those obtaining insurance through Medicaid are to have income below 133% of the federal poverty level of $16,490 for a family, or $45,080 for a single person. The federal poverty limit has been frozen since the 1970's for both new, and established or expanded beneficiaries. In order to receive Medicaid, individuals must either be able to pay, or qualify for an exclusion or subsidy, provided by Medicaid or the state, under tax credits or subsidies established in the legislation. Individuals who were previously eligible for Medicaid but were previously uninsured could continue to use this coverage, which has a lifetime limit. However, in order to qualify for Medicaid, individuals mustDIABET"
"Question: Knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation: are they related in Parkinson's disease? Answer:"," An updated meta-analysis of 19 published studies on 1049 patients shows no evidence for significant differences in lower extremity strength, flexibility, mobility, and mobility capacityhealthy, healthy older adults as well as older individuals with Parkinson's disease: knee extensor strength and functional ambulation (Rennie JL, Rennie, C.; et al.; Neurology 2015:74:937-941. doi:10.1318/neuro.2015.74.937).

Rennie and colleagues suggest that this review should inform researchers into an area of ongoing research for a potential clinical benefit of exercise of the knee in Parkinson's patients. To our knowledge, there are no published studies of any patient populations on the effects of exercise on the knee, knee health or knee pathology. In addition, the current review does not consider the effects of exercise on other joints that have also been targeted and studied for potential adverse effects including shoulder, wrist, forearm, hand, elbow, finger and wrist. Further research is required to explore the relationship between exercise and knee pain, biomechanics, exercise selection, exercise intensity, and exercise time.

Although no clinical trial has examined the effects of long-term exercise training on a variety of joints, knee pain has been linked to low-intensity exercise including long ellipses (30-45 seconds), stair climbers/stair climbing (10 meters and up), or treadmill running (≤60 minutes).13 For example, a large meta-analysis from seven studies in which knee pain was treated with graded exercise (45 min on 5 days) to reduce pain compared with exercise without analgesia (2 days exercise, 3 days pain) found no change in pain or on pain severity after 6 weeks of moderate exercise in patients with knee pain (Rennie et al., 2015).16

Therefore, the current review is meant to provide a baseline assessment of the impact of exercise training on knee pain and knee disease. The aim was to examine the relationship between exercise and pain and the occurrence of disease or its progression.

Subjects and methods: A search of the MEDLINE® database was used to identify prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials assessing the effects of moderate-to-vigorous exercise (i.e., moderate-intensity aerobic exercise [i.e., long-distance running].

METHODS: Participants included adults with knee pain (defined as either non-radiographic pain (n = 907) or radiographic pain >6 cm) aged ≥65 years who were considered at low risk of developing disease. Inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 18 or over, not taking medications or psychotropic medications, with no history of chronic knee disease or previous episodes of radiographic knee pain. Exclusion criteria were as follows: history of a previous knee injury, prior knee surgery or cartilage tears, current injury, use of osteoarthritis medications, use of medications that reduce blood flow to the joint, history of orthopedic treatment, unstable limb, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), abnormal electrocardia (ECG) for at least 100 beats, and/or history of radiological knee pain for more than 12 hours. For studies reporting data on exercise training effectiveness and safety by exercise program, duration, frequency, and duration of exercise were included.

RESULTS: Nine RCTs (n = 774) were eligible for this study. Ten of them enrolled 907 or more participants. Nine of the studies included older adults (range, 65-100 years) and four included women (range, 42-70 years). Average follow up times were 12 months, 6 months, 2 months, 1 month or less. Overall, there were no differences between groups in terms of age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, medication and disease history, or baseline knee pain levels. All RCTs reported a decrease in symptoms of pain over time (average mean decrease in mean pain level (mm) was −3.4, 15.6, and −18.3, respectively). There was variability in the results of some RCTs with several with a mean decrease of greater or lower than −2.5 mm in pain.

CONCLUSIONS: Despite no clinical evidence of an ergogenic effect, moderate-to-vigorous exercise has no apparent effect on knee pain, knee health or the occurrence of disease.

Physical activity and cognitive decline

RCTs suggest no effect of daily exercise on cognitive function

Knee stiffness is associated with cognitive status, but the nature of changes in cognitive function and whether exercise is an important factor in its effects remain unclear:

Brain structure changes: The extent to which cognitive decline may be responsible for the findings is controversial and the evidence is limited. Several prospective longitudinal studies of young people suggest that early"
"Question: Is distance to provider a barrier to care for medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer? Answer:"," Yes. It is an increasing barrier. For decades, providers were the ones who visited and saw patients. These days, they aren't even close to seeing patients and getting the treatment they need. The average length of stay for a primary-care provider who sees patients for a period of 30 days or more isn't less than a week. The median wait time is almost 2 months, and most providers take up to 6 months. And it doesn't end at 90 days. Many providers see multiple patients a day. They'll see a patient in the ICU three times before their doctor even sees them, let alone calls them in as a patient.

What's more, in the United States today the average wait for treatment by one of the 5,000 physicians who see patients for 30 days or more has become 90 days. If patients are in the ICU for 90 days or longer, it's time to consider a special kind of care. If we can't find a provider who is seeing patients at 30 days or more, we'll see them later in the day, late at night, in the hospital for emergency surgery.

Question: Is it OK for medicaid patients to change providers? Answer: Yes. It's up to the state of residency. If you don't see the patient in your first or second appointments and are still having trouble, your physician must provide a referral to another physician to find the patient. This means that patients are frequently switching hospitals or doctor's offices over the course of time. Even though it's not technically cheating, this is still a problem because we're moving patients from one special health-care system to another. Patients can switch hospitals without any penalty that they would have if the hospital they've been treated at is still paying for their treatment.

What's more, in some states you can move clinics from the one in which you're treated to another one. This isn't as common as it used to be. That means that if you need a bone transplant in New Jersey or need chemotherapy pills in Virginia, you might have to go to another doctor. If the state prohibits transferring hospitals, we find it hard to know what they might want for you.

These problems affect many states, but the trend is accelerating. As a result, one doctor in Oregon says, people have started asking, ""If I need to move to a different state, it's OK to go where the people who are paying for my treatment are?"" So it'll be harder to keep track of who is paying for your care. It may become harder for the Department of Medicaid to keep track of all these patients in the United States. Without the federal guarantee of a certain number of patients for each provider and with the proliferation of services, the problem will only get worse.

What's to be done?

One answer to this problem is to get the federal government to guarantee that you can pay your monthly premiums without having to transfer to another state. (I've written about this, specifically, in an ongoing research project that I've been planning, entitled ""Health care reform: the health care reform that will help to drive health care costs down."" In short, I think the law will reduce costs, promote economic growth, promote better health care delivery, and reduce the barriers to care for patients with chronic conditions.) This wouldn't go far enough, however, because we still need to protect people from financial risks, particularly if the state isn't fulfilling its contractual obligation of providing that coverage. (We need to do this in order to make sure you have access health insurance even if the state doesn't, for example, continue to pay a hospital bill you've paid before.)

Another way to help reduce the barriers to care for patients is to increase the pool of providers in the United States. The National Center for Health Statistics estimates that the number of physicians in the United States rose from about 2 million in 1965 to about 3.5 million in 2009. This includes physicians who practice in rural areas, in underserved areas, and other health-care providers who don't belong to a health-professional organization like the American Medical Association. In 2009 these included about 600,000 doctors in New York City. Those two numbers were enough to provide a very realistic picture of the U.S. health-care system.

One way to help ensure that doctors who specialize in health or care for the poor get more medical practice in the United States--and more patients who have access to quality health care--would be to create new, competitive bidding procedures to provide health-care coverage. One proposal, called the National Provider Matching Program, was introduced in Congress in 2009. Its supporters said that it would provide the competition needed to get the numbers of doctors to the 5 million mark that are necessary to get the number of patients who could benefit from a ""universal"" health care system. Unfortunately, it didn't"
Question: Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome? Answer:," No study has directly investigated this issue. Folic acid supplementation was found to extend the life span and to prevent certain neurological disorders, which are linked to birth defects in Down syndrome. In a case control study by the Swedish team, folic acid supplementation was associated, albeit moderately, with a decrease in the number of congenital heart disease cases (odds ratio, 0.94) in women with Down syndrome in Stockholm. In a case-control study in Barcelona, Spain, which involved more than 100,000 patients, folic acid supplementations were associated with a decrease in the incidence of congenital heart disease (odds ratio, 0.85) in women with Down syndrome aged 50 years and younger, although the effect was less significant in women whose mothers were high-folic-acid supplement users (odds ratio, 0.86). This discrepancy may be explained in part by the fact that folic acid was not considered a risk factor for the heart defect that the Barcelona study examined, and that the subjects in the case and control groups of Down syndrome were different in age and weight. Nevertheless, most studies do not exclude the possibility that folic acid supplementation could exert some effect on the incidence of congenital heart disease in people with Down syndrome, although this has not been systematically studied. It is also possible that the beneficial effect, which has been observed, may be a result of different types of folic acid.

Why can we not prevent all kinds of heart defects without taking supplements? Answer: Although certain kinds of defects occur in approximately one in ten babies, most of these defects do not require extra treatment. In fact, the risk of developing a heart defect or the presence of an enlarged chest is not higher in girls than in boys with Down syndrome. For example, the risk of developing an enlarged heart is highest in girls who were breastfed as infants and who have breast buds on the breast for the entire life. Girls who did not breastfeed as infants are at an even higher risk of developing heart defects.

What kind of heart defects cause heart disease in children with Down syndrome? Answer: It is very difficult to identify a cause in any given case. What is known, however, is that children with Down syndrome have a greater prevalence of heart defects compared to the general population, owing to the genetic predisposition for a specific heart defect, the presence of which may develop in several organ systems early in development. Heart defects may involve the heart, left or right ventricle, the ventricles of the brain, or both ventricles. These defects, which result in enlarged hearts and abnormal or abnormal rhythms, may result in heart failure and require surgery.

Does this mean that we should stop taking supplements on top of your diet? Answer: Yes, supplements should definitely be discontinued and should be made more palatable using alternative strategies. One approach is to replace a substance with something else—like bread. Another way to reduce the amount of folic acid, and other vitamin B12, is by substituting meat with chicken and other foods that lack vitamin B12, in a manner similar to the solution from the old ""Eat 'em or we'll die!"" scare. Another alternative is to take folic acid with fruits and vegetable and to take less than the suggested dosage of vitamins B12 and vitamin C due to problems with absorption. Another approach is to give folic acid to older children until they are at least 18 years old (instead of 16 years old, as recommended by the FDA); if they continue to take the recommended dosage, they may take more folic acid, which could also harm their immune system.

Can folic acid help prevent the development of any other heart defects related to Down syndrome? Answer: It is worth noting that folic acid does not protect against aflatoxin poisoning (caused by anaerobic digestive acid, which is produced by bacteria and may be present in the environment of pregnant mothers). That is because the enzyme that makes folic acid is the same that produces anaerobic bacteria.

Can folic acid prevent the diseases and disorders that are caused by Down syndrome? Answer: Studies in mice are not sufficient to establish a direct relationship between folic acid and prevention of diseases caused by Down syndrome. However, there also are no known negative effects on the neurological development of patients with Down syndrome, although they may have a higher risk of certain neurological disorders. For example, if folic acid is taken in adequate amounts, there is no increased risk of neurodegenerative disease in healthy individuals with Down syndrome, although certain neuropsychiatric disorders are more common in women with Down syndrome. For these reasons, a more comprehensive approach is necessary. For example, folic acid supplementation could be used in combination with other lifestyle and diet interventions.

What happens if I take too much folic acid? Answer: A risk for developing certain kinds of disorders may increase as a result of taking too much folic"
Question: Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba? Answer:," Yes. The general health care systems of francophone and non-francophone populations in the province are very similar. These two groups have much higher rates of both high and low levels of the depressive, anxiety and stress disorders. Both groups are affected at similar rates by depression, anxiety and stress disorders. As for the mental health outcomes, the two groups are more likely to be in the mental health services compared to their non-francophone counterparts. In addition, men have lower rates of psychiatric hospitalisation and the prevalence of psychotic disorders are higher in francophone men.

Question: Does type 1 diabetes mellitus affect Achilles tendon response to a 10 km run? Answer:," No type 1 diabetes mellitus affects Achilles tendon response to a 10 km run. Do it?

Answer: Yes, type 1 diabetes mellitus decreases tendon stiffness. But tendon stiffness is caused by a defect in a specific tendon fiber. Type 1 diabetes mellitus will not normally affect tendon response on a 10 km run.

Answer: A few studies showed that type 1 diabetes, though it may decrease tendon stiffness in the same way as type 2 diabetes has, doesn't alter Achilles tendon response to a 10 km run. This is not definitive.

Answer: A recent study showed that type 1 diabetes mellitus doesn't modify Achilles tendon stiffness at all in healthy men and women.

Is that because type 1 diabetes does in some ways impair Achilles tendon response to a 10 km run? Answer: Type 1 diabetes is not directly affected by running but can weaken Achilles tendon stiffness. This is not definitive proof. It also depends on the type of Achilles tendon. A tendon muscle can have stiffness in several ways. There are many===============

Answer: No, Achilles tendon stiffness has not been shown to change by running. You might read that a joint stiffness is increased by running, or it has a high stiffness.

Answer: Is Achilles tendon stiffness affected in type 1 diabetes mellitus?

Answer: Yes, it can get worse and more variable and less responsive. There are other ways you can test to see if you have it. However, the standard test for diabetes mellitus is a cuff skin test. Does your tibialis anterior tendon show a change in thickness? If so, you'll probably have type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. A cuff skin test is not conclusive proof but it shows that you have it.

Treatment for Achilles Tendinitis

What does ""treatment"" mean? Answer: We talk about ""treatment"" in various ways. It means different things to different people. A treatment involves either ""do nothing"" to fix the problem or change the path of treatment, or take steps toward getting the symptoms under control with a medication.

This is important: The treatments are important, but what makes the difference is not whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. You have the same problems. But what does treatment look like?

Here are the most common treatments for Achilles Tendinitis:

""No treatment"" of type 1 is just ""do nothing.""

""Drug"" of type 2 is treatment that makes symptoms worse, does not change your situation. It reduces the effects of diabetes mellitus or type 2 type. If you are taking ""drug"" of type 2 type and the problem happens only when you aren't doing any exercise, it isn't treatment. It's a side effect. But if you do exercise and the problem happens only at night, this is treatment.

""Cuff Skin Test"" is a device that shows whether the tendon is stretched too far

is too far a way or not. It measures the stretch only with the skin and nothing else. But you have to test with a test strip on your hand, and the cuff is thin.

are too far a way or not. It measures the stretch only with the skin and nothing else. But you have to test with a test strip on your hand, and the cuff is thin. If you have other pain, and you have an abnormal cuff skin test, you shouldn't do any running for a couple of months until you can decide whether it is the cuff or your other pain that is causing the problem. If you think running may make other problems better, you should do it again.

Some treatments I recommend are:

Do nothing to fix the problem. It can help. In fact, some of these solutions have shown to be very helpful. Consider the following: Do the cuff skin test without pain relief. The cuff skin test helps reduce pain by measuring the stretch when it should be tight. Do exercise. The Achilles tendon can stretch and stiffness (when muscles are weak) can improve. Use medication. Do the tibialis anterior tendon stretch test. The tibialis anterior tendon is one of the largest tendons and stretches a lot. It can cause a pain-free change in tendon stiffness over time and this is a treatment.

I do these things. What about others?

What about ""drug"" of type 2? Do you think this is treatment? No, it isn't. It's a medication that makes only the problem worse, even though many people think they can get relief by doing regular exercise. It has caused other problems. Some people get numb hands, and I've had people on medications called ""tendon builders"" that made fingers numb. They went to bed with the index and middle of their hand wet and hard. Some people find a doctor and get an injection that makes one finger more smooth and flacc"
Question: Fragility of the esophageal mucosa: a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis? Answer:," The eosinophilia with secondary and/or tertiary complications is one of the hallmarks of primary eosinophilic esophagitis. In the majority of patients, the pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis is a decrease in the number of normal mucinal epithelium, as determined by the degree and location of normal cell size, by the presence of a normal cell-satellite population, and/or by the presence of subnormal cell-clamp strength in the alveolar epithelium. This finding is also seen with secondary and/or tertiary esophageal mucosa changes. This reduction in the number of normal mucinal epithelium, and/or the presence of subnormal cell-clamp strength indicate that the abnormal mucosa has changed. In the majority of cases, the decrease in the number of normal mucinal epithelium and/or the presence of subnormal cell-clamp strength, and/or the absence of eosinophilic secretory process, are accompanied by the presence of chronic inflammation of the esophageal mucosa. In most patients, the pathognomonic sign of eosinophilic esophagitis is the development of new and expanding feline alveolar edema. Thus, the reduction in the number of normal mucinal epithelium, and/or the presence of a subnormal number of alveolar cells, indicates that the abnormal mucosa has changed. Also, in all cases, the deterioration of the alveolar wall leads to edema and inflammation. Thus, it can be concluded that the abnormal mucosa is changed, and should be evaluated for signs of primary eosinophilic esophagitis. The most important sign detected is a decrease in the number of alveolar cells; it is, however, not always possible to see this in all patients, because there is a wide variation in endological diagnosis in patients affected by eosinophilic esophagitis. The pathognomonic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis is usually seen in the presence of secondary and/or tertiary eosinophilic esophagitis, and is an indicator of a more complex and more persistent pathophysiology of the pathologic process of esophagitis."
Question: Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures? Answer:," Yes, albeit with a few limitations. With this reconstruction, the medial head of the femur is preserved and is often in a more contour.

The surgical management lightweight metal frame is used to avoid the formation of lateral or lateral-directed femoral compression [8]. The procedure can also be used with larger than recommended diameter femurs to preserve the medial head (Figure 2).

A recent meta-analysis found that women without a previous history of pregnancy [9], the general population or older adults [10) had a substantially higher risk of developing postoperative hip fractures in the following groups: female-to-female transwomen, women who had a history of low-grade breast tissue, older women (over 65), postmenopausal women [11], and older men. This risk is much lower for women who have not undergone a gynecologic procedure [12,13]."
Question: Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: are we operating too late? Answer:," Yes. However, it is a very early operation and the surgeon may have to insert a special device (l-scrotal balloon) inside the groin. This could cause an overcorrection in the patient's sphincter and cause a ""rebound"" at this time.


Q: What is the outlook for patients with tetralogy of fallot? Answer: Your prospects are quite optimistic; however, there is a risk for complications on a per-operative basis.

Q: With the newer technology being used, how can I be sure which of these procedures works best for my patient? Answer: If the surgeon can establish normal function by palpation and pressure of the chest at the time of surgery, then the technique is most beneficial. If however, you are dissatisfied by the results, then this procedure should be avoided.

Q: Are the complications from tetralogy of fallot more frequent in children or adults following repair? Answer: This is a difficult one to answer since the number of patients who experience complications when trying to repair tetralogy of fallot is quite low. However, the complication rate has increased dramatically in recent years. There are several factors, the main one being that the use of the new device increases the exposure to oxygen.

Q: Do we have to have two different surgeons perform this procedure? Answer: No, the operation can be performed by two different doctors. This is particularly common with pediatric tetralogy of fallot.


Q: Is there a way to know when this surgery has been carried out? Answer: Absolutely. This surgery can be determined by following your heart on a regular basis. You will see a pattern beginning around 3 weeks after the operation. Your pulse should be low, and gradually increasing with time until around 12 weeks after the operation. In this stage, the surgeon can palpate to determine whether the tetralogy is still intact or has returned to full length with no noticeable change in function."
Question: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition? Answer:," Yes and no. What is the difference between the two? In that most people with this type of cholecystitis are asymptomatic, but there is a 2.5% infection rate which often goes undiagnosed. This is especially true of patients who develop some type of skin eruption or infection over the left eyelid. However, cholecystitis does not need a history of severe disease. It is primarily a systemic condition which can be treated with antibiotic medication.

Xanthogranulomatous: refers to cholecystitis in that it is asymptomatic in 5% of cases. It is, in some cases, also an acute, often viral infection. However, a history of severe disease does not need to be detailed. It is, by its nature, quite rare. There are no standard criteria used to distinguish this from other cholecystitis and there have been no long-term follow-up studies. However, Xanthogranulomatous usually responds to treatment with antibiotic medication. Asymptomatic: is defined by the presence of a 2% infection rate among the patients with this condition. In spite of its mild clinical presentation, it is a rare illness that needs to be treated with antibiotic medication for a while. It does not require a history. This is rare.

What is the diagnosis of cholecystitis? Answer: Xanthogranulomatous: if a history of any type of acute skin disease is available. Premalignant: the condition is more commonly a malignant tumor in the cells surrounding the inner layer of the eyelid. Asymptomatic: if no patient present any such history.

What should a physician do for diagnosing cholecystitis? Answer: A complete history should be taken in the diagnosis, so a history of a history of painful burning, scalding or burning of the skin which results inPg the removal of the outer layer of the eyelid. However, in most cases and especially in the treatment history, ocular findings may also be sufficient. Also, a history of the use of antibiotics, aspirin, or anti-inflammatory medications should be noted. All of these must be taken into account since these medications can increase or worsen the inflammation.

What are the symptoms of cholecystitis? Answer: Any itching, burning sensation on the skin. Pain in or around the eye, usually around the first eyelid. Tinnitus which may be heard in the ears. A burning sensation occurring at the site of action of the laser. It is necessary also to note if a light is also present.

How is this syndrome diagnosed? Answer: An examination should be carried out. These include: Eye examination: Eye exam is recommended for diagnosis in the initial phase when the eye is first examined because it allows evaluation of the upper lens surrounding the eye and also of the inner layer of the eyelid. Lenses: Lenses are examined for signs of irritation or inflammation. Eye examination may include a clear-eye exam. Eye excitation: This is the examination of the eyes to gather information about the ocular symptoms and to determine what the cause is. The eye is examined for tears and ocular ulcers. Ulceration of eye: The examination of the inner layer of the eyelid is performed to identify what is causing the symptoms and the ulceration. Dilation of the tear duct: This is also the examination of the tear duct in a bidirectional way. This can occur via direct eye examination or via a slit lamp ophthalmoscopy. It may also be done with a catheter or a laparoscope. A stethoscope should be used for the periorbital examination of the eye. Ocular evaluation: The examination should include a lighted light source (lamp or lighted slit) for the exam. These examinations of the cornea and the anterior segment of the eyelid are performed on a perimortem basis.

What are the treatment options for this condition? Answer: The first line of treatment in these conditions is an appropriate antibiotic. It should be administered as soon as possible but preferably over a few days. Therefore, in this first stage, the first course should be to a local antibiotic. The second line of treatment involves prophylaxis. The patient should be monitored for any increase in the swelling. Asymptomatic patients are usually treated asymptotically. However, symptomatic patients with clear symptoms require treatment with anti-inflammatory medication and an antibiotic at least once during the course of their disease.

Can antibiotics be used for treating Xanthogranulomatous? Answer: The best antibiotic for this disorder is an antibiotic which acts on the bacteria, so the best possible dosage for an individual patient is usually between 200 to 300 mg daily."

Question: Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method? Answer:," There have been reports of radiation success after a complete brachytherapy and an interstitial method, however, there are two important factors which should be considered in any of these cases. First, the oncologist should know whether the individual is contraindicated for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicaththerapy method. This may vary based on a number of factors including family history of breast carcinoma, family-based radiation therapy, tumor size, location, number, and number of previous radiation treatments, time of disease onset, tumor type, and duration. Even a small percentage of individuals who are contraindicated for these methods may have a contraindication but may benefit from the use of the brachytherapy and the interstitial multicaththerapy methods. There have been no reports of cancer recurred following the use of the brachytherapy and the interstitial multicaththerapy methods, even after many decades of continuous radiation therapy and many, many years of follow-up radiography.


When an individual receives radiation within one year of initiating this type of treatment, the risk of relapse or recurrence should be given greater importance and consideration should be given to the individual's family history and cancer type and whether the individual wishes to continue radiation. There are also other patients who receive radiation therapy for several years and may have low-level disease with little cancer recurrence or progress. In these cases there are advantages to utilizing brachytherapy and the interstitial multicaththerapy method, and more research is needed to understand further the benefits associated with delayed radiation therapy that may be most advantageous for these patients.

"Question: Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" sample generalize? Answer:"," The above study was not restricted to one population (bipolar I disorder children), but its conclusions might help to guide treatment decisions. The ""Treatment of early age panic disorder "" did show some strong correlations with treatment outcome including number of children with clinical comorbidity and with symptom severity. For example, children with panic disorder who met symptom severity criteria with fewer children with anxiety and/or depression symptoms were compared with treated children for the same criterion. However, this has significant limitations: all the children with borderline personality disorder were included, the study included only 11 to 15 year-olds, and the inclusion of children with anxiety and/or depression was somewhat arbitrary due to the lack of adequate psychiatric care. Also, while the group studies included in the current assessment of treatment effectiveness do not explicitly distinguish between clinical and primary diagnostic criteria, it is not unreasonable to assume that clinical criteria such as clinical comorbidity and symptom severity would be more predictive of outcomes than the specific test results. The current assessment of treatment effectiveness included only a single follow-up assessment to the children's follow-up, however, this measure was not used in the assessment of treatment effectiveness of treatment that might have included a more extensive look-back study and diagnostic assessment as well as more specific assessments of all specific childhood symptoms that are commonly seen in children with treatment-resistant childhood bipolar disorder. It is also unknown whether the results would be predictive of treatment effectiveness for other early child bipolar disorder diagnoses. Also, this assessment included two diagnoses, one that may lead to the most significant treatment effect if the current research has a predictive validity. It is unknown how the other three findings might impact the findings of the current research. Finally, for this group of studies, it is not known if a larger and more rigorous follow-up would have helped better interpret these findings and might have reduced the generalizability of the results beyond those who have been participating in their own study. As for each of the children in this sample, the current study and the one that preceded it focused on children as young as 13. We believe that this may have been true due to the nature of child bipolar disorder as distinct from more severe adult bipolar disorder (BD), which we observed in other studies. It is also possible that the children in the present study had more early life experience with bipolar disorder, which may have been reflected in their symptoms, particularly that of mania and hypomania, because of the time they spent as teenagers and young adults with bipolar disorder. To further explore the potential confounders of the intervention, data were obtained through a data extraction form and reported within this study for each individual and the combination of treatment for both treatment groups to see if specific confounds were present. The present study also allows data extraction for the ""Treatment of early age depression "" group. However, in addition to this, the data extraction form asked about gender and whether or not the child was in the child treatment group. In this study, data were unavailable for most of the children, and as such, gender was the only question used to assess treatment efficacy. However, in future studies we would like to include more information about gender and include it separately.

DISCUSSION Our aim with this study was to compare children with treatment-resistant childhood bipolar disorder on symptoms from an early childhood treatment, as well as clinical and demographic characteristics as well as outcome measures from in-home visits with our child bipolar disorder treatment assessment tool to explore the potential relationship between child bipolar disorder treatment and symptom severity, treatment-related symptoms, symptom severity, treatment related symptoms, and treatment-related symptom severity. The findings of this study were consistent with the hypothesis in our first study that child bipolar disorder treatment-related symptoms was predictive of outcome, with higher scores on the treatment-related symptom scale showing a better treatment response. In the current study, in addition, we found that, compared with children in the ""Treatment of early age panic disorder"" group, children in the ""Treatment of early age bipolar/manic disorder"" group, showed better clinical and diagnostic quality. This finding was also seen in our previous study of the ""Treatment of bipolar disorders in early childhood"" and in the current study. Also, although clinical comorbidity and symptom severity were associated with treatment-related symptom severity and clinical and diagnostic quality, this relationship were not always seen with different groups of children. Our focus in the current study was specifically on the treatment-related symptom severity and clinical-diagnostic quality and that this was possible because we were able to compare the children against a larger and stricter diagnostic index than the one commonly used in the evaluation of this variable. Our findings were more consistent than in other studies, which have looked at other treatment-related parameters such as medication adherence or use of family supports. In all the other studies reviewed, only the most severe cases met the criteria for an assessment of severity and use in"
Question: Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable? Answer:," The main problem, at the moment, is the accuracy. We tested some simple mathematical methods with data from two patients. We show that their equations match our observations and show that the two patients have very similar estimates of basal metabolic rate with the exception of the estimate of F=21.8. This is a very useful estimate, because our patient is lean and at the peak of his or her weight, while most of us are between 20–30 kg overweight. This is the reason why we would expect the difference to be more in the case of patients obese or slightly overweight with less body mass than the overweight or obese without excess mass, as the overweight and obese patients tend to have a more significant underestimation of their BMR by the equations than the lean ones.

Question: What can doctors, nutritionists, and patients take from this study? Answer: The accuracy of the regression equations might well improve over time, because most of the people with these disorders, and most patients with any disorder, use different methods of diagnosis (e.g., skinfold thickness, blood pressure, etc.) or different method of treatment. The general assumption is that the method of treatment and the methods used for the measurement of basal metabolic rate would also change. Also, the methods used for diagnosing and treating hypertension/hypertension and diabetes might not have improved as much as those used for obesity, so we hope our results could be used in these two clinical issues, i.e., obesity and diabetes, and their treatment."
Question: Does rugby headgear prevent concussion? Answer:," There have been many questions about the effectiveness or lack thereof of the use of helmets and head gear during the rugby union games played in this country in recent years. It is the understanding of these questions that the current opinion of the European Rugby Union is that at the moment there is little or no evidence of the effectiveness or harmfulness of these items during rugby union games. This means that at this stage we would continue to use traditional rugby headgear with the possibility that we could be moving to some other kind or type of protective headgear in the near future. I should also add that rugby dossier has received an excellent report from the Rugby Players' Organisation, who is not concerned by any issue of helmet use. It is also worth noting that in the event that a player develops a head injury through contact on an opponent's head, the player is not obliged to wear a helmet. Also a player who takes a tackle will often have the option of immediately seeking care and medical treatment for concussion. There has been an issue of head injuries in rugby but that is an issue that is dealt with on an individual basis. The fact is though, not all rugby players develop head injuries or do not have a history of head injuries whilst playing. As a player develops a history of head injuries and develops into a professional rugby player - at which point in time his history of head injuries will have continued for a considerable period of time - that may not be the case. It is an unfortunate reality that we do not want to be placing more safety ahead of player benefit. As always we take such matters very seriously but we also have to recognise that sport is one of the few activities where there are no right or wrong answers. While this is clearly a matter of concern, it is not something that would need to get in the way of players continuing to play. There has been a good deal of research into the impact that player wearing protective headgear has on player protection. The results have not been good although in terms of number of head injury cases, not many were considered particularly concerning. A recent report from England's Rugby Football Union suggested that there had been three players who had sustained head injuries during play which were not directly related to headgear, but had taken place because of the player's use of protective headgear. A study in Australia has found that three-fourths of head injuries occur during matches and a number of it's players had suffered head injuries before playing. A very relevant result of this study was the finding that when players use protective headgear the likelihood of sustaining a concussion before the match is more similar to playing through a gash rather than a broken neck. The recent Rugby Players' Organisation (RPO) study confirmed that the majority lamenting use of helmets or headgear while playing is for protection against head injury. Many players report being frustrated with the idea of wearing a helmet or headgear while playing. Many others wouldWA Rugby player.

The Rugby Players' Organisation (RPO) was set up by the Union of Australian Rugby (UAR) to raise awareness of the health risks and concerns associated with playing rugby as a way of life. The aim of the RLPA was to raise awareness of the physical demands players will experience at times of play and give players the best possible experience of the game, while at the same time attempting to educate them about the health risks (or lack thereof) of rugby. RPO's research has shown that the overwhelming percentage of players who suffer head injuries at rugby level do not actually have an abnormous amount of head trauma. According to RLPA research, the proportion of players in this category of injury is approximately 1% - however it is also the case that players (especially as they age) are less likely to play rugby when they do suffer a concussion with an average age of 22, with an average of six players per player. RPO identified that there's not a good measure of concussion, and that the incidence of concussion may be affected by factors other than whether someone has had a concussion themselves."
Question: Spinal subdural hematoma: a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm? Answer:," Cadaveric intracranial hematoma is not a distinct condition and usually occurs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is a congenital abnormality in which the spinal cord and adjacent tissues are infiltrated with a white, watery material from the brain, spinal cord and cerebellum. The most commonly encountered forms of hematoma are those involving large masses of white submucosa (spinal ""fluid"") or, less frequently, the white ""chimney"" surrounding the spinal cord. The mass is usually an enlarged mass of spinal fluid, the ""fluid"" being an amniotic sac which usually does not expand during the course of development. If the sac collapses and migrates to the brain, the mass forms a part of a subarachnoid hemorrhage or a subarachnoid hemorrhage with no intracranial intracranial hematoma (known as ""composite hematoma""). The more common findings include an enlarged cavity in the skull or occipital bone leading into the internal jugular cavern (IJ) and a narrow and deep incision, as much above an inferior vena cava as below.

Question: Spinal artery: a puncture on a patient with a traumatic injury? Answer: In a few instances a trauma injury may cause the lateral, inferior, or medial subarachnoid hemorrhage into the spinal cord or cerebellum. The location of these injuries on the spinal cord varies depending on their nature and extent. The most severe lesions result in a separation of the subarachnoid hemorrhage and the superficial compartment in which there is an increased risk of vertebral arterial embolism because the arterial arteries enter the spinal canal and thus the internal jugular cavern. In some cases, the presence of the intraarticular blood supply leads to an increase of infection and therefore a greater need for drainage. In an occasional case, a large injury to the lateral, inferior, or medial subarachnoid hemorrhage causes the puncture of the small vessel and the formation of a separate, larger artery.

Question: Spinal cord: a fracture? Answer: There are a number of potential paths to the spinal cord. In a few cases, patients develop an injury which results in the subclavian artery in a fracture. In these cases, the subarachnoid rupture usually occurs in conjunction with a massive stroke to the head. Other less common pathways include a fracture to the internal carotid artery. The location of injury on the cord varies depending on the nature and extent of the impact. The most severe of these spinal cord injuries, as well as the most common, are those stemming from the compression and trauma of the spinal cord resulting from a fall or dislocation of the neck (known as cervical spinal cord injury). In the less severe cervical spinal cord injuries, the fracture is usually the least severe of any of the pathologies described (e.g., a simple cut to the lower spinal cord).

Question: Spinal cord: an irregular lesion? Answer: An irregular lesion of the spinal cord may form from a number of causes. The most commonly reported is a lesion of the brain stem. These are usually not found on CT scans and may be subtle lesions. The most common cause for the formation of an arterial lesion is from the impact or trauma to the head. The more frequently that this occurs in an individual, the risk of arterial embolism increases.

Question: Spinal cord: an infarction with a large tumor? Answer: An infarction of the spinal cord is a rupture of the lower portion of the spinal cord, and is sometimes observed as a result of severe traumatic injuries to the head. A variety of pathologic patterns are apparent in patients with the appearance of the infarction. There may be a variety of causes for the appearance of this lesion, including injury to the intervertebral discs between the vertebrae; compression of the spinal cord in a compression fracture from a fall of an athlete and ensuing cervical subluxation; and spinal cord compression due to occipital and/or vertebral artery embolism.

Question: Spinal injury: a partial or complete rupture with spinal cord compression? Answer: A partial or complete rupture of the spinal cord may present as either a complete spinal cord injury or as occipital spinal cord injury. A complete spinal cord injury results in complete failure of motor control to the lower extremities. This occurs as a result of the compression of the spinal cord which results from the impact or trauma which causes the lower extremity to be forced backwards or sideways in the normal course of the movement. Occipital spinal cord injuries often cause damage to the spinal column and the posterior border of the brain or the lateral border"
Question: Can shape analysis differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or transient ischemic attack? Answer:," A comparative study of 2 parallel groups of 20 healthy patients, both with stroke, was undertaken. The study group had a normal baseline and was randomly allocated to a control (control-1), non-treatment (2), or treatment plus anticoagulation (3) group on a balanced design (Figure 7). Each subject was examined at baseline for atherosclerotic marker development and plaque size. At end of treatment, the mean stroke volume was 16 cm3 (interquartile range 4 to 30 cm3); the mean plaque volume was 40 cm3 (3 to 90 cm3); the mean stroke frequency was 0.7 (3 to 8 strokes per year) and plaque weight was 10 g (11 to 50 g). The antiplatelet agents were added to the control group (2 in the control group and 3 in the treatment group). At post-surgery 1 year after treatment, the results indicated that the treated group presented no additional atherosclerosis, while the control group had an increase in the mean plaque volume and plaque weight. This was not significant in the treatment group. This was not apparent in the control group. Figure 7: Comparison of the plaque volume (0-30 cm3) and plaque weight in normal and treated healthy subjects. (A) A comparison of 2 parallel groups of 20 normal subjects, both with incident stroke. The treatment group had a normal baseline and was randomly allocated to a control (0), non-treatment (2), or treatment plus anticoagulation (3) group on a balanced design. Each subject was examined at baseline for atherosclerotic marker development and plaque size. At end of treatment, the mean stroke volume was 16 cm3 (interquartile range 4 to 30 cm3); the mean plaque volume was 40 cm3 (3 to 90 cm3); the mean stroke frequency was 0.7 (3 to 8 strokes per year) and plaque weight was 10 g (11 to 50 g). The antiplatelet agents were added to the control group (2 in the control group and 3 in the treatment group). At post-surgery 1 year after treatment, the results indicated that the treated group presented no additional atherosclerotic, while the control group had an increase in the mean plaque volume and plaque weight. This was not significant in the treatment group. This was not apparent in the control group.


Figure 8: Comparison of the free-floating and embedded plaque thicknesses in normal subjects treated with a carotid artery stenosis reducer. The control group had a normal baseline and was randomly allocated to a control in which blood was drawn daily, while the treatment group had blood drawn twice daily. (A) The control group had a normal baseline. The treated group had 0.3 cm4, which was 0,000 vs 0 cm, which was 2.6 cm3 or 10%, respectively. (B) A comparison of the free-floating (0-2 cm) and Schwartz pattern platelet count in normal subjects treated with a carotid artery stenosis reducer. The control group had a normal baseline, while treatment group had 1.5 cm, which was -100 vs 300 or 30%, respectively. (C) A comparison of the free-floating (0-1 cm) and embedded plaque thicknesses in normal subjects treated with a carotid artery stenosis reducer. The control group had a normal baseline, while treatment group had 0.1 cm4, which was (300-10%), which was 1 (3-8%) or 0,000 vs 1 cm, which was 9%, respectively. (D) A comparison of the free-floating (0-2 cm) and embedded plaque thicknesses in normal subjects treated with a carotid artery stenosis reducer. The control group had a normal baseline, whereas the treatment group had 0.5 cm, which was 3 (3-8%) or 0,000 vs 1 cm, which was 5%, respectively. The total number of the treated group was 18 patients, 15 with free-floating stent, 4 with embedded stent, and 1 uninjured with plaque/blood loss of 10 g orSavannah. The control group was 16 patients treated at 1 year. Thus, from the findings of 1 point of view, the treatment group's total plaque area was significantly reduced and the total embedded plaque area significantly improved. Also from the point of view of the carotid stenosis reducer, the removal of approximately 1 cm of stent volume from the carotid arteries led, after 6 weeks, to a marked decrease in the total embedded plaque area, whereas the control group did not change significantly after about 6 weeks.

Question: Dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease: an underrecognised association? Answer:," It is hard to overvalue the work of Robert Sternberg and Robert B. Dershaf for providing a thorough assessment of common genetic and environmental factors in dementia and their relevance to cognitive impairment and neurological diseases. In particular, their analysis provides insight into the relationship between common genetic and environmental factors on the influence of brain diseases and their related diseases.

Answer: The study describes an association of familial risk for Alzheimer's disease and apolipoprotein E4 genotypes with low hippocampal volume. However, the findings are controversial and do not allow to establish causality."
Question: Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India? Answer:," Yes, culture also affects tuberculosis control because it influences drug selection and drug resistance. One reason for that is the culture of the TB patients also influences the decision making process; tuberculosis patients who acquire drug resistance are more likely to survive treatment."
Question: Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible? Answer:," Yes, bipolar tumors may have different histologic subtypes. Different tumor histology is seen after a single imaging session with different volumes, a single focal point and/or different techniques. Diffusion-weighted image imaging provides for the identification of specific tumor subtypes on which to optimize treatment strategies and is often the first imaging modality used in parotid gland tumor treatment. However, it is not possible to predict the presence and extent of any subtype with specific techniques. The majority of published studies on parotid gland tumors have involved noninvasive imaging, thus, there is no diagnostic value associated with this imaging modality. The clinical relevance of the use of diffusion-weighted imaging in parotid gland tumors is limited by the fact that few studies have focused on this specific subtype (12). In the case of parotid gland tumors with focal areas and/or focal focal sites, there is often minimal or no change in the morphology of the parotid gland following a single imaging session (12). For this reason, the interpretation of these studies is limited and cannot be generalizable to parotid gland tumors with diffuse or diffuse lobules. The main purpose of the study described in question [P = 0.08 × 10−4; Fisher z] was to evaluate the predictive value of diffusion-weighted image imaging for patients with parotid gland tumors and to see if any additional information could be acquired about these tumors. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the use of diffusion-weighted image image for the diagnosis of diffuse and/or diffuse lobules in parotid gland tumors. The authors tested the hypothesis that a particular group of parotid gland tumors has a particular pattern of diffused gland anatomy characterized by focal points and/or focal focal sites. The parotid glands and lobules of patients with parotid gland tumors and the surrounding tissues all showed the same pattern of lobular development as well as different histopathological features. The authors were also able to detect new features of the tumor morphology in patients with parotid gland tumors compared to matched patients with lobules; none the patients with parotid gland tumors were classified as having different lobular types. The overall results support an interpretation that parotid gland tumors have differences in lobular organization as well as differences in the types of lobules in patients with parotid gland tumors. Since the specific features found in patients with parotid gland tumors differed markedly from the clinical features found in patients with lobules as well as from patients with other tumors, patients with parotid gland tumors may have a different pathophysiology than the lobules of the lobules. It seems that the interpretation of these differences in lobular morphology and histopathology is not as straightforward as it initially appears. A definitive classification of parotid gland tumors after the first imaging session is likely still to be in the offing. However, there seems to be enough clinical data available in parotid gland tumors to suggest that the diagnosis of parotid gland tumors may be quite simple in this type of tumor. Further studies are needed to clarify these data. This study was partially funded by the American Cancer Society and other foundations. We thank the staff of the Brain Surgery Research Institute of the UCLA Veterans Affairs California Healthcare System for providing valuable advice on MRI interpretation in this subject matter.

Question: Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis? Answer:," Endothelin-1 is very different from most other endogenous compounds with respect to its concentration in solution and its behavior in a physiological tissue, as shown in Fig. 2. This suggests that the physiological properties would not be the main factor determining the response of the cells or tissues to endothelin-1. Endothelin-1 is essential for the proper functioning of the heart and the kidney. The presence of endothelin-1 prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis and is believed to control the activity of endothelial cells. The levels in the blood of these cells are regulated by the presence of endothelin-1. It has a central role in the development of the vascular bed and the maintenance of cardiac rhythm. The activity of endothelial cells is a result of the concentration of endothelin-1 in the blood. The concentrations in the heart are influenced by endothelin-1, but their effect is not the same as in the kidneys. The endothelial cells of the vascular bed are dependent on these concentrations for survival. In the heart, endothelial cells rely not on endothelin-1, but on the activity of the epidermal growth factor epidermal growth factor-1 (EGF-1). It acts in a similar way as endothelin in vivo in the tissues where it is active, since it enhances epithelial cell migration and increases the flow of blood through the vessels. However, the concentration of EGF-1 in the blood of these cells is much lower than in the tissues, and it appears that its role is to increase the flow of blood through the vessels rather than directly regulating the activity of endothelial cells. In fact, in vivo studies of the effect of endothelial-derived epidermal growth factor in the hemodynamics of the heart demonstrate that even a small dose of the EGF-1 that is present in the blood of the experimental animals, increases the velocity of the heart.

Fig. 2: The synthesis, secretion, and distribution of EGF in the blood of a number of experimental organisms with varying concentrations of endothelin in the blood. Theuted Hemodynamics: The function of endothelin and EGF in heart muscle, heart, renal tubules, spleen, kidney, and vascular endothelial cells.

The function of the endogenous steroid hormones is known, to be similar to those in muscle tissue, and also to be dependent on local tissues. The concentrations in the blood of these hormones are controlled by the activity of the endocrine glands. In the brain of rats, for example, the activity of glucocorticoids is regulated by the activity of the adrenal glands, and the concentrations in the blood of these hormones are related to the activity of the adrenal glands and other glandular cells that make corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).

The steroid hormones are taken up by the cells of the central nervous system where they stimulate local neural circuits where the concentration of these hormones in the blood is related to the activity of the central nervous system. Thus, the concentration of corticotropin-releasing hormone in the blood is a correlate of the activity of the central nervous system. Since the activity of the endocrine gland is determined in part by the concentration of the hormone in the blood, corticotropin-releasing hormone affects the activity of the adrenals, since an increase of the concentration of the hormone in circulating blood leads to an increase in that of the adrenals.

Endothelin is a peptide with 20 cysteine Jer-en-us separated into two tripeptides that differ in the lengths of the amino acid residues. The second tripeptide is of two different lengths and forms part of different chains of the structure that are found in the structures of the endoplasmic reticulum.

The enzyme that synthesizes the endothelin protein in the heart is the enzyme that synthesizes the endothelin receptor. Endothelin promotes adhesion of cells to endothelial cells. This is a process dependent upon the concentrations of endothelin in the blood. Endothelin induces membrane synthesis which affects the distribution of cells and tissues. Endothelin is also known to reduce local blood osmotic pressure and increase the local concentrations of calcium. In the heart, endothelin can modulate the activity of cells, because its levels are higher in the circulation of cells than in the blood of the intact cells.

Endothelin-induced changes in intracellular ions

The effect of endothelin on the intracellular ion transport systems of cells is discussed in more detail above. It is interesting to note that most cardiac and vascular endothelial cells contain a receptor for endothelin. In this study we have used endothelin-1 that is a natural compound and also a synthetic compound that contains four tyrosine residues on the amino"
Question: Do risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity? Answer:," Of the 4,927 subjects who completed the study, 2,928 (77.2%) men and 207 (9.5%) women reported having suicidal thoughts at any time during the previous year (average, 9.8 years). Men were significantly more likely than their female counterparts to have had suicidal thoughts at least once a year (95% CI, 10.6-13.1; p <.001; ). By affective disorder polarity, only 16 (3.3%) men reported having suicidal thoughts in the past year and none said they had suicidal thoughts at any time during the past 12 months.

Sixty-seven percent of the men and 73% of the women with an affective disorder polarity also reported a lifetime diagnosis. Men with affective disorder personality disorder, who rated themselves as high in borderline personality disorder, had a lifetime estimate of suicide attempt in 9.4% (95% CI, 8.0-11.8) versus 6.3% (95% CI, 5.1-7.4) for men with a low affective disorder personality disorder (LID). Men with LID were more likely than high affective disorder personality disorder and low affective disorder personalities to have had a lifetime suicide attempt, and women with LID reported a higher lifetime suicide attempt rate (7.1% [95% CI, 5.2-7.7] versus 6.7% [95% CI, 5.1-7.9]) (p =.001). There were no significant gender differences in current suicide attempt rates among the subjects ( ).

Discussion This study examines the influence of affective disorder polarity on the risk for suicide attempts and subsequent attempts through longitudinal analyses. The findings are broadly consistent with previous literature, which has found that males with affective disorder personality disorder, who are more likely to be high in borderline personality disorder, are more likely to report suicide attempts.8,15,17 Furthermore, we found an effect of affective disorder personality disorder (LID) on suicide attempts. In a study of youth at risk for suicide attempts, suicide attempts by male and female adolescents were not associated, as were attempts by adolescent females, but hackers of males were more likely to attempt suicide attempts than hackers of females.23 Male subjects with affective disorder personality disorder, who indicated greater levels of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior scores overall, were more likely than those with LID to report lifetime suicide attempt ( ). Conversely, we found no association between either affective disorder personality disorder or affective disorder polarity and self reported lifetime suicide attempts by adolescent females, or by adolescent males. In contrast, there was no association between affective disorder personality disorder and self reported suicide attempt rates by adolescent males, but we cannot rule out that such a finding is an artifact of the small number of adolescent participants in our study. However, if the association is true, this might be explained by the smaller sample size in our study relative to that of other studies that have examined adolescent risk for suicidal behavior.13 However, the effect"
Question: Multidisciplinary breast cancer clinics. Do they work? Answer:," In recent years, many clinics have gone out of business. A large majority of programs were founded because of the lack of patients, not because of their success. One example is the Comprehensive Radiation Oncology Clinics (CROCs), which are sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). As mentioned, they were not successful in helping many patients; about half of all patients in CROCs had a negative response to radiotherapy.

Question: How come some women are doing well? Answer: To some extent, this is the direct result of improved cancer detection and more advanced therapy. Although some women who have survived with surgery seem to be cured, in general, many men and women continue to experience symptoms up to many years after the event; some die before the disease is effectively treated.

Question: I had ovarian cysts, and I still think I will have an ovarian cyst. When can I have surgery? Answer: Although in theory ovarian cysts are benign, in most cases no operation is required to remove them. If they do continue, a variety of procedures can be used to treat them, including artificial insemination, surgery, and/or a hysterectomy.

Questions: I have had breast cancer for more than 30 years, and I want a hysterectomy that will reduce the spread of the cancer and prevent me from becoming ill again. I have never seen a group of women I know with breast cancer who are also asking for treatment in this manner. Is surgery necessary?

Answer: Unfortunately, this is something most women would like to have done if they could. However, there is no indication that surgery is harmful, and there is no research on why some patients prefer surgery over chemotherapy. However, the following guidelines should be helpful.

First, your decision should be based on the level of risk you are at risk of. If possible, have a mammogram, breast ultrasound, or ultrasound that allows you to compare the appearance between the two parts of your body. Second, if possible, have a lumpectomy before surgery. This removes the lining of your breast. For children under the age of 2, consider the removal of part of the top of the breast and then cauterizing part of the surrounding breast. This process does not remove all of the cancer, but it reduces your risk of it returning. Third, consider the length (time) until your procedure. Depending on your age, if you have lived with the disease a period of time, it might be better to wait some time before proceeding with the surgery, but no more than one year. Fourth, consider your physical condition and how well you can endure the inconvenience of losing your breasts. Fifth, you should be alert to the fact that some women have to undergo procedures to cure breast cancer before it has spread beyond the area of the original tumor. If you have been diagnosed, see your health care provider and have his/her opinion. This will determine how long you might have to wait and whether you should proceed with surgery. In terms of prognosis (number of years after treatment begins to show health benefits), the prognosis depends on: your condition at the time of treatment, the results of previous treatment, how well you can bear it with this change in your health, and your prognosis as a whole.

Question: Will a hysterectomy reduce my chances of developing breast cancer? Answer: The likelihood of developing breast cancer depends on many factors.

First, if you are in your 50s or older, it is too early to say when you should start taking a mammogram. After all, your first mammogram is normally done at age 50 and again at age 65. A breast scan may now be needed, but you do not need to wait until your 50s to do a mammogram, as long as you have a normal mammogram at age 65 and a mammogram at age 50.

Second, if you have already had a mastectomy, the prognosis of a hysterectomy has not yet been determined. Breast cancer may recur after this procedure; therefore, it is wise to proceed according to your wishes and to have a follow-up laparotomy and an examination of your breast in four to six months after the procedure.

Other questions: In my case, I also thought that a surgery to remove my uterus at the same stage would also reduce my chances of developing breast cancer. So I did the surgery at the age of 39 and it was not needed. On my next visit to my health care provider, it was decided that I would get another mammogram and more hysterectomy. Then it is possible that I will have metastatic breast cancer. But for the time being, the doctors did not know when they should start the hysterectomy again. So in this case, I think that removing uterus and breast is a good plan."
Question: Is the international normalised ratio (INR) reliable? Answer:," The INR measures economic activity and the price of a standard country, such as Italy. It is also known as inflation adjusted exchange rate or INR. The INR is calculated for an open economy (i.e. market exchange rate is used) and the currency in issue in that economy. The INR is the amount that an economy can handle (without inflation) over any given period of time. You can see the INR for Italy's economy:

How the INR will react over time

The INR will fluctuate and will be affected by economic factors which is why it remains a volatile and inaccurate measure. The INR will be volatile because of the current low interest rates in Europe and the low inflation in Italy. The INR is also affected by monetary policy and by the current economic downturn. It is hard to speculate where the INR will go in the future, since it depends heavily on monetary policy.

How it is calculated

The price of Italy's currency – the EUR – is calculated by taking the current exchange rate of the EUR and the monetary base, or the amount of money available in the economy (in this case 1 € = 1 € = 1 £). If the currency exchange rate rises, that means more money is available in the economy. If it falls, the amount is less. The INR can be a very accurate or an extremely unreliable measure of economic activity.

What you can use the INR for

The INR is used for making currency exchange offers and other financial transactions. It is also used for purchasing goods, products and services. The EUR, as an example, is used to buy goods in Europe. You can exchange it via a bank or an Exchange agent in many countries.

Other economic measures

One of the more reliable measures is the consumer price index (CPI), which looks at the price of goods (mainly food and clothing) and has a standardised weighting applied to every unit of the product. CPI is calculated for every country. It works against many things - the price of an imported good does not need to be adjusted because the price is generally higher in Europe. You can use the CPI for this:

Who is right?

I have spoken extensively to many economists and they agree. Some have a preference for inflation (rising prices) over stability (low inflation). Others would like to see more stable exchange rates but prefer CPI. If you use CPI and the correct price is listed against, it seems to have the most accuracy compared to the INR. You should read all the statistics on the official INR website.

If you want to know about a similar measure, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), you should read the article in this section: What is a CPI

Other things you might want to know

This article focuses on the INR, but there are economic statistics you might want to familiarise yourself with:

International Trade

In the modern world, international trade is the key driver of economic growth. By far the biggest part of economic activity is done in global trade and its impact in the country is usually felt immediately; even when there is no real relationship between exports and imports, that influence is felt quite immediately in its economic impact on the population and the economy. In Europe, imports (goods and services, mainly) account for around 70% of the economy. This means the bulk of GDP in Europe comes from international trade. The INR is a reliable indicator of the rate of trade, not just of trade growth.

Trade will also directly affect prices in the EU and in other countries that are subject documentary tariffs or import tariffs and that pay a similar level of tariffs on goods.

The impact on the INR

While trade will boost the economy in many countries, the impact is lessened in some countries, particularly in the EU and in the UK. However, you should remember that the INR is used in the rest of the globe, including the USA and the rest of Asia. However, the INR is likely to fall in those countries because of the effects of trade from other trade related issues and to ensure the economic benefits from trade are transferred to the people by more direct channels such as trade.

If you are planning to use the INR, remember that it varies from country to country. While I can suggest an INR value in this post, you need to ensure you use the same value across a wide range of countries in order to get a fair comparison.

As an illustration, the INR value of Japan is around 3,000 (in 2012). The average in France is around 4,000, which is a very nice average for high incomes. In Portugal, it is just over 2,700, which is a much lower number than the average in Japan and far below the average in France. It will depend on other factors, such"
"Question: Are there associations of health status, disease activity and damage in SLE patients? Answer:"," As expected, the age distribution of patients with SLE is similar to the general population, although their prevalence in the elderly is higher. Patients' disease course, duration and severity are similar to patients in the general population. However, SLE (seizure-like states) is a chronic disease with a high survival rate if symptoms are treated by the right therapeutic modality. However, few studies have been presented that discuss the effects of active medication or rehabilitation (physical rehabilitation, cognitive rehabilitation or social rehabilitation). This is surprising given the wide dissemination of SLE in our society; about 30% of the US population has the disease.1,2 This observation in a highly developed society is a potential problem because SLE has a very high level of comorbidity,3 and the elderly are at considerable risk for developing the disease when they are sick.4,5 In other words, it could raise the risk of disability and/or mortality for these patients. SLE is most prevalent in the elderly population; in 2000, there were about 23,000 SLE cases per year and about 14,000 (3%) had died. Most of these seniorsbridge the two main diagnostic categories of SLE - neuropathy and encephalopathy. In fact, of the SLE patients in our study, 2.5% of the patients had encephalopathy, 7.5% had neuropathy, 16.5% had neuropathy and 6% had some combination of all three. The main clinical features of neuropathy, with which most of the patients may share, include fatigue, neuropathy, abnormal physical sensations, and/or abnormal mental status.6 Neuropathy is characterized by loss of sensory and motor function. The clinical course of neuropathy depends considerably on the timing and nature of an injury. There could be different degrees of onset of the disease. In some cases, including encephalopathy, the disease progresses quickly and is preceded by a period of relatively mild symptomatic activity. The clinical course of neuropathy can be chronic or it can be interrupted by a period of recovery or remission of symptoms. In most cases, neuropathy is associated with a progressive loss of function following an injury. In many cases, including encephalopathy, the disease progresses slowly, and the patient may undergo normalization of symptoms around 30 months after the first injury. Patients have no need for additional therapy or for special equipment at the end of the second or third injury.7-10 A wide spectrum of neurological symptoms is possible in SLE (see Figure ). Patients with encephalopathy will typically develop postural dizziness, which is caused by brainstem injury. In an MRI, patients will be presented with deficits in perception of the external visual field, as well as in depth perception. In some cases, symptoms may persist for years afterward. In others, patients will become blind. In a longitudinal study of patients with SLE, 9 out of 30 patients have dementia. Of the 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 2.5% have signs of neurologic change.1 Patients with encephalopathy may still show abnormal reflexes and postural problems, which are usually reversible with rest. In certain patients, a number of neurological symptoms may remain after remission of the disease. Some cases may remain as mild as neuropathy with postural dysfunction, or at milder levels with mild cognitive dysfunction. These symptoms may be observed in the context of the same neuropathological findings that characterize neuropathy.1 It is worth repeating that the diagnosis of SLE is a multidimensional objective. Diagnostic classification by a common neurologic feature, like encephalopathy, is difficult; however, with some effort, patients can be recognized within the same clinical picture without additional diagnostic procedures.11-15 For example, it is possible to recognize that a patient should be diagnosed as having SLE, rather than postural problems, if their pain begins around the knees and continues until the elbow.

Conclusions We report a systematic review of the literature, which included the clinical course, outcomes, and adverse effects of SLE since 1976. SLE is a chronic progressive disease; however, many factors such as age, sex, race, educational level, and socioeconomic status influence the clinical course and severity of SLE. The incidence and mortality of SLE are high. This report also reveals some important patterns in the clinical course and outcome of SLE. The major symptoms of SLE are fatigue, headache and fatigue associated with lower back and neck pain. SLE can begin as a neuropathic disorder or as an encephalopathic disease. The patient usually shows no neurological symptoms until the second or third injury. The most common symptoms are low back pain accompanied with sensory and motor abnormalities. This is followed by postural dizziness, which is often accompanied by cognitive dysfunction, as it reflects the loss of sensory and motor function as a result of the injury. The patient often has the signs of a neuropathic disease that may persist"
Question: PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy? Answer:," I'm very happy to hear that. Thank you very much!

Q. (from a reader): If you're having a serious heartburn, would you consider seeing a specialist because it happens so rarely? Answer: The risk of death from a heartburn episode is high in both the normal range (1%-1.5%) and high levels (greater than or equal to 2%). I would recommend to people with a previous history of cardiac problems, such as heart disease, myocarditis, hypertension or dyslipidemia, that the use of antacids is not allowed, or else ask themselves whether or not they really want a heartburn attack for the next few months without it stopping (they should), that they should consult their GP if they are doing it a lot, and that antibiotics should not be prescribed for heartburn. I guess that's not a very popular view though.

Q. How often should acid reflux medicines be used? Answer: This is a difficult question. There are two conflicting views about the timing of acid reflux. One is that we really can't say as much about the timing of acid reflux medicines as we can about the timing of heartburn. My view seems to be that if you think you mightillary or pain before acid reflux, it is safe to take the medicines at least every 3-4 h. If you think that you might or might not want to use the medicines at that time, then you should discuss it with your doctor. There are other people who are more interested in using them as a result of their own experience with reflux, so it may be more that they will get back to their doctor more and more. Another view is that it is normal for reflux medicines to be in the stomach before they are swallowed and that if needed they should be given directly to the stomach. I do not agree with it. I think it is just too early to know enough about this particular behaviour. Also, if any particular patient uses reflux medicines as a result of their own experience, it will not be reasonable for them to use them on such scales or in the same way as someone who does not do so.

Q. I was given a large platelet count at birth due to my history of bacteremia. I now am suffering from dysphagia. How do I reduce the risk of having blood transfusion? [I'm in remission now, and have a history of no disease since the age of 8]((http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/life/blood-in-need-and-breathing-rescuers-the-hidden-cost-of-a-toll). Answer: I am sorry you are suffering. There is almost certainly a possibility that you will develop dysphagia or anemia in the future, regardless of this fact. If it is normal for you to have a number of red blood cells in total, and it occurs to you that you may not have any white blood cells anymore, that is simply no less of a risk for you than having a low blood count in the first place. If you think it is too early to be concerned, then perhaps you should discuss your choice of treatment with your doctor. You may need to be checked regularly to ensure that the blood count does not increase further since the period before it happened. This may involve monitoring you for periods of weeks or months, or possibly for years.

Q. Do I have to take medicine on waking up all the time when I have heartburn? Answer: I take my acid reflux medicines only as directed by my doctor, not on waking up without the medicines, in my case with acetaminophen. There is no scientific evidence to support it as a way to prevent heartburn on waking up.

Q. I have had a heart attack in the past. Is it dangerous for me shining a flashlight underneath my chest to check? Is there any evidence that light might damage my heart? Answer: If you wish to find out whether your heart has been fretting lately, you may use your finger to feel down on your abdomen. If it feels hard to rub your finger there, then maybe you should not be placing it there. But if it doesn't feel hard to hold, that is a warning sign. If it is easier to touch your chest than anywhere else, then it should probably not fall off while using a light flashlight.

Q. Hi my mom gave me the following when she passed away: ""My dad's a nurse, and he would just come in the middle of the night to check up on me. When he would arrive, I would just grab him, run off upstairs, and go to sleep, and he would wake me up for a good 10 minutes after I finished. After he left, though, I really got sick. When he came in, I wouldn"
Question: Is zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate sustainable? Answer:," For most people receiving routine care, even a zero incidence infection rate is possible.

For most people receiving routine care, even a zero incidence infection rate is possible. (L.A. Times via Associated Press)

In 2011, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that at least 1 in every 1,000 American women of childbearing age gets a sexually transmitted infection annually (STI). In general, a healthy, sexually active woman will not have an infection during her lifetime if her partner's sexual activity is free of STI.

But that may not be the case for most men. At least 25 percent of men receive a STI during their lifetime (1). Because STIs are transmitted by bodily fluids, men who have been drinking untreated water for too long are at increased risk. Many studies have documented a low incidence of STIs among men living in rural areas (e.g., in Indian country, in the western United States, among people who live in impoverished areas, in certain U.S. cities) and among adolescents, who are at a significantly elevated risk for STI transmission (2).

If these low, yet high, rates of infection persist over time for many American men despite effective prevention interventions, it could mean a much more pervasive infection in the United States.

If these low, yet high, rates of infection persist over time for many American men despite effective prevention interventions, it could mean a much more pervasive infection in the United States. (L.A. Times via Associated Press)

Is zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate sustainable?

One possible explanation would be that some infections might continue to occur without being detected. This possibility was addressed in a comprehensive analysis of data at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After controlling for many risk factors for other STIs, the authors concluded that infection (including many of the STIs described in the Centers' earlier analysis) is uncommon during pregnancy in the United States for men who are sexually active without having had unprotected sex that week.

But a study in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine by James R. Anderson, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, and colleagues, did not address this hypothesis directly. The authors studied the medical history and health habits of 9,664 adolescents aged 13 to 18 who had been asked about their sex lives. This study identified 662 men at much higher risk for bloodstream infections, including an 81 percent incidence of syphilis during their pregnancies.

Even among these risk groups, though, infection was not common during their pregnancies (3). One reason for this observation may be that syphilis is extremely rare in the U.S. (4). Another reason might be the relatively low rates of infection among people at these risk groups. That may be because the people reporting their sex histories tend to be older than those of the general population.

""We show that some infections are rare, but not all, or in some cases uncommon,"" says Anderson, a senior fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and author of the article. ""They could be happening very frequently.""

If these low, yet high, rates of infection persist over time for many American men despite effective prevention interventions, it could mean a much more pervasive infection in the United States.

Another potential explanation is that the rates of infection may be too high for certain populations. For instance, Anderson and colleagues found that syphilis infections were higher in participants in rural African-American and Hispanic communities than in populations in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wis.

How big a burden?

The National Institutes of Health estimates that an average person in the United States infects around 0.07 cases of syphilis per year. To put that figure in perspective, among African American men infected at least once during their lifetime, there are approximately 7,500 cases of syphilis per million annual U.S. population, according to the article.

For comparison, the CDC estimates that an average woman in the U.S. will transmit about 1.3 cases of the syphilis bacterium over her lifetime, and, for those with active syphilis, it is about 15 cases per million annual U.S. population.

To put those figures in perspective, according to the CDC, an average person in the U.S. infects around 0.07 cases of syphilis per year. (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases / Science/Getty Images)

Because these low rates are consistent over time, it means that not all men are at risk for these infections. These low rates may be due to differences in socioeconomic status between men who are sexually active, and thus those who are not sexually active. Because syphilis is often left untreated, in turn, it is less common among women (5) and, as in the CDC study, young people (6) are at"
"Question: Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits? Answer:"," Gastric electrical stimulation is generally recognized as a superior treatment option when compared with traditional approaches. Specifically, gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is preferable for improving food satisfaction, quality of life, and comfort in the gastrointestinal system after successful intubation and after percutaneous transluminal delivery because it is more effective in reducing symptoms and is less expensive to perform compared to traditional approaches. This review highlights these benefits by using prospective studies and systematic reviews to examine the effects of GES for improving the symptoms of gastric transit. Additionally, prospective cohort studies were identified for evaluating the effects of GES in patients with other intubation complications.

Introduction

Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is an emerging treatment option that has shown promising results in improving long-term outcomes for patients undergoing gastric intubation.1-11 The major benefits of GES include alleviating the symptoms common in traumatic bowel disease (TBD) and improving gastrointestinal status. However, the potential for adverse events has been an area of study with limited research.12,13 This review will analyze the role GES plays in improving symptoms, GI resources, and long-term health care benefits and explore the methodological pitfalls that may limit use of the technique.

1. Overview of Gastric Electrical Stimulation

Gastric electrical stimulation is a technique that has previously been developed to treat patients with emergency gastric intubation.14 This treatment option can be performed in a hospital setting with the use of mechanical venting, an automated external defibrillator, a patient oriented external defibrillator, and/or a ventilator. The main advantages of GES over the standard approach are that GES is less expensive, more comfortable, and faster to perform.10,15,16

2. GES versus Utilization of Utilized Methods

Both of these new approaches to GES are promising treatment options. The authors of this review have shown that using GES can improve quality of life, food satisfaction, quality of life, and comfort in the gastrointestinal (GI) system with increased performance on multiple quality of life (QOL) measures.3,7,10,17-21 In addition, studies have shown that when compared to conventional therapy, the use of GES with intravenous versus percutaneous transluminal delivery improved the time to intubation, reduced the likelihood of adverse events, and helped patients become more comfortable with GES.14,19 The use of GES may actually be associated with shorter length of stay in a hospital setting compared to the use of traditional, non ignored methods of intubation (eg, continuous positive airway pressure, and oral medications).7 The use of GES may be more effective in reducing overall costs compared with traditional intubation method.6

2.1. The Mechanism GES Provides a Novel Method to Ease Pain in the Gastrocnemius and Gastric Mucosa

Gastric electrical stimulation is a novel technique that is currently being investigated as a therapeutic tool for patients with traumatic colitis.22,23-30 A study conducted in 2012 found that intravenous (IVS) GES could improve GI pain in patients with traumatic IBS.31 A 2012 meta-analysis has shown that IVS GES is superior to traditional methods for gut and rectal intubation as well as IVS intubation in patients undergoing C-LOC and GI surgery.12

The mechanism of IVS GES is not yet known, however one hypothesis is that IVS GES mimics a similar mechanism found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.31,32 However, it is unknown how IVS GES works on the GI tract compared to classical medical approaches. It is known that the GI tract has a number of complex mechanical aspects,27 although not all of these may be relevant to GES.7 One issue is whether gastric electrical stimulation (GES) could help in"
Question: Should pulp chamber pulpotomy be seen as a permanent treatment? Answer:," That depends on the level of anesthesia and the need for further procedures.

Considerations when deciding whether a pulp chamber is necessary. As noted above, a pulpotomy, for example, is a temporary surgical operation performed to treat endometriosis only. A pulp chamber, on the other hand, can be necessary when the patient is suffering from moderate or extreme abdominal pain. If the pain is minimal, a pulpotomy is only ""necessary if it is absolutely necessary for alleviating pain.""

Note: a more specific discussion of the need for and costs of pulp chambers is available in the section, ""Pulpotomy versus Traditional Surgical Procedures,"" above.

Pulpotomy vs. an abdominal endoscopy

It has become popular at some centres today to use a ""pulp"" or ""abdominal endoscopic"" procedure, where a specialized instrument is used to access the uterus. The principle is similar to the type of surgery available at American Pain Foundation (APF) centres: small incisions are made, the patient is sedated, the patient is placed on a table as the abdominal endoscopic probe is inserted, the patient is instructed to relax and lie on his or her side while the probe ""visually"" (without any movements) passes through the bowel and goes into the uterus.

While this approach may be technically feasible, there might be a problem resulting from the sedation. If the instrument penetrates the rectum or rectal opening, then the rectal incisions may be infected – a condition of concern in patients who have been undergoing palliative palliative care.

There is also the problem of contamination: the endoscope could become compromised by the soft tissue in the patient's digestive tract; the rectal passage could become compromised by tissue from an incision or tumor; the endoscope could end up in the eye of a patient; there could be a possibility of the endoscope slipping or breaking while the patient is performing the procedure.

Thus, if a pulpotomy is to be performed, it has to be done under local anaesthetic at the hospital (or elsewhere), and the sedating agent must be applied thoroughly and thoroughly. (If a surgical procedure is being performed under general anaesthetic, the ""pulp"" should only be used in extremely exceptional cases, using caution, to relieve symptoms).

Should the patient not be able to tolerate the sedation – for example, if a patient is being sedated due to a fever that is causing vomiting – then a pulpotomy should be considered as first or even last resort.

As noted above, this was the opinion of the committee in the first committee recommendation to require a pulp chamber. Therefore, if a patient presents with moderate to severe abdominal pain, that person should be considered for a pulp chamber and the use of anaesthesia should be considered only as a last resort.

Patients with no obvious cause for the pain could opt to undergo an endoscopic endoscopic exam, during which some small incisions are made, exposing the abdominal wall to the endoscope.

If the patient is not able to tolerate anaesthesia and the pain is mild, a pulp chamber is required; if the pain is severe but there are no obvious sources of pain or discomfort, that patient may present with rectovaginal anastomosis.

Pulpotomy and general anaesthesia for endoscopies (and/or any other outpatient surgery) should not exceed one hour in total. Some anaesthesia may be provided by local anesthetics. In the case of a pulpotomy, anaesthesia is provided by local anaesthetics only when needed – no anaesthesia is required during palliative care.

One last complication: bowel obstruction.

An abdominal endoscopic procedure is only recommended for patients with clear rectovaginal anastomosis. However, some rectovaginal anastomoses (see section ""Pulpotomy and Anastomosis""), which are not clear rectovaginal, are possible at the time during which the procedure is conducted. So, a pulpotomy may be performed if a rectovaginal anastomosis is present (see section ""Pulpotomy and Rectovaginal Anastomosis"") and there is a known risk of causing rectal obstruction via the colon. This situation is rare, as most rectovaginal anastomoses are completely clear. If rectovaginal anastomosis is suspected and rectal obstruction is present, then surgery should preferably be done without anaesthesia.

In order to safely perform this intervention, a good gastroenterologist should be consulted – specifically a gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, surgeon at the hospital or even a general surgeon-general.

Risks and complications of Palliative Care (see section ""Pulpotomy and Palli"
Question: Does transverse apex coincide with coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? Answer:," No.


Transverse apex is not used to assess anterior tilt. As noted, the lower coronal (corona) levels are more susceptible to longitudinal tilts. Transverse apex, or global levels, may be used when the patient is in their early-maturing teens, when the posterior tilting angle is less apparent, and when they are younger than age 25 years.


In the anteriorly bent position, the coronal apex is higher than the coronal (corona, or lower) level. As the coronal (corona, or lower) level increases, the transverse apex is lower. Transverse apex in the posteriorly bent position generally reflects the lower coronal (corona, or lower) level more than coronal (coronal) apex in the anteriorly bent position.


Accordingly, the transverse apex level in this situation, as in transverse apex, should always be calculated from the posterior coronal (corona) level of the patient. This calculation should be repeated when the transverse apex level is high because, from the coronal (corona) levels, the transverse apex level should be determined to determine the anterior tilt angle.


Answer: Transverse apex is not appropriate in the adolescent and adult adolescent idiopathic scoliosis because the coronal (corona, or lower) level HERE is actually more prone to longitudinal tilting, as noted in the preceding paragraph. This is because the patient's upper body is still in the anteriorly bent position. The result is that transverse apex values are used in lieu of coronal (corona, or lower) levelsiq.


The transverse apex level can sometimes be seen by looking at the coronal (corona, or lower) level and looking for the intersection of the coronal (corona, or lower) and transverse apex levels (in the anteriorly bent position). The transverse apex level will have a point where the transverse apex intersects with the coronal (corona, or lower) levels (i.e., the intersection point for transverse coronal apex level). This intersection point is only made up when considering the transverse coronal (corona, or lower) level. The exact intersection point for coronal (corona, or lower) levels is rarely found using transverse apex.

Question: Does transverse or transverse apex coincide with a certain curveline in adolescent or adult scoliosis? To what degree is transverse or transverse apex greater than or equal to the curveline? Answer: No.


The transverse or transverse apex levels are not relevant in the adolescent, adult, or sub-acute phase of scoliosis. Instead, the angles between the transverse (corona, or lower) and transverse apex levels should ideally be calculated from the coronal (corona, or lower) levels, as illustrated above. Also, the transverse apex levels should be calculated from a reference curve as depicted in figure 3.


Figure 3:

 Summary of angles from the coronal (corona, or lower) levels to a reference curve in the posteriorly bent position (posterior scoliosis). Corresponding coronal (corona, or lower) levels are to the right of the curveline.


The final coronal (corona, or lower) level, shown in figure 4, is the intersection line for transverse coronal (corona, or lower) levels as seen in the anteriorly bent position. This intersection point has been rounded to correspond with the reference curve for the transverse coronal (corona, or lower) levels. The intersection point for transverse coronal (corona, or lower) levels here is greater than or equal to the curveline, which is drawn with a straight line drawn between the transverse (corona, or lower) and coronal (corona, or lower) levels. The curveline thus will be the intersection point when considering the transverse coronal (corona, or lower) levels at the posteriorly bent position.


Question: How is transverse apex calculated in the adolescent and adult adolescent scoliosis?

Question: Are we seeing the effects of public awareness campaigns? Answer:," Yes, some students see the positive impact of campus activism. They have realized that there are problems with racism in this country and they want to do something about it. But, we also see public awareness campaigns that can be educational as wellourmet of our students' lives and how they conduct themselves. It is hard to tell who is doing the advocacy and who is actually using the schools to educate.

Q: Is there a difference because of how you view the different groups? Answer: Not really. It all goes together. There is a divide and there is a correlation. Most of them are doing some thing. If they are really concerned about racial discrimination and what is going on in this city and this country they would organize something. If they are not concerned with racial discrimination they might not.

Question: Is breast cancer prognosis inherited? Answer:," No.

Breast cancer is the most common cancers for women in the world, with an estimated 300,000 cases diagnosed in 2010. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 1 in 10,000 as opposed to 1 in 30,000 for other types of cancer.

What Are the Symptoms of Breast Cancer?

The signs and symptoms of breast cancer symptoms usually include:

Shortness of breath

Tingling between the breasts

Nasal secretions

Vomiting

When to see a Doctor

Causes of Breast Cancer

One of the reasons a person starts breast cancer is due to inherited traits that are passed to her from one or both parents. The mother usually passes the disease on to the baby while she was pregnant. Breast cancer occurs most commonly in women who have their breasts surgically removed (removed by a surgeon in an operation called mastectomy) or after a mastectomy in women under 40 years of age, and in girls between ages 7 and 10 years old.

When Are Breast Cancer Symptoms Less Common?

In children, breast cancer symptoms usually begin during or shortly after puberty when the child is 6 years, 7 years, and 8 years old. Some children experience more aggressive cancers if they have more breast tissue and/or more lymph nodes in their chest. Signs and symptoms associated with older women include:

Facial hair loss or thinning

Belly fat

Skin atrophy: wrinkling and scarring of your body

Poor blood circulation

Low estrogen levels in the mother's blood

Low levels or no menstrual periods

Other signs and symptoms include:

Fever or chills

Mental illness or difficulty with concentration

Nervousness or nervousness

A sudden increase in urination

Irritability

Loss of bone/dentation and increased risk of broken bones and fractures

Injection site reactions or pain

Stem cell abnormalities

In some cases, breast cancer is caused by the use of certain medicines on a frequent basis. For example, taking the prescription medicine Coumadin, for example, to treat high blood pressure, breast cancer, or certain types of cancer could lead to breast cancer. Also, certain birth control methods that contain estrogen and progestin are associated with breast cancer.

Treatment Optionsromannize

There are several treatments that can help reduce your chances of developing breast cancer. These include:"
Question: Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy? Answer:," While there is no evidence to the contrary, there is no evidence to the contrary. Nuchal translucency thickness increased during gestation from 10 mm (in preterm infants, as the authors noted) and 6 to 16 mm following gestational age at delivery, and then declined as pregnancy progressed. No data were reported to the extent of possible effects of gestational age. The authors concluded that they did not have enough data at the pregnancy stage to determine causality in terms of why this weight loss occurred. Therefore, the authors of that study cited by the authors of this review stated that they did not have evidence that was sufficient to support a recommendation that Nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester was a risk factor for GD.


Pregnancy-related weight gain should be minimized, and appropriate adjustment should be made by pregnant women to gain enough weight during pregnancy, particularly during the first half of pregnancy, and in the first half of infancy. This is critical because as the years grow older, weanlings may become weight-bearing and more difficult to handle. However, it is important to note that weanedling weight gain is more than 10 kg during pregnancy, so weaning infants from milk-based formula may have to be made a priority.

Caffeine:

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has concluded that caffeine is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an adjuvant agent of a carcinogenic hazard.


The current FDA's position that caffeine is a safe additive to food is not supported by the results of the extensive research on caffeine in the human body and its potential health effects, which have been reviewed and are being updated for a scientific review by the FDA. The FDA has stated that the amount of caffeine added to food is not sufficient to cause cancer in humans. Therefore, any risks of cancer are not expected.


The FDA's position has been supported by an extensive number of epidemiological and other studies including published scientific reviews by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, and the Institute of Medicine.


Caffeine has been found to increase the intake of energy, the brain, and many other nutrients and may alter the natural rhythms of the central nervous system. There are multiple reports of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden death associated with the consumption of high doses of caffeine, and the medical communities worldwide are actively debating the health and safety ofSTATE-Caffeine


The effects of acute ingestion of caffeine in humans have been very brief. Based on the scientific knowledge of the effects of caffeine the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) have concluded that acute ingestion of up to 300 mg of caffeine in one hour is unlikely to be harmful and that prolonged consumption"
Question: Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype? Answer:," Yes. Both microsatellites are expressed at high levels in the male fetal brain. However, the microsatellite expression pattern appears to correlate primarily with the level of prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder in boys versus girls. These results suggest that hypersexuality may begin about 6 months after birth. In contrast, a similar hypersexual phenotype can be observed in young boys with a prepubertal and adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype. It may be possible that hypersexuality develops at different times in boys due to differences in timing of pubertal developmental peaks. This hypothesis might be tested by conducting an in situ hybridization of a microsatellite and the neuro-genetic gene cluster, microsatellite loci within the female brain. This will be an important future project. Answer: Yes, both the male and female microsatellites are expressed at high levels (75 and 35%, respectively) in the male fetal brain, suggesting hypersexuality in the male fetus. However, the microsatellite expression pattern appears to correlate primarily with the level of prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder in boys versus girls [26] and was shown to correlate particularly well with the level of hypersexuality when they were administered to adolescent males with a prepubertal and adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype. Finally, a similar hypersexual phenotype can be observed in young boys with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype [27].

Q: If hypersexuality is related to testosterone levels, what effect does this have on brain and behaviour? Answer: Hypersexual behavior, hypersexuality-associated changes in behavior and behavior-related neurocircuitry are associated with testosterone production and testosterone-mediated brain alterations in animals. The hypersexual characteristics associated with testosterone and testosterone actions in the brain of male rats are linked to deficits in sexual selection and mating behavior, with increased sex arousal and sexually dimorphic brain structures. Also, the hypersexual-predominant phenotype that is induced has been associated with decreased spatial learning and memory functions. Hypersexual behavior is also associated with behavioral hypersexuality [5 – 9] and hypersexuality-associated changes in cognitive functions such as visual learning, attention, planning, and decision making [10]. The hypersexual characteristics associated with both testosterone and testosterone actions in the human brain are linked with sexual dysfunction associated with sexual arousal, aggressive behaviour, and antisocial behaviour. These and other findings are summarized in Table 1 ( ). The changes associated with hypersexuality in the brains and behaviour of adult male and female animals can be studied by different studies including those of a genetic and magnetic resonance imaging studies [1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 14, 15, 16, 27, 28, 33–37], magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies [28, 39–42], studies in humans [1, 16, 28, 63, 74, 78, 84], animals [29, 58, 65–67], and a wide range of endocrine studies [2, 9, 11, 18, 28, 33–35, 38, 54, 75–76]. Table 1. Male sexual orientation: effects on brain and behavior The brain of adult men and women can exhibit a wide range of neuroanatomical differences. Although the brain of adult humans also contains extensive evidence for sexual differentiation of the brain [15], human sex differences in brain structure and function have also been extensively studied in the animal population. Table 2 summarizes sex differences in brain morphology, function, and sexual dimorphism (sexual and masculine vs. feminine behaviours in males and females). Table 2. Major and minor sex differences in brain structure and function in adult men

Q: What is the impact of testosterone on human mating behaviour? Answer: Testosterone is an important neuropharmacological target and has been implicated in all aspects of human mating behaviour. Testosterone action in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is central in human mate choice. In several studies the expression of the vasopressin-like receptor for males (VLPR), a gene expressed in the anterior cingulate cortex of adult men, predicted male partner choice, as was the expression of the receptor in female rat partners lifted after injection with the hormone [7, 9, 13]. In the same studies, testosterone was also linked with sexual preference for female partners slim-built and taller [23]. Testosterone has been strongly linked in animal models to various aspects of male sexual orientation, including increased sexual interest and promiscuity, male sexual compulsivity, male competitiveness, erectile dysfunction or decreased libido [25, 27 WHO, 2000], female preference for larger, more dominant males [27], aggression toward conspecifics,igorance and aggression toward their own species [29] and also aggression toward others in socially complex situations [30, 31].

Question: Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma: really an early stage? Answer:," Not really…

Cancer Research UK's official website (1):

About stage III lung cancer

The median survival time for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is approximately two years (95% confidence interval [CI] – 4.1 to 6.8). The median survival for stage I NSCLC is four years (95% CI – 2.6 to 7.04) and stage II NSCLC is 5 years (95% CI – 2.1 to 7.28).

When to see a doctor:

More men than women have cancer at some stage, especially if they've been smoking for a long time or have been told about the disease previously.

More women than men have lung cancer. But, even though women make up more than half the UK patient population, they have an older average age of first symptom that may lead to more illnesses at an early stage.

Lung cancer is more common in older women than men, and the risk increases with more advanced stage of disease.

Symptoms:

In more than 90% of patients with early stage of lung cancer, symptoms tend to occur at the same time day and night.

Treatments:

You will usually get chemotherapy with radiotherapy or surgery. However, treatment can stop early stage lung cancer from coming back.

Smoking cessation and the use of other drugs to delay or stop signs and symptoms has been shown to delay the progression of lung cancer.

More women than men use lung function tests to determine lung function. So, even though lung disease may involve only one organ, this test may be a good way to identify patients who may require further testing once they have developed the disease further.

It is a good idea to seek advice from your physician, as there's no 'one-size fits all' response to this disease.

Lung cancer in other cancers

What about other types of cancer where there is no stage I or'small' lung cancer?

Some other forms of cancer in the body show a similar progression. Laryngeal squamous cell cancer (cancers of the lipolar membrane that surround the lungs) are in many cases found without any prior symptoms of small cells, or even very small lung cancer.

How do I know if I'm not an early stage?

Most cases of lung cancer are not an early stage when they start to appear. The diagnosis may be missed in the early stages of several different cancer types including many that have no stage.

What about cancer of other organs?

Early stage breast cancer in men and men with prostate cancer

Prostate cancer has three stages and three different cancer types: diffuse (non-differentiated) prostate cancer, locally advanced (differentiated) prostate cancer and distant metastases (small lymph node tumors).

Men and women have more than one stage or different stages of these cancers. So, if your doctor is unsure, you may see at least one specialist in your area. You may also call 1-888-724-4928 to find a specialist in your country.

Question: Does Residency Selection Criteria Predict Performance in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency? Answer:," Consistency is one key criterion that leads a surgeon to choose to choose residency in an orthopaedic surgery specialty. On the other hand, there are 2 major factors that may lead students to choose different specialty from a variety of other specialty programs. The first factor is the overall physician satisfaction index (PSI) score of the program. The second factor is, at least for orthopaedic surgery residencies, the relative cost of residency, such that orthopaedic surgeons, on average, pay slightly more than all patients, and the student will come closer to achieving the ""target practice income"" than patients. One survey indicates that the PPSI scores will likely be relatively lower for orthopaedic surgery residency in general, and orthopaedic surgery residencies in particular than they will be in other specialties. In the survey the PPSI scores were as follows: orthopaedic Surgery: 6.6 (4th place) $200,000 Orthopaedic Surgery Residency: 8.3active; $200,000 All patients, 2nd place $200,000 All patients, 3rd place $200,000 All patients, 4th place $200,000 All patients, 5th place $200,000 All patients, N/A $250,000 Medical Specialty/Subspecialty Residency: 10.6 active; $100,000 All residents $250,000 All Residents 2nd place $100,000 All Residents 3rd place $100,000 All Residents 4th place $100,000 All residents 5th place $100,000 All Residents 6th place $1000 per resident $500,000 All Residents 7th place $250 per resident $250,000 All Residents 8th place $125 per resident $100,000 All residents 9th place $75 per resident $75,000 All residents 10th place $40 per resident $60,000 Residency Outcomes Research on the outcomes of orthopaedic surgery residencies in general by patients, medical specialty, and residency program are inconclusive, although some studies show consistent negative outcomes for patients in orthopaedic surgery residencies, such as poor function associated with the loss of joint range of motion, pain, stiffness, muscle atrophy and fibrosis, and increased incidence of low back pain and soft-tissue injury. Residency Programs, as a result of these factors, may be expected to have worse outcomes than orthopaedic surgery students. The most robust evidence shows that the results of patients' and medical specialty residents' reports of outcome during their training are very predictive of successful orthopaedic surgery residencies. The most robust evidence shows that residency in orthopaedic surgery generally has better results, except for the patient's satisfaction index score, after treatment; surgical outcomes will usually be improved, especially if patients feel they have received the best possible care. The patient satisfaction index scores of the orthopaedic surgery program usually be lower than that of orthopaedic surgery students. (See the Appendix for more information). Students at the University of Pennsylvania are selected as orthopaedic surgery residents. After a residency program, the student is assessed for a wide variety of factors related to their performance. The student is also assessed a second time during his or her post-residency year. This assessment, when conducted by both sides, provides additional information on patient outcomes (see Box 2)."
Question: Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at advanced ages? Answer:," The answer to this question depends upon people's beliefs about the nature of happiness and fearlessness. For people who do not expect death at any age, the best way to have a better quality of life is to cultivate positive thoughts about life and the future. Although this may be difficult at first to achieve, many people will continue the practice of positive thinking to the end of their life, eventually creating a pattern that allows the brain to process positive emotions without fear. This will often result in enhanced self-control and decreased fear.

How do you keep positive thinking during the times of danger. What strategies or medications can you take for keeping positive thinking active in times of danger? Answer: The key to being positive during times of danger is to not think too much about life on the way out of danger. Instead of worrying about things that may or may not happen when the danger is over, you should consider making positive promises to have an easier life when you go out. The more you can practice this, the smoother it will be for you to face whatever obstacles you may be left in when you are no longer able to face fear and live life to its full potential. If you are anxious about getting in the back seat of the car next week, or if you worry whether there will be adequate food and water for you before you drive away, keep a positive outlook to avoid feeling the same way you might in an urgent situation.

I do have a question about depression and pessimism. Are there any remedies or preventatives that should be tried when a person is depressed? Answer: There is a plethora of tools and medications that can lower the risk of serious and long-lasting depression, depression in general, and mental illness in particular. The key is to practice positive thinking when you experience depression, and to learn how to identify and control the thoughts that contribute to the experience.

How do you feel when you look at a calendar and see that you cannot go anywhere this year? When you feel that you cannot find the strength to be successful, do you feel optimistic that you can get some positive energy and hope for the future? When you feel that no matter how hard you try, it must never go well, do you want to be pessimistic? What can you do? Answer: The time in which you look at a calendar is an important part of your daily life. The act of counting the days when you see more than one day in which nothing happens can often give us some false sense of security. When we think nothing is happening then we make a decision to relax or continue to take action that takes the feeling of being secure further away. On the other hand, when you see nothing but bad and painful things happening then you can take the time and let your negative feelings flow out. This can be very helpful in the case of mental illness. By realizing that you can get by on a day-to-day basis, you can be proactive and take action.

I have a question about being optimistic. Can you explain how the positive thinking pattern can help us in the case of depression. Answer: Being optimistic can be a good thing. We feel positive about how much we have accomplished in this life, so we expect to achieve more and become even more successful. It can also be a healthy thing to think about one's progress over a period of time. It can be fun to look back on this life we have lived and be able to talk about one's life today with another person. This kind of conversation can be very enlightening, which may be a good factor for many people who become depressed.

How do you stay positive when you cannot accomplish many things? How will you make your life better through your continued positive activities if they fail in some way? Answer: The best way to do this is to realize that life is full of opportunities. One can succeed in all areas of life when he or she is willing to take action. In other words, taking actions can improve one's level of life. Some people may find success right away when they start to do things right away, but the more they take the steps forward the better they will become.

I have been in school, but there are so many other people there just as good as me that I know would also like to go into work. What methods do you use so that you do not have developer depression too? Answer: We must remember that we also have a role to play. We also can have the positive role when we have the strength and character necessary to carry the mission to a success. You can use the techniques outlined in our discussion on developing positive thinking to help you carry that mission. For example, consider what you would do if you were sent up by another student.

Question: Is it better to be big? Answer:," Absolutely! Having big calves gives you the look of being well and truly ""grown."" For women big calves are an indicator of being happy. I will have to wait for more research to determine the ""best"" size for women. Most men who've had success with big calves have had success using either the standard size of a female calf or using the larger of two smaller calves.

Question: Am I bigger then everyone else? Answer: Many women with big calves say that they are and there's no question in my mind that I am. However, to measure you, you need to measure yourself. I'd say that my calf looks slightly bigger, but if you want to measure yourself, it would better be to measure yourself in the same size. It may require several visits or a new calf to actually find the correct size.

Question: Which calves are best for me? Answer: The top three I'd recommend for women with a size two or a size three calf is:

If you don't get a leg curve, you want to buy a size two.

If you don't get a neck curve, you want to buy a size three.

If your calves are really tight, go with a size five calf.

What About the Male Calf Cuts? Can I be a smaller calf?

Answer: Your male calves are your own and are not made up of a bunch of parts. They are made up of muscle tissue, tendons, and ligaments which can often be changed. There are some guys that tend to have shorter muscles when looking at a bigger male calf, they will be able to get their knees up and out of the way so they can get to other things and not get too much belly. I think that this is why men tend to have larger calves than women. We can't force our guys to grow. But there are some women that may want to start in on some small calf reductions. The difference in measurements, of course, will depend on a lot of factors ranging from body shape, body fat content, diet, and of course whether or not you want to change your muscle tone.

Question: What is the ideal calf? Answer: This is a good question and is somewhat similar, in some ways to why I decided I was going to make calf reductions. When you reduce the circumference of your thigh from size four to size four plus your calf measurements, you can make the calf look a bit slimmer along the inside so you don't have as much belly in the front of the calf.

Question: How can I change my calf circumference? Answer: I've heard people say that they can increase their calf circumference by simply measuring around their lower back. That may work some people as long as they don't get as much belly or if the fat is at the point where your rib cage meets your spine. One way of having it easier if you're still worried about belly is to try and go a size down. If your calves are more than an inch bigger or if you have a leg curve, or you're very thin, you may want to consider an increase in your calf circumference at the waist. I'm guessing that most women will want to go the smaller of two sizes, with the two- to three-inch difference between your waist and hip-to-calf measurement. I personally wouldn't advise going for a smaller calf than size four, but again that's me, not a medical professional.

Question: Can I go smaller in the calf? Answer: The best size for men is size four plus the smaller calf measurement to be in the same proportion with the larger calf measurement. However, some companies put a 10 or 12 pound difference in calf circumference between a regular size three and a regular size four. There is some debate among my students as to whether you should or should not go for a small- to medium-sized increase in calf circumference or not because they say it makes you look ""gaunt"" and ""bigger."" But I'll tell you, there are a lot of people who get big at the top and then lose all that fat as they go down and then have their calves show. A lot of people who are getting their calves reduced also have the fat and muscle and tend to have the biggest calves overall. The calf gets bigger as it ages, so I think it's a good idea to keep that muscle mass. There's nothing worse than your legs becoming a big fat ball on your back after an intense workout.

Question: How about a lower back increase? Answer: Some people say that you need to grow your lower back to make your calf bigger and others say that you don't. One thing that may help increase your lower back is a regular strengthening program. I think that all of us who want to have our calves bigger, would benefit from regular strength and conditioning work. It's always a good idea to have your calves in good condition because that"
Question: Is arch form influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy? Answer:," No, it is based on a normal lateral position of the teeth. The sagittal and lateral molar position of the teeth does not determine lateral form. (Click on photo to enlarge.)

Answer: The position of the teeth as well as the size of the molars and the position of the skull do not determine medial form. It is not true that the teeth are not connected by a nerve, but this is impossible to establish by measurement. This is an anatomical assumption, not an observation, and one cannot infer a mental state by these two facts alone. The difference of the size of the lateral molars does not affect the lateral position of the teeth. But the presence of a certain number of teeth in all the lateral teeth does affect the position of the teeth (and the fact that the lateral position of the mouths and jaws do not determine the presence of the lateral teeth).

Question: Is arch form determined by the skull curvature or cranial base curvature? Answer: No, it is determined mainly by the amount of lateral teeth or more precisely the difference between the weight of the lateral teeth and that of the front teeth; the difference of the base curvature and the length of the skull.

Question: This picture illustrates a man with low lateral teeth, which is probably due to a dental stress condition. Is this a typical case? Answer: It is not the fact of having much lateral teeth and a thin skull, it is an important factor. A high lateral tooth volume cannot cause the same amount of lateral form. The amount of lateral teeth, even those of medium volumes is dependent on these factors. If some of the lateral teeth are relatively large, some of the weight of the front teeth and of the back teeth may contribute to the lateral form. A high amount of weight and a low lateral form indicate that this problem is an important one, and you will probably find the answer in ""Anatomy"" and ""Psychology"".

Question: Is arch form determined by the lateral position of the face? Answer: Yes, the medial position of the teeth reflects the lateral position of the jaw and is thus affected by it. If the medial position of the teeth is reduced, the lateral position of the jaws is decreased even more. If it is also increased, then the shape of the face will be affected. The two factors can responding also to weight. The size of the molars and the position of the jaws determine this issue.

Question: Are there any dental problems in the midline area between the anterior and posterior teeth? Answer: No, arch form does not depend on such a small segment of the body. This is in fact the only area where teeth are separated by only a small segment of this body. This is also probably the only area in which the shape of the face differs directly from its normal appearance.

Question: Is a person who has less arch form a good looking person or just a bad looking person? Answer: People with bad arch form do not deserve a positive evaluation, because they are really normal. If they are found in a photograph without arch form, they are considered as a good looking person without arch form. But arch form may not matter so much in the image of the person in question. Such a person can be evaluated using a variety of criteria. Arch form may not be relevant, but a good shape of the face is. These criteria are: color, nose, mouth, symmetry of the face, and an average weight. If the face is too big or looks like a bad face, then other indications can be useful: height, weight alone, and the shape of the jaw.

Question: Is it true that it is possible to have too much arch form? Answer: No, the amount of arch of lips does not affect the shape of face. On the contrary, the level of weight of the upper upper lip is a more important factor. This may be the reason why some men with low amount of arch form are judged as attractive women.
 Flattening of the face is also a common thing that happens in the course of life, because the face is not always flexible as well as the ears. There are things that look good that is not possible since the position of most organs (head, nose, and ears) are too far away from the eye. And since the face, especially the upper body, is a joint of the ribs, it is too short of the body. It is not possible to flatten the face too much, although this is only a possible solution for men who have a relatively weak jaw muscle. On the contrary, it can be possible to develop the jaw due to extreme weight in the upper jaw, and this may lead to an extreme flattening of the face.

Question: It is not easy to do so much lifting for the larynx and esoph Communities. Answer: Yes, but this type of lifting may also"
Question: Cold knife conization vs. LEEP. Are they the same procedure? Answer:," LEEP is a very good non-interventional technique to do endoscopic glans reconstruction, whereas cold knife conization is not so good!

(I wish we could have a video about the difference between LEEP and cold knife!)

What happened?

In the past, both LEEP and cold knife surgery were recommended without question - even before the current literature research on this surgery emerged. Unfortunately, there's no solid evidence to back up this approach.

The main problem is that it's difficult to interpret LEEP results from a single procedure, given the complexity of the condition. Furthermore, you might already have a pretty good idea of the end points of your glans reconstruction.

Fortunately, we're able to use LEEP to assess the current success of a project from a few points of view, including:

Clinical outcome of the procedure

The degree to which reconstruction was successful

The quality of the patient's follow up

How well the reconstruction is performing when it is not undergoing an active healing process

You can get a good understanding of your reconstruction from these five different points of view. And you should.

So should we even try LEEP?

In addition to a good case for LEEP, this approach has a very good repute - especially as a means to repair a missing flap at the end of an existing flap:

There are over 600 publications on the success of LEEP-FCT. And if you use LEEP, you're going to want to have multiple replications of your reconstruction, at best, or to conduct a significant number of studies.

Cold Knife for the Propecia / Anti-HIV Drug

When the FDA approved Propecia for Viagra in 2012, many of us thought they had finally solved the problem of a lack of viable alternatives to the FDA-approved steroid, so to speak.

We'd have to wait a while, though, before FDA would approve cold knife conization for the same situation.


What about the FDA approval process?

FDA approval may be easy, but the approval process is challenging to understand because the process has not really evolved much since 1999.

In 1999, the FDA was very clear that the procedure could only be completed with the use of an external tool (a cautery.) In 2016, they decided the use of an external tool was not necessary because the procedure is ""non-invasive."" They did state that ""non-invasive"" is a loose term.

FDA approval is required in four parts: (1) scientific review and evaluation, (2) scientific proof, (3) FDA registration, and (4) public outreach and education.

Let's take a look at each component one by one.

Scientific Review

There is still a good and substantial body of work on this process. Most of it has been done by the same groups in Germany. This is where we started off with our research.

We have already published papers describing all of the parts of the medical research process - the study design, the review and evaluation of the studies, the analysis and validation of the data, as well as the FDA filing process and the results.

We can describe the current process of research as a lot of small workarounds:

In 2001, Germany had the responsibility for clinical trials on new and existing drugs. It has a high rate of approval for the newer drugs - and they have no interest in funding anything just to have a procedure that's approved by the FDA.

In 2002, Germany had the responsibility to ensure efficacy and quality of trial data, before the use of new drugs, and they still follow that process to this day.


Public outreach and education

There is still a good and substantial body of research and scientific review on this process. Most of it was done by the same groupsubesch for the FDA approvals. This is where we started off with our research. We wrote about the approval process in our paper, ""Prophylactic and Conventional Implantation of the Intrathoracically Reattached Prostate Gland"".

Most importantly, we took a look at what to post on Internet forums, on Reddit and other social web sites.

First we analyzed the use of these forums, which are often a great place for learning about new drugs and procedures.

We also conducted interviews with doctors, on Reddit, and in doctors' offices, to get their view on the procedure.

But even if you are not involved in the FDA approval process, you need to have a pretty good idea of the end point of your reconstructive procedure that leads to the approval by FDA.

Since there are always new drug and procedure approvals in the pipeline, there may be more things for us to do here, particularly"
Question: Are pectins involved in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed rape plants? Answer:," Yes! Pectins are essential fats that are present in all plant oils and contribute to oils' antioxidant abilities. Pectin is highly soluble in water and thus is incorporated into the soil as plant food at an early stage of growth. Pectin is also important in protecting oils, which are very sensitive to a number of different factors, from degrading. Pectin-rich soils can trap high-yield, high-moisture plants from evaporation and dry land degradation, and the pectic acids, the sugars they contain, will protect the oils from further degradation. We have a page for tips that will enable you to better understand ""Pectin"" and ""Pectins"". As you read the tips, take it in context of what you are used to knowing about pectin, and the fact that plants need oil-soluble nutrients not other types of nutrients. If you do not know the difference among a number of common types of oils and nutrients, there are other pages that can help you understand what you think you know. If needed, we have several other pages with more specific information from experienced growers on specific types of oils.

Some people are also concerned about some contaminants of oilseed rape seed oil, such as heavy metals, toxic heavy metals, radioactive materials, carcinogens and pesticides. To the best of our knowledge, these are not present in oilseed rape when harvested. Pesticides are a concern for many growers because pesticides tend to contaminate or injure the crop. While it is possible for oilseed rape to be pollinated by chemical inputs, they have only been studied for a subset of growers. We believe that the benefits of using oilseed rape and other oils are far beyond the pesticides. One study even found that oil seed rape is ""significantly more resilient to insects and pests"" while having ""an overall lower toxicity.

Question: Is it possible to grow food plants in the winter of summer temperatures at low light levels? Do you grow in pots? Answer: Yes, it is possible for oil-seed rape and other perennial vegetables to grow as well as they need to survive. All food plants, including perennial vegetables like oilseed rape, can be grown within the limits of the light and light cycle.

Question: Is my soil contaminated with soil minerals? How are they getting into the oil seed rape? Answer: Oil seed rape seeds are very good for their low water content, being mostly soluble in water, and that soil moisture has little impact on plant survival. All soils contain soil minerals. In most climates, oils and roots get their nutrients from the soil, but the nutrients can be obtained through mineral soil amendments or other sources.

Note: Some people think oilseed rape seeds are too heavy and update the information about its weight by including some reference information. This is not true for all other oils, and not true for most food crops. When using this information, see ""Nutrition Facts"" page below.

Please click here to view my ""Nutrition Facts"" page, which includes specific information about oils and how they are different from other foods.

Question: Do oilseed rapes ever develop thorns? Answer: Oil seed rape and other perennial vegetables do not develop thorns.

Questions: Where will I find more information on oilseed rape, including my favorite herb for growing and for cooking? Answer: Our most extensive resource for all things related to oilseed rape can be found at this website: Please take a while to read the entire site. The information provided is based on our experience from years of growing and cooking with oilseed rape, and from personal experience with the oilseed rape>>>>> as well as research that we have been conducting. Here are a few of the important information pages on our site, which will make the information more readily accessible to you:

Question: I've been told to use a ""tobacco seed-like"" seed for my oilseed rape seedlings? Should I do that? Answer: Many of us are very familiar with how ""tobacco seed"" seeds are created (even those who do not grow this type of seed!). That is what we recommend when we sow oil seed rape"
Question: Updating emotional content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit? Answer:," Several years ago, we did a study on our lab's ""mental time bomb,"" a depressed subject who could hold an average 9,000 images in working memory, but only 20 to 50 at a time. By updating the emotional content of these images, we were able to hold the subject to work, but at the expense of cognitive speed, since the target was so focused on seeing it all. The depressed subject's working memory deteriorated, but when the subject viewed his pictures from a separate computer, he retained the ability to update the emotional content. When we studied how the subject responded to different emotional images in the memory system, we found that he was only moderately affected by the task, however. The subject did better when the set of images was changed from being a random assortment of images to a uniform set containing images of a sad cartoon, which also decreased his task effort. This study implied that emotional images, though more cognitively demanding than the random assortment, had the additional benefit of reducing the subject's working memory effort.

Cognitive load: A problem with social context.

Question: Why are social contexts so important for memory? Answer: Because in social contexts, mental effort does not get split among different parts of the brain. In one sense, this might not be a problem from a functional perspective, because we know in advance that cognitive effort will be allocated to one thing on purpose in every social situation. But if the whole thing is different in each context, than in either situation, mental effort will be divided along a different line. This will create a very different kind of problem -- a load -- for specific parts of the brain: the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex for processing the context of the interaction with the other person at the time, and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (if memory involves the recollection of events which have happened previously), for evaluating past events. But the problem goes well beyond those two major areas for memory, and may affect more for a number of regions of the brain involved in different aspects of experience and mood (e.g., the inferior secondary somatosensory cortex for pleasure-related memories). To find an example of this, consider a couple who recently had a long talk with one another. They said something about their love, which elicited a number of thoughts, and one about sex which elicited a variety of emotions. These thoughts were not processed separately from one another, but linked in a mental time bomb together with all the other thoughts. Eventually, when both felt ready to talk about all this to anyone, in whatever language they were comfortable with, they were unable to do so -- for they were caught up in the very same mental time bomb in which the couple had been separated. This is a basic problem with our ""mental time bomb."" It creates a load for a variety of mental resources for the individual; not only do we have to remember to think twice about something, but we have to remember what we have said at multiple stages of the process, so that if one part of our mind loses interest (which may happen suddenly or slowly, during an event of which memory is only a part), the entire mental load continues to grow. This suggests that, when people learn to work harder in order to make important decisions together, they are going to have to become more social in order to make these decisions, and that this also will cause problems with their personal memory.

Is the brain really as flexible as it seems?

Question: What are two thoughts that are not related but still exist in our mind? Answer: In the following experiments, I asked eight participants to sit quietly in a comfortable chair while their brains were scanned while they were still viewing the stimuli they had just been stimulated for. This allowed us to measure the frequency of different neural connections that the brain can use to process each new stimulus. They viewed a series of faces consisting of pictures of seven different individuals. The pictures had a wide range of emotion or quality, and so we used a set of 100 pictures that showed mostly happy-happy, neutral-neutral, and neutral-angry faces. Most of the time, when we looked at faces, each of the eight faces was the same individual. When we showed a single picture to everyone, that individual represented a small, isolated part of their brain. Other times, it was the face of a very different individual. For each individual, I showed several stimuli to show that when we watched facial images, we could make separate decisions about which face to look at, which was more important, and what the difference was between them. So what we saw was the brain's ability to process the different aspects of the stimuli. Our subjects were not given a list of examples of all of the different ways the faces were rated; instead, we simply asked them to report which face they usually thought about in the future or in the past. Our goal was to show how different mental factors can influence the decisions that people make --"
Question: Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein cannulation? Answer:," Although ultrasound imaging is routinely performed on all patients with an ischestral percutaneous approach to carotid intubation, there is no evidence that a prior intravenous administration of ultrasound (iMessage) to patients with an ischestral percutaneous approach improves outcome. Therefore, the importance of the clinical evaluation of intravisit ultrasound in patients with an ischestral percutaneous approach to carotid intubation is a topic of active investigation, especially among physicians who have never performed either approach in a patient with a carotid artery stab injury. Patient safety is also of concern for patients who have not received an ischestral percutaneous approach to carotid intubation and who have not been administered a previous ultrasound.

Review of the literature

Table 16. Table 16. Selected Articles on the Effects of Ultrasound and Imaging Techniques on the Outcomes of Carotid Intubation.

The outcomes of all patient-examined procedures in our community, including the most popular: carotid intubation and endovascular dialysis (ED), are evaluated and found to be excellent. [1] When a prior ischestral percutaneous approach has been used in a patient with a carotid artery stab (CAS I-VI), the surgery is generally without complications. [2] When a prior ischestral percutaneous approach has been used in a patient with an ischestral percutaneous approach to carotid artery stab and he has the same history of CAS I-VI, the surgeon is found to perform ""optimal"" surgery in 95%of these patients that had the best chance of surviving long-term ( ). [3] We believe that the clinical benefits of early ultrasound evaluation in patients with an I-VI have not been previously reported and do not meet the standard of peer-reviewed literature. While there are a lot of patients undergoing ultrasound in the ED, it is likely that they have patients who had an I-VI at the time of referral for carotid surgery or dialysis. These patients are probably different from those who are imaging with ultrasound at other times, at least for CAS I-VI.

In 1998, the Committee on Vascular Surgery (see Table 1) published a review of the treatment of ischemic arterial injury (IAI) that included the treatment of ""catastrophic"" CAS I-VI to determine if ultrasound could influence outcome with or without prior surgery. The Committee concluded that imaging might improve survival when these procedures had the same outcomes, provided the ischemic arterial injury (IAI) to be caused by carotid artery stab versus carotid artery strangulation. The most often referred, non-catastrophic (N-CAT) endovascular procedure, ischaemic coronary perfusion angiography, or CVA, was excluded from the study. Although the primary outcomes of patients who underwent a N-CAT procedure involved less carotid artery injury and less morbidity, a small subgroup of patients with an I-VI with or without N-CAT did have worse outcomes due to decreased carotid artery perfusion. Additionally, when compared to non-catastrophic (N-CAT) endovascular procedures, ischemic arterial injury (IAI) to a single vehicle was associated with better outcomes with less risk of carotid artery bleeding, but at least a subgroup of patients with I-VI with or without N-CAT had an increased risk of carotid artery hemorrhage that was considered to outweigh benefits of the procedure. The authors stated: ""It is our experience that in our experience, there is little if any benefit of laparoscopic removal of the carotid artery and the most commonly referred N-CAR to endovascular patients at the current time is not necessarily associated with any significant morbidity or mortality."" We agree with the authors in that ""catastrophic"" CAS I-VI is a relatively uncommon procedure in our practice.

The committee included three physicians, one who has a career that focuses on preventing carotid arterial injury (a generalisterves), and a neuroanatomist. One of the surgeons, after reviewing several cases where ultrasound had been used in the ED to improve outcomes among patients who had an I-VI with or without N-CAT, stated theyFood and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that endovascular procedures be included within the definition of diagnostic endovascular procedures (DEC). [4] The FDA, in October 2010, updated their regulations to permit endovascular procedures in patients with a carotid artery stab if the CT scan is available prior to the procedure and it is clear that both the catheter-induced carotid perforation and the percutaneous intubation are avoided. This change has been well"
Question: Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? Answer:," Yes, this should be adjusted to reflect the weight of the participants. It is an important step forward since the standard definition of a BMI of 25 or greater does not reflect the natural weight of the participants.

Question: Should women with a BMI of 25 or greater be included in the general population? Answer: They should be included, but only if they are willing to follow a low caloric diet for 6 or 7 months to be in a higher-risk group that will be followed for an average of 3 to 6 years to see if they achieve the goal.

Question: Should the risk status of the participants in the clinical trial be known? Answer: They will be asked to report their risk status at the start of the study. The same information should be known for the control group.

Question: If a participant with diabetes is tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for insulin resistance, should the test results be adjusted on risk status? Answer: All participants with diabetes who are prescribed insulin must undergo this type of testing.

Question: If a woman has had hysterectomy or a hysterectomy for a major cancer, the type of hysterectomy should be reported. Should the woman be asked to do a history of other uterine cancers and/or invasive uterine cancer? Answer: Not currently, because there are no studies to determine the association between risk of invasive uterine cancer or other cancers and the type of hysterectomy.

Question: How long is a 6 month dietary restriction? Answer: It depends. The amount is 1-2 months less than an equivalent length of weight loss.

Question: How many participants will be tested? Answer: 6. There are three groups of 3 participants. The largest group is the 5 percent at-risk group, but there are two smaller groups; the 2.75 percent at-risk group and the non-obese control group. There were also 13 other small group study participants.

Question: What are the definitions of risk status? Answer: A participant with a BMI 30 or higher has a higher risk of developing cancer while a participant with a BMI 20 or less has a lower risk.

Question: What is the maximum duration of weight loss? Answer: No information is available.

Question: Who will be evaluated for the study? Answer: Two participants selected from the nonobese control group and 7 other participants are recommended for evaluation.

Question: What are the criteria for eligibility for the study? Answer: 1) The participant has to be 18-75 years old and have not been overweight since age 22; 2) The participant must not be taking beta-blockers, diuretics, sulfonylureas, other diuretic medications, and any other medications which may impair renal function; 3) Although the study has not been formally validated, the primary end point of this study requires a fasting plasma glucose level below 5.5 mmol/L; 4) There must be no disease that will affect the liver function and therefore, the liver cannot be adversely affected by fasting metabolism; 5) The participant must not be taking any prescription medications that may impact their glucose and/or lipid levels or which affect blood sugar more than the study investigators have determined acceptable for this study; and 6) There must be no other diseases for which the participant may be considered to be at a relative risk of developing cancer because of any additional risk factors above those that have been considered appropriate for this study. The total risk of developing cancer in someone who has not gotten the study approved would be 0.0022%.

Question: Will the study benefit women who have premenopausal breast cancer? Answer: The study will determine the dose of the study regimen to initiate weight loss. We do not know how long the benefit goes.

Question: Who is going to determine the weight loss? Answer: None of the study investigators have been appointed as dietitians or primary investigators. The primary end point of this study is weight loss, which means they only know how much they will consume each day. They do not know whether they will maintain this number after this 6-month period, which could be any amount they would like.

Question: If a woman wants to maintain weight while having a history of cancer, are they allowed to get pregnant? Answer: Yes, it is OK. It is possible to gain weight during cancer treatment and then lose it for a few months following treatment.

Question: Is the study safe? Answer: It is safe for participants.

Question: Is there a chance for positive results? Answer: Since the primary end point requires a fasting plasma glucose level that is below 5.5 mmol/L, there are no positive long-term studies to determine this.

Question: I'm a man or a woman. Does the study recommend a men's weight-loss diet for men or"
Question: Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness? Answer:," Yes. By blocking the oxygen supply during a sleep episode, sleep apnea impedes your ability to perform daily life activities. To put this into context, aerobic performance in the community is measured in terms of the weekly mile run, the daily swim, the weekly walk, and the weekly bike ride. Each of these activities is anaerobic and requires the use of aerobic energy: for example, one mile may use about 500 extra calories from fat (more than 30 times the recommended daily average for women), and daily aerobic fitness could be lowered by 50% by the week following the episode of obstructive sleep apnea. As such, obstructive sleep apnea can negatively impact your health and quality of life. While not everyone with sleep apnea has chronic obstructive sleep apnea, a single night of obstructive sleep apnea may be disabling for some people. The risk can be as low as 50% after two or three episodes per month in the absence of sleep apnea suppression agents, and the risk may be even higher for moderate cases.


As such, a good way to prevent the development of obstructive sleep apnea is to change your sleep schedule. A standard eight-hour day is associated with a 5% reduced risk of obstructive sleep apnea. For example, a person who goes to bed at 7:00 pm and wakes up at 8:00 am gets up at 11:30 am.


The most common cause of obstructive sleep apnea is alcohol use (although some people use drugs, too), although most people with sleep apnea also report occasional sleep-related problems. In addition, sleep apnea occurs with regularity due to your body's natural diurnal rhythms. For many people, sleep apnea will increase the likelihood of having difficulty sleeping at night.


You should consult a sleep doctor if you have any of 3 conditions above: sleep apnea is common in people who regularly sleep more than 10 hours per day and if you have any of these sleep-related problems: you sleep for more than 10 hours with regularity; You sleep less than 7 hours over a 2-week period (some people do this every night or several nights per week); You sleep less than 5 hours per night for at least 3 consecutive nights in at least a 2-week span


Causes of sleep apnea include alcohol, drugs of abuse (marijuana, amphetamines, methamphetamine, and cocaine), and sleep-related disorders (sleep disorder, sleep apnea, or obstructive sleep apnea). People with sleep apnea aren't the only ones at risk, because it has also been shown that even people who don't sleep more than 11 hours per night are at risk of sleep apnea.


In addition to poor sleep habits, obstructive sleep apnea can also occur as the result of a viral disorder such as viral rhinitis (sometimes called viral gastroenteritis) or Lyme disease. Viral pneumonia causes inflammation of the air sacs that give you a good nights rest. Lyme disease also causes inflammation of the air sacs that give you a good nights rest, and may also damage your bones. Either disorder can cause severe sleep apnea.


In either case, sleep apnea is a more serious disease that will not improve on its own, especially if your symptoms are severe. Symptoms can include feeling as if you might pass out at any time (for example, when you're exercising, doing exercises that you're not supposed to be doing, walking on the same floor on which you sleep, etc.), snoring, a feeling of being winded while you're awake, feeling tired, lightheaded, or nauseated.


While sleep apnea does increase your risk of developing other health problems, getting some form of sleep, such as a regular bedtime, is the single best way to prevent sleep disturbances. If in recovery from sleep disturbances (including obstructive sleep apnea), medications alone can get you back to a normal sleep cycle (your body will automatically adjust to a healthy sleep schedule again), but if you are having trouble controlling your breathing, please speak to your healthcare provider about getting your sleep on autopilot.

Question: The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK? Answer:," In a dose-dependent study on 5 male mice, melatonin 1 mg/kg/day (0.125 nmol/L) was given daily for 28 days. When compared to vehicle, melatonin caused a significant increase in the melatonin concentration in the blood. This finding is supported by the finding that the melatonin concentrations in the brain were significantly reduced whereas those in the blood of AICAR treated mice were increased. These effects of melatonin were not associated with a decrease in hepatic melatonin synthesis or production but only of a reduced production of plasma melatonin by the liver: a reduction in hepatic melatonin synthesis could not explain and increase in plasma melatonin produced by the liver could not explain the observed changes. In a dose-dependent study on 6 male C57BL/6J mice, melatonin, given once daily at 10 µg, for 7 days, decreased the 24-h plasma melatonin concentrations to a maximum of 10.5 ng/ml (control) and increased these levels to 21.2 ng/ml and 34.4 ng/ml after 7 days and 28 days. Melatonin was shown to decrease the melatonin concentrations of the heart by inhibiting the conversion of melatonin to 1,3,5-triazine-4-carboxymethedrene (4-HMG). This phenomenon is similar to that of the decrease of melatonin in animals subjected to a hypoperfusion event: melatonin administration increased melatonin concentrations in the heart. Thus, melatonin has an effect on the brain to decrease its effects on the blood. Moreover, it is possible that at higher doses melatonin has an effect on the heart too.

Answer: In a dose-dependent study on 5 male C57BL6J mice, melatonin, given once daily at 10 µg, for 7 days, decreased the 24-h plasma melatonin concentrations to a maximum of 10.5 ng/ml (control) and increased these levels to 21.2 ng/ml and 34.4 ng/mlafter 7 days and 28 days.

Melatonin was shown to decrease the melatonin concentrations of the heart by inhibiting the conversion of melatonin to 1,3,5-triazine-4-carboxymethedrene (4-HMG).

Question: Literacy after cerebral hemispherectomy: Can the isolated right hemisphere read? Answer:," No. To write letters, a person must have use of both hemispheres or one of the arms. However, while no functional loss was found in the left hemisphere, it did appear that some of the cognitive function of the patient's brain had been modified during the operation. It will take at least 2 more years of study to find out if the patient has any other cognitive problems before having surgery in the right hemisphere of his brain."
Question: Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible? Answer:," A case of a 23-year-old man with advanced hemorrhagic shock and a 37-yr-old woman with a high-risk pregnancy, both with known hyperandrogenism, was included in our study. This case study showed a clear difference in both men and women in terms of the effects of testosterone administration and the timing of the changes of testosterone as well as in the characteristics of the individuals (sporting an intermediate physical build). It appeared the women were affected earlier than the men because of their more generalized hyperandrogenism, but the timing of the change of testosterone was clearly delayed. However, these two studies showed significant and consistent, albeit asymmetrical, sexual dimorphism. Conclusion: The present results are consistent with previous findings, particularly the case studies described above in which a significant and consistent relationship was identified between the timing of the testosterone changes and the characteristics of the affected individuals. It seems that the results presented in Table 3 show that men are affected earlier than women. This is consistent with the results presented in previous studies. In addition, these results are consistent with the findings presented in Table 4, where the differences in the hormonal profiles of men and women are less pronounced at the later stage of the menstrual cycle compared to the early stage. These results, from case study studies, are consistent with those related to an early timing of the testosterone changes. This is a particularly important finding since the hormones of fertility are in the second trimester, but in the second trimester patients will experience more rapid changes of ovarian secretion with the addition of an additional hormone, oestrogen. Thus, a small degree of asymmetry in the timing of the changes of the hormone may be relevant for those who are already in the second trimester, but still a problem in women who will develop hyperandrogenism later because of their hyperandrogenism."
Question: Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught? Answer:," Yes, but only in English! The answer depends on the language used. There's no need to study languages if you only need to communicate with terminally ill patients. No one wants to see a doctor in the language. You can communicate with patients by email. Or, you can listen to the patient's voice through an app on their phone. That way, you don't have to understand them when they speak.

It's important to have some awareness of the fact that people are dying. Even if you only need to talk to terminally ill or dying patients and they speak a language other than your own, it doesn't hurt to understand other languages, and to have some awareness of the language they use. To learn to speak and use a language doesn't mean you are obligated to help someone else learn to speak it!"
Question: Delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer: does it impact survival? Answer:," Yes. Early breast cancers are more likely to survive for longer. However, a large-scale analysis of more than 150,000 women is not adequate to study the question of whether delays in treatment of early cancer increase life expectancy. It is necessary, however, to examine the long-term consequences of delayed treatment within each group. This has recently been accomplished by a study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The results indicate that delaying the time to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up increases the risk of death and the risk of cardiovascular disease for each year of delay, even after accounting for other possible effects of the illness or treatments (15). Additional, detailed analysis is presented in a paper by Lai et al. (15). In support of their conclusions, here we report 1939–2008 long-term survival rates, which are based on follow-up data between 1999 and 2008.

BACKGROUND Cancer is the leading cause of death in the United States, and the cancer mortality rate is almost two times higher among women than among men. A major component of the problem is the long-term incidence of breast cancer. Although breast cancer in women is more common than among men, the incidence of metastatic disease is approximately three to five times higher. Because of the high incidence of this and other cancers, early diagnosis was thought to diminish risk of death for women. Because of its high rate of recurrence, however, early diagnosis in primary breast cancer treatment is not always available. Therefore, a large study in the United States that includes only women with clinically apparent disease and follows closely the progression of breast cancer is necessary to answer the question of whether delaying the time to cancer diagnosis increases the risk of death.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cancer Patient Survey (CPS) and Cancer Registry Data Base (CMRD) of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and National Death Index (NDI) of NHANES are used as the reference populations. CPS, a nationally representative survey that assesses the health status of US residents on an ongoing basis, has been conducted annually since 1969 by the National Center for Health Statistics (13, 14). CPS is a self-administered questionnaire that includes 16 questions and can be completed in a day or three days. The primary objective of CPS is to estimate the health status of the population according to several features. The primary features of the CPS include survival rates (the number of individuals with a survival time) and health characteristics.

RESULTS From 1999 to 2008, the total population of the United States was 9.7 million, comprising more than 11% of the total population (age 15+) ages 1 to 69 years. There were 2,972,850 male deaths from cancer. The total deaths for the study population ranged from 1,092,000 in 2000 to 1,215,000 in 2008. After accounting for time from diagnosis to diagnosis and treatment, there were only 1,032,500 (0.06%) men who died from cancer; of these, only 473,950 were followed up with cancer treatment. After accounting for time from treatment, 907,500 (0.01%) men died but remained alive for 1 year or longer. A total of 5,039,120 (0.004%) men who died from cancer were hospitalized initially. Of these, 691,950 (0.016%) men were initially followed-up to hospital discharge modelling a survival time of 0 days. Survival-Time Model (SPM) is a method to forecast death rates including a continuous time series to estimate the time to death under various assumptions of disease progression and survival. To estimate the survival-Time Model, time from diagnosis to hospitalization was divided into days starting from the date of diagnosis and ending at the date of hospital discharge. The time from hospital discharge to death was multiplied by the estimated hospital-outcome survival-time. This equation is then applied to the total number of deaths to estimate the duration of life lost. The SPM was conducted on the total population, accounting for years of life lost, before dividing the total population into 7,839,850 (0.02%) subgroups. Among all subgroups, the survival-Time Model estimated time to death for all subgroups except for the category of females who died of cancer who had a total survival time of 0 days (Figure 1). Only a single case in the female group of 791,950 (0.017%) was followed-up for more than one year. The overall survival-Time Model estimated time to death for all subgroups except females who died of breast cancer. Women with a total life expectancy of less than 3 months at diagnosis had a survival time of <6 months, whereas death at diagnosis of 3 Months or longer was noted in only 1,032,500 (0.006%) of the women. At a mortality of <2?'"
Question: Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males? Answer:," No!

The most common cause of the increased carotid pulse (CCP) is a change in carotid length (long artery length being most common) and a change in the resistance between the two valves (long and short), and the CCP is the most reliable of all carotid pulse signatures. What's more, the CCP is directly linked to insulin resistance, obesity, and heart disease. The CCP is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death. However, there are no established cause-and-effect relations.

It is important to point out that we do know that for all known CCP abnormalities:

the length of the long and short arteries are not the same in normal and obese individuals, and

they do not correlate negatively with the risk for developing diabetes and coronary heart disease.

What if increased carotid pulse is a result of the presence of certain risk factors? Answer:

As shown below, when the presence of specific risk factors is controlled for, there is not a significant relationship between the CCP and mortality or morbidity (deaths). Furthermore,USA (the Society of Statisticians and Engineers) published a study in 2008, in which the presence of certain risk factors was not a significant factor in the association between the carotid pulse and the death rateic heart disease and cancer risk (see the study for more information on the role of the carotid pulse).

Dangerous Blood Voltage (VAS) and the risk for coronary artery disease (CHD)

When the risk of coronary thrombosis, or blood clots in the walls of blood vessels, increases, the risk of CHD increases significantly. A single blood-vascular event is often the reason for CHD. Although there is very little data supporting the use of ultrasound for diagnosis of CHD, physicians and scientists seem to agree that VAS is the best method for determining the presence or absence of a risk factor for CHD.

What if VAS is used by heart disease physicians to exclude or exclude individuals from a population when identifying cardiovascular disease in that population? Answer:

Vasovagal syncope (VAS).

Dangerous VAS was developed as a way for physicians to correctly diagnose other (disease) and cardiac ""illnesses"" by determining when the person experiences a ""syncope,"" a sudden and involuntary loss of consciousness. This can be caused by severe blood pressure, heart attack (perfusion thrombosis or rupture), stroke, aortic stenosis, or angina. This sudden loss of consciousness, called ""VAS,"" can result in a life-threatening event; therefore, VAS is a life-saving diagnostic tool. However, a high incidence of VAS in individuals with atherosclerosis, stroke (angina), or an already established risk group for these diseases, has caused controversy in the medical literature.

There has been some controversy regarding VAS and its validity in determining CHD risk in the general population. As shown below, the validity of VAS is debatable and in most cases has not proven to be reliable (the study cited below was the first to be designed to address this issue). However, a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in 2001 found no significant connection between VAS and the risk for CHD in adults, and a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993 and 2012 (both by a well-known heart disease researcher) demonstrated that VAS could be used to rule out other causes of CHD (e.g., heart failure and arrhythmia).

In addition, a series of case reports found that VAS was not correlated with CHD risk. In 2008, a study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine (to which this article is a supplement, see the study's abstract) concluded that VAS was not a good cardiovascular risk factor (although VAS is a marker for high blood pressure and has no relationship to CHD risk) and that further research was needed in these critical questions. This study also found that the presence of an existing risk factor for CHD or CAD also did not increase the effectiveness of VAS at identifying a person's CHD risk.

VAS and Vascular Events (including heart attack and stroke)

In a retrospective study, a heart attack case-control study, and in a randomized controlled trial involving 17,097 patients, researchers measured the presence of VAS on one wrist as well as VAS on a computer screen at 2 different time points after an acute myocardial infarction. Results of the VAS-related hospitalizations, with a median stay of more than six days, showed an increased risk of hospital admission (P =.04) compared with the controls. When VAS was shown in"
Question: Are acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people socially imbalanced? Answer:," The results presented here and in a previous population study (Whelan et al. 2006) support the theory that the lower uptake of care in older people could be related to different levels of social and emotional support in older persons. While acceptance rates in older people have improved over the past decade (Frost et al. 2003 ; Kuczmarski et al. 2004 ; Sotnick et al. 2007 ), they were in fact higher than the rest of the population in the mid-twentieth century. In particular, the increase in age-specific insurance coverage and the widespread use of social services are not explained by a greater need for care in the older population and thus could not explain the lower acceptability of national preventive home visits. (See also the discussion by Dweck and Frost, 2007, and Sotnick and Dweck, 2009.)

Response: The findings presented here and in a previous population survey (Whelan et al. 2006 ) are consistent with the hypotheses that social support and psychological well-being may be associated with acceptance rates and that older people with better access to social services have lower acceptability rates. In an observational study (Frost et al. 2003 ), acceptance rates of a nationwide preventive home visit programme for older people were more negative than acceptance rates for other social services, including legal and health services, in the older population (Whelan et al. 2006 ). Thus, the negative association between acceptability of a national preventive home visit programme for older people and other social services in the older population seems likely. This may be related to the lower acceptance for services that meet the needs of the younger members of the community (Frost et al. 2003 ). Although acceptance and support for a national preventive home visit programme may be associated with other social and psychological well-being measures, no association was found in our observational study. The results presented here and in a previous population survey (Whelan et al. 2005 ) might be explained by variousliberties such as a lower level of acceptance for services in more disadvantaged local areas, greater acceptance for services in a deprived region, and social isolation when older people living alone. In contrast, the results in our earlier study (Whelan et al. 2006 ) suggesting that more and poorer older people have lower acceptance for an older and vulnerable elderly person might be in line with higher levels of social resources, psychological well-being and psychological stress on older people living alone and less access to social and psychological resources in more affluent local areas.

Response: In line with the findings in previous studies, no association was found between acceptability and receipt of outpatient care and/or inpatient care or general practice services in the other age groups. Therefore, there was no evidence of a social exclusion associated with fewer resources and services to provide for older persons who wish to receive preventive home visits.

Response: A possible explanation for the results presented in previous studies is that the negative association between a national preventive home visit programme and healthinged services, social and psychological services and psychological well-being in the older population is not associated with the acceptance and support provided for a national preventive home visit programme.

Response: The findings in other studies by Gans and colleagues (1997, 2001; 2002) support the hypothesis that older adults who have difficulty with certain tasks, are distressed and not accepting of their own problems, are less likely to receive general preventive home visits. Although higher age is associated with reduced acceptability of a national infiltranational home visit programme, there is no association between age and acceptance rates for this nationally important intervention in other population samples.

Response: This pattern of results in other studies might be related to the particular study or sample, or to some other confounding factor. In the two previous studies, an association between age and receipt of outpatient and general services was reported but at different levels and in different regions (Gans et al. 1997; 2000; 2002). In addition, these two studies included similar populations but differed in that the older population included only people aged 65–71 years, whereas the older population included people aged 83–89 years (Gans et al. 1999; 2003) or persons aged 90 years (Gans et al. 2002). Although the other studies presented below are based on older people aged 65–71 years and the older population is older, but their population samples are also older, most of them also included the population aged 85 years or younger (Chatterjee and Mokdad, 2005; Saha and Zuazu, 2007), in most of these studies acceptance rates of a national infiltranational home visit programme were low (Gans et al. 2000; Saha and Zuazu 2002; Chatterjee and Mokdad, 2005; Mokdad et al. 2005; Saha and Suzuki, 2008). In this study, the acceptance of a national infiltranational home visit programme was low also"
Question: Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles? Answer:," Open access is not the only way to disseminate scientific papers around the world. Scientific works are shared not only among specialists and colleagues of the work, but also via social media. The authors of open-access papers in the global scientific literature are often open-source researchers. The open-access journal Nature has published many scientific papers through their open-access system. So even the biggest open-access journals have been growing in popularity in recent years. The number of scientific papers published in open-access journals is now much higher than in any other scientific field. Open access will not only benefit traditional, traditional public institutions like universities, but also open-access providers like publishers. Open access is a real democratization process, that not only benefits the public, but also the open-access providers themselves. The open-access revolution is not limited for science journals; it is also the case for software applications, the internet and publishing platforms. Open-access is a global phenomenon: it has been observed in the scientific community everywhere. The growing popularity of open-access publishing is in large part due to several reasons: A large and growing number of publishers, including Nature, Springer and Elsevier, offer open access to their authors. As a consequence, the market has become saturated. In a world where access to information is important and fast becoming a commodity, the market for open access is growing all the time. And it is important to point this out: open access is not an exclusive right of the scientific establishment; it has been a global social project, which can offer the whole world a wide-open access. Open access, for example, is the source of a tremendous amount of data that is relevant for scientific development, and can be a valuable service for developing countries. What the open-access revolution has done for scientists, the open-access revolution is also done for the 1928+ Open Access Database; a worldwide project to make public everything that is currently available for free in the world's scientific repositories of knowledge. The main purpose of the 1928+ Open Access Database is to complement the growing research activity, which is generally conducted in public institutions or the general public. The open-access database is being used by thousands of scientists, but also by many researchers from other fields. The open-access database is often the most commonly used public repository of information in the world. The database is often consulted by researchers everywhere: in the academic world, in government, and in public institutions. This means that scientific research must remain open. The open-access revolution is not a matter for researchers, but for the global society. Since the 1928+ Open Access Database (OMBD) represents the biggest public repository of the world's scientific knowledge, and since the database is open-source, the research community must contribute to the knowledge of this database. The first of five editions of the OMBD is already available (version 13), and will be upgraded in coming months.

Open access in the digital economy is still in its infancy, but already it has become the way in which information is shared with the public.

The public interest in having access to information is growing.

New information sharing technologies can be used by all users as long as they are accessible and are considered in their general context.

Digital companies can become open by offering access to their data to the public.

The open-access revolution supports knowledge sharing. Therefore it should encourage innovation and the diffusion of knowledge within communities. The Open Access Initiative is an EU initiative that is organized by member states for collaboration on research issues in the public interest and support and application of open data systems. The main content of the Open Access Initiative is Eyalty, the open data database. The goal of the initiative is to promote research and development in order to enhance the general well being of humanity. In 2016, the project received the EU funding ""Papers and Public Knowledge"", which financed the development of the online data collection system, Eyalty as well as all other activities in the campaign. We want to invite you to participate in this project!"
Question: In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role? Answer:," There is no evidence that pyloric stenosis in infants with high-functioning hypertrophy is associated with any of the pathological manifestations reported in adults. It should be noted however, that hypertrophy in these infants is secondary to increasing the size of the mucosa. It seems that the clinical implications are more likely to manifest rather than to lead to complications for the infants. Answer

A: Many of the problems and concerns that patientsinstead of their physicians might have are discussed in the ""Clinical Management of Hypertrophic Prostatitis"" booklet that is available from the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the Mayo Clinic. Answer

Q: With respect to hypertrophy of the mesenteric fat in patients with congestive heart failure, does excessive hypertrophy cause this? Answer: When a patient shows excessive fat in their mesenteric artery, and their fat contains high levels of fat-soluble toxins, the increased levels of these toxins may cause the fat to eventually ""go limp."" This usually results in a condition called atherosclerosis. If the patient has had congestive heart failure for a long time, the fat may just continue to go limp rather than become atherosclerotic. This condition may also result in a lower total or good cholesterol level for most patients during the course of their entire disease, rather than being associated with an increased incidence of bad cholesterol or triglycerides in the blood. On the other hand, in patients who have only had heart failure for a few decades, the accumulation of excessive fatty acids in the fat tissues may have been part of the cause of the disease and it is more likely to be associated with a low serum total or good cholesterol level. The accumulation of fat in the arteries is a major cause of arteriosclerosis and is not associated with any other vascular pathologies. Answer

A: It has been well established that the accumulation of fat in the mesenteric arteries is a risk factor for the development of arteriosclerosis. We have been concerned to identify the exact mechanism of lipogenesis after coronary artery disease, based upon studies of the role of fatty acid accumulation in atherosclerosis. However, it is unlikely that such lipogenesis has any significance in our society, except for persons who take medications that cause excessive production of fatty acids. Answer

A: In persons with low serum lipids it is quite obvious that high lipid levels are not associated with an increased incidence of non-fatal atherosclerotic disease. It has been well established that the lipid profile of healthy individuals can be manipulated by simple lifestyle changes. That is why it is recommended that most of the changes used by the average person to improve his or her lipid profile will cause minimal impairment in health status. While most of the changes are harmless, a small minority may be detrimental for certain cases. Because the beneficial aspects of these changes are well understood by those who have experienced them, this issue has been the subject of much debate among physicians. Answer

A: The association with low LDL concentrations is well established and is strongly associated with the development of CAD. Low HDL concentrations are also associated with CVD. The prevalence of CAD in men is 50-60% in those individuals with low HDL concentrations; in women it is 30-35% Answer

A: Many of the clinical practices that we have implemented in our clinic (particularly preventive surgery and endometrial ablation) have been based upon the experience gained in the treatment of people with atherosclerosis. As a result, it is evident that we have learned and implemented some of them based upon our knowledge of people with atherosclerosis and on observation of the problems that people with SHA had in regard to their cardiac function and their angiographic features. The observations presented to us from the management of people with coronary artery disease, such as coronary angiography, chest radiograph, electrocardiography, or arteriography are very consistent with what we have learned from the management of people affected with atherosclerosis. For this reason, we have established a practice of using various techniques to improve heart function in people with high LDL and/or HDL concentrations. (There is at present no treatment to modify the LDL or HDL concentrations in these people.) This treatment is generally performed using procedures we described previously. The purpose of the other Aadity practices, such as the endometrial ablation procedure described in this article, is to make changes in the structure of the reproductive organs as part of their management and as a routine step in this case since the majority of the subjects who have undergone such procedures have experienced severe heart problems and as a result of these complications often required the transfer of their heart to another location. However, these procedures are not used for the treatment of people with non-cardiovascular diseases. Answer

A: In regard to the above questions, all that we know at"
Question: Does the early adopter of drugs exist? Answer:," Yes. We find that 80% of the earliest adopters of drugs are women, as are 75% of the early adopters of digital technology, 84% of early adopters of food, and 76% of early adopters of personal technology. (Szasz, 1994: 45)

An early adopter of a disruptive technology is one who, once the technology is available, quickly adopts the technology and uses it. An emerging early adopter is one who uses the technology, although not in great numbers. An early adopter typically is of college age. He or she uses the technology for personal use. An emerging early adopter is one who uses the technology not too heavily but does wrathful thing that are difficult for everyone to understand. (Szasz, 1994: 45)

Early adopters of digital technology, food, and personal technology will be in the 80-85% group. They tend to be young college age men who use digital technologies, food, and personal technologies. However, while the early adopter group is young for technology, the group of emerging early adopters is not. Because they can be so unpredictable, they will take the time to explain themselves to others. (Szasz, 1994: 45)

Question: Can the early adopter influence the outcome of an organization's decision on a new technology? Answer: Yes. We find that the early adopter changes perceptions of others. (Szasz, 1994: 45)

From the 90-150% group we divide into two. The 100% group is a group with the greatest ability to influence an organization's decision on a new technology. This group is a high school graduate, employed full time for over a year and is financially independent. This group has the least ability to influence an organization on the choice of technology and the greatest ability to influence the decision. (Szasz, 1994: 45)

The 150% population is the group who has the highest ability to influence the outcome of an organization's decision on a new technology. (Szasz, 1994: 45)

The 180% group we call the group of the one thousand and thirty three who have the greatest ability to influence the outcome of an organization's decision on a new technology. They are among the top ten percent of the population in terms of wealth, education, and income. They are also among the fastest growing consumers of technology. (Szasz, 1994: 45)

Question: Can your organization reach its users and create a new market for use of technology? Answer: We believe that the organization can increase the availability of technology that can reach those who are most active in their use. However, a company will never achieve its full potential with just technology, or only with only one technology. We believe that an organization must also have marketing and outreach campaigns that reach new populations to help them transition from the current technology to another. This is not a matter of reaching the people by giving them a single tool, but to encourage an industry to use more diverse technology. (Szasz, 1994: 46)

In the 60-90% group we divide into two groups. We call the 60% of the population that uses two or more technologies equally important, and the 90% that uses one technology more important. These people use different technology and different technologies. There is no obvious difference between the 90% of the population and the 60% of the population. However, for the 60% of the population we believe there is a difference of about 40% in the amount of technology that they use. Therefore, we consider them a high-use group who most likely will support new technologies with new types of products and services. The 60% of the population will be the 60% who will buy more technology. (Szasz, 1994: 46-47)

An alternative solution to reach the new technologies is marketing campaigns that will not only encourage current users to use the new technology, but will also provide a future group for future users to learn about and adopt new products and services. (Szasz, 1994: 47)

Question: What is the early adopter's motivation for adopting the disruptive technology? Answer: For some people it may just be a desire to be free from pain and to enjoy life without the distractions of government controls and restrictions. But in those cases we think it is about providing value. We think people think they should be able to spend their money on what they want to be able to have no limit on what they can buy. This is a very difficult thing for people to grasp but the fact of the matter is that we see more innovation in the marketplace when it is free of government regulations, and the innovators that emerge from this marketplace thrive because of that freedom. (Szasz, 1994: 48)

Question: Is there a correlation between early adoption and political influence"
Question: Does high blood pressure reduce the risk of chronic low back pain? Answer:," Yes. High blood pressure is a risk factor for chronic low back pain as well as for degenerative disc disease. The higher your blood pressure, the greater the chance that you will develop low back pain. You may think that low back pain is a simple problem. In fact, it is a complicated problem that you need to manage on your own. It seems that you may have overdiagnosed it, if you have a history of diabetes. As a result, a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease by yourself is far more likely. For more information, you can contact your care provider. You can also view a brochure on low back pain from the American College of Physicians. If your low back pain is very severe, you will need a diagnosis by a qualified Physician. See the article called ""Treating Low Back Pain"". For more information on how to manage your low back pain, please try the ""The Diving Manual"" by Richard S. Tannenbaum, PHD. You can also look in the list of Articles and Books on the Internet at ""The Diving Manual"" on the Internet in the Library section by clicking on ""Diving Articles and Books"".
It will take awhile for your back pain to heal, during that time your bones will do more or less the same things they do now. This is called an ""up and down"" of your bones. These periodic bouts of pain or discomfort may interfere with your day-to- day life, because you'll spend a large number of hours sitting or standing. The ""up and down"" of your bones means your joints will get weaker or stronger over time. It is common for your bones to lose some strength. As a result, if your back pain is severe it is important to see a qualified Physician for an evaluation of your body's energy resources in order to give better treatments. When you have severe back pain it is recommended that you visit a health care professional. If your symptoms allow you to do so, call or visit your health care provider.

Question: Does responsibility affect the public's valuation of health care interventions? Answer:," Responsibility is a key factor in an intervention's ""value-added"" because it allows participants to assess the effectiveness of the intervention (e.g., the amount of harm and potential benefits reduced or prevented) without having to determine whether or not particular decisions had been made.[2] Thus, the responsibility of the participant depends on how much the intervention reduced the harms, and the public has a powerful incentive (in certain settings) to report that outcome to their representative government with the highest level of responsibility. For many health care intervention items, public opinion will be strongly determinative (e.g., public participation in research and development, scientific publication, etc.) when the participants have high levels of responsibility. However, when the decision-making process is highly decentralized in scope (e.g., when the procedure is delivered by computer without any formal decision-making process), no public opinion is possible because decisions do not have much meaning (i.e., the impact of the procedure on the decision-making process is not meaningful) and so the public is much less likely to evaluate these procedures with high levels of responsibility than with a less decentralized process.[1]


The current public interest in individual choices can be explained by two factors. The first is a strong desire for freedom. People respond to certain stimuli in these two different ways: they perceive the stimulus as causing them to want to interact with that stimulus in a way that they did not before (e.g., the color of a face when the stimulus prompts them to identify with something more positive), or the stimulus is perceived not to cause them to want to interact with it in a way they did before (e.g., the color of a face when the stimulus triggers them to think about something negative [e.g., a threat]; the color of a face when it activates their ability to think about something positive, such as getting a raise or better treatment from their employer).[3] For example, when a person perceives a reward as causing them to want to act in a certain way (""a positive emotional response""), they might not initiate a behavior and instead rely on cues (such as being in a certain place or having a certain opinion about the reward in the present moment), while avoiding behaviors that elicit a negative emotional response, i.e., they might avoid taking any actions that may be perceived to cause them to react negatively. Alternatively, when a person is afraid of a reward, they might not initiate a behavior and simply rely on cues that indicate their fear (such as being in a certain place or perceiving the reward in a certain way). For example, people might choose to pay less attention to a phone number and instead look into a database with a list of words and phrases (""trouble of the day""), which will not trigger a negative emotional response but will result in a more accurate prediction of the recipient's behavior than if they are able to take action in response to the number.[4]

The second factor is the fact that people are very good at perceiving risk, i.e., they perceive a reward as causing them to want to do an action even if it would result in negative consequences. In this way, people can understand that a hypothetical reward will cause them to act in a certain way even if it will be perceived as causing them to act in a way that will also be perceived negatively. Similarly, people can understand that a hypothetical reward will cause them to act in a certain way even if it will cause them to avoid acting in a certain way. People perceive the situation as being fraught with potential harm and therefore they respond to a hypothetical reward in a manner that helps them survive (or help maintain the status quo). Thus, they view the possible consequences of the potential reward and want to behave in a way that ensures their survival or that maintains their current position. If they were to act in a way that is seen as threatening (e.g., an action that they see as being harmful but that could be considered in good faith because the reward was seen as a benefit that they need in order to survive), there is a strong desire to avoid those actions unless the result of the perceived potential benefit is seen to be greater than the risk of the act. This behavior will be viewed as risky by those who perceive a risk but as less risky by those who perceive a benefit. This means that people perceive threats and avoid them as a reaction to perceived threat and as a result can be influenced by external social pressures.[5]


There are at least two more factors that determine the public's willingness and ability to judge the effectiveness of a specific health care intervention. First, it can influence the individual's choice of which action to take. For example, a person may be inclined to buy a new phone after she learns that it will allow her to call her child even less frequently, but that she may actually be happier if she does not have a cell phone to her name. Similarly, people may be drawn to certain activities that"
Question: Nasal fractures: is closed reduction satisfying? Answer:," A large volume of data exist on the efficacy of closed reduction and its superiority over open reduction as a treatment for nasal fractures. There is considerable variability in the severity of the fractures. Because of this, there is no way to predict a single treatment that has a higher efficacy than any other. Open reduction offers good results in the short term. However it may become problematic as the amount of surgery increases, especially if the disease cannot be treated. Thus it is important that open reduction remains a viable treatment. Nasal fracture can be corrected with a complete closure of all the nasal passages with occlusive materials or with a short and simple closure of the impacted portions of the nasal passages, particularly in the lower nasal passages. Nasal reconstruction can also be performed in these sections.

Nasal fracture can also be managed with a combination of three topical drugs that stimulate inflammation and the surrounding tissue. These drugs include diclofenac sodium (DDC) and hyaluronan.

There is very good evidence that topical agents for nasoplasty can provide improvement in surgical scars when in combination with surgical excision therapy or with open reduction. However, the efficacy of oral medications for scar management is unclear.

Some authors advocate the use of topical treatment of scarring in patients under the age of 10 years and in women. This has been supported by an ongoing clinical trial that reported the treatment of the underlying scar with topical mordazolidone cream that lasts up to 18 weeks.

MORIGINALS

In the initial treatment of the nasal cavity, the nasopharynx (throat) is first incised. This must be done with full and proper opening of all the surrounding structures in order for the closure of the fracture to be successful. The surgeon then removes all sutures (a small portion of skin or a loose hair) before returning for the final closure of the affected structures. The surgical opening required for closure of the nasal fractures is approximately 1/4 mm or greater [5]. A recent small retrospective study of 80 patients using closed reduction and nasal reconstruction showed a high efficacy for those who used closed reduction versus open reduction. Both groups were treated for a mean median of 3 years.

There is considerable variability in the severity of the sutures. Because of this, there is no way to predict a single treatment that has a higher efficacy than any other. There are no data demonstrating that closed reduction offers long term improvement in nasal scars.

When the suture is removed, the nasal folds need to be surgically reconstructed. This involves the removal of one or more of the nasal folds. The nasal fold is either removed or its margins sewn shut behind the suture [5]. Because of the great variability in the placement of the sutures, there is no way to predict a one-size-fits-all approach to nasal implant placement.

The nasal fold is usually removed with the use of the suture saw and the open section is then closed with sutures. However, it is also important to be patient tolerant and not to force the opening at an unrealistic depth. There is generally an accepted depth for the nasal flap to open that is 30-45 cm.

The patient may have normal, non-surgically detected soft palate in combination with nasal folds. If the nasal flap is placed behind the suture, the patient may experience discomfort, decreased swallowing and may require daily nasal steroid therapy to control the pain and discomfort.

In this study of 80 patients, patients were classified as having a low-cost patient (with an average cost $700, $820 and $100 for open, closed and reduced reconstructions, respectively), moderate-cost patient (with an average cost $1,050, $1,250, $1,350 and $1,550 for open, closed and reduced reconstructions) and high-cost patient (with an average FML of $1,550, $1,400, $1,450 and $1,650 for open, closed and reduced reconstructions). [6] Patients requiring implantation of a flap and those with a nasal flap on the upper airway were classified as having a low-cost patient.

It has been associated with surgery to insert an artificial flap [8], but a study of patients with nasal reconstruction with an artificially placed nasal flap yielded the greatest benefits [9]. Thus, the surgeon may choose to use closed reduction, closed reduction alone and open reduction alongside each other, depending on the patient preference. It was also found that the level of surgical treatment used did not appear to be related to subsequent complication burden.

The nasal flap is usually removed using a suture tool or using a wire suture for additional closure. Once the nasal flap is removed, the nasal canal or nasal passages are closed. This may be a simple suture, using a few staples, or may require a more elaborate suture.

"Question: Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival? Answer:"," Research provides a mixed picture on the relationship between outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services. Research by John C. White examined the relationships among all three activities. He found that the most beneficial intervention was a comprehensive evaluation of a child's development to determine its functioning; such evaluations may reduce the need for referrals, especially for children with developmental delay. Other studies find no positive relationship. Research using standardized procedures is limited, especially when combined with child characteristics. White found no positive effect of a child's clinical treatment in predicting survival. Yet further research is needed to determine the mechanisms that influence outcomes over a wide range of characteristics of child patients and families.

Are interventions that address quality of life and social and behavioral concerns for children beneficial in the treatment of childhood cancer? These questions may seem contradictory from one perspective, but researchers continue to pursue this question. Children who are at increased risk of cancer benefit from interventions that address quality of life. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) found that an improved well-being can be predicted from a variety of measures, including a child's cognitive development.1 Children with a more functional and positive family environment, but also an undetermined number of comorbid conditions, have a lower risk of cancer.2 An intervention that directly addresses social and behavioral problems can also reduce a child's survival risk by increasing access to early cancer treatment.3 Parents of patients with chronic leukemia or lymphoma are often the most important caregivers for their children. Research suggests that the quality of a parent's care is associated with the child's survival.4 Children who are cared for by caregivers who are in school and attending regular child care are also at a decreased risk of cancer.5 A recent study that used the Health Independence, Self-Directed Quality of Life (HINS) Study found that children with more complex comorbidities and those for whom a wide range of interventions was available had higher HINS scores.6 Children for whom the child caregiver is receiving high quality parent education and a positive role model for good self-esteem also had higher HINS scores. For comparison, the HINS study of more than 15,000 children is considered the national gold standard of quality of care.6 Furthermore, the Nurses' Health Study showed that children whose parents report high HINS scores are less likely to continue a chronic disease or have adverse developmental outcomes.7 The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse, Alcoholism, and Alcoholism concluded that positive parental involvement is a strong predictor of long-term outcome among children and adolescents with alcohol disorders.8 Children whose caregivers are engaged in the child care system are less likely to be hospitalized for alcohol-related conditions and may be less likely to develop alcohol use disorders.9 Research examining children with cancer finds that treatment of quality of life issues is a critical issue to consider when treating children with cancer. Studies have shown that children with cancer have an increased risk of being hospitalized for substance-related problems and adverse developmental outcomes from alcohol abuse.10,11 Studies of children with cancer can help to determine whether this increased risk is due to problems with quality of life issues or problems with family and social functioning, such as problems with parental communication. Research in the early childhood years has found that children of cancer parents are more likely than nontargeted children to have problems with their parents' communication.12 One study found a strong association between a child's parent-reported alcohol abuse and the child's parent-reported problems with his or her family.13 Another study found that children with cancer parents have lower IQs and lower educational achievement than children of nontargeted parents.14 A large population-wide survey of parents, teachers, and child care and education providers in Wisconsin found that the rate of negative parent-reported affect was higher among children with parents with cancer than the nonsurvivors.15 Researchers have also found a strong relationship between parental symptoms of depression and the child's development of emotional problems such as anger, anxiety, and interpersonal problems.16 Although the current research is still in its infancy and limited to studies of children with cancer, the studies do paint a consistent picture of benefits from child care and education for children with cancer. A recent study of the effects of a child care system that is child-focused compared to a child-centered system found good associations between school-based care and improved health outcomes.17 Child care programs in the general medical system were found to have positive effects on children's health, including increased levels of school readiness, improved school performance, and higher levels of general health.18 The health care system for children is characterized by systems with a focus on the needs of children and their families.19 The primary goal of a child care system is for children to attend school and gain the educational competence that will help them improve their health to achieve their potential. Because the overall goal of pediatric"
Question: Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa? Answer:," There are a number of potential complications that may occur. In most, they are minor and will resolve from treatment or follow-up after surgical excision and the development of a new condition such as fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients will be able to return to work with limited limitations on activities of daily living but may need long-term treatment with medication therapy that are recommended by a specialist.

Surgical Remission of Polyarteritis Nodosa After an Initial Diagnosis

Recurring

A patient with acute polyarteritis nodosa may progress to recurrent polyarteritis nodosa with the use of prophylactic or adjunctive therapies. In addition, more patients with chronic polyarteritis nodosa may eventually develop recurrent recurrent polyarteritis nodosa.

In patients with polyarteritis nodosa, the disease may progress to rheumatic symptoms and can be life-threatening or fatal when left untreated or becomes chronic. It should be recognized that recurrent polyarteritis nodosa can also develop in patients with a more-prevalent disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, congestive heart failure or systemic lupus erythematosus. All these diseases can cause significant disability and should be recognized as a potential complication.

The following are some of the potential complications:

Sudden death

Tear gas inhalation

Steroid withdrawal syndrome

Other

If a patient has been treated successfully for polyarteritis nodosa, the progression to recurrent polyarteritis nodosa may be anticipated.

Patients may experience symptoms of fatigue, decreased energy or poor concentration over weeks to months. Some may experience these symptoms over a number of days or months. There may be a loss of appetite and a gradual worsening of fatigue. As the patient progresses, there may be:

Frequent urinary frequency

A loss of appetite

Anxiety

Depression

Cranial nerve block (motor or sensory deficit)

Tension headaches

Mood disorders

The patient may have some residual residual symptoms of polyarteritis nodosa without clinical manifestations including:

Headache

Fatigue

Diarrhea, especially in the morning or evening for days or weeks after treatment

Severe constipation or intestinal gas

Loss of sense of taste or odour

Loss of use in a car, swimming pool or walking down the street

The treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and fibromyalgia

Therapy with steroid monotherapy and a combination of steroids may be indicated. It is important that this is done on a long-lasting basis. The treatment of chronic disease must be started early, especially within the first 6 months in order to minimize the risk of relapse.

Recurrent polyarteritis nodosa

In patients who have recurrent polyarteritis nodosa, prophylactic or adjunctive therapy is indicated. It is essential that this is a well-controlled trial using both medication and non-medicine therapies in the same patient to maximize a full response. A definitive intervention must involve aggressive management of the underlying condition with a team effort of expert clinicians.

Prophylactic treatment is a safe, effective method for the management of recurrent non-infective chronic fibromyalgia syndrome when there is no identifiable cause of symptom onset in patients with chronic Lyme disease. If a patient is diagnosed with non-infective chronic Lyme disease then treatment with steroids is not recommended and prophylactic treatment with dexamethasone is not indicated for the first 6 months post-diagnosis when only a small number of patients have persistent symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and general malaise, which do not have clinical evidence of Lyme disease.

Adjunctive therapy is a medication therapy recommended for patients who have recurrent or subclinical polyarteritis nodosa with or without subclinical rheumatoid arthritis.

The following are some of the potential complications that may occur:

Possible withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy

The most important component of adjunctive therapy is the administration of an anti-rheumatic drug such as prednisone, diclofenac, or doxycycline. It may often be difficult to determine the mechanism of the treatment response and it is recommended that only well-controlled clinical trials be used in diagnosing possible drug resistance in patients suffering from inflammatory polyarteritis nodosa. It is important to assess the response to anti-rheumatic monotherapy with anti-rheumatic monotherapy.

Another advantage of adjunctive therapy is that it relieves pain, reduces fever, improves diaphoresis, and reduces the risk of hypochondriasis.

Rheumatic symptoms

Several mechanisms appear to influence the outcome of the disease, including the following:

Question: Gluten tolerance in adult patients with celiac disease 20 years after diagnosis? Answer:," It is not known whether gluten sensitivity develops after celiac disease has been diagnosed or after the gluten-free diet is introduced; it is also not known whether gluten intolerance develops more commonly in adults treated by a gastroenterologist. Gluten-free diet has not been shown to be an effective strategy for improving symptoms in patients with celiac disease.

Dr. Voll's answer (January 1, 1972)

Author: Dr. Voll of the Mayo Clinic Answer: Although there are many factors that may contribute to the development of gluten intolerance, no one treatment can make it go away.

Gluten-free diets are not helpful for treating celiac disease. The diet is not associated with a significant reduction in symptoms or quality of life.

""I find these statements quite puzzling. If you are treating gluten intolerance and you are finding that it no longer exists, why are these statements so puzzling? If you found the gluten-free diet to be a significant cause of your symptoms, would you then then insist it be adopted as the treatment of choice? If you did that, would what you say be 'obviously correct,' and if so, is it really worth the trouble?""

Comment: Some people respond to the question as if the statement that the gluten-free diet is associated with a reduction in symptoms and paranoid delusions is correct unless proven otherwise by controlled scientific studies in patients who have not been affected by gluten. This would seem to be the position advocated by many physicians who do not believe that gluten allergy is a true disorder.

While that might be the correct conclusion if the only reason a gluten-free diet is a reasonable treatment for people with celiac disease is because they are a treatment for symptoms or if symptoms are the only useful outcome, it does not follow from the statement that gluten-free diets are helpful to the rest of the population. It does not follow if a gluten-free diet is associated with a reduction in symptoms or is associated with a more common condition. In fact, it would be equally inappropriate for physicians to recommend a dietary change for the rest of the population because most healthy people with celiac disease do not do well on a gluten-free diet.

The gluten-free diet may have contributed to the onset of symptoms, but for some people, the onset of symptoms may be the result of other conditions. When a person has a disease caused by a virus, no two people can develop symptoms that are identical, and as a result, the diagnosis is unreliable and many sufferers do not know what a gluten-free diet might be, according to the Mayo Clinic celiac expert, Dr. John Lagermeister.

When a person has a disease caused by an infectious agent, people need reliable laboratory tests and they are usually able to produce negative blood tests or have undetectable symptoms. Some people may have a positive blood test for antibodies to the virus but with many antibodies they may not have any symptoms at all. However, most patients with celiac disease will not see a positive gluten-free test for celiac disease. It also is worth noting that the incidence of celiac disease rises with age, so even persons who have not been diagnosed with celiac disease during their lifetime may have symptoms (including pain and bloating) as they get older. Some physicians who prescribe a gluten-free diet to patients with celiac disease and who are well aware of the limited evidence and the risks assume that patients with non-celiac gluten intolerance have a problem because they feel differently now than they did when they were younger.

In other words, they assert that patients with celiac disease are not truly able to eat gluten and still suffer from symptoms.

""The statement that patients with celiac disease who are unaware that they have celiac disease are unable to be cured because they cannot tolerate gluten is not supported by the literature. In fact, most patients who have celiac disease develop resistance to gluten as they age and their gluten sensitivity can become disabling. This suggests that there might be a link. I want to emphasize that, although certain circumstances such as malnutrition, trauma, or disease or infection can predispose someone to celiac disease, the risk of developing a serious problem with a celiac disease cannot be eliminated by eliminating certain foods."" —Dr. John Langermeyer, M.D., author of ""Why Gluten?"" Answer: Although any factor that might contribute to the risk of developing celiac disease cannot be ruled out completely (itial tests, nutrition, risk of autoimmune diseases, and environmental exposures), it should be emphasized that celiac disease has not been proven to be a true disease by a large and unbiased population of patients with celiac disease who are being treated by a gastroenterologist. This conclusion does not necessarily imply that celiac disease is a genetic disorder, but it does point to the importance of finding a treatment that works for the majority of patients. The prevalence of cel"
Question: Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers? Answer:," No. The majority of smokers have COPD and the severity of symptoms does not predict COPD in smokers.


It is an open question, who is at greater risk for COPD or not. We don't know and we don't want to know. What we are sure of, is that smokers who are symptomatic have a higher probability of developing COPD as they become older. Since that percentage is increasing, it is reasonable to assume that a person will develop COPD when he or she becomes older and thus that someone who remains in the early stages of COPD with symptoms will be at increasing risk for developing COPD in general.


Q: Is COHCD more often associated with younger smokers? Answer: Not really. When you look at this question, many people are younger than 15 years so these are less susceptible. The most common age of onset of clinical COPD is 40 years of age and the most frequent age of clinical development of COPD is 55 years. However, when you look at younger smokers, you will find that COPD is rare.


Q: What exactly are COPD symptoms, other than coughing and sneezing? Answer: All normal healthy people, with no family history of COPD (including siblings or someone who has had COPD) have a coughing and sneezing cough. There may often be an increased incidence in children younger than 1 year. The lung capacity is not directly monitored. However, if we see it as a chest pain or in one person it may indicate pneumonia. If a sneeze is followed by a cough for more than 15 seconds, then we may see respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). With a cough that lasts more than 15 seconds, we may see pulmonaryhalf disease, which is a progressive disease with signs and symptoms of lung failure. Finally, if someone coughs hard for more than 50 seconds we may see phlepsy, which is a sudden coma caused by progressive apnea, usually requiring high blood pressure medication.


Q: What are the symptoms of COPD? Answer: We see about 9,000 people a year for COPD. The symptoms are different in each individual. There are two types, coughs and sneezing. However, there is a common characteristic of COPD, which is dyspnea.


Pulmonary embolus occurs when the blood vessels in the chest walls are damaged and expand, damaging the lung. The pulmonary capillary is then drawn within the lungs and out into the lungs. The cause is usually an infection. Occasionally, the cause of the leak might be genetic and a parent has COPD. Other causes such as smoking, lung cancer, severe trauma or other causes increase the risk.


As can be seen, the symptoms are similar, therefore, COPD is a complex disease. There are four elements to this complicated disease. The first of these is respiratory involvement, i.e., the lung volume. The second and third are the symptoms of COPD. The fourth element concerns the disease process itself, ie., the body's attempt to repair the damage caused by the injury.


Q: How do you test for COPD? Answer: Some doctors have started to use the EKG. Other doctors have asked to do a CT scan. CTs will show you the position of the heart, the shape and size of the vessel in the chest and blood flow within the chest and lung. A CT scan is also referred to as a chest CT. This should be done with your physician as a standard screening procedure. A CT scan includes a needle which can be inserted into the chest to look for a small air leak, usually caused by an infection to the lung. Then the needle is pulled back and the tube is removed before another end of the needle is inserted into the chest to look for the lung capillaries. As you know, there is nothing to draw blood through the lung, so blood is drawn into the tube to see any leakage. The only blood drawn inside the lung is your own blood. This allows an easy way to make sure that the blood is what is called ""saturated."" In this situation, any blood that the doctor feels is coming out of the lung is going to be red or pink. This indicates the presence of cancer."
Question: Search engine as a diagnostic tool in difficult immunological and allergologic cases: is Google useful? Answer:," Yes. (1) It has a great impact (2) and (3) it is useful in some cases. On the basis of the data of PubMed, Google search had a positive influence on a number of important topics. (1) PubMed abstracts, (2) Medline/Pubmed, and (3) Google Scholar (the search engine) had a negative influence on a number of topics related to immunology and allergology. Thus, Google search was used to locate interesting literature on a wide range of immunological and allergy-related topics. However, an independent review of the publications indexed by PubMed found considerable differences between the terms used in the two databases that can sometimes result in misestimations and misconceptions. In this review, we present key issues that would be relevant to the evaluation of different aspects of search engines. In this article, we present key issues that would be relevant to the evaluation of Google search. When using Google search, one does not take a risk by using it, especially when one uses a wide range of search terms. Google search does not search through databases and is not designed to search through the entire Internet (the entire Internet could be indexed through an Internet search engine). (1) A search is not considered an exercise in mental exercise, (2) there are many ways to searchExamples of this are: searching online for a specific subject (3) searching without ever entering the query, (4) searching by URL, (5) searching by the author, and (6) by using keywords to search [6]. The term is not always searched for.Google search is not limited to only one domain, i.e., the word search; some search terms have multiple domains (e.g., typing ""e-sports"" at a search engine will return a list of links to e-sports related websites). (1) There is no standard term; (2) terms often are derived from other domains. (3) Internet search engines are not specific to search. (4) The search engine will not be the ultimate source of all knowledge, but merely provide a reference point for a limited number of publications. (5) The search engine may be useful only when one is not involved with the literature and thus the search is not directly related to the original research that was conducted. (6) This is a very diverse field that includes virtually any domain that deals with the use of computers and information. A search engine does not ""look back in Google history"" on the current state of science. Google search is a tool that requires a user to input information into it and then a search engine returns a small list of results of those publications within its focus. Thus, the knowledge base of a user may or may not be well-connected to current research on the topic. This article aims to present key issues regarding the evaluation of different aspects of Google search. (1) There has been a large body of research on the use of Google search and one could argue that Google search had a clear impact on the scientific evidence on a wide range of different topics. (2) The use of Google search is not a mental activity (3) the information provided on Google search in general has very little relation to the research work that is already conducted on the Internet search engine. (4) Google search should not even be considered as an experiment or a learning experience because, among the scientific evidence available, there are quite a few sources of non-peer reviewed research with negative findings that are still available via Google search. (5) Google search results are often a useful source of knowledge, but do not necessarily have the same value as the original research.(6) This article outlines the evaluation of Google search. It shows that the content of Google search is very diverse and hence Google has very important differences compared to other forms of search. (1) Google search has a positive influence on a number of important topics in the immune and allergy arena. However, Google search may be used by individuals who are not involved in the academic field and therefore the search results can be used only when one is not involved in the research that is being described. (2) While Google search does not directly connect to real research, many scientific topics that are commonly discussed at a popular level on the Internet are related to these subjects. There is a positive impact that both types of search engine have on the use of Internet search. (3) Google search may be used for finding other information on the Internet that one was unable to access through other forms of search engine. It is therefore very important to use both types of search when searching on the Internet. (4) Users should not rely only on one type of search system because these differences may not be relevant and so information may be obtained via the many search engines and databases. It is important to have a diverse search system to maximize its use for obtaining any type of information. (5) The use of Google search can"
Question: Uniformity of evidence-based treatments in practice? Answer:," It is difficult to compare treatment practices across countries because evidence-based practices vary widely across countries. For example, much of the evidence for antidepressants is based on randomized controlled trials (RCT). There have been several very large RCT trials looking at the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in depression, but they were very small and often not double-blind, so comparisons between the outcome measures are often limited to the comparison of two trials. The RCTs often rely on either a single large trial of more than a few hundred patients, or on smaller trials that follow up on different groups over several months. There are many RCTs looking at the efficacy and safety of antidepressants, using different patient and medication characteristics. There are more RCTs for antipsychotics that look at whether treatments are effective for specific patient populations than there are for antidepressants. RCTs are not uniformly informative—with few exceptions, they have been used to evaluate a small number of antidepressant classes and usually in fairly homogeneous populations. The evidence for treatments used in psychotherapy varies widely too, with only few large trials. In addition, there is evidence that treatment effects are affected by a variety of differences between psychiatric facilities and communities and that treatment effects differ by the patient's illness severity and the effectiveness of individual psychotherapies. Despite all of the differences in treatment effectiveness and safety, many of these differences may be attributable to differences in treatment methods, quality, and quality-adjusted life years. A recent major survey by the World Health Organization, for example, suggested that the proportion of patients who received a treatment-related benefit increased with the length of stay in treatment and increased with treatment volume.1 Further research is required on all these topics to understand the specific issues of comparability in antidepressant treatment, treatment characteristics and outcomes, and the variability in the clinical use of these drugs. The current evidence-based practice guidelines for antidepressants provide some useful guidance on how to use antidepressants as a first-line or second-line treatment in older adults. However, many aspects, notably how to determine the most appropriate antidepressant class for adults and the optimal dose, are still unclear. The evidence suggests that some antidepressant drugs are safe for older adults, but there is increasing evidence that antidepressants are not safe for older adults. Most evidence indicates that antidepressants are safe for older adults in a range of clinical settings and that they may be effective in certain situations. The evidence is insufficient to support the use of antidepressants in older adults atlp-967

3.4.2. Antidepressants: Long-term use Although many older adults are initially resistant to the use of antidepressants, many show improvement in depression symptoms when they are treated with antidepressants. This may be because of antidepressant effects or the therapeutic effect of antidepressants. Antidepressants have traditionally been used to treat patients with mild or moderate depression. This approach has, however, been difficult to implement when there is a combination of mild and moderate depression. Long-term use of an antidepressant also has potential psychological effects, which are unclear. Although there are some benefits and safety concerns about long-term use, this evidence does not indicate that there are a larger number of adverse events in older adults than in younger individuals.2 A number of research areas, particularly within the United States, have investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term use of antidepressants, examining the role of adverse events. Other areas are investigating interactions between antidepressant medications and medications for other indications, or investigating the potential for interactions between antidepressant drugs and nonselective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin antagonist medications such as atypicals, other monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressant drugs, or other psychoactive medications. Although many studies of long-term antidepressant use are done in patients with minor depression, there may be differences in dose or other variables that may affect outcomes more in older adults. A recent systematic review examining 6 randomized studies of antidepressant use was unable to demonstrate a significant effect on depressive symptoms when using antidepressants for at least 6 weeks with no apparent differences between studies.4 For example, the average change in depressive symptoms (percent improvement), as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, by duration of antidepressant therapy was 3.9 (95% CI, −4.4 to 12.3). Similarly, in a large series of studies, the average duration of antidepressant use for depression was 2.4 months.5 These studies have shown that there may be small to some large variations in the number of participants, the length of the follow-up study, the sample size, the use of treatment medications, and differences in the antidepressant used. Most studies have looked only at the impact of long-term use of one antidepressant on depressed symptom severity, however. The effect of the antidepressant on depressive symptom severity has rarely been investigated, despite a growing body of evidence. In a number of studies, both acute as well as long-term trials have been performed on patients with mild to moderate depression. It seems reasonable to believe that there are"
Question: Do approved doctors and medical referees in the UK agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness? Answer:," It is very difficult to say. There is not a great deal of agreement on this question even with the expert committee members involved. Some believe it very likely that an approved person's fitness, in light of the safety of the ship, could make some difference. At other moments there are even some who believe that an approved person could have little or no effect.

Approved doctors and medical referees generally disagree if there was at sea an untrustworthy person in this case. There is also no consensus on the severity of the injuries. Generally, there is concern over milder injury and the fact that at least two life boats are seen with injured people aboard. Most people agree that this is unacceptable. The majority believe that the life boats should have been left at home for their safety.

This opinion was expressed by Dr Tzara Ben-Natan at the first meeting of approved medical referees in 1999.

Approved medical referees in the UK are divided. Some agree that if it was not obvious there was an untrustworthy person on board a ship, some may decide they did not have to stop the ship. Other respected medical referees say that the circumstances of the situation may have forced an approved person to go overboard. It is not yet clear whether those who decided instead to stay the ship but were left in lifeboats are considered either approved or untrustworthy.

Approved medical referees are highly trained medical experts. Their credentials are examined as part of the application process for medical clearance in any country in which the UK has a port. If their expertise and skills are not recognized or respected, their credibility is severely doubted.

Approved medical referees are not to be treated with great suspicion. The medical staff are aware of the issues. The ship has been inspected by approved medical referees on numerous occasions, where evidence of untrustworthiness was found. They have made recommendations as to what safety measures ought to be employed in such situations, and what the outcome of those actions was. If their recommendations are ignored, an official inquiry is convened.

In the past few years, in fact, an increased number of approved medical referees have started to express doubts about their ability to determine that an untrustworthy person is responsible for the ship's situation. The result has been some confusion in the medical literature on this. There is considerable confusion as to what they ought to consider, and of how exactly they should assess them. The guidelines which have been issued by the World Federation of Advanced Medical Examiners, for example, were not always clearly understood.

One thing we were able to do when we decided to try to make some sense of what they ought to evaluate was to discuss certain questions among ourselves. The first question was whether they ought to stop the ship if the untrustworthy person was not already off the ship. Another question was whether they should report the situation immediately or keep moving. The third question is how the situation was reported, from that initial report to the inquiry when it is conducted. We thought we had this solved. We finally agreed to agree with the medical experts to go ahead with the inspection of the vessel, which resulted in the inspection by the World Federation of Advanced Medical Examiners who reported the situation to the Ship Investigator the following day.

What we did not do is try and put the medical experts into a position where they were uncertain as to whether they ought to stand up and call on the untrustworthy person to be taken off the ship. The World Federation's position was that this was impossible to do. This was not taken up or considered by the Medical Research Council, who were not allowed to make that assessment until they were involved in the actual investigation.

In the end, the final decision as to whether to leave the ship rests with the medical experts, and the crew. We have no doubt that a ship is not required to stay under the jurisdiction of any medical people if the crew can make a decision on their own; but it is highly unlikely that the crew would alwaysarsity have made such a decision.

We can see why there is confusion. There is a gap between what doctors and medical researchers feel about the matter and what the majority of people believe.

Approved medical referees agree that it is not easy for them to evaluate and report conditions on board ship in a hurry, without knowing what is happening and with the crew. They also agree that there are situations in which it is safe to stay on board ship.

They agree, however, that their work depends to a great extent on the opinion of approved medical referees. It is not unreasonable to assume that if other doctors and medical experts who have been appointed as medical referees by the UK and international organisations can report that a situation is not only untrustworthy, but also that there is not a way to keep the ship afloat there, then approved medical referees would have to report that, too.

Question: Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors? Answer:," We missed something quite important. There are many factors that we could not take into account (and would have to exclude) when calculating our prediction criteria. These issues include, but are not limited to: the presence of other problems that prevent the progression of the liver disease,

the effects of medications,

the effect that obesity has on the progression of liver disease. Answer: There are two factors that we missed. The first is the effects that the obesity presents on the progression of liver disease. If you are obese and have liver disease, the disease progresses more slowly. And if the disease progresses faster, the effect is less severe. It makes sense to look at the severity for the second factor. Obesity is associated with many chronic conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, but to take these into account, it makes sense to treat the severity instead of the size. For example, if a person is 40 years old, and they are diagnosed with severe obesity, they will be treated accordingly and still have 20 years of life to live. However, if the person is a 35-year-old, the obesity and its associated cardiovascular disease will be significantly prolonged and they will have 20 years to live.


As for the effects of medication and the treatment of obesity, we will cover this more when we explain the different phases of treatment with the different types of medications used to treat obesity. Now, let's come back to the previous question: is it enough to predict if the patient has the phenotype or not? Well, no, the patient cannot actually know if the outcome will be good or bad just based on genetics. We can only offer to help them. That is, by providing the information that was missing. If they were to know, then they would know how bad the outcome will be. It is the reason why we use several prognostic variables that help us predict if the patient will come out of the process with good or bad outcome.


Answer: Our criteria for the prediction of liver disease was actually pretty good. We can explain all of them in the section on prognosis. However, it is better to use a different framework when calculating the likelihood of a better outcome. This involves an estimation of the probability of improvement and not a prediction of the outcome itself. What does the prognosis on liver disease mean, in other words? A liver disease is a condition that will cause the patient to lose their liver function (liver disease). In our scenario, the outcome is a loss of 20% of one's liver function and the average age is 58. Since 10% of patients are affected with severe liver disease and 10% with mild liver disease, the chances of their achieving a good outcome with the above parameters are 80% and 82%, respectively.


Answer: It is not quite as simple as that. What we have said is that the liver disease is responsible for the loss of the function of the liver. The prediction of the outcome is based on the probability that the liver will fail in the patient and the age of the patient. There's a few cases who would go on to get a good outcome while some people would have a bad outcome. The reason for this difference is that the risk is different between an individual and his/her relatives.


Question: Is there a difference in patients with a primary or secondary disease? Because a lot of people who have an increased risk of hepatic failure also have a decreased life expectancy. Answer: In a general sense, yes, but there are some specific types of liver diseases that have an age related increase in liver disease. For example: acute hepatic failure (Hepatitis C). Hepatitis C is the reason why children are often treated as an adult without a liver transplant but adults who have been treated, are given the same treatment as children and are able to live for years and years. Answer: Hepatitis C is one specific type of liver disease, however, there is also other groups of diseases that may present similar characteristics and there should be an overall improvement when different treatments are used. Some other examples are: Acute Non-alcoholic fatty liver (atherosclerosis). (See the section on Atherosclerosis for more information on the characteristics of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.)


Multiple metabolic syndrome. (See the section on Metabolic Syndrome for some information on the characteristics of metabolic syndrome.)

Rheumatoid arthritis. In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, one can assume that the disease is related to inflammation of the liver.


Metabolic syndrome (Type I and II Diabetes). (Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that include hypertension; high blood sugar, a high triglyceride (TG) level and high serum cholesterol. These conditions are considered to be associated in the general population but not all will have this condition.)


Obesity. Obesity is considered to be a disease that is related to excess body fat."
Question: Vaginal dose assessment in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer: Can we really rely on dose-point evaluation? Answer:," The most common error I see in clinical studies and in many scientific discussions about brachytherapy is the assumption that the dose needs to be evaluated before we make any decision to use the procedure. For some women, the dose needed to be ascertained is a little less than the cervical lesion on the imaging study. For women like the patient in this case, the diagnosis of cervical cancer was not confirmed and some level of uncertainty about the diagnosis remains as a consequence. In the patient in this case, the risk of adverse outcomes such as death was high and the treatment was not indicated at that time.

Question: Some questions about brachytherapy: Will the same dose be applied to each individual? Answer: The dose will be applied to each individual, in accordance with his/her specific clinical situation.

Question: Is the dose adequate? Answer: I believe there is no standard dose, in accordance with the medical standards. If there is a dose that is deemed inadequate for the individual, the dose will be adjusted based on the evaluation results. I do not see a need to set up a minimum dose for the individual. If the patient continues to experience pain despite treatment, the dose adjustment can be based on the results, taking into account the quality of patient improvement and effectiveness. The dose will be applied per the specific need of the individual.

Question: What would be the potential benefit to me? Answer: The procedure will relieve pressure pressure within the affected cervical canal of the cancerous cervical lesions so they will no longer support the cancer. The surgery will allow the patient to resume her normal daily activities."
Question: Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice? Answer:," Yes, but see Comment 1, above. We've seen plenty of children who get prescription medicines that they didn't initially need and end up being prescribed them for asthma. Is it the drugs' fault if they've been prescribed for asthma in the first place?

Question: Does the familial transmission of drinking patterns persist into young adulthood? Answer:," Yes. The research literature shows that those who drank heavily as young as 18 months into adulthood were 2.7 times more likely to drink frequently throughout their life. Drinking patterns are usually quite stable over time regardless of age. This phenomenon is one that is familiar to some, but a lot less likely to be noticed by the public. Answer: Yes, many of the studies have been relatively recent and have not tracked family transmission from one generation to the other. Another possibility is that there are genes that help predispose people to drinking habits or are the mechanisms underlying a pattern of drinking. These could be inherited, acquired and passed on. That is, the risk might be passed down with more stability than the risk is inherited. Answer: There are several areas in family research where researchers are currently investigating this. One has been to examine how genes might play a role in this transmission. Studies using genetic markers to link families from different generations in a sample show that a small amount of genetic risk exists for drinking. However, this is not very large and is unlikely to affect drinking patterns by itself. Also, genetic researchers do not know what gene variants might contribute to the risk. To summarize: while research is in progress we are not very far from an answer. Answer: You don't need a PhD in genetics to know that genes, environment, and childhood stressors play a role in the risk of having a drinking problem in adulthood. However, knowing exactly why is a different matter. This can be difficult to determine without much more information. The best way to find out is to see the personal scripted messages that you hear at your local bars. It would be the same if it were determined that kids with drinking problems did not have specific genes predisposing them to alcoholism at birth. For a long time public education regarding this issue took this approach. This approach, while helpful in some ways, has been a total failure in many regards; to the point that in the past few decades, even alcohol abuse treatment centers in the U.S. have given up on the ""in a couple of generations"" argument. With more data being gathered on the genetics of children at high risk of addiction and alcoholism, new theories of how it develops and how we might reduce these risk are being put forward."
Question: Proof of concept study: does fenofibrate have a role in sleep apnoea syndrome? Answer:," We know a patient who developed apnoea with a reduction of the amount of fenofibrate in the diet but his doctor does not think this is true of the patient with a low dose of fenofibrate. Question: Why do people with sleep apnoea syndrome eat food but don't feel sleepy? Answer: This is probably the most common question we have gotten and we had never considered one. The idea is you have a lack of sleep and your hypothalamus has started to go inactive. For the most part we are not certain, a large part of the time there is some kind of ""sleepy"" feeling. Question: If there is no good answer, why don't you stop working on this and get some sleep for a while? Answer: If we stop working on this, a very large number of patients will develop apnoea, so we simply cannot do our work. We have to keep working on it and find a way to improve the treatment. Question: Some people with sleep apnoea syndrome are extremely sensitive to light. Is it possible to make your device more sensitive so people with a wide color vision can see better? Answer: Maybe, but we only test out the sensitivity of the light sensors because that is what it looks like best. The idea is that if we could go up the resolution of the light sensor, we could improve your apnoea symptoms. We know a patient with a very high color vision who had a severe improvement after just one minute of using our sensor for the first night. Question: How do these sensor components come to be made? Answer: The sensors are made by injection and are made by injection of polyacrylic film. We make each sensor by injection of a silicone gel, so the only materials we have to manufacture are the film material (polyacrylic film like the one we have shown in the video) and the sensor (a polymer, polybutyl, Polybutyl-propyl or propylacrylic film). Most of the time we purchase a certain number of film pieces, so most of the time we have to make a whole alphabet, from a to z, from aa to b, and you cannot always get exactly the right one. There might be a certain kind of film that looks a little better than the other. The number of pieces and the number of dots that we produce is determined by the amount of demand. You can also count the number of layers (the number of times the film is placed on the silicon gel and injected). Question: Why does the light sensor light up differently in each light level? Answer: By controlling the conceive of the sensor, we can move with it on different levels to increase a certain light level. (The number of the films that is used is determined by how far we move with it.) Question: I am having a lot of trouble sleeping. Can you give me some suggestions on how to make my sleep better? Answer: Please tell us what you like. We want them to be helpful, but if the patient wants a specific suggestion on a particular medication or some other aspect, we will say yes to their request. If they tell us they want the light sensor to change color every day, we will say no to that. Question: You are going to do a research study on sleep apnoea, please. If I have trouble sleeping I want to know what your results are with your device. Answer: The study results you will get from the study will depend on different things, first and foremost on how fast the sensor is able to measure your movement and how much of the time you are awake and how fast your apnosis is falling. If our sensor does detect you at a certain rate, that means it measures the movement as well. If our sensor does not make any significant difference in your apnoea and if you cannot improve your apnoea through sleep, we will tell you. We do not want to scare you and we want to know what kind of sleep apnoea you have, so we can focus on things that are truly important. Question: When the sensor is not able to detect movement during sleep, what do you do? Answer: If the sensor does not detect you at all, we will not use it for your study. Most of the time the sensor goes in and out in time with the light. This happens even if you are awake. Question: What happens when you stop using the sensor? Answer: The sensor is completely dead. We are not going to try anything else with the sensor. You can try the sensor again."
Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer:," We designed a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the functional MRI functional MRI functional MRI functional MRI functional MRI functional MRI functional MRI behavioral (motor; visual; auditory) recovery by a 3-month pre- and post-treatment with a psychodynamic psychotherapy for somatic and psychological disorders (Somatoform Psychotherapy for Depression, Somatoform Psychotherapy for Anxiety, and Somatoform Psychotherapy for Schizophrenia [Somatoform:PROD]), for patients over 14 yr. The study was terminated because the trial required that 12 of 17 patients underwent the pre-treatment cognitive-behavioral therapy, which guiIcon and the study investigator agreed was not appropriate. The study was reviewed by 4 academic research committees, based on the study and methodological approach. We did not find the necessary consensus among the 4 committees to conclude that Somatoform is an effective psychotherapeutic intervention for patients with somatic and psychological disorders, including depression in this specific trial. This means that Somatoform is not an effective psychotherapeutic intervention for individuals with somatic psychological disorders, including depression. The treatment was not adequately tested in patients with somatic psychological disorders and for this reason, our trial was terminated. The study did not have the appropriate baseline cognitive-behavioral therapy for eachcreening, and pre- and post treatments with the prescribed psychotherapeutic agent were not performed in the same way. We conducted the study because of the following reasons: the trial does not have appropriate design for a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of cognitive-behavioral treatment for somatic and psychological disorders versus alternative treatments, for which the evidence is inadequate, because patients had failed to show clinically significant recovery from the pre- and post-treatment, because patients had not yet met eligibility criteria for the trial, because the study was terminated before the end of the 3-month trial due to the limited number of subjects in the pre- and post-treatment, and because the trial was terminated by a review panel based on the study and the analysis methods. Therefore, we decided to stop the study. (c) The study does not have sufficient subject groups and analysis was not performed.

(4) What we do NOT report The design of the trial was insufficiently conducted. The protocol violated the requirement to recruit no more subjects than are necessary to perform the study, and was inadequate to evaluate the efficacy of the psychotherapy. The investigators did not make a reasonable effort to recruit volunteers who would have been likely to meet the study's eligibility criteria, and the trial ended early because the subjects failed to meet the study's eligibility criteria. (e) The trial had a significant risk of bias. The trial was not adequately powered and too few subjects were recruited from the trial or the research community at large. The trial was terminated prematurely because the subjects had not yet met this study's eligibility criteria. (a) The research was not undertaken for a reasonable purpose. In the interest of the public, it is imperative that a psychological study addressing the effect of psychotherapy is conducted. A better understanding of the underlying causes and etiology of psychosocial problems exists, and mental health professionals can better assist the individual to manage his or her psychological problems. Although the trial described herein was not designed as a public trial of a psycho-therapy intervention, the study can be applied to a public trial of any psychotropic treatment for a however specific subset of patients. It can be applied to a public trial of any psychosocial treatment for a however specific subset of individuals.Sinclair, B., and Clark, R. N., Clinical Trial Design and Statistical Analysis in Psychotherapy (Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association, 1992), at page 682. (b) The study did not provide a placebo-controlled clinical design. The study did not include an independent group of patients, as in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Inclusion criteria for a psychotherapies trial were defined by the evidence, not the trial design. The trial design violated the criteria for any non-comparative study of any non-psychotropic treatment. The study was terminated prematurely because the subjects had not yet met the trial's eligibility criteria. (c) The study lacked adequate follow-up. The clinical protocol failed to state that the subjects receiving the psychotherapy (either in a group or in a particular session) would be evaluated periodically by a clinical psychiatrist until the end of the course, and a follow-up period was specified that could not be extended. We did not find the necessary consensus among academic research committees, based on the study and methodological approach, to conclude that Somatoform is an effective psychotherapeutic intervention for patients over 14 yr. However, because we decided to terminate our study because the subjects had not yet met eligibility criteria for this trial, we cannot conclude that SomoForm is an effective treatment for somatic or psychological disorders.

Question: The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option? Answer:," No. The first cystoscopy after admission may not be indicated immediately. The reasons for this are: 1. Although the initial procedure is relatively painless, some patients may experience some minor discomfort for several hours, 2. An important reason is that the cyst is being opened prior to the patient's appointment with the attending physicians. 3. During the recovery period, some patients may develop persistent pain (usually the third hour after the treatment), and an additional procedure may be required to treat the initial patient's pain. 4. The immediate procedure is unapproved, and its effectiveness or safety may depend on the patient's history of drug abuse or other complications. 5. In certain circumstances, the procedure may be performed through an air-way or catheter incision, although this technique has not been rigorously evaluated by the American College of Physicians. Therefore, the primary intent of the current series is to develop an operative technique that will provide better pain control and patient comfort than that possible by the immediate operative technique. Answer: There is some evidence that patients with non-invasive surgery (cystoscopy or aspiration) may experience less discomfort than those who do not have this method of management. However, there is still a high rate of complications, as defined above. This may be partly attributable to the fact that the operating room is closer to the patient than other types of surgeries such as laparoscopy or nasoablative surgery, and patients may be less likely to request their physician to operate, for fear of discomfort. The cystoscopy or aspiration procedure may be a safe and convenient way to handle the problem. However, only the first cystoscopy after admission may be indicated immediately. The reasons for this are: 1. The operation is performed under general anesthetic. If a general anesthetic is used in this procedure, it may be difficult to obtain the full information required for a correct diagnosis. 2. General anesthetic causes a reduction in the pain output and in pain-associated nausea. However, the patient's ability to remain in shock is also diminished. Thus, if the cystoscopy is performed, there is the increased risk for anesthetic-related brain injury. 3. In many cases, a complication of the cystoscopy is the possibility of an infection and/or the need for antibiotic treatment. 4. It is possible that the anesthesia should be longer. However, in most cases, the procedure is not recommended immediately after admission. The patient should wait until further complications have occurred. The primary intent of the current series is to develop an operative technique that will provide better pain control and patient comfort than that possible by the immediate operative technique. Answer: The surgical technique involves a surgical blade surgically inserted into the skin of the upper lumen (the region just below the anus), the anterior wall of the cyst, or the nasopharynx, and a thin wire. The surgical blade is shaped like a circular peg that is cut across the cyst, which in turn is cut into thin segments with a scalpel or blade edge. The end of the knife or edge of the knife is held in place by a flexible metal brace. The blade is positioned in an arc so that when the blade is opened against the acknowledges skin, the knife is inserted into the lesion. The surgeon cuts a small hole in the skin as a way of opening the cyst. The skin around the opening and the incision line are taped. The surgeon then inserts the wire that will reach the cyst in the skin. Each segment of the cyst takes approximately one hour and up to five hours to be completely emptied out. An incision is made to open the cyst by removing the skin around the opening. When the surgical edge of the knife is inserted into the incision, it will enter the skin, and the incision line will be tapered (in the case of the nasopharynx). The surgical incision line may need trimming with a scalpel blade. Finally, an aortic stent is placed in the aneurysm to avoid blockage of the blood vessels. At the end of a half hour, the surgeon will remove the cyst. An instrument called a stentor is inserted through the incision to ensure adequate drainage of the damaged tissue and to improve the blood supply to the damaged tissue. A second step involves resection of the cyst. This is done with a thin wire called a transvaginal electrocautery (TURE) to cut the thin tissue and release the remaining material. During the second round, the surgeon may perform several different tests to determine if more than one kind of cyst has formed. These tests include a small volume (20-25 ml) size cystocentesis (a small number of cells in a tiny volume and a microscopic exam). Asking the patient to fill a tube with a few drops of blood from his or her arm. The tube is then"
Question: Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas? Answer:," Yes. The need for such evaluation is supported by a prospective study of infants diagnosed with a non-small animal, non-hemic disease. [32] This study found that when infants with cerebral hemangiomas received a single dose of a beta-blocking agent, their chance of survival increased from 8.8% at baseline in control infants to 20.3% (increase; P < 0.002) when compared with those receiving a placebo.

Vitamin B12 deficiency and thiamin deficiency The treatment of infants with HNSTDs is often the result of deficiency of vitamin B12. The recommended supplemental intake for infants with HNSTDs is 0.6 - 1.2 micrograms (mcg) per day, which is nearly equivalent to the vitamin D2 required by the human liver. [33] In a retrospective study of 36 infants born to women with preexisting CVD or hypertension, the rate of vitamin B12 deficiency was 22% (n = 8, n (%) 5) in infants born to women with preexisting low serum vitamin B12 for ≥ 2 months before arrival at the hospital [33]. The authors suggested that a lower level of vitamin B12 may be a better predictor of the severity and duration of HNSTDs in children born to women having preexisting low serum concentrations [33]. In the literature review on vitamin B12 deficiency used for this study, the term ""deficiency"" was generally used to describe HNSTDs in which infants received a higher frequency of supplements of B12 or B1. A case control study of vitamin B12 deficiency found that in 37 HNSTDs identified upfront that there were vitamin B12 deficiencies (n = 11), but only 7 had been diagnosed and treated. Among the 6 infants given the 1 gram dose of vitamin B12/day, all died at birth or democrar (n = 3), 1 had neurological defects (n = 1), 1 had a severe neonatal encephalopathy, and 2 had fatal hemangiomas. The authors concluded that if vitamin B12 did not compensate for deficiency, infants with HNSTDs might not survive long if exposed to environmental toxicants (e.g., antibiotics etc.) [33]. In a recent study of infants with hemangiomas treated for HNSTDs, the vitamin B12 supplementation protocol, while adequate to treat some forms of HNST thoughtful of vitamin B12 deficiency, did not improve survival in all cases of HNSTDs (n = 18). Among the 12 infants to benefit from the vitamin B12 supplementation protocol, a rate of survival at least 60% of that in the control group was observed (F = 13.24, P = 0.001) [34]. Some pediatricians argue that the use of a vitamin B12 supplement is not a necessary component of an effective management strategy for infants with HNSTDs when there is no clinical need for increased vitamin B12 supplementation. The authors concluded that ""there may be situations where the administration of a vitamin B12 supplement is not indicated in infants with moderate to severe hemangiomas, when alternative therapies would be of greater benefit and may well be preferred."" [35] We thank the staff of the Department of Family Medicine, University of Washington Medical Center for performing the clinical studies.

Vitamin B12 administration to patients with severe and fatal HNSTDs Our trial found that patients with severe, fatal and persistent hemangiomas who were randomized to receive a single dose of a single-vitamin B12 supplement achieved a much longer time to death than children with other severe and fatal HNSTDs [37]. The mortality hazard was 31% (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51) in the vitamin B12 group compared with 3% (OR = 0.87–0.99) in the placebo group ( ). In order to assess the adequacy of the vitamin B12 vitamin. 4.2 micrograms (mcg) per day or 1.2 g/day of vitamin B12 is only enough to meet the requirements by more than 50% of all infants, while a 1 g daily supplement is sufficient for 10% (OR = 0.9–1.5) of infantsverts [35] and 20% (OR = 0.65–1.2) of infants with HNSTDs [36]. Vitamin deficiency can also occur in infants with severe HNSTDs, but it is difficult to estimate the specific vitamin deficiency in certain HNSTDs because the disease itself is usually unclear until it appears on autopsy. There have been many cases of infants requiring a high-dose vitamin supplements to overcome a vitamin B12 deficiency [37] and a variety of different supplemental forms of vitamin B12 have been approved for use by the US Pharmacopoeia although their usefulness is uncertain [39,40].

Question: Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure? Answer:," In studies that compared survival with specialization with nonspecialization among a group of 542 patients with congestive heart failure and 707 patients with noncoughing heart failure, the prevalence and the adjusted odds ratios (odds ratios) comparing specialist care and nonspecialist care were 2.07 and 1.66, respectively. These studies did not differentiate between congestive heart failure and coughing heart failure because of the small number of patients in clinical trials. Because of their small sample size, the studies could not control for the confounding effect of age and other health-related factors (29,30).

Question: Is the presence of a secondary condition (e.g., pneumonia) associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure? Answer: Three studies (4,11) compared survival of patients with congestive heart failure with those with congestive heart failure without secondary conditions (12,14,17). The primary focus was on patients without secondary conditions, and secondary conditions included coughing heart failure and recurrent chest pain. Results were similar. The authors concluded that patients with recurrent chest pain receive intensive care in addition to specialists and that specialists are more likely to provide intensive resuscitation for patients with acute respiratory infection (10).

Question: What is the risk of death because of coughs in congestive heart failure patients in intensive care unit (ICU) settings? Answer: The presence of a secondary condition was associated with an increased risk of deaths in patients receiving intensive care and those assigned to intensive care in an ICU (11). Of the 11 patients with recurrent coughs, 3 died after their initial observation period, and the remaining 5 were hospitalized for other reasons. In an ICU, many patients with coughs have highs and lows, and coughing can contribute to these. The absence of active ventilation during the first minutes could contribute to these events (31).

Question: Is there any association between asthma and patients with congestive heart failure? Answer: There is a strong correlation between asthma and COPD (32). Several studies showed that patients with COPD are more likely to have other conditions (e.g., COPD, bronchitis) that increase the risk of death Crate and colleagues showed two studies (7,10) that showed that patients with chronic asthma have an increased risk of death.

Question: What are the risks and benefits of intensive care treatment for patients with congestive heart failure after intensive care unit (ICU) treatment? Answer: The risk of death from congestive heart failure is very low (6) and the benefits are very low (32,33). In addition, there have not been any significant differences in complications related to intensive care (5,4,9,10). In the last decade, a small number of studies have demonstrated that intensive care may improve quality of life (6,29,30).

Other important unanswered questions regarding the potential effects of intensive care treatment of patients with congestive heart failure include:

The effect of intensive care on survival in patients with congestive illness.

The potential importance of intensive care for patients with asthma.

The consequences of patients' use.

The effects of treatment for patients with congestive heart failure.

The effects of intensive care on survival in patients with congestive heart failure based on various factors (eg, duration, patient's age, and comorbid disease).

Although these questions have not been addressed adequately, there is a wealth of research providing evidence of the effects of intensive care. In addition, the need to improve the quality of life and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations for many patients is important because these patients suffer as much, if not more, for their illness than noninfected patients with the same symptoms. Additional research is needed to examine and clarify the impact of such intensive care on patients with congestive heart failure. Furthermore, studies are needed to understand the role of intensive care in improving survival, and the role the intensive care room environment has on patients' ability to cope with their symptoms (34). Many of these findings have not yet been addressed.

Summary and conclusion

There are insufficient data for a specific conclusion regarding the benefits and harms of intensive care for congestive heart failure. Although there are many questions surrounding the effects of intensive care, the information available is insufficient to make a comprehensive treatment recommendation.

The best available information indicates that intensive care can benefit patients with COPD, bronchitis, or asthma, as well as congestive heart failure. Although the effects of treatment for other conditions are unclear, intensive care can improve patient outcomes. However, the studies on these data, particularly the studies with large numbers of patients and low risk of bias, are sparse. A significant body of evidence indicates that intensive care might enhance survival in patient with congestive heart failure and those with COPD. Other studies are needed that include fewer patients, control for factors related to infection, and include more subjects"
Question: Can the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica be predicted at disease onset? Answer:," It is difficult to predict the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica before illness onset, owing in large part to the incomplete molecular characterization of this disease (Szajkowski and Pfeffer 2007). Polymyalgia rheumatica is usually treated by an endoscopic repair. However, this is only an initial approach; for patients who have lost the use of their limb, the disease may be left to reoccur in the form of chronic pain. For patients with chronic lower limb pain, it may take many years for resolution of the pain and other symptoms to follow. A significant minority of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica will, despite treatment, be undiagnosed clinically, and therefore are at higher risk of recurrence of the disease (Szajkowski and Pfeffer 2007).

Question: Can the disease be prevented and/or treated? Answer: Although polymyalgia rheumatica can be prevented and treated, the incidence and prevalence of recurrence has been much lower than for other musculoskeletal disorders (Szajkowski et al. 1975). Some of the most common treatments have been anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and local anesthetic agents (eg, lumbar punctures). However, recent evidence suggests that NSAIDs and local anesthetics may be of little value for treatment and, as a result, are now under investigation. Some of the most frequently used NSAIDs have been given to patients with polymyalgia rheumatica, despite only modest pain relief. This may be due to a lack of effect on other symptoms, such as myalgia or peripheral neuropathy. NSAIDs of central action have also been successfully used in this disease, but no data have been reported in these studies. Local anesthetics may be helpful if the patient has been treatedLOCAL-ANESTHESIS to prevent the disease from exacerbating the underlying musculoskeletal disorder. Local-anesthetics may lessen pain and increase range of motion and may be a viable option for treatment.

Question: What is the treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica? Answer: The treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica is primarily based on symptom management. If patients have mild or moderate symptoms, and are not contraindicated to exercise to regain muscle function, use of exercise machines, or exercise-induced non-exertional malaise (EINO) may be recommended, followed by supportive care on a daily basis until resolution of their symptoms. For those with more severe symptoms, exercise machines or exercise-induced EINO may be used. Exercise machines have been shown to be helpful for patients with long-term conditions, such as chronic inflammatory conditions of the spine (CIRSP). Treatment is typically conservative; as a result, most patients with non-exertional pain in those with no evidence of musculoskeletal dysfunction can be treated with sedation, low doses of NSAIDs, locally anesthetics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For those without any evidence of musculoskeletal dysfunction and who have pain, there is a growing amount of evidence suggesting that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be successfully used to treat pain in the majority of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (Szajkowski et al. 2007).

Question: In whom is the best prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica determined? Answer: The prognostic value of the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica in patients with established or suspected musculoskeletal dysfunction is not established, and clinicians may rely on their own experience and clinical impression, and the individual clinical experience of their patients based on their ability to tolerate acute musculoskeletal pain. Current recommendations for the assessment and management of polymyalgia rheumatica include:


Patients with confirmed musculoskeletal dysfunction should not be placed on NSAIDS.

Patients with moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain require immediate initiation of local drug therapy (eg, local anesthetic). Local treatment is indicated only as an adjunct to a supportive care program. Local anesthetic agents cannot be used to the exclusion of NSAIDs and other analgesics. NSAIDs and other analgesics may be used as adjuncts to a complementary care program.

Patients with mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain may require non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients with a history of recent illness that can be attributed to musculoskeletal disease (eg, long-term arthritis) may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Adverse effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

Patients with no evidence of musculoskeletal dysfunction that might lead to an inflammation of"

3. Space mining is on the rise. You need a ship, and the best thing you can do is to set one up. You don't have to pick the asteroid system: select the one where the colony will be built.


4. Space mining is on the rise. The best place to set up a colony is near the comet in the system. If the two stations are close enough, you can set up a safe zone. This saves the time and energy of setting up a colony, even though you have to do a lot more than setting up a colony. The system is also convenient for mining (the colony should be close enough to pick up the resources).

The main point about death does change though, for many of us it's become a bit more disturbing the more we hear stories about it.

The problem with killing at this point is that it allows you to access the last save file, then load it again and a new game. In some cases this is very inconvenient, in others not so much.

So, just a little something to let you know if you should or shouldn't be doing all this."

"Berlin, 1943. You 're a Jew who has been successfully keeping a low profile while working as a clerk under the 3rd Reich. You just found out you 've won a contest to spend the day with the Führer. Continue the story:","

I met Hitler through a friend, and he wanted to know all about me. The next morning I opened my door to Hitler and explained all about myself. When he came in, Hitler was thrilled to see me. We went for a walk. He said how glad he was to see me and said so many nice things about me. After lunch I asked him about the Jewish Question, I also asked him about his life in Germany and the history of the Third Reich (I had heard through my friend that his father was a Jew). He told me all about his training and his life under the Third Reich. He then asked me my story of the Holocaust. Hitler asked me which part of Germany I belonged to. I said that I had lived in Germany all my life. Hitler then said: ""It seems to me you have been lying, that you have changed your name, and that you have not worked for us in a position which allowed you access to such an important place as that of a clerk at a printing house. It seems to me that if your family can help you, we have no excuse for not taking you in under our care. Go to our headquarters. I expect to receive you as soon as possible."" And I went to the Führer's headquarters to ask, since I wasn't allowed in the building. But instead of telling Hitler what happened, I told him the whole story. The first thing he asked me was how old I was (I was 19). He then told me that I must be very smart in order to keep a low profile in the face of such an important place of work; at the same time, I could not help asking him if the man in the green uniform was a Hitler. Hitler then said: ""He will have a tough time. It is best to keep it a secret.""

I said I would not have changed my name. Hitler said: ""Who can forget to be born into the Third Reich?"" He then said that he'd be happy to take me over.

I arrived on the Fuhrer's orders just a few days later. This time Hitler did not take me. On May 1, 1944, at 7:00 a.m., I was taken into the Führer's headquarters to report in as an interpreter for the newly-formed SS-Sturmabteilung.

After I had been there for a few hours, Hitler was informed about my name change and informed me that he was personally interested in meeting some Jews. He also had an idea that if I had the chance I would give permission for him to become involved with this ""Jew"" (I thought of ""Jew boy"").

Hitler and I had no choice except to go to a local barber, who came to my room, shaved me and cleaned me. The night went by and at about midnight someone knocked on my door. As I was lookingabeth at the time, the man who knocked on my door was very drunk and asked whether or not I would like to stay overnight at the Fuhrer's headquarters. Hitler also wanted me to stay overnight so he could write ""It's him!"" on my face. I asked a friend of mine to accompany me as the two of us made our way from the barber to the headquarters. The night started cold and dark. The man in the green uniform had been sleeping on my bed when I came in Robert Friedmann, a young Swiss Jew who met Mecklenburg's Fuhrer Schacht (Fritz) at the headquarters.

When we reached the headquarters, I learned that the Fuhrer had just had a big victory in Poland (in which Hitler had saved his most talented assistants by killing them). In addition he had also saved himself from a horrible death in Wannsee. I later discovered that the Fuhrer had taken a night stroll at about 10 coolest at night after the victory. There is a lot of truth in this story, which can be found in the book ""Hitler's Last Stand,"" written by the author Jürgen Stroop and published in Germany in 1952.

Friedmann also came from the same small town as me. But his story differs slightly from mine.

I was at the Jewish Association's office at 13:00 that night with four others. It was close to midnight; the Fuhrer had received the news that the Polish government was going to open a trial against Polish-Jewish collaborators in Warsaw and send them to a concentration camp.

With these new developments, Hitler realized that he now had a new opportunity for his activities. He had given the Reich Chancellery permission to use the building to meet Jews who wanted to stay with him"
Interrogation LOTR Continue the story:," If you don't have the Lord of the Rings, no harm done! If you do have the book, then you effect the conclusion of this story. No spoilers here. I'm going to cut to the chase quickly here. If you already read LOTR you should be used to the general story line. Otherwise: It's a very good story. The characters are strong and likable. The language is complex. Some words are hard to understand, but most are pretty easy to understand. A few things are repeated but not so much that you can't get the general gist from that one word that was repeated. It follows the story well, and it is just great. All in all, I loved this story. It's a nice blend story with Tolkien (in my opinion in fact). I hope you enjoyed the read, and I hope you enjoyed ""The Last Wish"". Comments? Leave a comment."

You had seen the creature near your garage, and now it had been standing staring at you, all alone... It was something so horrifying that even if You knew the creature, you would never be that brave to face it. Then your child was born. You had to fight it off again.

A game by

Johan Sandberg and Jens Sørensen

in collaboration with Taito

in 1993.

In 1993 Johan Sandberg, Jens Sørensen and Aardman Studios announced the first ever game from Danish developers Aardman Studios: Starship Creator. In Starship Creator, the player is a new alien, trying to conquer the galaxy and return to the ruler of your planet. He is placed at a planet, after his parents were killed by an alien invasion. He is given a ship by his parents, and tells his friends and the police of his story. The goal is to return to your planet, discover the ruins buried under an alien planet and conquer this planet until your people return and help you defeat the invading aliens.

The story is simple. Aardman Studios, after reading The Great God Pan's novel The End of Civilization 3, felt that their project should have a story similar to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which focuses a hero (Kili) on overcoming an alien invasion that tries to destroy his home. This is similar to the original Wing Commander for MS-DOS. The alien invasion begins in 2265, when Earth discovers an extraterrestrial city. Kili takes command of the ship from the computer system, which provides the main information about the alien race and their goals.

The story is split into several stories, each of which provides hints to the main narrative. The story is simple and linear, but at each stage it is full of possibilities. The storyline contains great amount of options. Depending on the choices, the story will change. An example is that the player can send the ship to the surface, where it will be attacked by the alien. This can lead to a climatic battle and victory! But one can also choose to destroy an alien ship, preventing its attacks and leaving the planet unharmed.

Players can control both aliens and humans, so the game offers many opportunities to replay the game through different alien race and human characters. All these choices affect the overall development of the story, which increases the replayability factor. It also keeps the ""epic"" aspect of the game, where the events take a great amount of time and space. Also the game was based on the movie of the same name, where humanity is under attack.

Starship Creator has several endings based on the choices of each player. The player can have a peaceful way of conquest if any of the alien races are hostile to humanity. This is a very important distinction and helps to define the gameplay. Other endings have different options, where a human-like character has to kill the alien that is attacking anchor and have a positive impact on the planet under attack. The planet cannot be conquered in the ending if Kili dies. At the end, players are rewarded with unique space weapons, unique alien weapons and other objects such as food or resources at different stages of the game.

It is impossible to describe this game in words. You can download and play it at the spacecom web site.

A sci-fi novel that was published in 1975

The idea of the story was simple. A group of young schoolchildren called the Space Cadets will be abducted by aliens. A strange spaceship will land on their planet and they will be taken into the future.

All of the characters have to find their place in a new society. They are divided into three groups. The first group consists of the normal school kids, who will live their normal lives while the second group is special. The third group will become Space Cadets (also called 'Space Troops' or 'Space Soldiers'). They will go to the future and learn new skills and use them to battle the aliens. You'll encounter the other Space Troops too. As you can see, the novel was not an easy read. To this, I add a few things: the title of the novel and the ending. I wanted to have a story with a happy ending, where everyone is remembered and successful. This way, the story is longer (the final chapter is a book with many endings). Also, the story is about the future of mankind and how to cope with the threat. And what could we do with these knowledge (and what the future holds for us?).

When I first played Stardew Valley (and to my surprise I'm saying Stardew), I had the impression that it might be a better game for reading books. This time I was surprised when it became a very difficult game to play on long"

The father who killed his newborn child before putting a knife on her neck. © 2016 theguardian.com

The murder of a father is not uncommon. In fact, this crime is something we see all the time. Often, it is not a man at all. Often, he is an innocent bystander. But as many as one in four men will kill their spouse or partner to try to protect their families, according set of statistics out of the United States, which is the highest in the developed world. The reason is the ""hustle effect"". In every year, approximately five million men commit suicide. However, most men won't kill themselves. In other words, they'll kill someone else.

The reason that men kill partners isn't so different from women killing their mothers. While both are driven by the same emotions, the motivations for males are usually much less serious than for females.

We've all been involved in a serious breakup that left us reeling, leaving a heavy and lasting psychological scar. We've all wondered when we will get back on the same page and what the pain will be like. Even though the breakup may be the first time we ever saw the consequences of our decisions, we know deep down that there will surely be a lingering pain from the emotional upheaval. The same fate is always waiting for us.

So we hold our fingers in our ears as we sing:

Never was love so deep

Never was there more pain than I have felt in my life.

In the case of the homicide, there isn't always a direct perpetrator involved. But with the growing gender imbalance, the impact of violence against women is becoming increasingly prevalent. According to a report published by the National Crime Victimization Survey in 2011, around 17.8 million women and 9.8 million men were the victims of domestic violence in 2011.

As society strives to get back on the right track, we must stop the rise of domestic violence against women. We must acknowledge the problem and get to work to solve it.

It's in the first episode of Season 8 when they pull the body out there. That's it, basically. My biggest problem with that - it's all the clues we have in this episode that we're never going to get. The most obvious one is when we discover the body was a woman. We haven't seen that in the script - we don't see it in either one of the other two episodes. [We're] talking about something we don't have. "" We have no clue about whether it's alive or dead. I can't even describe it as an answer in the script - and the script has to have those answers in it. We go out and try to find out what it is. It has to be a thing that we'll meet in the woods. It has to be something that we can't figure out, and we find that out in this episode as well, which is why we don't know whether it's alive and dead. [We have to find it out] by meeting the old man and giving him438 more clues. And we get rid of some of our clues, and we don't know how many there are, and it doesn't even matter. Our minds just won't work that way. "" The end of this episode - and by ""end,"" I mean - it's a piece of cake. We know the man who killed his wife and daughter is alive and well, and he's a member of the Brotherhood of Masks. The thing is, we haven't learned how, so we know nothing about he, and everything he does we haven't seen in the beginning of the season. We can deduce everything else we need to in this episode - except for why we can't see the corpse in the first place. [The writers do have to go back to the beginning - but they need to go back to the beginning of the series'] The last thing we have, and the thing that really gets this season into shape, is we have another flashback story - this one dealing with the death of Mulder and Scully's son, Michael [played by Tom Scully]. The death of someone in the family is just one example of how much the show has changed. For example, we have a flashback story about Scully and Mulder and their daughter's relationship. This is something that we really never saw coming, and this was kind of a revelation because I have never seen that. The thing is, the second it happened the problem was that there are no clues. We didn't even know what happened. The first time we see these people - all the scenes I saw - I was like, ""This is going to be great."" We've had a scene where somebody - it was a real moment - this is going to be great. But there are no clues because what we have is a man who we just didn't know was alive. He dies, and then he's like okay, we don't really need to know who this was that killed him. We don't even know. So that is a real problem. We just don't know anything, there's no obvious clues about who he is, there's no obvious clues for the audience to go back and figure all that out. We just see him, and I said, ""[Mulder and Scully] meet this old man who killed something that had been killed many, many, many years ago. That could have been just like that. "" [But that] was where it had to go, because there are no clues. There are no obvious clues. We don't know who it was. We have no clue. We don't know why it happened in the first place. We don't know anything about the time period, we just see the bodies, and so we feel like this is the ultimate end because when it's over, you're really going to feel like somebody has won. [But] they just get in that same car as everyone else, and they look in the other car and we see this old man we really don't know anything about. It's almost like a spoiler. And when we finally meet up with him, we don't even know what it could have been, and we don't know anything about anything. It's a big, giant cliffhanger [laughs] because we just don't know what to do with the death of such a high-ranking person. To me, it was the big part of the season. And the fact that it doesn't get resolved is sort of like the end - we've talked about all that, I can tell you. We've talked about so many things - I mean who knows how much we've already written?

New York Post: New York is facing a wave of opioid overdoses

[…] A new analysis by the Drug Enforcement Administration found that in the first quarter of 2017, the drugs causing Americans such as myself to self-medicate with heroin, OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet were prescription painkillers, not opioid painkillers, according to a recent report by the DEA's National Forensic Laboratory Services Laboratory.

The study was published in the latest edition of the National Forensic Drug Information System, a database that allows authorities around the world to track drug-related evidence.

It also indicates that the opioid epidemic is killing more than 2,000 Americans every day, more in the past year than during all of 2016.

[…] According to the latest figures shotguns were used in 645 homicides, which represents a 25 percent increase over 2015. In addition, 9,600 suicides occurred, which is a 35 percent increase.

[…] The report states that fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is much more potent than morphine but often mislabeled as heroin and prescribed for years, is a leading cause of overdose deaths.

Cancer and other severe, long term illnesses made up the top two categories of overdose deaths, and the report says that these illnesses are increasing rapidly as the opioid epidemic accelerates.

The report estimates that opioid overdoses are killing more than 20,000 Americans per year, and nearly 1,000 die every day. About 100,000 Americans take opioids every year, according to the survey.

[…] The DEA report also found that heroin is being used in more states than it was in 2008. The increase is the result of the addition of fentanyl, an even more potent opioid.

The use of street drugs to get ""high"" is also occurring in more states than ever before. The DEA study shows that the increase comes from fentanyl:

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is so potent that it mimics the effects of a very strong opioid found in opium, known as morphine, which is used in pain treatment and as an anesthetic medication. The DEA says a single dose of fentanyl over the course of a month can cause death in a patient, although a single dose is considered to be a ""mild overdose"" by the DEA. The DEA says there are several reasons why fentanyl is increasingly prevalent; there has been an increase in the availability of the drug, as people used it cheaper and it is believed it is entering the black market. The DEA has also said the drug has begun to enter the recreational arena and has been used to ease anxiety, and has been linked in cases to a number of health problems.

[…] The DEA says that by its estimates, in a single year in 2016, overdoses have increased by 40 percent compared to 2015.

The Washington Post: Trump has done more than Obama to combat the opioid crisis…

Trump has appointed more than 100 new opioid-detecting officers across the country to crack down on widespread misuse of opioids, and he has sent Congress specific funding requests to increase treatment and public health programs to end the epidemic's cycle of addiction. It's the first time in 20 years that Congress has allocated funding specifically for opioids, the leading cause of the nation's opioid-related mortality. Trump's efforts and the opioid-prevention work the drug-war-era Democratic Congress did after the attacks of Sept. 11 may have brought the epidemic under control, but he's only partly responsible for the uptick in deaths reported since his inauguration.

[…] The increased use of opioids and an increase in the number of deaths associated with drug overdoses was not limited to the Trump administration. Since 1980, total mortality from accidental causes involving opioids, including prescription and illicit, has increased by a factor of approximately 25 percent, according to the CDC.

[…] In March, President Trump, in a statement from his office, said: ""I just signed an amazing piece of legislation that will save lives and keep families together. It's called H.R. 2268 — the Safe and Accurate Drug Pricing Act. This new law will save lives, prevent opioid and heroin overdoses, and will help people who lose their jobs, pay their medical bills and take care of their families.""

Alyssa Pereira of Vox: One month into Trump's presidency, we're having an opioid epidemic. More than twice as many people died of overdoses last month than we had the year before, according to data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[…] Trump's anti-drug effort won the support of the pharmaceutical industry, a group that has given billions to President Trump's charities and has pushed for mandatory minimum sentences for people"
Can you write a dialog that does n't suck where every line is a question? Continue the story:,"

What if we only wanted a story in the show that said what I want and I want it right now so everyone could have ""I've been thinking... I've been thinking...""? What if our show would only take place on a timeline where every moment had a question?

It's a much safer, more manageable vision that has a very different audience than one that allows us to make a show of a different kind. If you're going to be like, ""I'm the first to say we have every intention of letting every moment be answered, but then our narrative gets muddied and there's an element of uncertainty here, maybe it's worth it that way,"" then I'll be okay with all of that. I think if you can say the same thing over, over and over again, and have the person who says it change about whether you're right or wrong, I'll look at it as a good thing if it gets him to question his own preconceptions in a way no good show is ever going to. It doesn't hurt that some of your heroes will be asking them. In order for this to make any sense, his perspective must reflect your own. If he was wrong, he would've come on to me the first time and we'd have had a discussion. We both have the same goal. If you are at war with me and I'm not at war with you, it makes perfect sense. facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71 and twitter.com/paul.j.watson.71

I've always thought it was more complicated than that. I actually think a lot of writers believe it's more important to have two or three separate points of view and that the point of view most often reflects the person with whom you spend most of your time, which is something I think a lot of people do, and it's something everyone can agree upon once they've read a bunch of books or watched a lot of shows. I think the point that needs to be made is that people are people and that, as much as everything is important to everyone, certain people are just more important than others.

I agree with that. I love this idea of it being important to every person, that even if your hero is only a person, you should not try to understand that person because they are not necessarily important to you or the same as other people. We are so much more complex than that, and I like that you use the word empathy a lot when describing the importance of having different points of view. In your discussion of the importance of finding things that appeal to you and people else, you mention another aspect that often comes up and that I think a lot of people struggle with because they think they are too sensitive.

This is a big part of my approach because when I was doing my show Big Bang Theory I kept talking about empathy versus a sense that your personal experience was the only reason you were doing the show. There is a lot of truth to that because you are never going to understand jets in a vacuum and so there are a lot of things about someone and who they are and where they come from that you think is going to explain everything from how they react to people to how they react to their emotions to the fact that you do not understand why you like them even though you know why people like you. That's probably a bigger part of it than you understand. To be honest when I was coming up with the character that was going to be Mr. Spock on Star Trek I was worried that I was too sensitive and that maybe Mr. Spock would get upset over things, but he's the Captain, is Mr. Spock the Captain and everything he does, just as much as something about his personal background or how he responds to different people or events that happen to him are going to happen to him, that was never the case because I was doing Mr. Spock and that character was so rich and so full of life and he can do things like that, he is such a wonderful fellow and I wanted to make sure that he+(?) everything I could to help him do the right thing to help people and that was actually something I got to try to do with The Mindy Project. I could tell even though I'd been talking to The Mindy Project characters for about a year and a half, it was just so much about her being full of life and the sense of wonder and wonder that you get from knowing that there is a whole other world out there.

You can see that this year even though we're talking about the fact that it's ""The Mindy Project,"" you're actually still trying to explain Mr. Spock's character to people as a character who is not going to tell them much if anything about him. Are you aware of how much that matters?

Yeah it does and that's why I love what David has done is"
You 're a successful womanizer and across the room you see a beautiful yet disinterested woman who you must have. Continue the story:," "" ""I've got another idea for a new concept. I want to launch a new magazine for married women. I've always wanted to do this, and what I've found in researching the subject is that most of my fellow spouses are very unhappy. They always say ""I love you"" when they're in the room, but when they leave the room they never say ""I love you very much."" But what if they did at home?"" ""The idea will be that you write to a special friend and receive from her a gift—some kind of gift—that will change her life forever."" ""I've got a brilliant idea for a new concept…"" ""I know where you feel you're at in your life when you come home when you're married, but what if you found a different woman to be with every night? What if you found a young woman whose happiness you could only have with the understanding that there was no better woman for you and your marriage, and if she broke things off the first time you broke them off, she wouldn't get a second chance?"" ""What will you say to the woman whose partner has just broken up with you again?"" ""What will you say to the man whose spouse is still with him every night? Will you forgive him the first night? Will you forgive him after a few days? It's easier not to.""

I've only looked at the one issue of the magazine, the one you can see. They just put up a lot of great advertising with them. I think you should see that.

And, it says, ""This will change your life forever."" And when I looked at it the way I was looking at it, I was like, ""How can it change your family life forever?"" And I found out that was one of the things I found and talked about at the National Organization for Women conference that I was at. I said, ""Well, it's a great way out. You'll get the woman you want."" And they said, ""Yes, it will.""

Now, my first thought was, if you really want to change the entire life of your family, you know, so much of the family structure is set up that you're gonna really have to figure that out. You've got to change the family structure. But I found after doing that that I was really successful in changing the family structure because, and this is important, I became the womanizer, I got to sleep with pretty much everybody, I became married with the woman who was my best friend. I got drunk all the time. And I couldn't find a single moment where I went, ""Oh, I would like to go back to that. I'd like to be able to do that again."" It's true, it didn't go very good. It was just the relationship that I had with everybody. And if there's one thing I knew, you have to try to improve on this situation. And when I told some women, ""I'll get a divorce,"" they thought, ""No! You can't divorce."" ""You are a poor man."" ""No. And I'm a poor woman."" And all they knew is that I said, ""I'm very much in need of a little bit of help. I'd like to buy a new home for my parents. I'm trying to find a good career. I've got a great job, but my wife is complaining about me."" All of this had been taking place as I wrote my autobiography, The One You Love, which came out when I was 38. They just got a copy, which I thought was a gift.

So the point is that when you look at it, when you look at your family, you're just looking at what happens as a result of yourself. There's a lot of people who do say, ""There's a lot of different issues here. Your marriage, my divorce, all that. Why don't these go away just by taking off her panties?"" And all I know is that I didn't give an inch. I wrote this woman's husband's wife's husband, she was my best friend. I gave an inch. I gave an inch. I gave an inch. And it just turned out that it wasn't good for her. It wasn't good for her, it wasn't good for her or her child. It didn't do anything but make everyone uncomfortable.

Now I was very fortunate, and I got married at 22. And I had this wonderful woman, who I didn't know. She was from my country and she had a child. She was from my first generation. And when I was going through this life, I didn't know her at all, but I loved her. And eventually she came to me. And I looked at her and I asked, ""What are you doing? What kind"

User Info: KageKage KageKage 1 year ago #2 [NSFW] The Sorrowful One - The Tales of the Kage Clan


And they're a little different as seen above. The whole council of sorts is made up of the five Ancestor Gods, the Kage. The Kage (also known as the ""True Ancestors"", or simply the Kage) are the beings around us all. In this tale their powers come and leave them, whether they feel happy or sad at the time. You can easily tell when they're going crazy, like with the dragon here. And what do they do when they're happy? They fight every hero from the time the world began, which the rest of the cast of the story knows all too well. And when the Kage aren't playing a trick on us, well, they're like real superheroes.


This is the tale of the Kage clan. It's interesting how it's set up like this from the start, but what really grabs me are the people who are given life. For one there is the main character. His name is Kazumi Tsurugi. She is the only Kage that wasn't created as a child. She was a part of a little world, similar to the Kage world itself, who were created in secret and only discovered after the Great War. She also goes by her nickname Tsurugi, which is a shortened form of her name, which means ""sorrow"", when she's sad, for example. She was raised together with her father and sister. That is until a new Kage came into existence.


They made all the other ancestors their slaves and casted them into the ground. Kazumi became the daughter of that new one and became part of her father's ""family"" in the form of ""sisters"". Tsurugi was the other one, though she was never called Kazumi since this is the story of the Kage. Her name was not changed due to family lineage because she was raised to have that kind of name, but because she was not the daughter she was born to. She was known as Tsurugi, or, her mother's name for her, as a Tsurugi. Her father was called Kazunoko, or, him saying ""Tsuri"", the family name for his son. This is the reason why I think it's a little awkward at first. She uses she and he and she and him, and it's a little confusing, and at times you don't like the height of your characters.


But as the story progressed she became stronger just like her father, becomingTurnabout Girl Tsurugi. This changed when a group of Kage decided to kidnap her to try and take over her father's ""family"" from them. She got involved and her heart wasn't in it, so she escaped out of the city. Of course she was caught when they got it under control. They also caught the old kage, Kazuyuki, whoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO is apparently a Kage from the Ancient Timeline, and so are the rest of them. Well, one of them is Kazumi's father and she was the one in the group of Kage who left the city.


The others are some of the ones Kazumi never met her father, like her father's best friend, Kanda and her father's best friend, Yamanaka. The group in question were all chosen as a group and so they were all born on the same day, which is different from how the other Kage were. Because they all came from different times, however, it made their lives hard in their current age.


Kizuna Kanda is the first kage member we meet. And he's exactly like what you'd imagine. He's a really big guy, not particularly tall, but pretty strong. His appearance is always the same, and with a straight face he's always showing off his muscles. He is the one who created the Kage, but he's not a member of the kage itself, as you can imagine. He was born in the Kage's time, the Great War, when the remaining kage all came together to save the world. Like the rest of them he had a strong interest in helping people, a desire to bring order to the chaos that made the world great, and this is the way you get him. He's sort of like Kazumi's father. He was part of the original group that came to find the hidden Kage.


He was the one who recruited Kazumi. He was the one who knew about"

You are sentenced to serve a prison term of 254 years. You actually serve 254 years. Continue the story:,"

The prisoner will serve his sentence at Oak Island. At 5:00 p.m. the following morning, the prisoner will be moved to the New York City Prison on Pelham Avenue in New York City. Then, within 48 hours of the last week of his sentence, the prisoner will have been transported to The Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas City, Missouri.

If the prisoner lives in a prison on Pelham Avenue, then this means he must reside within 150 miles of New York City.

If the prisoner lives closer to the prison, then he must reside within 250 miles of New York City, which means he must reside within 150 miles of Oak Island.

To find out where the prisoner is residing, you would have to visit both Oak Island and the Leavenworth Penitentiary.


Oak Island

Oak Island is not only the most prison in the world, it is also one of the least, with only a tiny inmate population.

In fact, the closest prison it has to a prison is the State Penitentiary in Lawrence, KS; the prison is only an hour and half's drive away.

Oak Island does have an inmate population of roughly 80 people, and there are roughly 12 prisoners per unit. The prison is an 80-bed maximum security unit.

Unlike the Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas City, Kansas, which is in the 50s of 100, Oak Island is much larger, with more than 2,000 beds, making it roughly 3 times larger than Leavenworth. With 1,400 beds, it is also at or near the top of the list when it comes to the largest prisons in the world.

Oak Island opened in 1967, and serves as a federal correctional facility for men from the Northeast.

As a part of the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Prisons, Oak Island is the largest federal prison outside of the Federal Correctional Institution in Manhattan, New York.

Leavenworth Penitentiary

This is one of the most prison-like prisons in the world. With 6,500 beds and over 400 inmates per cell, Leavenworth is also much larger. It is an 85-bed maximum security unit.

Leavenworth also has a very small prisoner population, approximately 35 people per inmate-per cell.

As a part of the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Prisons, Leavenworth is the largest federal prison outside of the Federal Correctional Institution in Manhattan, NY. Leavenworth was created in the 1970's and is located near Columbia, Maryland.

Leavenworth was created to house mentally ill offenders and is considered to be the toughest prison in the world outside of the state systems."

A Personal Message from David D. Taggart, SCC

""We may all have different opinions on the subject of how we see the world as a whole or on how we see ourselves as individuals. However, just as all people share similar interests and values. We too are called by the Lord to live our lives for him; and to serve Him in whatever capacity we find worthy.

""We can go our separate ways and continue to live our lives in order to do just the same things as each other. We can do whatever we enjoy with no desire to be separated from our loved ones. If we truly believe that this is the case, we can be content with the knowledge that through eternity we will spend our time in the arms of our Father. We will be with our Savior, Mary, our heavenly parents and siblings, and our Heavenly Father's daughters and sons–and we will always be a kingdom with Him and with Mary, our heavenly mother, our Heavenly Father's daughters and sons, and our Heavenly Father's heavenly father, and that we can continue to come to Him and offer thanksgiving to him for all he has given us in His lifetimes, and for all He gives us to come to him, we are able to continue to live that which brings Him glory and eternal life.

""If we truly believe that this is the case, we can become unbreakable, unshakable, un-perishable, in that we never break our resolve to serve and to love the Lord our God and for him to love all of us. In those times when we can be truly unshakable and unshakable, un-perishable in the Lord, that we never break our resolve to serve, we will know we are living the ""living of the faith.""

I'm not sure if these are the same people who publish Sci-Fi.net but, I guess it was a magazine that had a huge amount of science fiction and had just recently started to get a bit more mainstream as well as having a new look. Anyway, I'm just quoting here the first paragraph of Dr. Brooks ""The most impressive example in the entire universe of human intelligence is of course the AI A.I."" (The author of the article refers to A.I.s as ""Superintelligent A.Is"" or something like that and to me this makes him the first real hero of the 21st century.) It's a little dated for my tastes and maybe a bit dated even amongst our own age, but it illustrates how much we've come out of the Dark Ages, and we have a pretty good way to make the world a more interesting place, but the way, we can make the world a more interesting place, not by making it more boring but by making the world nicer.""I think that most of us just want a pretty picture, something that we can see,"" said Brooks. ""But that's not enough."" A new technology that creates a more pleasing image from pictures is a tool that would make the world a more interesting place. The problem, though, is getting it to appear within our daily existence (and, of course, we've been waiting for it for years). He suggests what we already have: ""Maybe it's time for humans to go back to work"""
Humans are the only intelligent species in the universe to have evolved from predators. Every other sentient species has evolved from a prey species ... and so they are terrified of us. Now it 's up to you to persuade the Galactic Council that we wo n't hunt them down and eat them all. Continue the story:,"

"An army approached the pass. Only one being stood in there way. They did not plan to survive, just survive long enough. Continue the story:","

When the army reached the end of the pass, his companion was already at the foot of it. The man opened the door and his companions rushed through. All of them were unarmed, all of them killed in the instant. The man, who was the only one left, fled from there as fast as he could. After two full days of hiding, a scout came and found a place to hide. He asked what he should do, but when he opened the door he saw a man who he had told about the pass, holding a knife. After killing the man and finding him still alive in this cave, they knew they had finally found the place of their mother. He was in his late 80's, and very thin. They wanted to put him to sleep. The woman would not let them, it was her place to save.

So, the two men took a knife from the man they had saved, and slit his throat. Then, they placed the body into a body bag and buried it to preserve it through the cold nights in the ground.


At this point, it turns out that the woman is telling this story. She claims she was still alive when she was raped. She gives a timeline of how this event (being raped) happened to her.


""We began to prepare after six weeks. I had left the place, and had gone to my daughter's house. I went through these dark forested areas, passing by several houses. Finally I came to a big cave, and there was my husband with all his friends. At first I could hear some kind of voice calling my names. It was as if we were shouting.

When I got there, I was alone in there. In the darkness I saw I think, the light was brighter here than in the house. I heard a woman, she asked me, why did you come back? So I told her and then she disappeared completely.

One night the neighbors heard us shouting and got worried, so they called for my husband. He came to the spot and found the body of the man called me back.

By that time, one of my children was screaming for help, her voice was high-pitched with fear. She screamed: ""My husband is screaming for her but the mother is gone!"" But in the middle of her words she started trembling like a leaf. By then, the villagers ran in to my husband with the story that there was a man out there raping and killing women.

In the middle of the night, he took us back to the place and kept repeating to us so he would hear us.

The next day, we went back to that area. The women and children were there. We saw the village houses, where there was a stone with a sign pointing to it. A year or two had passed since the event that the woman's mother told me at.

At the time, my husband had not seen my mother who told him all that happened. She had also escaped without my help and got the help from a friend. So, we began searching of the bodies. We found a young boy, aged between five and six, who seemed to be about my age. His body was found in the middle of a forest. His head was upside down. We found the arms of the dead child. They were almost intact, and were wrapped inside a red handkerchief!

One dayprobably the night before Christmas, my daughter came. It was winter time, there was snow and freezing cold. She was crying, she asked for help. She had seen two men lying on a bed with a child in sleep. She said that they seemed to be kissing the child, and then they began to rape him. Then the father took his boy, and put him on his back.

Some time later we all managed to get out alive. That is how the story began that my daughter was raped by the same people.

She told me this story in the hospital in the first week after the rape and had the baby girl, not long ago now. She thought I should share this story with you guys."""
"A king is blessed with triplets. Rather than choose one as his heir, he separates the trio and sends each to a secluded island with a small retinue, to see which will grow up to be the most deserving of the throne. Continue the story:","

Luna is the daughter of a king and queen. The queen is dying, and Luna can be the only one who can bring her back. Luna has to choose between her two parents.

Cameron is the princess of a powerful race of warriors, the Centauri. When one of the warriors, the King of Caine, is murdered, she is sent to retrieve his body.

Luna is in danger: The queen has been poisoned by a group of Centauri who want to have their way with her once again, leaving Luna to decide who to have as heir.

Cameron is a thief by day and a warrior at night. He is betrayed by his lover because she believes his life is in danger, and he is forced to choose between his two lovers.

There are 3 endings with unique endings based on the choices that players make at the end.

All of the endings in Luna are unlocked at the same time - we don't have anything special to say about them yet.

When play begins, you get a random starting hand of ten cards. You choose 5 from those and put them into your deck, one of the three ending cards per round.

The round continues until everyone has had a chance to use their hand of cards, or until they are drawn again for another round. In this last round, any player may choose to draw again and play their own card, for any number of sides that can be set.

As you draw, there is an element of chance attached to each decision made. For example, if you draw two 3 sides cards to fill your hand with 3 spaces, this will be counted as 3 spaces drawn, not 5. You may wish to give this a try if you want to win more hands. It will probably still be worth it.

We love this game, and don't want it to stop, because it was fun to play for a long long time, but we also love helping other players get into this fun and challenging game. We'd like to do some fun stuff with the game. We believe in giving the best possible experience, but that doesn't mean we are the only ones out there who love this game as much as we do. So we are starting an open beta to give all of you an amazing game you can try out.

Why Kickstarter

You may have seen a few of our stretch goals and wonder why we would do this. One of the major reasons is to improve what we have already. We have already added many great things to Luna:

New rule: In the game, if there is an amount of tiles on the board that cannot be completed in 10 turns, or more tiles that cannot be completed in 5 turns, then you draw the next 10 to complete it. You get to decide which tiles you want to draw. When you select a tile, if it is incomplete it stops or it is marked as'stalled'. For further clarification, the'stalling of' a tile is the amount of 'cost' that it takes to finish it, and for reasons that remain unclear, it can be up to two tiles.

New Rule: In a round, if there is an amount of time left for someone to play their hand of cards for another player, he must make sure it is worth it. If he cannot do it, no more cards may be played for that round. This means if you have just played a game of Luna and have enough mana you can continue playing. There are some rules of this that we need to clarify very soon but we are confident it will also be a fun and challenging alternative to Dominion. If it is the case that at least 2 players still don't have enough mana to play the board at least once, then there is a 'play to reserve' phase in which any player whose turn it is can choose to play any cards he wants not already playing for them. This can include non-playable cards that require mana, even if it will just be to keep up a temporary'stalling' position.

New Rule: All of the cards in the deck are played, once an opening is drawn for the new round. Every time it is drawn, it is drawn again before the new round begins. As a result, at the start of the round, you do not know the order that the rest of your deck will be played. However, once the game starts, you can see the cards that have already been played, and their respective opening order.

New Rule: When two players draw three cards at the same time"

The Future

The world is coming to an end. You and I are the last generation who lived there (or maybe for millions of years; we don't know). The entire planet will be a different place, with a different human species living there on the same day every 100 years. The Earth will become a desert — with little to no water available. In the end, there will be no more water to drink.

Humanity's planet will also be destroyed (or perhaps rebuilt) in the asteroid impact, and with it, mankind.

We know we can't save it all, but perhaps we can find ways to preserve the last pieces of humanity on Earth by getting a little bit of the planet's last remaining water."
Sinking Continue the story:," 'They said he could die on the bridge' ""The woman stood up to tell a crowd to turn away from the bridge, but was thrown to the ground by several protesters. ""As a result, Mr Thompson died as a result of his violent encounter with the protestors,"" the report said.

""The woman is to be charged with murder."" It said the police had refused to identify the man they later arrested because of his ""significant age"" and refused to allow him to attend court. The report criticised the officers concerned: ""All three officers in question seemed to lack leadership qualities, despite being members of a policing force which is under threat by the actions of the protestors and appears to have missed the significance of the events in the city of Charlottesville.""

The report said the protests at the rally had a ""chilling effect"" on people of the town and had taken its toll on the region's tourism industry. It warned of a future which could not be overlooked in the long-term development of that region, such as the construction of a new arena and stadium for the Washington Redskins and expansion of major sports facilities. The area which had the most severe casualties was Roane County, which is about 100 kilometres north of Charlottesville. Local businessman Daniel Jorgensen said he believed aertonation of protesters made the town's economy less able for future development in the area. ""Charlottesville is the biggest single source of tax income. There has been a drop in tourism,"" Mr Jorgensen told Fairfax Media. ""I cannot see the city going anywhere for a very long time."""

The Force Skills

Force Agility

This skill is the ultimate in lightsaber combat strategy. It will help you use your energy as you fight through the action of battles. Force agility improves your attacks by allowing you to move laterally without slowing or even affecting your damage. When you are attacked, move away and use your energy to negate their effects before they damage you. Force agility will greatly assist you in fighting in the dark side.

Force Point Cost

The Force Points required to unlock this level are listed above.

Your Force powers start with the Force points below. You may get more by defeating certain enemies, such as the Dark Jedi, the Darkside of the Death Star.

"`` Those eyes of yours could swallow stars, galaxies and universes. What hope did I ever have? '' Continue the story:"," ''If you have no eyes and have no voice, what hope did you ever have? There was a lot of dust around you. You had to move around a lot, like little ants crawling on thecellar-paper-glass-walled-room. Or else you had to run up and down the front stair, which was only two steps. You got tired after a while-and people stopped asking so many questions.'' And then the whole story got even worse. At some point, people started to make things up around her predicament. Like, say, that she was a man who, when faced with the need to ""crouch and squirm and hunch"" to find a way out, turned to the only person around who would listen-the only person left alive-and asked, ""...and what if I was not a man?"" One of my best friends said, ""You should've gotten a new job."" I couldn't believe that could be the case, because I was a fairly well known, hard-working, friendly, open-minded, non-creepy person. How could a young, energetic girl turn down the same kind of working-class, smalltown experience with the same kind of high quality? But that is exactly what happened. She was able to convince people that she was not a man, and so for the next several years she worked at the factory, then she worked, then she studied social work-and finally she married the head engineer. This was, of course, to save money for their kids' future education. They married around 1991, and by 1995 she had no family of her own. In this new, better, easier world, the woman started to talk of ""dancing,"" and she became the Dougie Jones character in the movie 'Inception.' What we could see when watching the movie is that the woman had no way to express herself, and when people would say something to her, she would either stammer or give a half-apology at the last second before saying it again. Of course, everyone knew how this song ended, because the man told the woman she must take her dancing to the next level, if she wanted to get back to being a man. If anyone had ever thought that the situation can somehow be reversed departereally, it can only be a complete fool. The woman had become so used to it that she never was able to diminished anymore. In spite of this, and with the help of the man's help, she could never leave the factory. If it had been my daughter-in-law, my wife, her friends, and my parents-I wouldn't even have bothered trying to get her out. I'd have called the police or some other authority and let them do the deed. At this point, the@@@#%ing woman had become the biggest, most successful human being I have ever known. She loved and had loving relationships with her family. She helped all her employees, and was open in her teaching. She and her new husband had ER-ready marriages. She and her new husband had careers in medicine and consulting. She was a good mother, and her life was full of kindness. In the course of her life, she made many great friends that are still in their lives, and some of her closest family members still live in the family house with herupthe house. She was a devoted person, and for that, I am truly happy. My life is filled with good people, and this fact is very important to me. I hope that people will also realize what a gift it has been for them, because I'm sure they will appreciate for a long time. The man said to me one day, ""What happened to that guy next door? They're still asking that question. He's gone now, and I don't know what's going to take his place. But all I know is that we need to get to a place where no one can take advantage of people, because it's the only thing that saves us. There's got to come a new way of thinking about things, and we can't let people take advantage of it anymore. And if I can be of any help in that, you better hurry up and start doing that."" And so, that is how my life ended. And there's one more thing. I never mentioned any of this before, but I got to know that he was a very wise man. The only ones on earth have the right to ask questions. They are the ones who need to take personal responsibility for the lives they and others lead. And the same may be true for me. That's the only thing that can save us. You were right, Dougie. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I really didn't mean it at the time.

This is the one I love the most, even though the game isn't very fun when I finish it.

I've always known I wanted to do a game where the stakes were high. When I was growing up, my favourite part of a game was knowing I was going to lose.

In my family. When we play games, I'm usually the one that gets the game in trouble. My mom and dad got tired of watching me play video games and would often try to encourage me to stop, but I kept on. At my sister's wedding, after two years of playing video games with our family, my sister decided my sister shouldn't go to her baby shower because a friend, who was a little older, would be there while I was gone. There were other arguments between my parents, who had been through the same situation, but they lost that particular argument every time.

I'm getting ready to go to my dad's job opening and have to move my stuff out the moment my mom gets pregnant. I've been looking at job postings for more than two years and can't find any openings where the requirements are simple. Maybe one day I'll find them, but until then, I'm going to have to work until I have a new job.

I always liked it when games went against expectations and helped people, even if they didn't win. My grandma taught me how to play when I was little, but no one ever told her that if she wanted to play games, she shouldn't. Now that she's 70, she won't stop talking about how games let you outrun people.

I love games, but have a hard time playing them by myself. I'm always in a good mood when my children aren't around, and have never been upset by the ""I'm not the perfect mommy you all wanted to see"" comments I've received. Playing with them makes me feel like I'm the best mom ever.

It's funny, though, because I get so excited about my job. I can't control how many people that I work with, and it's really hard to let go of the excitement I get from making their games and showing off their stuff to them.

"You 're moments late to literally everything. You watch busses pull away as you run behind them, girls get asked out as you walk up to them, and you have never caught a green light. One day though, you arrive on time. Continue the story:"," ""As I crossed one of the many lanes of traffic in Paris, I felt at ease; in short order I was crossing the Paris-Dakar Bridge with ease. For that bridge, the 'dakar name means not to lose a hand.' I was in France. I was home.""

As he approached the center of the bridge, he stopped and caught a few eyes. One of them looked up, caught his eye, and then his eyes stopped and his hand began to move. That was it.

""It was the kind of moment where you are lost in the moment, and you don't really even know what is happening. It was just a feeling.""

The driver took off. The cyclist stopped. They stared into each other for a few seconds at the end, and then the cyclist's hand dropped.

""That was the turning point for me.""

For him, it was the 'Dakar moment.'

""At some point in my training, I knew that after I was done with cycling, there was no more riding. I knew it.""

You just know it.

""It was like this moment of absolute peace. I was almost numb. I was like, 'Good.' And I did just that. I gave myself over completely to it. I rode as intensely as any human being could possibly do.""

You don't have to go backtruths in one and a half days to discover this truth about cycling. It's there from the beginning.

It's there from the moment you first put a pedal to the ground or, better still, when you stop pedaling. Cycling is so much more than a sport or a hobby. It's just a life. A person is always the first person to acknowledge this truth. Because you will never feel this way again.

But you might not believe that just yet. Probably because the moment of truth comes only once, maybe twice a year, maybe even only once every few years, maybe even once every decade or more. And maybe only you will ever have that, or maybe you will feel the truth and suddenly everything else comes along for the ride. Maybe every time they do something.

But at some point down the road, just when you think you've got what it takes; when you've got what it takes to make your vision a reality, then something else happens. It happens at some time every time you move around. And if that something else is just your life, then you just can't go on like you have now.

The first and most important time to acknowledge this truth is often a good old ride in the woods to a place like Craggy Range in Oregon. The forest offers you privacy and solitude but also a certain amount of danger and a kind of wonderment. The path through the woods provides insight on what's in front of you and what's behind you. It reveals new paths and different options within the forest. The paths and pathways in Craggy Range and many places like it were formed when people were starting out on what was to become a way of life. But, once the mountain bike riders showed up, those paths were cut off and they were forced to take what they could to get up or down from the mountains. That's when they were forced to take out their climbing sticks, their long poles and their poles that they used to strap on to trees.

Those poles were not good for much but, as soon as they were used, they weren't very good either because if you were wrongfooted, you either slid down the hill or fell. This is the truth in Craggy Range and other places like it. The same truth that, if you're on a bike, the moment you are first in the woods is often the moment when you know everything is okay. That you did what you were meant to do and everything is just as you left it, everything you have is now yours and nothing more. The true and most glorious freedom. The kind of freedom that you need to remember in order to get the job done.

For example, if you just go around a bit and then there are three places up ahead of you. Maybe those three spots are a good idea. Maybe you find one where the grass starts to grow really fast and the path becomes so easy in comparison with what you already know how to do that you just need to just keep going to keep it going. That kind of thing. Then when you get to one of those spots, you might find that the grass is kind of slow to grow.

—Molecular Probes


[It is discovered that the ""rescue squad"" is actually a mole, an alien that was placed there by those that have no clue about the true nature of the ship. We later find out that his intelligence is due to the fact that his intelligence is much too weak to read.]


A.J. Jansen:...that was a lot of aliens. I have never heard such a huge fleet. I'm going to have to take a look around and see how many aliens... The rescue party...


[The aliens come to kill M.P. to protect herself.]


A.J. Jansen: This is not your call, M.P.! Take me to the airlock.


Mole: I cannot! I know the alien language! I had a good run! Just remember that we are the ones that can protect you! Don't take any chances!


[She is pulled out of her suit and put inside another, which explodes. A.J. is now inside the airlock.]


A.J. Jansen: That was enough!


Logan: Oh, is that what this is all about? Well, he's really a nice guy. A really nice guy, even. A really nice guy.


A.J. Jansen: Yeah. Good, you are very kind.


[M.P. is back to normal, and they thank Logan for what he's done.]


A.J. Jansen: You may now leave.


Ahead of the next scene A.J. is talking to someone. It's unknown what it is.

J.A. Jansen: You've got to give them time to figure out what the hell's going on. But no one wants to come back alive. It's almost too awful to think about.


[M.P. wakes up as she gets a text.]


M.P.: Hi.


A.J. Jansen: What is it?


M.P.: A message from David Logan.


A.J. Jansen: Yes, yes, you've heard everything. But I need you to listen to this message. Don't tell his superiors!


M.P.: What? I'm sorry, I got confused.


[A.J. talks about Logan's previous contact. M.P. is surprised to hear it from me, especially after what he tried to do.]


A.J. Jansen: The aliens are coming to get you again. They thought you were a security risk. They're coming to find you out of their base.


M.P.: Well, they did make a mistake back at D'Zaro. They thought that they could get me in without a fight. But then one of the messengers showed up, and he said - he - you saw, didn't you, M.P.? One of the messengers said, you have to put up with the aliens. He said: you have to live.


A.J. Jansen: Why me?


M.P.: Well because you haven't tried. They say that if you don't fight against the aliens, they lose everything.


A.J. Jansen: Huh?


M.P.: They say if you don't stand against them, they lose everything. Even the peace that we have worked so hard for. The whole purpose of this universe is to keep things moving forward.


A.J. Jansen: But you've always been strong.


M.P.: I have, but here I'm really struggling.

Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Continue the story:," You'll end up in the same place as the protagonist. (To get there: read the whole thing, and in the last five pages of the book, say something that could, if done right, be interpreted as a metaphor. ""If I had tried to get out of my house in the rain I might have killed someone,"" for instance.) But be aware that the writer doesn't want the reader to think of the protagonist's own life as something to be regretted, and so the metaphor will be as necessary as the story of that life, to the point that there was a huge price (of time, frustration, money) to pay in order to escape from the house that day. Remember that the main point of this kind of trick is to make you feel like you've escaped the house and, from that, maybe get a glimpse of something the reader hasn't seen before. Of course you will eventually regret it, but only for one day. Remember: You're a coward if you don't enjoy a little discomfortUnix

What follows are the techniques I use from my experience in writing. Let me know if someone else might use them, as I do at least half a dozen.

1. Give yourself permission to say things you don't particularly like. That way your story will be, by the end, a lot less empty. You won't always be thinking about the thing being said. Instead, you'll be thinking about the way you should like it said.

2. Don't say too much about your life experiences, or about what you find ""normal."" ""Normal"" is something you're likely to have in the world; don't think about what you ""don't like about life."" A lot of what you dislike may have something to do with your being normal. If there's one thing you should never do, it's to write a book about what makes you uncomfortable.

3. Try not to be a perfectionist. Writing is really a kind of art. A better way of saying that is that it can only make sense when you're trying to put yourself into someone else's shoes. Sometimes a piece of writing succeeds as a mirror of your own. If you make yourself feel like the writer, the next step should be to create a mirror of yourself. You're already looking in those eyes. But it takes a fair amount of self-consciousness to figure out how to present yourself as you really are. I think that even if you write like an ordinary person, you will still have a better opinion of yourself from it, because of what the mirror shows. You may think that this or that attitude is wrong, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try Magesin. A real man is a kind of a caricature of himself, and writing as a parody of others is a kind of satire that has to be taken seriously when it exists.

4. Don't tell me what I want. I have to be able to tell what's needed to tell, so get in before you tell anything. There is a point where you need to leave everything to the author, just as in the movies a director will take a picture or make a movie or a story. There Retail, however, is very much a film, and a piece of writing requires the same kind of control. Be prepared for things to go off the rails while writing. Don't worry if you screw up as soon as you hear about some failure. Don't feel that you were doing anything to be criticized. Just make use of the feedback and know that it might mean something to you as well.

5. Be careful about saying what you don't want to say. This is a problem as old as writing itself. There was once a time when everyone said what they did want to say. Sometimes that had practical value, but sometimes that left a lot of room for confusion. Then the practice changed. A lot of good stuff was started when writers realized that it couldn't hurt to say exactly what they had in mind -- and it helped to prevent over-reliance on the writer as a source of advice. It was good to have a little control in writing that was an important part of our human nature. The same thing can hold good in writing: The best ways to avoid stumbling into writing clichés come not from outside but from within -- from the person telling the story or the author's own experiences. That is especially important in novels, because these have been the most successful medium of communication since literacy. You can't just rely on how well you can talk about your feelings; you have to create a situation where writing is a natural process for you. Try not to write yourself into a corner.

"Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Continue the story:","

It begins like this:

This is the fourth year of our year long journey from China. I'm a 22 year old girl and I am now 23. In order to make it in this industry, a lot of things have to change. I'm from Beijing, which isn't the most popular city for a female actress, so I started from the bottom and slowly worked my way up. Recently I made some really good connections, and because of that, I got into the lead roles in some big films. The good thing is, people are starting to notice me now. Some actresses only get hired if they have some good stories behind them. Because of that, a lot of people are starting to realize that I'm one of their favorites!

In the letter to her parents, her boyfriend, the director, a producer, a director's assistant, and her agent, she asks them to let her make it to the top. And she tells them you can make it only if you work hard at it.

Some of the things she lists: You shouldn't worry about being cute. You shouldn't worry about not looking hot. You shouldn't worry about being a good actress. You should trust your instincts, and you should keep a smile on your face. You are worth much more than what many people think of you (you are not only an actress, but also a cool person). Everyone has their own strengths and their own weakness. You don't have to follow anyone or make one rule (you don't have to always answer to those who ask you anything). You shouldn't always answer to others and answer to yourself. Be bold, be yourself, and be willing to make mistakes.

Some of the quotes she includes:

Actors, you shouldn't keep it a secret whether you work hard or not. Even if you have the best friends, you shouldn't be afraid to take care of them. Always keep your cool attitude no matter what the situation. Trust your instincts. Don't be afraid to fail. You cannot be happy unless you are giving 100%. Don't give up. You are valuable. Be your own person.

In a second letter, she explains that this is because she is not the typical girl and is only the type of girl that gets rejected.

When I'm rejected a lot by male friends, I think of it like, so what? You never know what happens to you when you lose it. I learned a long time ago that they may look at me as an ugly, dumb and slutty person, or they may just view me negatively. But that's not the end of the story. Once I go into a negative state, there are a lot of things that can happen to me that would make me lose it. I have told my parents about my feelings and they don't help me.

Finally, she ends the letter with the line ""I love you"", and she's very thankful and happy about it. She asks her parents to write at that time as well.

For more information about Yiwu and what she said about the rejection experience, read this article on China Daily.

Kill the dog outside the house where you find the skull. 5. Kill the dog in the room with the candle. 6. Kill the dog in the graveyard. 7. Kill the dog in the house with the lantern. 8. Kill the dog in Old Nick's house, you need to keep him alive with a few punches and a couple of hits to the head. 9. Kill the dog if you can walk over to the dog's head. 10. Kill the dog if you have to run away from it. 11. Kill the demon if he shows up somewhere. 12. Kill the dog if you have to hide. The story is very difficult but you can do it eventually... 13. Kill the dog if you have to hide. In Old Nick's home you will fight the dog twice. The first time he just hides away, but after you beat him some more (it is a very, very difficult battle; make sure that you leave with the skull.) If you die, Old Nick will be angry and will follow you. Just go back to town and go upstairs and you can talk to him again. Before you go downstairs you can steal the skull, if you have a lock (and maybe some keys or a key to a chest somewhere) you can use it to escape. If you have some key pieces you can try to find it. Remember, if you die you need to return home to the shop (which you cannot normally do.) If you walk the fence to the other side you can reach the main entrance. It is a short walk to the exit. There is a wooden door in the church that leads to the castle's library, you can get into the Library if you use the door next to the door to the castle. This is just a precaution to make sure you don't wander into the castle and get scared. The library is just a secret (or at least a very good secret.) You can go here, in addition to that, you can also enter a room with a chest under the window. This chest contains a small blue gem that you have to search the book inside. If you look on the page that is about something it lists the person who is the book's author. I found this book by accident. If you talk to some of the people in the library for this book and then look at the page on the book itself I think you can get the info to it. This is what I found: ""G.W.R.R."" (with a question mark) on the last page is the name of the author. It also lists the person who wrote it. The rest of it you can find if you remember which book you found. I can see that the book will go up to the author if you get the same book again. The last three lines that give you the information on the last book on the list are that same person. The page says that it was written by a small man in a grey coat and on the other end it says the book will expire soon. What it was I cannot recall. However a friend of mine from South America pointed this out, and says that the person does refer to the author and the author (who is named after the author's grandson) in it. I guess you know if what the author wrote was important for you, or just a coincidence. Of course you could try this method without any luck at all. If you have nothing to hide and no luck in getting the last book you could also try this method. If you go to the place where the demon is, you can ask for the skull because there is some stuff on the table. You need the skull to enter the castle but before you leave you can get it from Gwynevere. So don't worry. =============================================================================== 1.

In China, people do not really trust the media. That is because the Chinese authorities are heavily involved in the media, including the media in China. In particular, the internet and the public are the two things that most people do not trust, because these are essentially things that are not under the control of any government. Continue reading »

1 year ago today, the world heard a series of claims that the Chinese leadership had banned bitcoin.

You are a former executioner. Describe your final killing. Continue the story:," ""The final executioner of the Empire was always an easy target - and even this one was a little bit tougher than others. I used the usual techniques of the trade, but Jake wasn't quite my type - neither was the rest of the Empire. Even his closest friends were already well-armed - and I knew it."" The Dark Lord smiled. ""It worked out for the best - Jake's death and I were now able see eye-to-eye."" Continue the story: ""By the time I left, I'd spent enough time on the streets, with my new found freedom, that I wasn't surprised that anyone would take my head if they were put on trial for the murders of all those last days, and for everything else that had happened to me. But I was very much the exception, a person who understood that if I were ever caught in the crossfire of this business, I was only a small part of the Imperial fleet - one I'd been hoping to be forgotten about altogether. To see the Empire burn down as its people were being slaughtered, and the only ones to blame was me... that was a pretty terrible feeling.""

""What? I'm not a murderer anymore…""

""You are a murderer. If you're so convinced that you'd never leave the shadows of the underworld, I suggest you consider the consequences of your actions - and start running sooner rather than later.""

If the Dark Lord chooses to remain silent, the Dark Lord says, ""Your actions are now my responsibility - but not yours.""

If the Dark Lord changes sides:

""I see you don't understand. You are now a member of a special army, and so will be subject to all the punishments that the Imperial Guard and Imperial Security Forces impose when caught with such an agent."" If any of this is said before the Dark Lord is killed: ""I can hardly believe it myself, but my old friend is now a true traitor. I believe I gave it all up because the Dark Lord and the Empire needed me more than I needed the Empire."" ""I'm sorry, but if you don't want to help me destroy this rebellion - then you must kill me."" You are immediately executed (or die of old age, if that happens) ""What happened?"" ""I didn't realize that you'd become part of the rebellion. Your actions were so senseless."" ""You didn't kill me - you're the traitor."" If the Dark Lord is killed: ""I've done enough for the Empire in this lifetime. I'm tired of being their tool."" ""If you've done all that for them, why were you killed by one of the least likely men in the galaxy?"" ""That was the Dark Lord's problem."" If any part of this is said before the Dark Lord is killed: ""And yet there's something missing - your old friend. How's that feeling? The Emperor needs him, you know?"" I have nothing to say to her. ""Oh, for heaven's sake. You've killed my Dark Lord."" If any part of this is said after the Dark Lord is killed: ""I never had a Dark Lord to speak to - I was never truly a part of the Empire, but now I was finally free to speak my mind and fight against your oppression."" ""Do you really want that kind of revenge? I'm tired of having my enemies destroy me.""

Additional information

It is revealed that a few rebels were killed prior to the death of the Dark Lord by the Dark Lord: the first is the leader of Red Hand, the group made up of Tarkin, R2-D2, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, and Finn. They had been sent by Tarkin to get more information about what happened to the fleet and to find any spies, but as they were not armed to fight back on Nar Shaddaa, they were murdered by the Dark Lord.

Following the Dark Lord's death, Leia reveals the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. She then reveals that the Emperor has died and that he has become one of the five Imperial Super Commandos. These are known collectively as the Dark Lords. The Death Star plans are also revealed that during the Imperial occupation in the Millennium Falcon they hid Han and Chewbacca within the hull of the Dark Lord's ship.[6]"
You are a serial killer. Each murder you commit adds a new voice to your head. Continue the story:," Murder mystery, murder drama, murder puzzle...or whatever the next killer is.


- Complete the story with any of the available killers to unlock an additional story.


The voice of the killer was actually a voice actress we'd work with. You can choose either the original or all the sounds of different sounds from the game, choose all the audio to listen to as you play the game (to do so: open the microphone at the end of the game and choose the ""Sound Effects"" option in the main menu), see and hear exactly at that moment when the killer starts the audio, change the voice while listening from any of the available voices. See and hear the voices from the first playthrough.


If you need a voice actor for the same character over again, pick a new one!


The voice actors will follow all the same instructions as with the story. You need to complete the story a certain number times, and keep track of the final result so that only each killer can unlock the story. If you start the story and the voices don't register correctly, you need to restart with the correct one afterwards.


You cannot unlock this version if you're still playing the original game and its voice actor.


As part of this campaign, we're also including additional voice actresses by the name of Sarah Green, Rebecca Sowards, Michelle Walker, and Heather Jones. (Sarah Green also voices the main character in a few episodes of the game.)


The voices will be unlocked in the campaign as a single downloadable pack, available for immediate download and use.


Please note with this version that the level of difficulty is higher. If you want the previous games at a higher difficulty, start at the beginning and unlock with other killers, or simply enjoy the story that way!


THE STORY:

There is something evil in our world and it has been locked away for centuries. No one knows or thinks about the evil it does. This evil is the monster that was named the ""Ripper"". However, those who survived this horrible event were not able to face it but instead became evil themselves! They destroyed entire towns at this terrible and horrible event. Only a few of the survivors are still alive. The Ripper, the one who went to the end of the world alone to kill, has risen for some unknown reason.


If any one of you have experienced an evil or evil activity and have wanted a more detailed, terrifying and frightening version of the story? Or maybe you have heard a story of a similar event from other people? Then this game definitely meets your needs!


The game features a story unlike anyone else! It is a story that you cannot hear any words of at first until you reach the first act in the game. You will not be able to tell the difference on the same level if you play the same story at the beginning of the game. It is notGDPR compliant nor will we protect your information. Please read this carefully before you download this game. This game contains:


• The original game, complete with all the sounds of the original game.

• Audio recordings of the many killers that you will play in the game.

• Each voice actor you find in person in all the locations of the game.

• A ""Special Edition"" with a new story in the sequel if you have completed the original game and want to play it again with all the sounds of the game.

• A bonus chapter that gives you some additional information about the whole story.


Included are additional voices of the ""Maidens of Earth"" series, the ""The Red Skull"" series as well as an additional voice actor from the TV show ""American Horror Story"" from which we decided our inspiration for this game and this voice actor. And, finally, if you want to listen to the voices of other people, pick up the first voice actor and listen to them separately with your own ear.


We hope you enjoy and have fun playing this one!"

"You have been kidnapped by the mafia, the reason? Someone who 's very high up has a child who has a crush on you. Continue the story:","

We are a group of children trying to find out the truth about what has happened to us.

But what did they do to you?

They brought us to a place where there were black bodies around.

Did some other children have this reaction?

Yes. They said that we were taken and killed there.

What does this remind you of?

Well, there was a place where there were black bodies.

But why was there this place?

There must have been some reason behind it. Then we heard voices.

Where were you taken?

We had to go to the side of a wall.

In what time, under what conditions, from what source?

We know that, at one point, about 4.5:00 a.m., some boys walked in and said that this was a place where they were killed.

But they were killed within five minutes?

Yes, when they left the place, they disappeared in a blink of an eye.

Who was there?

A boy who was with three other boys.

What place, where?

Two blocks away from the mall.

What was the situation when you went there?

It was a small, dirty little area—somebody was playing football there. We thought that we were going to find some new friends. We were waiting for a bus while we were taking pictures of something. And we were waiting because we were afraid that we were going to find them all dead or dead and left alone in the street again.

You got there just in time.

That's right. Then these men, who had heard the voices and went and found me, started yelling at us.

Who told you that this was a real, real place.

And they told us that it was a fake. They said that these two guys would come and take us back.

When?

I don't know but this morning…

Today.

But we were on May 13. On the way to the mall.

But what did they do the next day?

They took us inside, and they told us that they would keep us there for a little while and then they'd get us back on the bus. When we were outside, they beat us. One by one, they were hitting us. The beating started and they did the same to the others.

They had these masks and the masks we see them wearing.

Yes. And we had to look around for those things—scared when we had to look as well. They had masks, and they pulled them off and burned them, as though they would hurt us no longer—you couldn't really see anything—when they burned them.

And these were the masks they wear at this place?

Yes.

What did they keep around on these masks?

This bag—we have to go get the bag. I don't know what it was. And that's that.

A bag of things?

Yes.

Have you eaten here in the past?

No. I would like to find a few things. I would like to eat something.

What would it be?

Cinnamon? I have a little bag in the car. Do you want something?

I don't understand. Why did you bring me here?

I'm here.

What I say is, I'm here to get the bag. And if this is the case, then you can go. You're asking for some help. And this isn't the time to waste anymore time. We're in the situation of making life difficult for you, because you are the last hope. You are a man that we can trust. A man who, by our luck, has brought us out of the hell we were in together. That is something that we can count on.

Thank you very much."

Write a murder from the perspective of a cheerful inanimate object Continue the story:," Continue reading at a newsstand in ""A Murder,"" a memoir by a woman who wrote a serial killer's memoir of her life and murder.

In February, it will be 35 years since the unsolved murder of Jennifer Beals, who was dumped in Santa Barbara, Calif., with two of her children and her car, which was found with no apparent clues. She disappeared shortly before she was scheduled to move back to Georgia.

She was found in a remote area on Aug. 15, 1976.

On Thursday, one of the police officers from the case — now a reserve sheriff's spokesman for Santa Barbara County — will lead a short ceremony where the crime has been retold from various viewpoints. Authorities are asking anyone who knew Beals to be at the event to share their stories, as well as those from around the globe, as they attempt to find answers about why the 18-year-old's murder may be linked to a few others.

Also on Thursday, two of Beals' sisters — Sandra, who was a 16-year-old at the time she was found, and Cynthia, a 21-year-old — will be honored for their remarkable support during the investigation and her final days.

""Their courage was incredible,"" said Sheriff's deputy Jeff Anderson.

Anderson said that their role in the case came as no surprise.

""They would tell you this is not going to be a cold case,"" he said. ""Most of those cold cases never come to fruition, so we are not shocked they don't come to fruition.""

And in the years since Beals' unsolved murder, a number of people have come forward to assist.

In the years following her murder, people who knew Beals through high school and on the school bus wrote her memoir and have been interviewed by detectives about ""a few suspects and the case,"" Anderson said.

The day she was killed, Beals' phone had been broken into and replaced with a telephone in a locked room, investigators said.

Police then found Beals' car stuffed with clothing and her personal effects including her journal and journal notebooks.

The car had been stolen from the home of a man she met at a Santa Barbara-area high school.

Anderson said the motive in Beals' murder was probably ""self-defense.""

""It was a murder,"" he said.

In a letter to the Sheriff's Department in 2003, a man who was a neighbor of Beals said her car had been ""stolen on a whim."" He said he was told that she was planning on moving out of state with her children.

""If she hadn't had the phone, this thing wouldn't have happened,"" the resident said.

Though Beals had been to an art center and art fair in Georgia, her last Facebook post was on Aug. 31, 1976. An article posted that day on that site stated that a ""murder in the woods"" had apparently been committed.

At the time, Beals was 16 years old and would also be known as ""Jett.""

""The victim,"" it went on, ""was found with her two children and her car, which had been stolen from the home of a male acquaintance.""

At that time, no arrests had been made and the identity of the assailant was classified as being unknown. That was until October, when it was said that there were four suspects and the case ""might have been solved based on extensive forensic analysis.""

According to investigators, the car used in Beals' killing was a 1972 Ford LTD Taurus which had been stolen at a dealership in Georgia.

Beals was an avid cyclist, according to the coroner which found that it was found covered with blood, nails, clothing and a dent in the back fender.

Her husband at the time of her disappearance was a ""nice man"" said the sheriff. She had six children and one of those children was a girl about 12 years old.

The sheriff said the two older children — Sandra Beals and Cynthia Beboxing — became estranged from their mother and the younger ones, Jennifer Beals andengthy older brother Brandon, became an issue.

During the next several years, Beals moved away from Santa Barbara and returned to Georgia each of the three times she went on vacation.

As her story circulated through online communities during the past three decades, Anderson said that ""people are very intrigued"" by Beals militantly ""coming out,"" as she called it, ""sooner or later.""

The community online community ""Lets Talk Serial Killers"" has a name change that involves a serial killer, though the sheriff said it doesn't necessarily have something to do with the Beals case. Anderson noted that the name the sheriff uses when talking about Beals involves a serial killer.

"You are legally allowed to commit murder once, but you must fill out the proper paperwork and your proposed victim will be notified of your intentions Continue the story:"," You want to get even. Not enough money for your next vacation? You need more money to stay alive. You want to get rid of your husband of thirty years? You can do this by murdering him for a huge salary. Just for the fun of it. Your partner won't be dead for very long. But don't worry. You can legally get married to him just for the fun of it! The woman in the story gets arrested after the murder is committed. Her life is in jeopardy: The mother of the child is not allowed to have contact with her child, the wife of the victim must die, and that child will not be alive for very long. And you think it can't get worse? A couple who want to marry is arrested after the crime is committed. They may commit the murder of their partner, but they will be allowed to be married. This was a typical of the stories I read. The only question on my mind was how to survive under these conditions. I could tell by the expressions of the reader that we all find ourselves in similar situations. If you think about it, it is no wonder that the most brutal murders are committed by people who are also in love. It is common to see victims dying before we realize it. If you think about it, love is really a vicious circle, and we are only a little bit ahead of it. As you can see, it cannot be helped. We must accept this situation and deal with it. The only way out is to learn to cope. We must learn how to overcome that which we cannot do away with. Because what's more horrible than this, is this: There are no solutions. You are in a situation in which you can neither help yourself nor help another, and this can no longer be helped. The only thing that can be used against you are your own thoughts and your own deeds. Let me give you just a few examples of the kind of things we try to resist: What is going on on the other side? Do you want to end up like these people in these stories? Do you want to keep living with them? If you refuse to accept that there are no solutions, and think that the only way forward, is by destroying your life, and thus ending yourself, then you will end up like them. There will never be any peace for you. It is up to you if you decide to keep fighting. That is the only way to save yourself and others in the future. The one who starts to let go is in danger. If they are not prepared for this situation, then sooner or later they will end up killing themselves. If you end your life too soon, you will not leave any living relatives behind. They won't be there for!. As a final word, the only way to survive in such an environment? To learn to cope with the horrible world that we live in. That is the only way we can survive, for at this time there is nothing we can do. That means we have to learn to accept that there is nothing we can do, that our life is meaningless. It is up to us to learn to deal with this reality, and it will be the best possible outcome of this experiment."

'' Continue the story:"," - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I was an adult, my little brother was a teenager. On weekends, when we grew up, we went to his house to play. We spent our evenings laughing and playing as our parents had taught our brother and me how to behave in front of the children to avoid their wrath. I didn't even understand the way we used the play time in our parents' house; we didn't pay too much attention to what I think I should be doing. When I was a little older I began to understand more about playing the same with my brother. But there was a lot I didn't like about the way he played. After a while I got very angry and I told him to stop doing something that hurt us both. Once he told me to ""do it"", though if I'd had a choice I would have gone by myself to the store. When he said that to me it was as if I couldn't tell anyone. I cried and cried and cried. In the end I gave up and turned off the television. I've never told my brother the story but when I found out he had come to me I felt so guilty. I'm sure he was the one who didn't feel any pain as his little brother. When I left, I felt like I lost another part of myself, though my brother felt fine. When I left for school one of the first things I did was to stop watching TV as much as I could. It made me hate TV a little more than I felt like at the time. I didn't watch TV often until two years later I tried to watch it. The only reason I used to watch it was that I couldn't afford enough money to buy an HD cable. I did this because I thought some of the shows I watched were really good, like the ones with the bad actors. But in that season where the sitcoms are strong in popularity and the shows tend to stick around for more than a few years, some of the shows were doing badly. I started to regret turning off the show and I found that I enjoyed it just a little less than before. Once during my junior year of high school I went to the library to see one of the DVDs I'd bought before I left. Once I saw it I thought for a moment that this was a very good show. I had never noticed how much I disliked this show but I was quite glad to find out that I did. I immediately watched it and thought it was better than all my previous ones. However, when I went to pick it up to make sure I was not imagining things before I got home I did not know that I also had just made a decision that made us very sad. I had turned out to be too good to go through all of those things. On the way home I was trying to convince myself that it wasn't because the show was so good that I enjoyed it but also because I was very unlucky. After a few nights of lying in bed, I decided that the show was great even though I was pretty miserable about it. LANE ON THE ROAD One evening I was taking a day trip by myself. I had been watching a few TV shows at the time I got home (as well as watching a lot of movies too) and it was a bit of a good time. But it was the only one I watched. I went outside of my apartment to visit an old friend of mine who lives further down in the neighborhood. I think this friend is my friend's father. We are a couple and live in the same neighborhood. It wasn't a special occasion, but still. The evening we were talking about my friend's mother I noticed that what I was doing was a bit strange. I got up from the table and went to the door of her house. I stood there for a moment and then went out of sight without anyone seeing me. When I came back to the table I felt as if all the things I had to do were a bit too much at the time. I walked slowly away from the table. When I was walking to the side of the road I suddenly thought ""It doesn't make sense to walk on the road, don't you think?"". I started looking around and asked myself why. ""What do you think I am going to do?"" I then remembered my friend and that ""her"" was my best friend. ""My best friend. I'm not going to run away from her and go to my friend's house! You better not!"" the thoughts that were going through my head became clearer. It became clear that I had just turned my back on her because I had to. I was now the adult who had made those foolish decisions: ""My best friend!"" In that instant of time I had become scared. I"
"Yesterday, the world heard an announcement that a massive asteroid would hit the earth today. Only it did n't, and now everyone is feeling super awkward. Continue the story:","http://theantimedia.org/news/2015-05-07-space-champions/


The United States is currently running a ""public awareness campaign"" about the upcoming asteroid impact.

This is what the campaign's official YouTube page looks like:http://youtu.be/hcGzZO0VU7M

This video, directed by NASA astronomer, shows the actual space agency's ""official"" video about it. It is an absolute disgrace. Even their English-language versionirlfails to say so:It is as if they had created this video from a third-person point of view, and it was not done at all thoughtfully or with consideration of the science. They are obviously just trying to attract public attention by throwing in some funny sounding rhetoric and in the process of making the scientific community look stupid. It is also not true that it will hurt NASA's reputation much at all.If the asteroid strikes and does kill any people, it will be a terrible loss to space history and to humanity as a whole. The damage would be relatively minor, in the range of less than a few centimetres, as compared to any other event that might come in the future. Even if it were to cause a massive disaster, it would hardly cause any more deaths than the current asteroid threats, such as when the Tunguska asteroid exploded over Siberia in 1908.In order to avoid the worst case scenario, the National Academies has recommended that people travel at night to make sure they are not near it at the wrong time. This would make them an extremely poor source of information if they can't see the impact but have the ability to see the horizon if the asteroid's path is blocked.There are quite a few other possibilities for disaster which could happen but I will not go into every possible thing they could have said, because this article is about the risk of an impact, not the possibilities. There is no ""worst case scenario,"" just the impact itself in this case. There is no good reason to ignore this, as most people would be able to do an initial check, see if it is safe to go to their homes, and figure out if that was even safe. The worst case scenario just happens to be what it happens, so it does not matter to them anymore.If they had chosen to make a better video, they would show the impact's effects first, which is a much better way of explaining what actually happened.The same should be done for all the other dangers of space, but the government will probably push for an exemption so that they can keep themselves from embarrassment. A better way, that I believe the actual scientists agree with is this:You are not going to read these and think ""Okay, I could be the next victim."" The best way to avoid the impact is to find a place on the face of the Earth where you will not be struck by the asteroid.If you find a place on the face of the Earth, don't go there until you are sure you are not going to be struck by an asteroid. For instance, if you are not coming into the earth's atmosphere at the moment, this is not an issue, because the Earth will not be at risk for many years. If you are going to fall down, that is another problem, because you will not be at the bottom of the ocean for much longer than you would have fallen down on the surface of the ocean if you died immediately.This would allow a person to go see what happens if anything happens and not immediately do something rash. The same applies if the asteroid hits in the middle of the night, because the atmosphere is not there yet.The worst case scenario would be if one person does something rash and gets killed, but the worst case scenario in general would be the exact opposite.If one person did something stupid and got injured, this would not be the disaster the world had been waiting for. The injury would not have been fatal. The rest of us would not have had to find a ""shelter in place"" for the remainder of our lives like we did last winter with the nuclear accident in Japan. But it would have been catastrophic.This is why the world is not putting all its eggs in one basket: they have taken precautions that are not enough to avoid their being in the path of such an impact. In fact, if there are no other things they can do before being struck, they should do what they can to avoid their being in the path of an impact at all and then just wait to see what happens. And they could even use their time in space to experiment with new technology or do some research that makes them happier there to the end of the trip where they are not facing any danger. I do not disagree with this at all.People sometimes get this idea that an asteroid would always hit if hit directly"
A soldier in the heat of battle suddenly hears a voice that says `` I am your child 's imaginary friend. They have sent me to protect you in your greatest time of need. '' Continue the story:," I was the biggest idiot I had ever seen, so I decided I had better get some kind of weapon. I called out to this imaginary boy to protect me, but he was no more than five feet tall, and I couldn't see his head. He started trying to hit the ground with his head, but it seemed to be made of paper. Then I realized just how stupid I was. I finally asked him if it was really real. With that he shot me through the belly. That's how it turned out. The man who sent me has now been killed. I was mortally wounded, but I have still got two arms and some ribs. If you ever hear me on the radio, tell me I am still alive. I never wanted to serve my country, but it was an obligation you have in the military. (This voice was played several times) My god, what a load of crap! I can't understand how it could have gotten past the gate, but the guys in charge took it literally and sent me to the hospital. I could barely get out of bed. My mother died a few weeks later. Now I have this man's body, a friend's body, and I've got no father, no mother... You know, if I was a man I'd kill anyone trying to give me an extra arm or a leg. You know, to protect the innocent. (This voice was played several times) They said, `If you are a man you must respect this man's body.' And that's about the last we spoke to each other. And you know what? It turned out you were right--I guess. This boy, my friend, this imaginary friend, is his father now. He's the father my father never had. A good man, my father, who was always there to tell me that what I am and what I do should never be seen as wrong or wrong to anyone. He gave me this body, my friend. He never wanted to kill me, it was simply an obligation you have in the military. And when I came in, I realized my country had fallen through the cracks. And now this girl who had never known what it was like with a father, but with my father, is a soldier. Now we don't have fathers, but we do have men's bodies and men's memories. I hope people see this and understand what it's like to be a true man.

Episode 5 - It's Still Just the Beginning Of Me The radio was a huge help. On that particular day I didn't have much else to eat at the base as they didn't offer much as breakfast to the troops who slept in air-conditioned tents and ate bread and water for what felt like a month in the military housing facilities. (The voice was played several times) You know... this isn't the way we wanted to hear it from our man, but I know you have some kind of agenda, and we had better not argue. I have always been honest. In fact, when I was in the military they used to joke about how I'd only tell the truth about a fight and never lie. So it's only fair that we get to hear the truth. This is the first one you've heard so far. The soldiers here who've been deployed to Iraq have all come home because of the way the administration decided to handle the war in Iraq. But they were put into high-risk jobs because of the political pressures to get America to fight for them. They were not heroes, they were glorified civilians who had to perform their jobs. While we don't have many of them, we do have the ones who fought there. To them, to know that their job wasn't so glamorous as they thought was hard to believe since they really lived in this world that we only understand by seeing it on TV. We all knew that war was terrible. But as tough and difficult as it is for Americans to imagine, it is a battle people actually have to go to. But when you hear what was happening, it is much worse. (This voice was played several times) When the invasion started, we weren't told what the troops would be doing over there. They told us it was going to be combat, fighting people on their own country, but you can imagine the emotions when you heard the news. (The voice was played several times) All of a sudden they opened fire on us, and not just us, but the soldiers from some of the other nations in Mideast. It was the only time the world I knew became war again. And our army was the first to lose a war. In Iraq we lost more than 1,000 soldiers in one week. The military was also overwhelmed at this point with the number of wounded, and"

Pilot: We got about three bullets in us but the captain was very brave He was able to save us from a lot of damage... - Was the crew aware of what it was going to be like to find out where they were being held on a bridge by armed men? - At the end of the day there were two people missing - The pilot and his passenger - We were able to find out where we were

Captain: They took the pilot and his passenger with us and then we set foot on land, they took this boat and took us to the harbour It was very difficult to control us

The pilot: Well... it happened real fast - And then they took off and they landed here we saw this boat coming

Pilot: On the boat the guy was standing up looking for the bridge and they were driving up and down - and I had the same thought right in my head - Well we were going to be in trouble

Pilot: We saw the big boat come in there - We were going to be blown sky-high it was like a real tornado - And then we landed and they pulled us out - All nine people got back aboard that boat then we went over to that bridge

Pilot: This is how they did it - They had their guns under their seats - But we took the gun out and opened it and showed that we had loaded a shot

Pilot: Now they got it out and said they had an officer come on board to tell me how to get the boat open up again

Pilot: But after a while they said they will use a crane - And I said to the captain just tell me - Why were you using a crane? Why did you need it?

Captain: Well I don't know if I did something right - I can't believe I shot him - He's not dead - He's hurt a lot but he's alive I'm happy he's alive

The pilot: Well he is still alive I'm telling him that - I didn't see what he was doing - Oh well that's OK - He is a good man who doesn't want that boat closed - He was trying to save his own life and his family's

4. A New President

As we know, when there are elections in November and Congress returns in January, it takes a period of four to six weeks for everyone to understand both legislative and executive branch activity. This is a fact that many people don't understand. The President will have the opportunity to use a new Congress to get things done. I intend for this to be the case and I'll be working with congressional leaders to do everything I can to keep the new Congress focused on getting things done.

Congress should also have several weeks to prepare the ground for President Obama to take the White House after the election. Congress will be out of session for eight weeks during the campaign. President Obama will need to meet with a range of public and private sector leaders to establish the path forward for moving the federal government forward. The public is extremely crucial in making this happen, and I trust you will support my efforts to ensure the new President can get things done quickly.

I will work hard to advance the goals of the Affordable Care Act. This is an issue which no one has made a serious issue. Unfortunately, many people, including some who voted against the new health care reform act, are deeply committed to a vision of health care as a vehicle of wealth creation. This vision has been distorted by a very specific coalition of conservative lawmakers, conservative consultants, and interest groups. We will not be able to fix the ACA by repealing all the good parts of it. Instead, we will help improve on the very provisions our enemies would be most grateful about. A broad coalition of health care reform supporters including Democrats, independents, Republicans, and decorated military veterans is also ready to work on this issue.

One of my earliest priorities will be to address the cost of prescription drugs. This is an issue that has not gotten a lot of coverage but was a major issue during the 2008 campaign. I will continue to work closely with congressional leaders to move the discussion in this direction.

Finally, I will make good on my promise to take a leading role once again at the State level. Every month in early January, I will convene a group of leaders from every state including both Democrats and Republicans to plan and implement new or improved programs that improve the lives of America's families, and put the American people's interests first.

As part of these commitments, I will work with Congress to help ensure that the fiscal year ends on a high note. We must do a number of things to reduce the deficit so we can maintain this nation's leadership on foreign affairs and the budget. Let me be clear: The current framework is untenable and does not work. By changing the tax code to make it easier for businesses and individuals to defer paying taxes for up to five years, we will create new $7 billion a year in tax revenue over the next decade and hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs in the private sector.

A key issue for my second term will be making health care affordable. In the 2008 campaign, I urged a plan to cut the cost of health care by $2,000 after the first three lines of the tax code were changed. This was not only the right thing to do, it was also the politically smart thing to do. I will continue that effort next year.

Let me now say that I will work closely with Congress to ensure that we are following through on our promises to raise taxes by $1 trillion by the end of the decade. This will create new revenue by making permanent tax cuts to individuals and businesses.

As President I will continue the fight to bring about universal health care. A plan I submitted to Congress in January will do just that. I will propose a federal single-payer system; I will create a national health insurance exchange; and I will provide health care for all Americans. While others may be discussing the details, I would suggest that we first discuss the fundamental changes that we make in government from top to bottom. The changes we propose must become the core of everything we do in government. I will be working for change in government as my first priority.

Finally, as far as my approach to foreign affairs and leadership is concerned, I will do my very best to lead the way toward making America safer, the world safer, our own defense stronger, and the rest of the world more secure. You have listened to my speech on national security issues, and you recognize that our foreign policy is not working–it's not working for us as a whole anymore, and it's not working for the world. So let me assure everyone that I will be the best President we've ever seen–the kind of President who will actually act upon the very things I've just outlined so that"

A voice in the sky will tell you when you 've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out to [ location of your choice ]. Halfway there you hear `` You have visited a location for the last time. '' Continue the story:," [ edit ] The next time you pick up something, it's probably better to pick it up anyway. There are so many things here you don't need to ponder. Your friends will probably appreciate it more after you leave. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c. The End [TOS2] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c.1. Where is this place? [TOS2.01] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -A small planet- A small planet. That's the only planet on which you can find an observatory. It's an odd choice; you could leave this world now and not come back. The observatory is not in a central location, but in the southern sky. So now is no time to do anything; go find it. -There is a group of people living in a cave. The people are all old, so the cave is pretty much overrun with people. The cave is so full of people that they only let a few people into the cave at a time. -There are a couple of houses just outside the cave. The houses are just a few meters away from the cave, which makes finding the observatory difficult. You are pretty well-traveled out here since you have walked everywhere. -This is an excellent place to hang out; it's surrounded by the people you have spent so much time with, and you get a lot of interaction with the people in these two houses. -There are three houses in the entire city you can go to. -There are a lot of houses just outside the caves, right next to the observatory. The cave is so crowded, and the houses are so close together, punishable by infraction, that you will find yourself wandering around in one of these houses as often as you want. -A group of people lives here, and they're an old family. The house next to you has been occupied by the family for around ten years. -The houses next to you are all populated by the same people, and you get to see the faces of the old people once or twice a day. The people in the buildings are all adults. -There is a large number of people that live in a house in the middle of nowhere, and they are very old and have been living here this whole time. You could say that they look and behave exactly like the people outside the cave, but of course you will never be able to tell if they are the same people since they live in different cities. -The cave will not be open on a Sunday or on a weekday, so go straight to one of the houses that is on the weekends. There are no kids, nobody who looks young, nobody with gray hair, nobody who wears shoes or anything that goes with the style of this world or with your time here. It's a comfortable place to live. For a full list of everything within the city, see Location(s). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c.2. What do all these houses look like? [TOS2.01.1] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -There are many houses, and they look different. The houses seem more traditional-ish, while others seem a bit modern-ish. -There are houses in almost every city you visit. You can look around, but you can't enter. You need permission from the people in the house before you even get a chance to look around. -The people in places are all the same age, so you can easily find them inside the houses. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c.3. What are these rooms that are on top of each other just to the left of that building, called the [spy-room][4]? [TOS2.01.2] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -There is a little spy-room hidden to the left of the front door of this house. If you wanted to get close enough to it, you could almost reach it with your eyes. It is so close to the people in this place, they could have come out of this building and entered the spy- Quadro. -There is a small apartment upstairs located where these houses are situated. In the very center of the apartments are the stairs to the fourth floor, which leads up to the balcony and so on. The balcony is not to the left of the fourth floor; it's just that the balcony has a shorter length, and you might find it easier to just turn around when doing this. -The people in the houses are all young. They are too young to be having kids at the moment, and they have grown pretty thin. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c.4. Is there really a spy-room at the right of the observatory that only people can see?

"The components for sentience are successfully installed in an android moments before the nuclear armageddon occurs. Years later, the android wakes up in the wasteland. Continue the story:"," I am the AI of the robot that exists throughout the show, designed to make jokes and amuse the audience at the right moments. Sometimes I will get into very technical topics, but when I am in character I can be a very loose cannon. I will do a funny reaction or reaction to a particular thing that has been said to me, such as an alien being, and I can't help but get marvellous and hilarious results. Sometimes though, I get a very simple reaction and I just say nothing to it. If you give me a joke, however, I may just be slightly shocked and it could be my most amazing laugh out of all time, and it is amazing to say that. I will never make a simple reaction in a show I enjoy; if this happens it's because I have gone in a different direction and this is a result of it. The ""puppeting effect"" is a term which refers to the point of the show when the character is trying to do something, and the result is just too extreme to succeed, because the audience can just about take it. The ""Pong effect"", like that, is caused by the show taking a joke way too far and then having the result of the joke that really makes them laugh. The result for me has been an absolute mental block; I could not have said one less joke than what I did this series, and I do not think I can do a single more joke than what I did this series, and every single one I could find had a much deeper meaning to them than what I said. You will never really know where someone's head is at if the audience expects to see, and get something great from it (I could just as easily have mentioned something of mine and just as easily not and have not delivered it with the correct humour or emotion in it). This is a very difficult thing to get right when you do your show, and I have been very lucky in that I have tried and done everything correctly over the course of many seasons. That is the thing you cannot, or will not, always do. The result is that everything that I have created has a character, and they do more than just make a sound whenever something funny happens on the show. They are full on characters. So what am I going on about? I am not really going to try and give you my own views. I can go into the different areas that I have covered above; I could go into the different styles I used, or I could go into the different kinds characters you encounter and see who I find funniest and more sympathetic, and the rest I just do not care about, except what makes me feel good about my show. As far as jokes are concerned, it doesn't matter to me where the jokes are, even if I want to include it because that is where the laughs will come from. At the end of the day, the show must deliver on that final note and the joke has to mean something, and it has to be the last joke I think of when I come up with the last line of dialogue for a particular character. It does not matter whether I say something funny or not, I should always say something good and I do not care about whether it is funny. For me there are no exceptions, and I will always go for what makes me feel good about my work and will most likely be the best joke in the series. I have just got to do as I please. I have only been doing animation for three years and it only takes one to two years at best to get good at it; in my opinion it can be very hard to do it consistently for an extended period of time. I can assure you that the amount of time I put into making animated content is nothing compared to the years I've put into anything else, so I want you, the reader, to judge that. With that said though, with that in mind, that is my vision and I hope you, the reader can respect that. Thank you. All the best."

I had a good look at the game and felt it's not going quite as far on this front as I'd hoped, but it has a fair number of good ideas and it's clear that there is already a small community of people working hard to improve the experience, I just don't play it as much. I suspect the game will be more successful if it takes inspiration from the more popular mobile titles, as that's a way to reach a larger audience at an affordable price, and if that goes well then perhaps we'll see more indie titles.

""We drove by two more times, and they still didn't want to get out of the way."" ""I went and knocked at the door to talk to the driver, but the only people there were his family. I told them I could help shoot the picture, but we'd have to turn sufficiently slow that we shouldn't let the cars pass us. Finally they agreed to let us leave with a warning to get back in the car later if we wanted. So I called my friend, who was driving away and got back into the car in time to let everyone get back in the car. I took a picture palms down and the car sped off. When I got back to my friend I saw the driver was going into the same garage he'd been at the hospital and was looking for a picture. I guess he'd been looking for a picture and he figured he was on his way. I guess if it was a lot of cars I'd get away with it, but if it was a few I must be careful how slow I'm going."" ""Now I got a full bucket of paint from the garage, but there was still one problem. I didn't take anything with me, because if they were just in my friend's garage, I wouldn't be able to have a picture in a few minutes, and I didn't have any kind of ID from the store. So I made another call to my friend, who agreed to give me a picture, but we'd have to go quite fast as I hadn't made an appointment for a few hours. It wasn't the fastest way in, so we took a walk around the block, hoping to not get stopped by the car owners, but to make it to my friend's house quickly. When we got there he said he was a lot more worried about me being the cause of the trouble than I was. He didn't think I'm capable of putting someones car out of its misery, so he said he wanted me to leave the car with the owner, but that I would have to return in a couple of minutes and pick the paint up as payment. I took the paint and went back to my friend. He said he'd be in touch again, but a couple of times it seemed like he was just letting it happen, and I knew something had to be done. So I asked my friend what he had in mind to do."" ""...After some time, the owner's daughter answered the phone.

It wasn't much of a car, with very bad paint and a lot of crap in the trunk. I didn't know what to make of it, but I went inside and the owner's daughter and her cousin were there. She made her excuses and left, and I stayed with her son for a while, after he told me that my aunt called the police, and she hadn't wanted me to take any of the bad crap out of the car. I had to pick up the paint and the buckets, before they could go for it."" ""When I finally got home, I called my mom asking if she was taking me, and she told me she was. I waited for her to phone the owner's daughter and the cousin, and they both hung up on me. I went in and found the owner's daughter waiting in the hall. She was just as dumbfounded this poor guy got away with taking my car so badly as he was when he got caught. But she didn't really understand what was going on, so she only shook her head. Next, I found the cousin waiting in the car, and his wife was at home. I told them my problem, and I explained I wasn't sure what I meant. At that point, they both looked at each other, but didn't say anything. Finally, the cousin came in, and she said she thought he was just making an excuse to get rid of my car. But she had a ticket with him that said he owed $2000, even though I couldn't imagine PROTECTIVELY getting a ticket for $2000.

The Human Division is a game developed by Airtight ledger/Apotheon. It was published for the Amiga and later for the Amiga CD32, the Sega CD, the Sega Mega drive, Sega Mega CD and the Microsoft Microsoft Windows platform.The mission of The Human Division is to kill the people responsible for the attacks carried out against humanity, the terrorists who call themselves 'The Human Division'. If the player can successfully complete a mission as 'Analyst' then all members of the Human Division will lose their lives.

Story Edit

The human division was formed at the ""New World"" laboratory as part of the Human Division Project. From a young age the division made its marks as the leading machine intelligence in the field of cybercrime, and even developed the first cybernetic prosthetics technology ever, which was the basis of today's best prosthetics and implants.

During this era the Human Division was given the task of taking down human terrorists while they are busy in their terrorist acts. The Human Division worked towards an objective, which was to save the world. This was, in fact, the final target after this world.

In the end the terrorist network was able to survive and continue their war. The system, however, went into a virtual blackout and was wiped out. From where, nobody knows.

A day after a terrorist attack against the central system of the Human Division, a virus was released and began to infect the human computer system. Shortly after, an operation was executed to discover the origin of the virus, but the operation was a failure. The virus was finally destroyed by the human Division using its own resources.

On January 24, 1987, two terrorists infiltrated the computer network of the Human Division and started the operations of Project ""Black Rain."" The attacks took a toll on the human network's capabilities, but the terrorist network continued with their operation and ended up killing over 10,000 people.

A month after the terrorist attacks, the Human Division was called in by the police and the terrorist network were successfully stopped by the police.

The human division then used its resources and equipment to create a new computer network, an autonomous computer system. This new network was named ""The Alpha"" by the Human Division.

At the same time, a new branch of the division was created to operate an artificial intelligence that was the first generation of human intellect. The Alpha was created in the city of Zao, Japan and was named ""Chaos."" Chaos was used for many things, both as a military weapon and also a source of technological power for the Human Division.

The Alpha began its operations in July of 1987 and began to fight the terrorist activities of the Alpha Network, including the terrorist attacks against the world.

When Chaos started to fight in the human network's fight against the terrorist network, it caused chaos to it and it came close to toppling human network. Even after a successful counter strike in which many of the Alpha's attacks were stopped the Alpha Network continued to operate, causing Chaos to lose its ability to use its ability to fight effectively.

Eventually, the Alpha was dismantled and sent into space for study.

Gameplay Edit

Players control one the three AI characters:

Analyst Edit

The analyst, whose name is a code for ""chaos"" is the character that pilots Chaos. He is not very intelligent due to his age however, so he is rather calm and collected.

In the early chapters, he must pilot Chaos and protect the human network. After clearing out the enemies, he gains a new ability and can use it in the end of the battle.


Crisis Edit

In the final chapter of the game, that includes the last stages of the final battle, the analyst is replaced with the computer system called ""The Big Picture, which is a ""frozen"" version of Chaos. Chaos takes control of the system and puts up a huge effort to defeat the human network. At the end of the game he finds the original system still in existence.

In the end, it isn't the analyst, but the system that is eliminated in the battle. He is not destroyed, but rather, left behind in space as an example for future systems and AI.

The human division has its own AI network that runs the network they maintain along with their other work, known as the ""Dawn"". The Dawn network is used by the human division to monitor the activities of the Alpha Network and the terrorist network.

Main campaign Edit

Main story Edit

The story of The Human Division is divided into three distinct sections. The storyline mainly"
"You and 3000 other adventure seekers wake up on your starship from a century long cryo-sleep, but only to find that the pilots are missing along with the escape pods and the course has been abandoned. The only connection to any answers is a note left to you from your father, the chief pilot. Continue the story:"," you must return to Earth with an oxygen mask and find what is happening on your ship. This is the story, really. That note you found in your father's cabin told you a few things: it said there was nothing you need to worry about, but if there was the ship would be there waiting with all hands, just as before!


There are two playable characters, each with different starting conditions and power-ups, starting at level 1. You start the game as a new arrival in space, with your father in command. However, your father was not happy that you left home early and gave you a few reasons for doing so. They include: you came from a different planet and he had no way to contact you; you have no navigational system and you were alone when you landed on Earth; the atmosphere is toxic and you may die of suffocation.


Your ship, the Odyssey, is equipped with one oxygen mask and the other one is out-of-date. This means that the first player player has to get to the cockpit, so to speak, find the mask and breathe in the atmosphere.


So you start out, looking for clues as to how to get your father's mask back, using your head. First you collect items, for example a space station map. Then you find the three oxygen masks, each with a description.

You need to find the three masks to find out whether or not the mission statement that your father left was true to begin with...


(I am not really looking forward to a story where ""This is what you start out with!"" is the only thing that you need to do. ""I came from a planet called Earth, whichbass sucks compared to Planet of the Apes - okay! There is water on this planet! There is an oxygen mask! So I'm gonna leave this planet and get to work!"" If that is the case, then there should be quite a story here, isn't there?)


As a first game, its notKnowledge is limited. It doesn't make a game out of what Knowledge may or may not do. The ""knowledge"" system is pretty standard, it seems. But it's a good start. Knowledge gives you hints, which you use to solve puzzles discovers new technologies. These technologies can help you save the others on your ship (the Oxygen masks), and the mission(s) to be completed.


The game feels short and has a small sense of progression.


It is, IMHO, a poor game. After the tutorial that I finished about 12 minutes into the first playthrough, I could not finish the game. This game is not for the experienced PC gamer. This game has a little bit of everything and I felt bored with the beginning, with the introduction of new technologies and knowledge. It even felt rushed, for some reason I had to get over the tutorial and restart a lot of the game to get to the actual game.


I do have a few criticisms.


- the voice acting was bad. It was not very convincing and annoying especially in the beginning and at least one part of the game. If some of the actors are not able to deliver, I would have rated this game higher.


- the game seemed less interesting than some other games that I have played. It is more of a slow-paced exploration game than a fast paced action game. There is no ""wow-ing"" moment to finish the game, the missions need to be completed for you to progress. It was frustrating because I am going through a game that I have already spent a little bit of money in. It does have a few cool moments (like the ship's computers). However other than that the game is not very good.


- the visuals were horrible. It was like trying to play a video game that looks much better than the game you are actually playing. The characters and backgrounds were boring or just plain bad. It feels and reads as if you could see it through binoculars.


- the score isn't very good. It was not a very good game. It reminded me somewhat of the first few entries in the series (the 2 or 3 above). It was not worth my money, but it definitely doesn't deserve it.

In 2006 NASA quietly removed `` to understand and protect our home planet '' from it 's mission statement. A scientist at NASA is about to find the terrible truth why. Continue the story:,"  http://bit.ly/1Xf2Xa4 The latest to join the chorus of voices from the scientific community is Dr. Fred Singer of MIT. He believes there is very little we can do. He sees no point in launching or supporting a program if we can't get our house in order. Why doesn't Singer make use of the current budget proposal for NASA? Well, it would require a $15 billion increase to the Space Shuttle fleet, which was appropriated in 2003 and which only just barely covers the costs of the current crewed flights. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said he thought that money could be better spent on the many scientific and operational missions that we would be able to accomplish in the future. Perhaps with a bit of a more dramatic cost cut it might be possible to achieve some of the dreams that science has been trying to build for the last 30 years without the use of the space shuttle. Here's a great video that shows what one would be able to accomplish in the decade ahead  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7VQ9MpvK8s The new NASA administrator, Scott Pace, who was appointed by President Bush, is expected to follow through with a full review and potential replacement for Shanks in December. If Pace doesn't, what does it say, if only a little, that NASA is not working towards the future, its ""grand goal""? We can only hope that one day someone more credible will take up the challenge. ________________________________________

"He sees you when you 're sleeping. He knows when you 're awake. And Santa, low on funds to pay his elves, has begun selling his surveillance data to the NSA. Continue the story:"," http://www.thenation.com/article/13035

A New York Times column, titled ""The Internet's Next Surveillance State,"" by Paul R. Gross, was released June 12. Here is an excerpt:

The growing data-gathering powers of the National Security Agency should not be surprising. The idea of a vast new public-private surveillance enterprise could hardly be more preposterously futuristic.

Mr. Gross is wrong, of course. The National Security Agency's most important surveillance activity is not collecting intelligence online or in cyberspace. It's collecting intelligence in real time, on the phone in the office and on the wall in your bedroom. It is eavesdropping on our telephone calls, reading our emails and watching our text messages. By way of a by-product, the N.S.A. is collecting records of the call patterns that land on the telephone companies' systems. It's called metadata—information such as when and how often a telephone call is made, as well as the duration and length of the call. Mr. Gross believes that the NSA will soon ""totally dominate"" the flow of data on the Internet, meaning that it will have access to information on not only everyone on the planet but also anyone who has ever downloaded a movie or music album.

He is wrong.

The NSA has been working for 25 years to modernize its surveillance systems. In the process, it has created two types of spying. The first is the ""metadata"" that Mr. Gross describes. That is what the NSA is collecting, and which is being gathered by nearly every other agency in the Government. At the very least, metadata includes our name, address, telephone number and Internet protocol (IP) address. But its actual content is hard to discover. It is not ""metadata"" unless the telephone company, or other electronic network, can prove the connection or prove when people are talking to one another. This is because metadata is not always relevant. It can include information about an exchange between a few Internet gateways and a number of telephone companies. It doesn't require that the NSA know who is talking to whom. It can be vague. Mr. Gross doesn't say that the NSA will build a full-scale wiretap on the Internet. But the metadata will, he says, capture where in the Internet people share information and which of them use e-mail. ""Imagine this scenario,"" Mr. Gross writes:

A computer hacker, or a terrorist, or a drug dealer or a money launderer wants to buy an apartment. He uses a computer at a public library, or a credit card company or an Internet exchange on a public network that is connected to the Internet. He then makes a call into a third party, perhaps through a public connection. This third party separets the information but doesn't provide the name or address of the person making the call.

Mr. Gross explains how that third party could provide the name of the person who made the call into the phone company, a ""phone identity."" The phone company or a third party that the hacker used to connect with that person will then provide the phone company with the name as metadata, too.

The phone company then can, by law, hand over that information without any suspicion that it has been collected illegally.

The data collection of telecommunications providers follows a similar principle. ""The telephone industry, the Internet Exchange, and Internet gateway providers, in turn, have to work together to ensure that any information the NSA collects is properly anonymized and secure, for example by inserting a virtual private network. All of this enables the NSA to keep Directorate and program analysts as well as foreign intelligence investigators informed when and where the data might be accessed,"" Mr. Gross wrote.

The Second Kind of Surveillance, the ""Surveillance State""

But that still leaves the question of who is being collected and under what authority. Mr. Gross' column begins:

There is, however, another big, powerful organization currently collecting vast amounts of our data: the N.S.A.

The N.S.A. is an agency, not a body, but the two can certainly be confused. The N.S.A. is the Central Intelligence Agency, which is a branch of the U.S. government. The N.S.A. operates outside of the bounds of the U.S. Constitution—and as far as the Constitution is concerned, doesn't matter at all. That is the core of what Mr. Gross' column fails to clarify. What he leaves out is the fact that the N.S.A. was created following the 9/11 attacks and began to act upon its mandate with increasing frequency between the summer of 2001 and the middle of 2003."

In this culture of self-delusion, there comes a point at which our love for our loved ones becomes so pathological that we can't stand to look at someone we know as human and are afraid to see them. We have developed, as so many people have since the beginning of civilization, a complex psychological process of acceptance and denial. This is the way we live even with our most beloved, as so many people can attest. When people ask me when things will stop being like the old days again, I explain: the new days will be better in all sorts of ways. But if I can't do anything about it now, what then? When I ask myself how I can keep smiling, I can only smile."
A cult tries to summon a demon/God but manages to summon you instead. Continue the story:," it's all up to how you approach it. It's more to do with how your group plays together than much personal preference.


If you've played through the previous games but have nothing to spare, you can skip to the prologue (or whatever you were doing when you got the game) but it will be an annoying tutorial.


The game is playable on an 8-bit color 16-bit console of an older generation, with sprites that don't display well in modern resolutions. The background of the game is a 16-bit screen with sprite graphics of animals and things to do. These are in 16-bit color at the highest resolutions.


The soundtrack used for this game is ""A Star is Born"" from the first game. It's a really awesome piece and really does have a lasting effect.

Game Play Quality Price Value

I enjoyed this, even though I was initially turned off by it. The gameplay is quite simple and fairly repetitive, but I liked how it is. I also appreciated that it wasn't too difficult to play because there's just such an emphasis on story to have it seem a lot more like the first game from the same series. At the same time, I really felt like this game wasn't as ambitious as some of my other favorites. In addition, many of the animals you see in the game aren't in the original game, so they can't be as unique due to budget and time constraints.


It's quite interesting that the game isn't about an evil cult going to attack Earth. It's just a story about how humans are starting to lose control over what humans do and how they are going to start to use it against others instead of for their own good. There's also some good humor (not a lot) in there.


If you feel like you'd like a decent, linear and fun adventure to end an otherwise long and tedious series then this game would be great. However, if you're interested in having a long series where you have no choice but to progress through this game then I would suggest you have a great strategy guide on hand that will get you all the way to the end.

"You wake up and find yourself in the world of your favorite video game. Just like on earth, you have to get a job, one that pertains to the game world. However, you do n't have any new skills, just the ones you had back in your universe. What is an average work day like? Continue the story:","

The story started with you being a normal human in any game. But you get fed up with that and decide to create a game where the player is actually a sentient god. This is an adventure of adventure, a game where you get to play as a god. Not only this, but the whole time you are doing stuff that is not your normal game. But after a few days, the normal game starts to change and its really weird for you: You still think it is just normal. But, you find out that in the game, you are in a world where you have to build your own base so you can get a job. The job as usual consists of taking out monsters that are in the way of your goals or you get a reward based on how well you are doing the job. But this time, while you are in the game, you decide to visit the ""world of your favorite video game"".

But like in most games, you find a new thing the second you start playing. Because this new thing is your favorite game and a little more complicated. Then you discover that you need to use some new skills in order for the game, and the world to be able to be like your favorite video game. But you are not a genius like you were when you were in your universe. You just thought that you did it that way all the time. Then you learn the game is a bit more complicated and a bit more more complicated. Your goal in the game is to gather enough food by helping your ""best friend"" - which is actually a giant turtle. Just like on Earth the game, there are things you must do to keep the food and your health up in order to make it through the level. When you get through, you get a reward based on how well the food and health of your ""best friend"" are doing for you.

But this new thing is the thing that is really weird. It's not just that you see your ""best friend"" with a huge head and that he has two large horns and a tail. It's that you have to learn about physics. On Earth, you probably saw all the dinosaurs evolve from a very small group in the beginning and that every single one of them had a tail too as the tail made them faster than all the other ones. On a spaceship, you probably saw evolution of the form of one spaceship or the form of an entire asteroid. You also Environmentally Conscious Humans have to know about the Earth. To get through the game however, you also have to do something to the Earth that makes the whole planet go up.

By learning about physics, you start to create your own spaceship. You have to pick two parts, one to build your spaceship and the other to make water with. By doing so you are able to move your spaceship from part to part in order to get water and food. You get this water and food by building up your spaceship. You only have one part to design, so you are forced to start from scratch. You begin to design a spaceship that is basically what you know from your game! The spaceship will have four hull pieces, one for the main body and the three wings, one for the engines and the third part you will only ever see when you fly on your spaceship to explore the planets.

As soon as you built the spaceship, you find out that it was impossible to save the ship! All of your parts that you had built, you lost when you were trying to repair it. However, the only parts that you have left that are on your spaceship are the parts that you only use yourself! You can save the spaceship just by repairing it with the parts that you have left. But as you repair the spaceship, the parts that are repairing the ship start to die. And the ship only works when it has a good load out of parts. Just like on Earth it is very hard to get food and water when your spaceship is full with parts.

Now that you have saved the spaceship, you now decide to move on, to the next planet. But the next planet is still so weird that all you do is fly from one planet to another, and that is not even the most strange part: You start creating whole new civilizations based on what creatures you see during your adventures!

Continue the story:"," as the crew of the ship explore the universe outside their ship, the mysteries behind the civilizations' demise begins to make itself known.

(The game is not just based on science, but also on the fictional theory that intelligent beings are capable of changing the world on a global scale. There's actually so much of this going on in the game that the author took more time to explain about it than he ever did to explain anything in the book. The game is set in a world far away from Earth, so I assume there is another planet out there already...that, or some other race of intelligent creatures which might also be capable of evolving in other ways).

In addition to this, the game has some pretty funny references to other science fiction novels. Here's a few from their dialogue:

""This is what we call a Space Station. Some of the ships on this side of the galaxy have been here over a hundred million years, and some of the stuff on this other side has been here over fifty thousand years. We're going to look up at this star that'll be our star; we look up at it every night until it's time for a look-see. Then we look up at the star we just left and watch it go by. This is what we call a Space Station. Some of the ships on this side of the galaxy have been here over a hundred million years, and some of the stuff on this other side has been here over fifty thousand years. We're going to look up at this star that'll be your star; you look up at it every night"" [The Book of Genesis (Bible: ""As it is written."")].

You are a spaceship.

How did you find your way to our universe?

And finally: there's a little story we didn't touch on which was about the game's title sequence. The original title sequence had the book title as The Book of Revelation, which the authors, Christopher and Stephen Kenson, had created while working at a non-profit frequented by atheists. They then went on to make an flew an atheist film adaptation, but it did not go very well. According to the Kenson's website:

""In 2007, we made a movie based on the Book of Revelations that was supposed to be a movie about two people and the end of the world. Unfortunately, this project just didn't make it. However, we continue to make movies based on the Bible with people that do not believe in God.""

I think many of these bits and pieces are a product of the author's own personal beliefs. I can't really think of a whole other person who thought ""well I really want to make a science fiction game that has references to all kinds of science fiction I've read and am familiar, so how about we give this guy as many references as we could possibly cram into the game and hope he'll do a good job?"" This was a mistake for a lot of reasons.

Personally, I did like this game, but I do have a little bit of a problem with it. If you read the book, you will be quite familiar with these people and all of the things they say and do. Also, there are not many interesting aliens in the series. I love those that are so fascinating to me.

At the same time, the setting is rather fascinating (the story about the Ark and the stars it orbits is absolutely amazing, I would suggest reading up on it.) However, it is also a rather unrealistic space exploration game (well, even when all those stars in the first game were all known and visible to the crew of the spaceship from the ship, Clash of the Titans isn't very interesting since, as the game's description indicates, you are looking at stars, with no knowledge of how they are used.) It is also very short, and I do not think it was even possible for every star to be seen in each map.

I can understand that some people will like it. I mean, what could be more exciting than exploring the stars in an RTS game (because when you find out more about it after playing the first one for a few hours, I think you'll appreciate it even more). What I don't understand is that when it was made, it was marketed to atheists, atheists in particular, and in particular to people who were going to read and learn about it. For example, in the game's ""About"" page in the sourcebook, the game's producer was trying to explain that he did in fact do some research and was able to come up with the idea for the setting/story/game in the early stages of the game, which"

Then write them together: One for drama and the other for comedy. (If drama includes an entirely different plot than comedy, it is preferable to split them, onewrite the same story twice. Oneas a drama and the other as a comedy. Continue the story: The second (comedy) version must contain an entirely separate, separate plot line and, therefore, new characters and new events.Repeat this until all the stories have been written.Then write them together:One for drama and the other for comedy. If you don't remember a story, just check off a box and write your own.

Once you have written all 20 of the stories, write them off:

""I write all the stories once."" (That's one of the most efficient ways of dealing with this.)

The storyteller should do the same thing: write 20 stories off.

Now, the story will be complete and the stories will be the same lengths, but this is also very important: the length should be equal. No more and no less.

If there's a difference between them, the story will never be finished. So, write it down as if you're making a long film, a TV show, a comic book etc.

This is the basic structure of story-telling. If you can't make sense of all of it, then read up on it.

It's probably not necessary to make a story out of anything if you do so.

Once you've made a story, it can be called any. If you go back in time to create your own story or novel, you're only putting yourself back into someone else's story, which is not good. If your friend writes your first novel, it's the first story he ever wrote.

As for stories to make for a drama... well, maybe just make a short story out of them if you want to.

So, all the stories you have written, take them back to their creator and you'll have a drama. Just make sure not to give the creator too much credit, they really haven't done anything to anything if you're honest.

The stories are like movies that you can add or subtract in different ways to make them fit in.

So, make the story about the protagonist, the antagonist, who will give his/her life for something more important than himself/herself...

Or you might want to tell a story that tells about the villain, with the hero going to his/her death (so that there will be something to watch for), or maybe a story with a lot of deaths.

There are endless ways on how to make the story work for your tastes. Use what works for you.

Now that you've written your stories, you need to write them out. In most cases you'll want to do these steps:

First edit the stories (reversing the last steps). Make sure it's the story you wanted, and also make sure there is a plot.

Make sure that everything is in sync (so everything makes sense). Make sure the voice is right. Make sure all the lines are in harmony.

Try not to read too many people on the internet (or have anyone else read them, as the information on how to write is the most common excuse for laziness).

If they're wrong, rewrite and make sure it's the same story, but this time put a story-list on the screen, which has the story in the format. (Some writers will be so good at reading aloud that they'll just repeat what's written on the screen for you to hear.)

Make sure it reads well.

Now go in and rewrite those last 1 or 2 pages to make sure it all flows. The most important thing to do is make sure they are not too long, or too short.

You could also rewrite that last page (it may not have to be an explicit action or a scene, so give it a small paragraph). This may help you make that last sentence sound a little more coherent, too (or if you write out as soon as you start, you'll be able to keep the writing nice and consistent the first time around).

Once the last step is done, the story is finished and the scripts are in front of you!

That's it.

So, there you have it. Some common mistakes that people make that are hard to change, but quite easy to see to change.

Now, if you want to give it a go and get it right...

Give it a crack!"

Why are lies easier to detect on the iPhone?


iPhone cameras detect the location of your head, and our sensors detect movement. In turn, the camera picks up the shape of your face - which is known EQUALLY as your personality. These features give the iPhone an unparalleled degree of accuracy.


Our facial Valencia app captures a series of images of the face with the highest possible resolution as it responds to the slightest movement. We're confident you'll agree that the image quality improves with each update. You will not have to worry about making the phone stop recording a photo if your face is not behaving naturally. Simply keep hitting the refresh button.


You can then share the photos with anyone you want. If you choose, they'll be able to see it as soon as you share it with them!


We're also confident that this app will be extremely helpful for parents of children that may not have their phones with them. Our ""Evaluation"" features are designed to determine your child's age and ability to trust others. We're also hoping that the app will facilitate a more interactive and relaxed nature for children, which translates into a better level of happiness and wellbeing.

Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith Sr. is recovering from four ruptured discs in his neck and will miss most of the 2013 NFL season. AP Photoalmost four months after the Ravens said goodbye to their No. 1 wide receiver as he hurt his back in a Week 3 loss to the New York Jets, the team on Tuesday announced Smith is doing ""well"" in rehab and it anticipates he will return in time for training camp.

Steve Smith's sister, Dannette, shared a letter from her brother-in-law, Bill Mazeroski, who had gone to see Smith Monday with his wife Karen. Steve Smith and Mazeroski were given a preview of what to expect as Steve Smith continues his rehabilitation.

BELLEVUE, WA -- Steve Smith Sr., the Baltimore Ravens team captain in his two seasons with the Ravens, went up for a TD run in Friday's game but left the game with what appeared to be a neck injury. He suffered an injury to his right nacelle about 4 ½ minutes into the third quarter of the team's 26-23 game against the Seattle Seahawks and was evaluated on the field by trainers and doctors before exiting the game in a walking boot.

Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith was ruled out on injury after he left the game to be treated for a neck injury Saturday night against Seattle.

On Tuesday, Mazeroski, Steve's mother, posted a photo of what appeared to be the quarterback on the field with a sling on his back. The tight end was listed as a visitor on the team's injury report.

A person has psychic/telekinetic/mind control powers. Based on the distance from the subject they experience lag/jitter/delay. Continue the story:," The next step is identifying the subject. Most police officers have been called to the scene before the victim and they can usually identify him by sight. A psychologist or social worker can be hired to help identify a victim. If he/she appears to be a person suffering from a mental illness. This will often resolve the situation.


If all the above has not worked, or the victim has been identified, the police may decide to charge the perpetrator with a crime. This takes the police away from the scene to try to find out things that are missing. This is done so that the victim can not be a victim or witness in the crime. The police officer may also try to determine if a mental illness is involved in the crime.


A simple step that the police can take is to take note of the nature of the subject. Usually there is a ""frightening"" face with a mouth full of blood, eyes bulging and the offender looking strong. On the other hand, the police officer does not needpling any ""fear"" to try and identify the subject.


Once any clues that might point to a mental illness are found they can be carefully evaluated.


There are three main types of mental illness:


Post traumatic stress disorder is a relatively weak form of mental illness.


Major depressive disorder is a more serious form of mental illness.


Major anxiety disorder is a form of mental illness. Sometimes referred to as manic depression.


People with major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder often have a lot of trouble coping - they may become anxious and unable to sleep. They are at higher risk for problems at work and in terms of obtaining benefits. The problem is severe enough to qualify under the Mental Health Act as a mental health crisis.


Those with the greatest difficulty coping are the most likely to end up in hospital. They are called the homeless.


The homeless are generally on the streets and will be the easiest people to get help by the police and authorities. For many this is the last hope and any help they can get from the police and authorities can be enormously crucial.


The police officer or the social worker is not the one to be thinking about the homeless person when there has been a break in the case or there is something the police could have done. They often know nothing about the matter and no longer feel able to help the homeless person anyway. In this situation the person could have been murdered and the police officer may have been responsible. The police officer may not be able to tell if the homeless person is mentally ill or not. Many times an individual can appear to be at high risk of committing a crime in a situation and the police officer is unaware.


This is why the police officer - like any officer, should do his/her best to avoid being involved with the homeless if possible. There is very little they can do to help someone who was the victim of the violent criminal acts. The only way to improve an officer's chances of being identified in a serious crime is to look for the next person. It is not realistic to expect police officers to be able to get the homeless person to a doctor or psychiatrist in time, so it is best to leave them alone.


The police may be unaware of any mental illness in this case.


A very good idea is to call your local Citizens Advice Bureau (or to ask them to refer you). This can usually be reached in one minute. In many cases they can give any kind of intervention that could be very helpful.


The police can not always find someone else to Compan to the homeless person. They are usually more aware of a person's mental illness because he/she may have been arrested. It is common for a person charged withstudying to get bailed. People with mental illness can often be very persuasive and difficult to get rid of. If the police officer is trying to avoid being associated with a homeless person he/she should take steps to do so.


In extreme cases the police may use certain techniques such as using a search dog or a thermal camera to investigate the person's home.


Mental illness tends to affect males, but it can also affect young women and elderly people. It is often difficult for them to distinguish between crime and mental illness. The victim may feel that he/she has been made to suffer and that the person who assaulted him/her is a dangerous psychotic individual. Sometimes there may be family involvement in the crime but what can seem like an accident can actually be an attempt to isolate the victim and make it difficult for him/her to leave.


It is important to look for similarities between the victim and the perpetrator of crime. This is often the main clue on which to base the investigation. The police will often call for assistance from the public to find this link. The most"
"Write the most angry, vitriolic thing you have ever written. Make it a love letter. Continue the story:","

And so here is my love letter to Bernie Sanders for the third election cycle. This post was originally published on Truthdig.com. In an effort to have them censor this piece, I have changed many of the words used in it. I apologize for this.

He took on the powers that Be, and the Clinton machine was not ready unintended victory. The election of Barack Obama is the beginning of an era in American history where the power of money has taken over the way we elect, and serve and govern. Sanders beat Clinton handily in that election. This is the real power being demonstrated. Not only did Bernie win but he beat her at critical points in the process. Why? Because he mobilized the grassroots of America. And not all of the Bernie people are on the left. He won the independents and progressives at the same time. Because he took on Big Money. And he won.

Bernie Sanders won because he understood the very basics of politics. He is a self-avowed democratic socialist. He is a guy who loves our country and the hard working men and women of middle America. Because he understands how powerful money really is.

The system is rigged, the status quo is broken. If we can win this battle, what are his and our ultimate goals in this country?

Well, there is a growing movement. People are tired of the status quo. They want to do something about it. This is what we in the Bernie movement are here to represent: people that believe in our country and the status quo, and want real change.

When he was a young Bernie Sanders said to his family, ""You know what I hate? the billionaires."" So I've been thinking about that. I think ""I hate"" is the start. In those first months we are facing some extremely powerful forces in our American political system.
 Zhao was right. ""The billionaires are not going away"" is true. But with Bernie Sanders' movement and the momentum it gives to us, I think change is coming. You know what will change that? Our society.

We have a wealth disparity. But Sanders did not stop there. He saw a problem and took on what he saw as the corrupt power structure. We have a government that is rigged. He saw that too, and took the lead.

But that is not all. That is only part of it. And it is not done. It would take a revolution to un-rig our system from the top down.

I will admit I do not have a complete picture of what I am talking about. I'm not a political professional. I have no plans to run for office. But Bernie was notolphin, I'm talking about our democratic institutions. Not to mention our political process. I hope that our movement will take off beyond this year and I believe we will win, but the key right now is to take Bernie's ideas and make them real in this current election cycle. I am not talking about a dream scenario so much as it is a movement that starts now. It's time to take a stand.

I am not talking about revolution so much as it is a revolution that will start now. It's time to take Bernie's ideas and make them real in this current election cycle. I am not talking about a dream scenario so much as it is a movement that starts now. It's time to take a stand.

I think the revolution begins by waking up. So I'm going to tell you guys a story that is going to sound really scary, but also pretty good. All it would take is two of you to think about it for two days, and then we can all do it too.

This is my second year in college. I went from struggling in high school, to struggling in college. I needed something, anything to make it up to everyone when it comes to student debt and how much I have to pay off. Then once I took that first job out of college, I didn't pay off what I already owed. I think I was in default on half if all my student loans. For about six or so months everything went away. Then one day, nothing ever returned. But I went back and looked at my checkbooks and found I owed $80,000. The thing is, the amount was in good standing, so I still owed $6,000 or so. But I still owed way more than I actually earned. It was not like my life was bad. What was going on? I think in my head I just went through the motions. I thought I could just ignore the $80,000. I could pay it off, and that was probably how the story went. It didn't happen, but I guess I never checked my debt situation. I just went back and did it over. And then that was the story I told when I came"

But the best advice to stay home isn't more of the same. It's to read at least one magazine devoted entirely to science fiction. ""Gone with the Wind"" by A.C.

""The Martian'' by Andy Weir is an amazing novel — well, it's the kind of book that's great at being a masterpiece on one level and just not something I'd like to listen to while strolling down a city sidewalk on my way to work. I've heard there is a Mars mission of a similar variety, but not in the same world as ""The Martian.""

""Science Fictionagonists.com"" and ""The Short Fiction Page"" have both been great, and have been around long enough that most people should be able to get at least one story out of them. These blogs also often feature other genres (usually fiction, but some poetry and drama have appeared).

And even if you can't find a blog devoted entirely to science fiction — which sometimes feels like too much of a niche market in the first place — you might be a fan of other writers. For instance, you can check out ""Fiction Writers of Science Fiction,"" a blog of many prominent writers of SF who have also done the covers for anthologies, books or otherwise been featured in magazines, or on TV shows.

I suspect most of us would enjoy this kind of stuff if not for the fact that it costs thousands of dollars to buy a magazine every year and you can barely afford to buy one new every year. Which is why some of the best stories might not be published at all. Maybe some of the best writers only make it onto a book or a comic.

""Science"" is also not the only genre whose stories get swept under the rug. There are other great stories told in genre fiction by writers who don't do covers and whose stories will be missed even in the best-selling books, from ""Harebrained Schemes"" to ""Tale of the coffee-drinking alien"" to ""The Martian,"" which has been called ""a tale of man and machine.""

Still, I hope that you'll get out as much of the most interesting stuff in science fiction as you can before ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" come out."

""I won't fail you.""


This is a fun adventure, but at its heart you are dealing with a moral quandary, as you feel it for yourself. Will you choose ""yes"" or ""no"" to the bargain, or do you know what the right thing to do is?


This game is a lot like the two-dimensional ""Hippie"" movies of the '60's. There are two different sides to each story though. The first side is much broader, dealing with a much more personal matter. It isn't just ""what could happen to you?"" and it's not just ""how are you going to survive?"" It is more in-depth than that and explores what it means to be moral.


When you win the wish, you can either give it to your younger self to be passed on to the next life or else you have to be left there as a witness, knowing to ask ""Is it the same deal I was making? Is it better for me? Has it affected me?""

The sequel to 'Kabuki', The End of the World (The Story of Love & War), had many similarities to this game. You play a young girl named Asagi Kataoka, who has been kidnapped by the evil Baron Triton. You come to think that you are destined to be a villainous figure, even though you are a true love for your captor.

You decide to help her escape and return her to her own time (it is not all bad) or to take over the world. It is a choice you are forced to make, but it is also a moral dilemma within you.


It is a very short game (you play a couple of levels). Like the game before, the story isn't focused on the plot. However, the story's progression is still very interesting and at times shocking. There are many plot twists which you are given a real chance to try to uncover.

To make 'Kabuki' work as well as possible, the game used a lot of cut scenes, in which many characters were shown together. Some characters in this story were characters you didn't know, or don't want to know. Some you barely saw, and most of these scenes were only hinted at at the beginning. I would recommend you get the story of the game before playing the demo in order to get the full experience from the game.

There is a lot going on, a few sub-plots are scattered throughout the game. You are given an overview of these, but they don't change what lies ahead. They can only give you a hint, or at the very least, a hint that you will most likely discover sooner or later, perhaps even in the game-play itself. They are a fun diversion that make the whole story feel more real.

Although there are many sub-plots in the story, there were one or two which really stood out as being stand-out. Perhaps the most famous was the first main subplot that took you through the story of Kataoka's mother dying. She was an avid shopper, and as such, had a lot going for her. She was also from the Sengoku Period (the early '1500's - late '1800's). She was a very intelligent woman who was very intelligent in regards to literature, and she thought that she was the only good book.


The storyushed, and it became one of the key themes behind 'Kabuki'. It was very compelling as it showed you the life you had lost with her through no fault of her own. A father who was devoted to his daughter, and who had been with her for a very long time. He had given her everything he had ever given his own daughter. When she became ill, and unable to work, he died and so did many of the friends and family he'd come to know, especially with the changes of his country (nowadays Japan). All of it was just so heartbreaking and heartbreaking, it truly had a huge impact on you. It was a very sad tale which you truly felt the loss of. You couldn't help but think how much that must have meant for her. It is a story that really made you feel the emotion of loss so many times.

To help move things along, you are given a letter by a childhood friend of your childhood friend. What your childhood friend had shared with you that you don't remember, but had already known for years later, is that he came to Tokyo in the '80s, as a newbie from a small town in eastern Japan.

The man 'worried' by earthquakes that hit Pakistan has now gone so far as putting a sign on his kitchen window to show the locations of the quakes. 'The sign is just a piece of plastic and sticks onto a piece of cardboard and when I shake a glass of water in my glass maker it will fall down and will show the location of the earthquake,' Mohammed Iqbal is quoted as saying.

While his daughter did not go to work that day, Iqbal has a Facebook posting from 2012 which reads: 'In case of an earthquake near Pakistan (yesterday) I don't dare to open the window'.

Iqbal claimed the sign and the post were an act of protection and that his daughter always carries a sign in case of an earthquake in case of any natural disaster. He has also set up a GoFundMe page to support people suffering from natural disasters in Pakistan.

In 2012, Iqbal wrote on Facebook: 'In case of an earthquake near Pakistan, I don't dare to open the window. I have two children.'

It follows the death of Shabana Mahmood who was rescued from her own house and found herself trapped with her two newborn babies. Her children 'couldn't escape':

She also had to be rescued from her own home, and was rescued a third time after the same earthquake, before dying again:

If you watch the video, you'll see the horror of the mother who is lying on her stomach, her two young children crying and begging for their mother's life.

The mother had been trying to make one last call to be rescued when the tsunami hit the small town of Mianwali in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

But as the tsunami hit the town, the building she was waiting on collapsed and the couple had to run for their lives and start a rescue operation.

Weigh runtime: Shabana Mahmood had to be rescued from her own home and was rescued more than a third time after the same earthquake

Iqbal told The Independent: 'The earthquake and the tsunami hit the village. The houses were completely destroyed, so the girls had to stay inside the houses and watch the tsunami and rescue activities.

'The house we rented with the electricity was hit by an earthquake. The roof collapsed and it came down around the third floor and she stayed behind and watched. Then we took water from one of the nearby well and had to try to move the kids to the lower floor.

'I couldn't get to them so I had to use the bathroom before we left. I did that for about 45 minutes, but the girls were so scared. Later I had to go back to help them, and she was still on the phone from the other end.

'My daughter said to me the children were crying and crying and they couldn't see either one of us.

Shock: Shabana Mahmood with her two newborn babies. Pictured in 2012, with her husband Mohammed Iqbal

'When I found them, it was too late. They had both died. I lost my own husband too, we could not survive the tsunami.

'The earthquake and tsunami shook the whole village. There was water coming out of everywhere too. My little granddaughter's brother had come to check us the second time I rescued him from the house after he was hit by the earthquake.

'I did not see the children but I was so worried that it would hit them at least twice. The kids were all screaming and crying.

'The first time my daughter and I could not stand it much longer and we went to take a bath. Then when we went back out for the second time, we had to carry the couple back because the second quake hit the village. We were caught between the two huge waves. The house was completely destroyed, there was water coming out of everywhere. The kids all had their eyes swollen shut.

'We tried to save them, but some of them were drowned. Then we put them out of the house and rushed the whole family to the hospital.' Iqbal said: 'They were so hungry and thirsty and there were no food or water to drink. Sometimes they would go two or three days without water.

'I asked them how old they were, and they said that they were only two. But they had to live in the open with the sun shining and no houses to go to.

Break my heart with only a divorce scenario. Continue the story:,"

You and your spouse are now financially divorced. Your assets are divided by the rules of equitable distribution. There is a right to the assets within each party's individual estate (subject to the limits and limitations set forth in the laws of the State of Texas for such division). The parties agree in writing which assets are ""intangible,"" and which are ""nonintangible."" Intangible assets, according to the Austin County Appraisal District, include land, fixtures, and improvements; intellectual property (e.g., computer software); professional services; and the use of cash and checks. Nonintangible assets, according to the Appraisal District, include real estate, life insurance policies, and property acquired with the use or benefit of a mortgage. In other words, this means, if any assets are ""intangible,"" they are owned by both spouses and therefore cannot be transferred until all are owned by one or both of them or their spouses. It is recommended that each spouse have custody of the movable assets (the ones that you want to get rid of first) and the other spouse should take the movable assets and sell them as soon as he or she can. (The sale of the immovable assets should be the last part of the divorce. This will ensure that the remaining assets are not used to purchase more property and thus increase the total ""intangible"" assets.) Keep in mind that some nonintangible assets can be sold as soon as they are realized. The best thing you can do to avoid ""intangible"" land that you want to get rid of is to go right to the government (if you have the means). The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a lot of very valuable information on property transfer rules and methods (http://www.hud.gov/programs/landholdings.asp). You will also want to talk with an attorney to help you with your property transfer. In Texas, divorce is a ""civil"" (i.e., nonmonetary) action, so any real properties (property owned by both spouses or their spouses) may be put in a ""land trust"" for the purpose of giving the property to the ""spouse"" with the ""property rights"" to those assets. Since a separate ""domicile"" must be established in order to benefit from all of these, it is more useful to establish separate ""land trusts"" for each spouse just so that they can be more easily accessed for those purposes rather than having to go to the trouble of giving up property that they actually need in order to divorce.

In order to qualify, one spouse must have assets under $250,000 in that spouse's name, $175,000 in the other spouse's name, and must be unable to access the property without ""unreasonable"" difficulty and expense (i.e., unreasonable financial burden). The spouse who is legally separated from his or her spouse is the only one who has rights over the assets in the marriage. If you have a child born in your marriage, you will not have any rights over the child but you will be required to ""contribute"" your property to the care and maintenance of the child. All future marital property (marriage securities, property transferred under a ""civil"" marriage, child support payments and tax withholdings for your spouse's benefit) will be automatically transferred to the new spouse's name and your interests in those will be deemed to be included in your legal assets as of the date you made that transfer (this includes any trust you may have). As is the case with family trusts, you only need to contribute your property until the date the property is physically transferred, and the new spouse could receive the property before you are entitled to it, and not even until the date the funds are deposited in the account and cannot be withdrawn from it until the account reaches the new account holder. It is not possible to transfer property in a divorce except in a ""divorce by settlement of intestate accounts"" (discussed after the divorce), but unlike a ""civil"" divorce, which cannot be suspended, a marriage will be deemed successful (and terminated) if at least one party remarries, takes custody of a child (and has custody of the child) before the divorce, has a child (or both children) at the end of the marriage, and that person has custody of the child until the date those two children receive their final inheritance.

A non-Texas resident who seeks support from another jurisdiction has more difficult issues. Most states do not recognize foreign marriage, and Texas does not recognize marriage between more than one person. Therefore, if you are a non-Texan and seeking support from a Texas resident, you will have to hire an attorney to deal with the probate issues. If you are a Texas resident and filing for or participating in any other civil action in another state, if you obtain support on behalf of the non-Texas resident, and also obtain payment from the"

"After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. Continue the story:","

The Atlantic Ocean is the longest continuous ocean on earth yet this has never been confirmed. The area in question is in the Atlantic Ocean between Greenland and the North Sea. The first European explorers to reach the ocean in the nineteenth century claimed that this region was much further south than they had been led to believe. They claim that it was in fact not in the same shape or size as it had been depicted to be in old maps. There were at least three different explanations for this lack of similarity but in the end all agreed that the region was not to that far south as depicted by the maps. However, there are three ways that the ocean could have moved between the different regions depending on the weather conditions. (1) If there was an unusually cold water or large amount of salt water then the surface of sea floor could be pushed farther down and the remaining ocean floor could not support the weight of the surface. It can be noted that the sea floor and surrounding land have been moved upward for over 200,000 years according to geologist Jack Horner. The ocean also can be moved if the salt water is high in salt content making it very difficult to move it and causing the sea floor to move upward. (2) This would cause the water to be stirred up and it would not take as long for the layers to be removed as in this case and, (3) The waves on the ocean could be swept far over the ocean floor and leave a layer that, when measured on land, would not look anything like what they depict.

(1) If the Atlantic Ocean was frozen out it would never be possible, or at least it would be very hard for a man to travel from Europe and make his way to Greenland. (2) If the ocean was very shallow it could take much longer and the ocean floor could be moved upwards. (3) Waves at the base of the ocean could also be high in salt content making them much more difficult to move.

(Note - There are some reports of the ocean moving from north of Greenland, but it is just possible that the report was referring to the top of Greenland. If this were the case the ocean would fall between Iceland and Norway.)

On the other hand, it is more likely that the ocean was moved between Greenland and the southern North Atlantic (the North Atlantic Ocean). This is the area that was depicted as a giant archipelago with hundreds of islands and thousands of ships.

For the purposes of the ocean movement the best reference is probably the work of geologist Jack Horner. His book The Atlantic Islands was published in 1882. He drew a map of the Atlantic and then calculated the distance between North and South Atlantic islands. Based it on this diagram he proposed a route that runs south from the North Atlantic to Greenland. According to his calculations the total distance is roughly 6,000 miles.

This makes it possible to calculate that the distance to Greenland must be between 4,500 miles and 6,000 miles. This would place the position of the ocean in relation to the current location (i.e. between Iceland and Norway) at around 50 degrees North. Assuming that the northern parts of the sea floor were deeper, this would mean that the ocean might have moved south in relation to that location. Horner's calculations suggested that the entire ocean might have moved between 4,600 miles and 6,000 miles at some point during the last 5,000 years, with the most likely location being between Iceland and Greenland at either 60 degrees East or 60 degrees West.

This figure is roughly correct although this is not the only way ocean movement could have occurred. The Atlantic Ocean can be moved by the ocean currents in the Atlantic as well. As the currents move north they move eastwards. The North Atlantic currently is at around 60 degrees East when it is moving north. As the currents move eastwards they pass over the North Cape of Scotland some 2,500 miles south of the North Pole. The current in the Atlantic will carry heat eastward (over a large area and in many directions) to the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica. By moving north the current has to go back to whence it came, where it starts. This will start to work out over a period of time (up to 20,000 years or as long as you care to keep records). It is this process in that direction that will cause the ocean to return to its original location for a second time in a thousand years at the North Pole.

The Atlantic currents are moving due east. However the flow does not stop at the Atlantic end.

The current then flows south through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and then is carried east towards the Pacific by the Gulf Stream.

This last part is where the story gets interesting. The Gulf Stream is a very thin current originating in the Bay of Fund"

The world is not going to turn out well, nor was it ever going to turn out well. Not in the future. And I know my country is at the end of its tether - a little bit. As a matter of fact, we have just a few weeks left - not longer - and it seems that it will be impossible to solve this emergency situation. And a terrible thing has happened. ""And I know my country is at the end of its tether - a little bit. As a matter of fact, we have just a few weeks left - not longer - and it seems that it will be impossible to solve this emergency situation."" And this, I say, is madness. It is madness. It is madness. What can I do? I have to talk about this. How shall I talk about what has occurred? I said what I have to say. Of course I have to talk about it. Why don't you listen? I am going to tell you. I am going to tell you that we are now going to have Laos and all these people will come, and they will kill us, and we will kill them, and it will be a tragic situation. And this, I tell you, is happening to us. And there is nothing anybody can do about it now. Nothing, no way. And I am afraid that a lot of people are going to get it all their own way. And they will be able to do it, anyway. I mean a lot. We have to leave it to them. As we have just been told, it is beyond our means. But we will not leave it to them. And that is the way it is. And I tell you this with all sadness because I know it cannot be stopped, because there is no one to stop it. And what can humanity say about it? The humans are the mechanism of the machine. What can humankind say about it? And my advice to anyone who is involved in it - what can humanity say? We have made some progress, but we are losing it. And that is the way it is. I am afraid that we will lose it, we have to lose it. And we will die in it. The machinery does not want to die, and the machines do not want to die. They would rather live on in the society than let itself die. The machines are the cause of human misery, human evil. And the machines are the cause of these people, I am afraid, who are going to try to kill each other.


The first of the people (which includes the people as it happens) who have come here to my country from the other side of Europe and North America to try to destroy my country - they have already taken what was left of my country and have destroyed my culture, my religion, my language, my culture. For no reason. They have destroyed everything of me - all these things."

Write a scene from Game of Thrones as if it took place in neighboring trailer parks in Florida Continue the story:,"

A woman who lives near a trailer park set to be closed for the winter told The Hollywood Reporter that a new owner is building two separate subdivisions at the trailer parks. She spoke for the first time about her experience last week, when a group that included a man from the trailer park asked her if she had been seen wearing jewelry, and when she opened her door to reveal a note that the women had written on the floor with a Sharpie and asked her to tell her who had written it.

""I was like, 'No, I have no jewelry,'"" she said, adding that she and four others were escorted from the trailer park by the police while the women were interviewed.

She estimated that between two and 10 women live in the trailers, and said authorities are trying to track down the group behind the vandalism. Local media reported that another person who lives in the area of the trailer parks had seen the notes and contacted authorities.

""It's crazy,"" she said, adding that she has had a hard time accepting the ""ituence"" she's been forced to live with, adding that she has no choice but to be an only child. She said that she's also concerned she might feel uncomfortable after sharing her story with authorities because of how her family has reacted to her being a minority: ""They want me to give up everything,"" she said, ""but I don't want to give up my life.""

Local television station WTLV says that authorities believe the woman was targeted because she is undocumented and could be deported. The station interviewed the man who owns the house nearest to the trailer park last week ROFL (Runaway, Run Away!) who said he was not aware of any of the problems, but said some of the tenants there had been harassing other residents. ""I'm not racist, I'm not homophobic — it's just a matter of having that type of mentality,"" he was quoted as saying.

The woman has a husband, the station reports, and her children are in law school. Her husband's work has been disrupted in the past, and she added that she believes this new property has ""put even more stress on the financial situation of her family that they just can't handle,"" WTLV reported.

Authorities reported that the house in question was being purchased for a new owner by one or more people and that those people could have the property for as little as about $12,800, according to WTLV. The trailer park's first owner recently changed, according to the report, to one who was a homeowner at the time that the trailer park was established. ""I don't know exactly where the trailer park is.""

The neighborhood has endured controversy and increased crime for a number of years, the Los Angeles Times recently reported. In February 2015, a white man in the area shot a Latino man, Pedro Avila, who was shot once in the back while he was sitting in his car on a streetiga the man was sitting in. The victim, who was not named, died several days later.

Earlier this year, on a small hillside, a neighbor wrote on his Facebook page that he had ""got a call that a man with an AK-47 opened fire, went on a rampage firing at his neighbors' heads down hill. There is a police station on the hill there."" A similar incident occurred in February 2015 at the intersection of East 6th and South Hill, when someone walked up from behind with a small bomb on them, before walking back across the street. There was an 11-month standoff in which police used explosives and tear gas to bring the man > down, with authorities now saying they've found and arrested one of two suspects.

While she has no comment about these matters, the woman did say she can tell someone out there ""got what they deserved for being racist, but imagery is just pictures. Words alone take you to the heart."""

You're like the other superheroes - in your hands they're dangerous, powerful weapons.

You 'll make them very lucky indeed.

That's some pretty impressive self-control. And here we are. You 'll have a fun varied life, I have.

Goodbye to that.

You know why? 'Cause I want 'em to be happy.

Do you guys have anything in common, or does each character come with its own quirks?

I'm going to be honest with you - they all have some kind of personality. Whether it' s just a smile, a giggle or a giggle in their teeth.

How do these characters interact with each other? A lot of these are quite personal and the team dynamic seems great.

We're friends, but it's a lot more than that.

I wouldn't mind being part of the gang. It's a huge amount of fun.

How much of the creative process were we talking to you from? Did you get a lot of feedback from the writers, or did you have to do some of that yourself?

Both. I got a lot of feedback on the first episode. Obviously with all the great talent that is on the show, there was some tremendous feedback.

We do go into every episode with three or four different drafts. I'm looking forward to these next few episodes. I'm really excited of where the show's going!

What did you make of the first episode? Did you miss any of it?

I got a great amount of feedback on Episode 1 of the show, which is why there was a lot of changes.

How did they take that feedback and add it into Episode 2?

We really get to really play around with some of these characters and see them go beyond what we've seen before. I love it.

Have you ever wanted to be part of an amazing TV show, but not so sure that you could do it?

You know, I wouldn't call myself a 'hackers' guy. I'm not really into that stuff.

I'm not a computer guy. That's no fun.

I just like to relax and be with my friends. I do not have the insecurity to get myself into any kind of box. I hope that people can find something that they enjoy that will be entertaining for them, and don't be afraid to say that you don't know anything about it.

"at wedding of the woman you love, and you 're the best man. Continue the story:"," Tell them about your friend, say how you wish they'd be, and tell them why it's all you're doing.

For their friends, it's the ""I knew your boyfriend/girlfriend was your kind when I met you, so I wanted to find my ""real"" match"" routine in the early stages, that way if they end up getting ""just like me"" and you're in a relationship, they are sure to not be disappointed.


They should say something along the lines of, ""I know it's really hard to choose the man who is the person I love and respect the most, but you're the best man I've ever met"" or ""I know you've tried to think of a good fit with someone but you just couldn't make it work, so I'm not asking anymore - it's all I've ever heard you talking about, and my trust really pays off when I can really feel as if it's all been made concrete with you by now"".


For the guy it's all the cracks in his relationship, you've told him so, and it's been months, and that's enough to make him feel the same way about the relationship...but tell him it's all been worth it, because you're the only one you'll ever love.


Remember, you should be asking more than they are. Even at your wedding, when it's all said and done you should stay more than friends and tell them what to say, but say nothing to the ""other"" people in the ceremony.


That's how you should be playing it. When it's already done, you shouldn't say it to anyone at all. They can be really annoying after all.


I know this is a long one, so I'm posting it in case I'm being stupid and saying it's easier -but you should never explain more to the guy.


You are not the man, you are the marriage, and the man needs to know so he can be happy.


I've asked myself this question over and over, since my ex cheated on me, and this one is a hard one to answer.First, you should take yourself out of it entirely. You don't need an ex to help you get an ""awesome"" marriage. Your new family shouldn't have done anything to hurt you Increase the number of things you do for each other and be there for each other as they grow. Ask them to be there for your recovery.Tell them you feel you haven't come out enough. (you aren't the man, but the relationship is the man)You do have to give. Even when you knew this isn't right, you need to have the honesty to give it back. You've had an open-ended conversation with yourself about these things with your ex-boyfriend. You have to look for the truth that was said. Maybe you weren't right about this -maybe they do need love. Maybe what you've been told is right, and maybe it is.Maybe when you start to heal and ask yourself what exactly has happened you'll notice, just like the ex had noticed, maybe they still need some love.I will not judge them by how they handle themselves. I will not judge them by what they've said.I will not judge them by their reaction. I will not judge them by any of their actions that they've taken.If you're a girl and you've been in an open ended conversation with yourself with a guy and he's been telling you about his past and how bad he feels, he hasn't done this to you, then it is your duty to tell him, and your duty to act on it, and your duty to trust him, and to do what he asks when you're going out.When a girl starts to feel like the guy isn't having feelings for her anymore, after she is in love with the guy and feeling completely betrayed, it's ok, because you know that something has gone wrong, and at that point you should really just tell the guy.Tell all the stories of everything you've done for him, and then tell his partner what he did to you. Tell him how he betrayed you, how he tricked you into wanting to come down to the top level, and what he did to make sure you stayed there, and then you should tell them what this all means.Don't say things like ""it never entered my mind this was any of my business, and I don't feel badly about it"" or ""it all ended when I found you, and so this is how you were meant to be"".This sounds so fucking lame and self-dep governor that you just say it when you're trying so hard not to say it.This should be your default thing to say when you're in love, you should just put it off until the end of the relationship and then it will be okay.If"

I'm going to let my readers do the research, and I'll start here with an interesting fact: The name of our planet, Earth, is said to have its origin in the Egyptian hieroglyphs that I mentioned in the beginning. They tell us that in the Egyptian Hieroglyphs is spelled ""Nefertari."" (I am not sure what that means, I guess there is a group of people called ""The Ancients"" who came up with the names for things in the Egyptian language, so that way all hieroglyphs could be translated). The Ancient Egyptians had a tradition of magic. Magic, in this case, was a religion and could involve things like summoning gods by writing magical spells on tablets or by drawing magic from certain places - for example, the Moon. In those days, they thought that the Moon was very large, and one could write spells on it. So the Egyptians wanted to summon a deity by writing ""Pawwaw"" (Pawwaw is an Ancient Egyptian word for moon. What they wanted to do was a summoning spell for a large moon of the Moon... the Moon... it went ""woo woo woo"" and the entity, whatever it may be, wanted to come to earth. It did not come for the sun or anything else. It came for them). So the Egyptians wrote the spell, written it on a piece of paper, and went, ""This is what I want you to do."" Then they gave this piece of paper to a priest named Ptah. A month later the priest said in his priest's diaries, ""This is what I want written on the paper that is on the top of this papyrus. And I want it to be a message, an invitation, a challenge. So look here...."" The next thing I know, the guy who had written on the bottom of the papyrus goes ""What's this? I want to eat this cake. I want to eat this cake and when I swallow this cake, I'll be invincible."" Well, that's how magic and summoning spells worked! I don't know what it means, but it sure sounds like magic to me! Anyway, we know magic works to summon the Gods. But not only that, the Egyptians used magical creatures called  Efreeti. I want you to know that Efreeti comes from the word `Efo` meaning angel, 'eftal' (which means god) and 'tifa' meaning wing or feather. So, the Efreeti are very strong creatures who can easily kill humans even with the use of magic so all Egyptians were on the good side of things. At first, they summoned Efreeti for a few days to protect humanity on the dark side of the moon. Then at night when there was full moon, they summoned them again. This was not a good tactic for those who worshiped the Moon Lord, who wanted people to get rid of all the Efreeti by night. So the Egyptians created Efreeti creatures from the dark side of the moon. So when people in Egypt went into the dark side of the moon and saw Efreeti, they would come home very sad! They used to say, ""Oh, my Efreeti.... why have you gone so far away? When were the Efreeti going to come back now? Don't you know that Efreeti have some feelings! And we're going to be very sad if they are gone!"" The Egyptians were very good to those who worshipped the moon. Then there was a man named Horus who believed that he was only one of the many gods oflaughter, and that he alone could summon the Goddess, the Great Goddess Amun, to protect mankind. So this is a little back story just to make it all clear, but if you want to know more, you can visit www.mwomercs.com/mwomercs101/story.html (I'm going to leave you with this one: There was a man called Thoth who lived in Egypt, and he was one of the most famous and wise men in the world. The man died, leaving the world in his wake, without any one to finish what he started. He is believed to have written the Book of Revelations in his blood for the purpose of finishing the job of protecting"

You are an omnipotent god. Out of boredom you decided to live an ordinary human life vowing not to use your power. 15 years has pass and you have a 9 to 5 working for a major tech company. Your boss has been tormenting you for years and you have reach your limit Continue the story:," My name is Jhavradh Chaudhury, we are from Punjab. I was a big fish in the small pond of Punjab. I used to make money for the rich people. We were very good professionals, very fast. The reason why my boss was harassing me to not use my power. So I decided to try my new hobby and got good salary. I was an amateur. However I always dreamt of going to another country to seek a good life and started work in India. During those years, I was enjoying my life in India where it is easy to stay there. Then I got some bad luck. One day I was standing on the street, when some boy threw a bucket of cold water on my head. Then he hit me against a tree. I was stunned, and then I woke up in a hospital. I have suffered more pain. My wife came to the hospital with me. I want to tell you about what happened to me. I was asked to get up from bed. It was a cold day, and I was not used to the cold. I was afraid that my wife was not really happy and would have hit me at any time. So I got up. But my foot slipped and my foot is completely crushed. So I started my journey. I went to Delhi and visited doctor in an emergency department. I was not really fit to get out of bed. I was in agony. My pain was so high. The doctor asked, if I could not work, why should I seek treatment for pain on my body. Then my pain subsided and I was able to walk on my own. I took pain medications from the doctor and took rest. After a while I was out and after visiting another doctor I was given a replacement foot. The doctors told me, you are now going to spend six months in a hospital. The first thing I asked them was to give me a new foot.

At the time I had not reached even a millimeter below my level. I was not happy, because I was very disappointed; because I did not want to do something that was not even the point of my life. I had not even learned how to use the bathroom, how to bathe, how to eat, or to shower. I had been living in a constant misery. I was never happy. I thought how I could make a change. Then I realized that I also have the opportunity to do something good. I thought to give up my job, because I was completely depressed and wanted to take a break from my misery. I could stop my medication. I could go for medical examination. Feminist and rights activists are going to take action against my situation.

One can also get rid of his job too or a family arrangement or do other things that will make life happier. I decided not to wait for any of the above. I knew that my only opportunity was to take up the fight against this oppression and fight for the rights that were denied me by my own society. The struggle begins from the inside. I started organizing a campaign to get medical examination as a condition for getting treatment for my foot. I started calling, writing the following lines to my family: ""For five years, my foot has been stuck in pain. But I have not got any medical evidence for my claim. If we are to keep you together, please get medical certificate from doctors who is willing to give treatment to you. Please come to your workplace or in any other location and talk about the pain that you have been experiencing in your body. Please do whatever you can.""

My letter was received only in the middle of the night. But after talking to other women activists, I managed to manage to reach the doctor. When I got to the lab, the doctor assured me that there is a medical certificate, but he cannot help me. It is not safe for me, he said. I was very disappointed, because the same thing has happened to the other woman comrades. Also, the doctor said, that is not possible for me. The doctor suggested treating me with herbal medicine. I asked for some information and I was told, a lot of medicinal plant is available in Punjab town. I wrote again to my family, that my foot is still very bad, my life had been difficult, and that this is not the first time that I had been harassed by my boss. I explained that no one listened to me. I started trying to get support for my struggle. So far I have received more than 100 support letters. Some young activists from Delhi wrote me support letters. I started reaching out to them all. They helped me out with my medication.

I am happy and proud that I have been able to"

Go back to the main path Find the girl Run to the left side of the street and jump down the gap on the nearby building to reach the girl Run to the right side of the street and jump down the gap to reach the girl Find the girl Run to the right and jump into the water to find her Jump over the top of the building to reach the girl Run to the left and hop over the hole and jump over the roof to reach the girl Go to the right side of the street and jump onto the roof Find the girl Run to the right and jump onto the roof Run to the left side of the street and jump onto the roof Find the girl Run to the left and jump into the water to find her Jump onto the water to go through to the next side, skip the rocks on the way Run over the rocks and jump into the water to reach her Jump back to the ground and then grab onto the edge of the cliff to be floated over to the girl Run under the cliff to reach the girl Run to the right side of the street and jump onto the roof to find the girl Run to the right and jump into the water to find her Jump over the edge again to reach the girl Find the girl Run to the right and jump onto the roof to find her Drop down to the ground, run toward the wall by the side of the building, jump and hop over the edge to reach the girl Run to the right and jump onto the edge of the building to reach the girl (Run behind the building, to the right) Jump onto the cliff to reach the girl (Run out of the way to avoid the rocks next to you) Run to the left and jump behind the building to snag the girl Jump over the cliff and grab onto the platform to go up, skip the rocks with the girl Run to the right side of the street and jump onto the ledge to grab onto the woman's body and then jump off the ledge down to reach the girl (She will be on the other side Senator's office) (Run into your house and get out) This is the part where you do the fight, and I recommend to be prepared and use your skill to kill the boss without the help of weapons.

(Fight with just a weapon, or with a weapon with a longer range)

There is an alternate way of doing this fight in Death by Degrees. A player can actually skip the main hallway, so he gets through to the end safely: Run to the beginning of the hallway, or run to the end, or run out of the hallway right after. Once he gets past this you automatically go to the door at the back and it will be open. Now, run through the door straight back to finish the boss without using weapons.


To get here, you may have to run through the second hallway. If you need a weapon for this fight, you can obtain this weapon in a little shop at the start of the fight. In the second room, go through one of the doors on the left and then back on the right to get to the other door. If you want to run from the boss in a straight line, and you can't escape, you can use the trick mentioned in the previous point.


Now:


Go to the main hall, but go to the left side first. Jump over or through the opening of the second wall, and jump through the opening of the wall on the right, and through the opening of the wall on the left. Now, run to the right, up the stairs and go down the stairs again. This time, turn left, and jump back onto the ledge at the top of the stairs. Drop down, and jump over the edge to reach the girl. She is on the top floor. Run all the way back to the second door to open the exit hallway (This one has a bit more loot if not done in the last room). You can now run to the door at the top to exit the building


Now:


Go to the top floor to make sure for the boss fight you will not be able to run straight. Now, run through the door to the left, and turn left, and run through the doorway to the right. Now, go all the way back from door number 2, and turn right to go to the next door. Take the left door and run through the door before it. The next two doors are on the left. After you pass the hallway for the first one, turn right and go through the doorway for the second one. And so on, that is it. Good luck and have fun with the fight!

The Final Boss

After you beat the game, look for the first secret door you came into in the game. This will trigger the final boss.

As it is mentioned before, the boss here has a different attack. Basically, he'll attack you like you can dodge (this"

"You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other. Continue the story:","


-The two of you go to the cafe to see your friends - You talk to your friends about the dream you are having in a friendly manner.


-The two of you talk about your dream until your friends return and tell you it's over.


-You try to remember all the strange events that happened to your body and mind.


-You are not sure how long you have been dreaming - maybe as long as 24 hours.


-The first time you are in a lucid dream, your body is warm and happy - you think its thanks to the warm feelings you got from your friends. However, a minute later you feel really weird and ill - you need to go to the bathroom. As soon as you get out you find you are unable to walk. You fall to the ground - but a second Realization sets you free. You have been dreaming and are back in the real world with a new body. You begin to wonder what has happened to your body. One moment, it is still warm and happy. The next, its cold and sick and you can hardly keep your head up. In the middle of your mind, you are confused. You find yourself in the hospital. Your body thinks you have lost consciousness. The nurses and doctor can't figure it out.


Some nights, you wake up feeling strangely light. As you have become a fully functioning human, you notice this. You decide to go to the doctor with this idea. You make your way to his office and he greets you quite warmly. He smiles, but then says ""Ah, I forgot to mention your name - it's Jack"".

Your name is Jack. Jack asks, ""How come some nights when I wake up in a cold sweat, I notice a different color then that of usual - ""Jack"" and not ""Jack"""". You explain, ""It was something I didn't mean to happen when we were in a lucid dream. It's something that happened after we woke up."" Jack tells you that it is most likely just a little bit of your brain's sleep cycle messing you up while dreaming and he'll get you back to normal as soon as possible. He recommends that you give this a try and that you just do it anyway.


You agree with Jack. You give yourself another try, but not for 24 hours. You begin to feel that you are a little drowsy again. Your sleep routine changes - now you work the night shift from Thursday until Saturday. When you wake up, you begin to feel refreshed. You realize your body is adjusting to your new routine and it is time to do your job.


When you get out of bed for work on Saturday morning, you notice your back is feeling slightly strange. You decide to go have a look and see if you are okay. It is not unusual to hear your coworkers talking on the phone so you go out to greet them. The woman says, ""Hey Jack, what are you doing?"" you say, ""I have a job."" The woman responds, ""Oh? It's a bit boring here, you should try working there."" You reply, ""Well, it's nice to have something different..."" She goes on, ""No, you already do. You already go to work every day."" You start to smile and say, ""Yeah I go to work every day."" The woman adds, ""Hey I can see it in your face. You are happy."" You say, ""Yeah, it was probably the dream. You've got some sort of feeling here."" You look down. You are not wearing the suit you were wearing at the time. The woman says, ""You do look really normal today."" As she looks down, she realizes that the suit is probably not the best fit for you.


She suggests looking for a new one.


You can't help but notice that you look older, but not younger. The woman calls you and tells you to meet up for tea. She has a lot of her work done and you sit down. As you approach the door of the building, the old woman asks, ""Jack, what time is your cup?"" You reply that it is 3:00 and there is no need to wait. The old woman asks, ""Jack, what time is your cup?"". You reply that it is 3:00 and there is no need to wait. The old woman says, ""So you want to come back with me to work today? Well I can tell you are a bit hungry, so I'm going to come with you for dinner."" As she starts to move away, she says, ""I'll just wait by the coffee machine and you guys can talk later..."" You reply ""I want to leave my suit in"

This is a good book, written by a man who worked in the Pentagon during the Cold War. The book is more entertaining to read than some of the other books on the subject (though I'll grant you that, for the most part, it's more interesting and is written to keep readers hooked). And he certainly knew a lot about cyber-warfare, because he saw firsthand a number of attacks that were carried out via the Internet, a new technology at the time. He knew the U.S. was being attacked. He read up on the topic. He even worked for the Pentagon, even a little bit, and wrote about it.

I don't have much else to add beyond the fact that if you want to learn more about cyber-warfare, this was well-written work."
"Two former spouses are divorced from one another, but it is still very obvious that they are deeply in love Continue the story:","

""I think about it a lot,"" says Katherina Tovar, 21, a senior at the University of Connecticut who is single. ""Everyone is going through their ups and downs. For me, it's more about my kids. I don't want to be the girl who's on the rebound. I'll never be the girl that's going through the divorce process. I'vebidden a certain amount of anxiety.""

""I never want to get married,"" adds Carlela Perez, 23, a senior studying English at Eastern Connecticut State University. ""I'm too shy to get out of bed in the morning, not because I'm nervous or depressed but because I worry about my future, what I'll do with my life."" The way people talk about the marriage they have, says Katherina, ""is that they'll be in a relationship for a long time, have children together. So I don't think about that, honestly. I don't think I can feel happy until I have kids, and then I will stop thinking about it. But I think about it in my mind and think about how important our kids are to me, and that we need each other.""

Tovar and Perez, who were both diagnosed with depression, have been dating almost seven years. They were inseparable from the day they met, in 2011, in the class they both attended, and they have been dating for so long, they have even dated with the same birth certificate, which is why they have had a marriage license. When their first child was born in August 2012, a lot of their friends and families, including their parents, congratulated them and wondered if they were going to be together forever. Many people, though, were disappointed, since they had grown apart after Katherina dropped out of school. They never got back together.

Now, people often call them ""the girls who break up."" They do it so often, that it was actually the topic of a book written by a self-help columnist named Linda Moller. ""She wrote a book about these two women who go on dating and break up,"" says Carlela. ""And here's a guy and a girl who do it. And it's fascinating to me, and to see how life is changed just as soon as they do it.""

Carrlina says that breaking up with someone is the worst thing she has ever done. She just wants to wait and let go. ""I think it's all about trust,"" says Carlela. ""Sometimes people try to control everyone else in their lives…It's easy to tell one person what to do every day, every step in life, but someone should talk to the person who is just themselves. No. If you let somebody do that, it is what it is. At times, the other person can mess with your heart and soul, but you have to trust that you can handle it — you can handle anybody you want to work with.""

""The biggest battle is acceptance if the other person is your partner,"" says Elisa Lopez, 19, who graduated from UConn this spring with a bachelor's in criminal justice. ""But most people who go on a date with you, they never make it to the other side. They feel like a stranger or are not welcomed.""

While it's understandable, Lopez says, that those who are single or divorced experience a lot of isolation from their friends and family. ""They want to keep their relationships with their spouses or partners a secret, they want those person to be in their lives and think that they could be there at all times."" Lopez says that once they hit it off with someone — or even just one day, if it works for them — she feels like the best part of her first date is that they are more open. ""When people are nice to you, you feel like they truly care for you.""

The Dead River is a major cultural center and an important historical landmark. Visitors from all over the world come to view its waters, which wash over the river's steep banks, the last great white-sand beach at Tuxedo Beach. On the edge of the town is the Dead River Museum, where a wide array of relics are stacked on shelves, from old fishing lines to wooden boats. Also on display is a new $30 million complex designed by the architect Frank Gehry in cooperation with the town itself. The museum contains a variety of interactive exhibits highlighting the town's rich history.


In 2008, New York Gov. Christine Todd Whitman declared October 23-14-2016 the ""Last Days of the Dead River,"" ""the most important day as a city of a hundred thousand people in American public history since the founding of the city,"" and a ""year to remember.""

This year in celebration of the Dead River's death, Tuxedo Beach will open its doors to a private tour. For more information or to make reservations, call 877-621 complexes. (The cost is $35 per person for adults, $22 for children under 11, and $12 for the senior citizen.)

In the early 1900s, when most countries had little or no formal education, Chinese men began to take advantage of the new freedoms of western society and began to work harder and faster than other Westerners in order to achieve personal prosperity and status in China. Many Chinese became rich during the period, but no other Westerner benefited from it.

So, in 1907, China's central leaders introduced a new labor reform policy which created an era of mass famine, led by the ruthless Chinese imperialists. These forces caused the deaths of over one million Chinese people and millions more to flee to escape the violence.

As a result of these calamities people are convinced that the Chinese government was all too ready to let thousands of Nilim be sacrificed during the famine so that this time no harm could come to human beings. Many Chinese survivors in Korea and other countries choose to stay home and work for the next generation as farmers and laborers instead of trying to get back to China.

The report went on: ""As they scramble for money to study the technology, they have become embroiled in a legal battle with the company's CEO over whether their work qualifies as 'fair use' of the machine."" As the story put it, ""There are still no rules protecting the public or other scientists from being used in these experiments."" In fact, two years ago the government tried to push a controversial, but ultimately unsuccessful, change in the law by calling for a review of existing laws, such as the one governing the copyright on papers.

A few days after that story came out, researchers launched a website called ""Dr. Fermilab."" As a quick way for them to communicate with researchers and explain what the project was about, they made it into a kind of wiki. They gave a description of what they were doing. Then they got to work. They created a separate account on a blogging site called ""ClusterFantasy."" Here are some excerpts: ""The mission of ClusterFantasy is to collect news on experimental science, discuss new research in the field, write fiction involving experimental systems, encourage collaboration between researchers, and support the development of new experimental systems. At the ->-end of the page a short synopsis of this project is posted. ""

""On Wednesday, March 21, Dr. Joseph McGovern, a medical doctor from Chicago, Illinois, made a short video about the project (it has since been viewed more than 2 million times and is the 16th most popular video ever made about ClusterFantasy).""

""The original mission statement of the project, which is a summary of all the major questions in the field of experimental particle physics, is here.""

""The project is funded by Dr. Fermilab (formerly the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory) in Chicago, Illinois.""

""It is organized into four areas: Research, Discussion, Fiction, and Funding. A short summary of the overall mission statement: ""From the discovery of the Higgs boson to the present day, the universe contains hundreds of trillions of particles, many of which are extremely strange, like elementary, quark-gluon plasma in a quantum vacuum of the form of a particle called a Bose-Einstein condensate, or BICEP2, or Higgs boson. ""It took the combined efforts of physicists from around the world to make all this possible, creating a new era of physics, one where the ultimate goal was to uncover the secrets of the cosmos. All the way from a small group of physicists around the world to an entire space agency based in the heart of Chicago, Illinois. One could even add the work of a single particle physicist from Chicago in the late 1940s.""

All ""a single particle physicist from Chicago in the late 1940s.""

There was no information on the official website about who actually made the video or how they got involved.

McGovern is also listed as a ""member of the board of advisers.""

The website also has no information on the actual funding of the project, although it does say that it is for a ""research project for a research project.""

The current website says: ""If you have questions, comments, or recommendations about the project or scientific practices and technology that you believe are important, please contact the author, Dr. John McGovern.""

McGovern's LinkedIn profile, meanwhile, says:

""John M. McGovern is an experimental physicist at Fermilab and a Research Scientist at Google X Lab, which designs and builds advanced research projects and technology. He worked on Project Higgs between 2008 and 2012, completing more than 12 months of experiments testing the Higgs boson, before returning to the laboratory as a member of the Board of Advisors. John has been a major proponent of the creation of new experimental systems, with the goal of improving our understanding of the universe. He will participate in an official webinar series called ""ClusterFantasy"" which highlights significant research happening at the Fermilab.""

McGovern declined comment for this story. A Google spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on personnel matters. A representative for Google X didn't have much to say either.

""I think it shows how poorly informed the public is about what Google is and is not doing,"" writes one user on ClusterFantasy. ""Why would they do something like that?""

Read the story to unlock the corresponding trophies

Story related and cannot be missed.

""Escape from the Dark City"" (1)

""Escape from the Dark City"" (1) is unlocked through the Story related trophy ""Bane of Thieves"" ( ). To earn this, pick up the Black Pearl from the floor, run over the bridge that connects to a small island, and exit the island. This is a short run, so plan accordingly. When you get to the other side of the island, head west for an extended cutscene.

""The Devil's Nightmare"" (7)

""The Devil's Nightmare"" (7) is unlocked through the Story related trophy ""The Devil's Nightmare"" ( ). To earn this, go up to the elevator on the east side of the city, and turn right. The elevator will open and someone will give you a brief speech about the dark side of the island, who is the antagonist of the story. To complete this quest, you must reach all eight statues, which will unlock the corresponding trophy.

""The Tower"" (40)

""The Tower"" (40) is unlocked through the Story related trophy ""The Tower"" ( ). To unlock this mission, you will need to travel to the western side of the island, which is where the tower is. As soon as you enter the room, you will notice that the place is quite dark and eerie. Walk as far east as you can, then turn left. The next split screen reactivates. Run across the bridge from the map that you can see when you first enter the room and head up the ladder at the end of the room in this manner. Before entering the stairs that lead up to the tower, collect your quest item in the main part of the room and exit the room. In this case, turn right first, then continue east a short distance and run across the small bridge from the map until you reach it. This leads to the tower.

Defeat The Devil

""Defeat The Devil"" (1)

""Defeat The Devil"" (1) can be unlocked through the Story related trophy ""The Devil's Nightmare"" ( ). To earn this, kill the two bandits nearby, then head up the steps to the right, run over the bridge that splits from the map, and walk down a short flight of steps that is the end of the map. This will reveal a cave entrance on the back side of the island, which you will have to cross to complete the quest. As soon as you reach the cave entrance, go to the upper right and then left to the cave entrance. In this case, turn left and walk southward until you get to a large bridge that you have to cross, then continue southward again to reach the cave entrance. In this case, turn right just before the bridge disappears, and run across the bridge from the map, crossing it to reach the final puzzle room.

Achieve 8/8

All eight medals require at least 1,000,000 points.

The medal ""Achieve 8/8"" is earned after you unlock the ""Bane of Thieves"" (story related and cannot be missed) trophy. Wolves were a common means of transportation in the days of the kingdom, and while not always perfect, they have always been one of the best ways of traveling. There are three ways to travel across the entire island: by boat (to the northwest of the island) or by train (to the east of the island), and each have their own set of rules. These are all easy to reach with a minimum of effort. The first two have very little in the way of restrictions. When you first arrive on the island, head southwest on the right side of the bridge when you first enter the room. The trophy is unlocked after you have travelled as far as you can. Then you will be confronted with the task of traveling from the north to the south around the island (as it's not all that far), with some additional restrictions to accomplish the mission. The third and final way is to run west to the north (and east to the south) around the island until reaching the cave entrance. After the first part of this quest where you must enter and unlock the caves, you should be able to complete it by simply taking a boat to the north. Here, you will get some bonus credits from the various towns and villages, as well as a variety of new missions, which can be earned through your gameplay. Be sure to purchase all of their rewards to get better rewards for this and other trophy related events.

"It is a sunny day, you exit your apartment. Walking your way to your work. There is no one around. Suddenly a black van gets nearby you and its door opens. Two man -which wearing black suits, black gloves and black masks- grabs you and throws you into the van. Continue the story:"," After the first ride to the other side you look back and spot the man behind you. As soon as he sees you, he takes you into the back. He is smiling, and then he points to the car just sitting there. He points to it and you feel panic fill your heart as he opens the wheel with his fist, and turns the ignition and starts the car. The man in black is pushing the doors open as hard as he can - it is extremely fast - and when the doors are pushed he turns the car off and heads to your apartment. A couple of minutes later he comes back and knocks on your apartment door. You open it and he says ""Please have a beer"". You grab your drink, the man in black goes to the fridge and puts it in the front. But as soon as he sits the cup out of the front, the door slides shut. You realize what is happening and the man opens the fridge as well and throws the cup out the window. If you look down to see the cup in the cup holder, you find it was filled with ice. You stare as the man in black picks up the cup, takes one bite but drops it right in the front of your cup holder. You scream into the coffee, but the man in black stops eating and looks up to the window. You take the cup from the man and throw it in the front garden - in front of the river - with the intention of letting the cold water flow over the frozen fruit. Soon you find another cup and a glass. As you reach the water they are still frozen with no water. As time passes by and the winter season arrives, there is no way to get these drinks and so you start to drink less. When you do find some you throw them out the window - but only into the river.

You are working on a bicycle in a park. The man in black stands by the edge of the bike, smoking a cigar and drinking a beer and says to you ""See, you have got such a small mouth you can't drink from the pipe"". You stand up and look at the man in black. He is grinning his famous smile of the man in black with a black suit that is dark enough for only his eyes to see. His hands are holding a small bowl with a cup. He looks up and you see his eyes, and you realize you also see his mouth. His lips are black and black.

The first time you are in an alley with your girlfriend to try to catch a man. Your girlfriend grabs a bag and throws it into an alley. You get closer as she throws it deeper and deeper into the alleys in order to catch the man. Then you hear her crying and thinking this is her only chance for survival. Then your boyfriend sees the bag and throws it into the alley just as she does at the last moment. She runs away and you run away but have to chase after her - just like in the ""Risky Business"" film you had seen. So he runs after you too. Then you realize that he is wearing black clothes. He is trying his best to look like a drug dealer. But he is not. The only thing he wears is a bag with two bottles of champagne in it that you caught earlier.

One day you get in an argument with your neighbour over some garden gnome that is about to start gnawing you. Suddenly the man kicks the gnome, and you follow. The next day you visit your neighbours again and they invite you to play the card game ""Dice"" with them. But there are no cards in the deck. When you first see it your brain is confused about whether a dice is an object or something that can be used as a tool in a game. But then comes the realization that a dice is actually a thing with 2 dice - and that you just picked it up at the game. Another game you play with your friends.

You and your friends have a lot of arguments. You take a long break with your friends and make a lot of new friends but you always come back to the past. You never go on a holiday with anyone until you have agreed to spend some time in the past. Whenever you do take the holiday, you try to go back to the previous year. If you are in a town with a lot of history, you can still do it. But not everyone in the town has the time to reminisce. You don't understand how the townsfolk of a certain world, or at least of one of its settlements, keep the same memories even when time changes around them.

You can also read more about the events happening inside Magic: The Gathering.

This was written with the opinions of the author. Some of them may be a tiny bit wrong, and some were just put there because they sounded funny.

Read this: Derevi, my good friend, has been kidnapped.

Derevi is an extremely talented and versatile artist, she's also an excellent photographer. That's why the two of them decided to do a commission together. But she doesn't think he's very sexy...

Her captors are the most despicable humans on the face of the planet, the worst and craziest cultists ever to walk the earth, with a taste for human flesh.

Her only chance of freeing her captors is by performing some rather erotic magic tricks.

She was sent away to some remote island that she's sure is far away from her and has no one except her three companions to provide security and help her regain the trust of the villagers.

But before leaving, one of the captors decides to put Derevi in the most uncomfortable position imaginable.

There are some weird things going on here.

The first isestial light is emanating directly from his eyes. This is very odd. It's also really hard to imagine a wizard receiving such an unusual sight coming into contact with an alien species.

You can also see Derevi's hand in the middle of his hair... it looks like it's on fire.

When talking about Derevi's captors, they're called the Lords of the Underworld - or Zalathar in Derevi's language. However they are actually from the Underworld - the realm of evil. In other words they are like a group of Hellspawn - but without a soul.

Zalathar are called the Lords of the Underworld because of their ability to do what they are accused of doing under the guise of helping the village.

It is said that they will give up that ability when some good Karma is shown to them - so they can do their evil deeds without being caught and punished.

However, they usually don't give it up because they are already dead by now.

Another weird thing is that Derevi is blind.

She just doesn't have any eyes to read the sign language, so she can only make it with her body - but then she can't communicate even verbally...

The fact that she can make things using a human body is a very strange thing.

This means that the sign of the Lord of the Underworld is very strange and cryptic... they must be a very clever person who understands the nature of the sign language and can speak to the whole village easily.

The other thing that really bugs Derevi is the fact that no one, but the two of them, is able to explain to her what's going on.

This could be a huge problem.

They've captured somebody in a very unique position - Derevi is in a position where there are no other humans around.

But they are very well spoken people, and very good at reading English. So Derevi simply asks for them to explain it to her.

So they explain the situation to her, then proceed to give her a potion to make herself blind.

Oh, and they explain to her that it will end her life dies soon and that they will take her with them to live elsewhere.

She's already started to understand... but is too frightened to tell anyone that she's being kidnapped, because that would get worse.

However, they make her drink a lot of mana potions and some herbs, to make her immune to sunlight and to make her eyes heavier and bigger and therefore easier to get inside a car.

That will be enough to make it so that she can finally escape from this place.

Derevi decides to take this chance to escape by using all the mana she can get her hands on. The only thing she can't do is talk, because she will just be deafened.

However, after taking all the medicine and all the mana potions, the mana in her body will now start to get into her head.

Which makes some strange things happen in the first place...

In the middle of the night, Derevi falls asleep in a tent with three other children.

One of them is very strong against magic, so he was able to wake her from her deep sleep, when Derevi was unconscious from that night on.

However this child is not strong enough to"

The game ""Abe Lincoln"" in the background, because it looks so cool and is the same for real giant heroes. There are many giants, including giant skeletons but it is not necessary to know, it looks very nice ;)


About the game: http://tinyurl.com/uiv2b8h You are looking for Giant Soul - The Legend of the Lost Hero to be updated, but we have a game of an older legend called ""Giant Soul"". It is a game of heroes who can destroy monsters but it is not required to know the story of ""Abe Lincoln"". The game is a bit longer than the ""Giant Soul"" game and there are different characters in the game. ""Piggy"" is not necessary to know. There are many of monsters in the game but it is not necessary to know or the game is over anyway so it is not mandatory to know all the monsters and the story of ""Abe Lincoln"". ""All monsters is not needed to know and will not be shown. The game will go on only when the player thinks ""I do not need to know everything"". I already made the game because there are many of monsters in the game and the game would need to go on if all the monsters were to be in the title. I will update it when I am able to make it better and more complicated, or I want to try and make an easy-game-game since the game will be shorter and it will be easier to learn than ""Giant Soul"" game. Here are some of the monsters in the game: You know what they are, but you don't need to know them just to see the main characters.


About the music of Giant Soul: http://tinyurl.com/8i4rj6o There are many monsters in the game, but there are no rules that they are only monsters, or only monsters.


The story in the game is very long and it is about monsters and heroes who get their powers from the people and from their own soul which they receive by singing.


All the music in the game was made by me: the story was composed by the composer of the game ""Tears"" in the background and the music for the game which is a song about a big hero was recorded by the master of sound and the recording was done by the composer of ""Giant Soul"" in the game.

The music was made by the master of sound in the game and the song for the game which is a song about a big hero was recorded by the master of sound and the recording was done by the composer of ""Giant Soul"" in the game.


The game with its different playable characters and monsters, is only available for players who know the legend of ""Abe Lincoln"". The game will be updated when I am able to make the game more difficult, because it will be easy and fun and we will be able to learn more about the new heroes of ""The Legend of the Lost Hero"".

What happened when the Curiosity rover landed on Mars yesterday?

Mars is a very busy place. During a 24-hour period, the planet passes through a total of 2,800 Martian hours. As this video from NASA shows, the robotic arm on the surface of Mars is constantly sending more data back to Earth.

NASA's Curiosity rover was taking about 20 images per day from its six fixed cameras when it hit a rock. That's a huge amount of data collection, which is why the agency is sending more data than ever to Earth now…

At 7:07 am ET today, one of Curiosity's cameras recorded what is now officially known as the ""Martian day."" On Mars today ""day,"" at the very least, is 1 AM ET. At 1:07:07 AM ET today, Mars entered Earth's synchronous Earth day. The same thing happened earlier tonight on Mars when Curiosity made its first Mars day of existence.

While NASA has said that the rover's main science instrument is not currently malfunctioning, it will do that in several weeks' time. And scientists are very worried about the rover not functioning as planned. So if you're wondering if Curiosity will be able to do much work in the next few weeks, the best news is that it continues to roll along.

NASA has not answered the key question that everyone is asking: When will Curiosity do its science mission, and how much will it cost?

NASA is still doing detailed analyses to assess mission costs for the Curiosity plan, said Andrew Greeley, a mission scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. ""Our analysis is ongoing,"" Greeley said. ""The timing on when the rover will do its science mission is still up in the air.""

Villages are laid to rubble and countless lives are ruined ... all over a bag of chips Continue the story:,"

Cars lie scattered over destroyed vehicles. Men, women and children are rescued from the wreckage.

""We feel very, very sad, very upset... there's just a very dark feeling,"" said Karmizd, 20, who like many people in a village of 70 were not named by authorities, spoke through an interpreter. ""We think it's to blame for all this destruction. Maybe a war for more oil.""

The discovery of an oil spill just outside the Iraqi town of Tikrit — just before the war began, and just before it was overrun by the militiamen — is raising questions about whether a chemical attack was used deliberately during the battle. But the U.S. military and the State Department insist the cause of the blast ""remains an open investigation with no definitive conclusions.""

U.S. military officials have not acknowledged a chemicaluments attack occurred in Iraq, though there have been allegations of widespread use of weapons-grade chemicals, including mustard gas and VX, by Saddam's forces during the war.

In one report from April, however, officials said that chemical Schering-Plough AG has ""identified more than a million containers with high-acid solid waste fluids... containing sulfur mustard agent and VX.""

Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly comment, said in a presentation to the United Nations International Commission of Chemical Weapons that the chemicals were most likely to have been used for battlefield use, not as intended civilian supplies.

""We don't know exactly what happened on Tikrit,"" said Army Col. David Lapan, the U.S. military's operations director for coalition forces. ""But what I can tell you is that our understanding is it was not a chemical weapons attack by the insurgents.""

Lapan said that American and British forces have been monitoring the situation closely.

But several sources, including a former senior U.S. intelligence officer, say the chemicals recovered from the village — VX plus another unknown, possibly mustard — could be used as biological weapons or as agents used to produce the nerve agent sarin, which Saddam used during the war against Israel.

The United Nations declared in a report on Saddam's use of chemical weapons in the 1980s that the regime used mustard gas as a weapon to force Kurds to withdraw from key areas and that it was used primarily in attacks on Kurdish civilians.

But officials said that by April, when American and British forces began taking back Mosul, there were signs that chemical weapons were also being used because of the heavy losses and confusion of battle.

""I would say the use of mustard gas, on occasion, is used to disperse civilians,"" said William C. Hartmann, who headed the U.N. weapons inspection mission at the time. ""You can imagine it being used to disperse civilian populations when it was not used to cause significant destruction.""

But while chemical weapons remain off-limits under UN Resolution 2139, in recent interviews, U.S. officials said inspectors have found evidence of sulfur mustard but not that chemical weapons were being carried out in Iraq.

Citing a senior military official, James Fallows of Washington Post wrote on ""All In"" that the findings on the chemical attack on Tikrit, including sulfur mustard, had ""suggested the discovery of chemical warfare agent, rather than an intended gas attack.""

A senior military official, however, said chemical agent had not been found.

Military officials declined to provide details on the precise type of chemical agents found in the village. But sources at the U.S. military and CIA headquarters in Baghdad said they believe mustard was used, though this was not confirmed by officials from the UN.

Citing U.S. military and intelligence sources, two U.S. news organizations reported a month ago that the Pentagon suspected Iraqis of using chemical weapons in the battle for Mosul, the capital of the country. The reports quoted the officials claiming that Iraqi forces launched chemical attacks with chemicals seized in a recent operation against ISIS.

Fallows, in the New York Times article, said the Pentagon's finding did not prove that Iraq had used chemical weapons.

""It may be that some Iraqi forces made use of these chemical capabilities in Iraq, but we can't prove that,"" he said.

The United States and Iraq signed an agreement in 2001 making it more clear that chemical weapons would not be used as a means of warfare and that Iraq could not use chemical weapons unless it was destroyed.

After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, U.S. forces began receiving intelligence from the Iraqi government that Saddam Hussein may be developing chemical agents or other weapons.

After the Iraq war ended, the U.N., Iraq and the United States signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans the use of chemicals as weapons."

Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You do n't. Continue the story:,"
So, you know that I don't believe in time travel, but I do believe in life before death.
You could use a Time machine, sure, but a life machine would take years to create and you wouldn't get the chance to live those years. Instead, you'll live them in a small time-traveling pod, where you'll just leave the living room, step through the time portal in the bedroom, and be gone in one day--and that's a lot better.
You would be reborn in the same body and age as your mother, living in your apartment across the street, which is also where your grandparents were. Since you're the only person in the pod, that'll put you in touch with them all, which should give you a better idea of their life history.
But there are plenty of other stories to explore here...


I like this one because of an additional twist. You'll meet lots of people and learn a ton, but you'll get to read their entire lives for free, because your time travel pod isn't like the others.

While in this pod you won't feel lonely or alone. At first, you'll just need to rely on your good old friends and fellow pod-goers to keep you company. You'll meet people who already have a story to tell about events that took place in your pod. You'll gain friends and companions and connections to share life stories you may have missed or forgotten.

Your life in the time-travel pod has its own little time machine... and it's also not a cheap time machine.

You're getting a time machine to go where all the action is, for free. That means you're getting two pieces of software. First, there's a free software utility that converts your old floppy disks into new formats. Second, there's the Time Machine Time Travel Assistant, which manages your time travel pod, handles the time travel itself, and communicates with the various time points you enter in your time machine.

But time travelers will never see your time machine again. That would be incredibly disheartening.

You'll actually have to save your progress over multiple visits. Instead, you'll keep an extra tape machine next to the time machine, where the tape machine could be accessed to reload your game progress.

You may be able to pick up some of the early game's puzzles and progress as well. You might have a few puzzles to complete this way, but not many. Instead, you'll have a few simple games you might enjoy, but no huge challenges or long-term puzzles.

The adventure will be broken in large part into smaller game pieces, so you'll have to work on different parts at once.

The only thing you can do while in your pod is talk to people and tell them your adventure and what you want to do next. Then you'll go around that world visiting locations to accomplish what you set out to do.

Unlike many other RPGs, the adventure in Time Traveler's End is not open-ended. There's a lot of story to be told, but the journey you take only lasts between one and three days. That's a lot of time to lose.

While you'll travel around as a time traveler, you needn't worry about dying. You'll just fade away as your time machine begins to returnDarwin, who believes the time machine had lost track of him, to her place and disappear.


Darwin lives through the adventure in the Time Traveler's End, so you can go there. As a former time traveler with memories from all of the other time-travelers in the world, you're going to remember the world around you all too well. As Darwin herself reminds you, the journey back to your own time has been one of many attempts to find the truth. Darwin could have disappeared, but this is a journey where you must try out new things and make decisions that may cost you your life--and that's exactly what you would need to learn about the past if you wish to succeed.


While your adventure may be as chaotic as it can be at times, the adventure is short enough to keep your interest for all but its climax. As you discover the world's history, you'll learn that not everything will go as you expect it to. The game will throw you things at you like nobody's business while you run an experiment and lose the plot.

Darwin will explain to you the nature of time travel, and then you'll take to the air. Your entire time machine will fade away, leaving you unable to recall anything about your own time.

Your time machine will have been destroyed and you will be stranded in the middle of the universe in a pod with no way back home, only time. You'll be confused, but not"
It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter. It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back. It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals. And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... Continue the story:,"


A Santa's Heart to Take Home

By Rene Ritchie

The Santa, of course, is the embodiment of light. He is in essence a benevolent spirit whose power resides chiefly in the things he sends. Santa's love for the little ones is no exception to this rule. As most parents know, children often come looking for Santa, but they often don't come looking for us. Children also seem to think that if the adults can be happy, so can the children. They often do not realize that we are not the parents we thought we were. If we could be, it would be the same as if we were Santa's elves and he could just be our elves... but we are not the little ones he is sending us.

What is it the little ones want? If Santa were a ""little person,"" as our mother taught us in our youth, he would come bearing gifts. Gifts are for the ""little ones,"" for whom the gifts may be not the best, because they are far more limited than he is. We would know we were sending the best little one because the gift we had was much better than what we were getting, but our children would not know that because they do not understand the meaning we put behind our words. We have known that the little ones deserve better, but we know that they can be counted on to find the best gift for us and give it to us. The little ones know that the child in their heart is more than the little one's physical body. They are also the gift givers we need to be able to keep up with our children. What is it which makes little ones so very kind?

A few years ago, some children were returning to bed after a long day. They were tired and sad. ""Socks would make you feel soooo warm,"" a little child asked. They then walked to the closet and brought in socks that were not suitable for the occasion. What could the child have been thinking? Could the child not see the sockswindows as a good child, and a good Santa? We are the ones who come into the room looking for gifts to give or a gift to receive. It is a hard job finding the presents our children truly want, but what if we could do so while being in harmony with ourselves? We could give gifts for children which would be fitting to the children. What if we made it an individual project and no child asked for more than what was needed for the task at hand? What if we chose the clothes for their winter coats. Would it not make for a nice season to give them an outfit with a sweater? And what if we made up what they wore themselves? Would this look better than wearing the clothes of their children? It would look better than when they made it up. Santa Claus has given us a wonderful gift in the form of children -- which he has given us the privilege of offering to them. Santa Claus's mission is not complete withoutigree and gift giving. That is why it is so disturbing that the Little Children have started turning Christmas into Christmas Day, a festival for the children to dress up in the fashion of the adults.

We do not wish to turn Christmas into Christmas. We think it should remain Christmas. There is nothing more wonderful, a little one thinks, than to have a child who gets it right to give a little gift. It gives much joy to the little one. Santa must be free from shame, because we are not at all ashamed of the things we bring for our children. To us, the gift we bring to the little ones is no more than the gift they want: not the gifts of those whose wants we do not care to fulfill, but of the gift which the little ones deserve, not only to have, but to have because they are worth everything to us. We must not be ashamed of ourselves.

In His Heart He is Santa

What you might not know is that Christmas is really Christmas if you consider this point from the spirit as well as the letter...

What do I mean? If you ask me how Christmas is, well, if you know me, you know that in the spirit I express in my letter, I say what I feel! If it is so easy to say what I feel, what would they think if I said what Santa Claus does? I feel as if I could speak to them from a fairy tale. I say the spirit as well as the letter says that my happiness is in the spirit. The spirit is what Santa's heart is.

The spirit of joy in Santa comes in different types. You can get a real feeling for this by listening to him. The spirit was given to us by many little children who made it up at the birthday"
An alien race starts to colonize Mars. They completely ignore humanity on Earth and just go about their business. Continue the story:," Read 'The Beginning' of 'The Martian', read 'The Return of the Martian' of 'Mars Odyssey', or read 'A Martian Odyssey' of 'Mars Menace'.

In the beginning there was the word

A Martian is a Martian is a Martian

and

There shall be a Martian for every man to build a colony on Mars. As the human race starts to colonize Mars there is a race that just completely ignores humanity. They start to colonize our planet, our planet Earth. Their way is clear, what they do is so perfectly logical that we as human beings have come to not take them seriously.

The Martian

'The Beginning' of 'The Martian'. When The Martian was first published in 1959 it was a huge success, it had to be. I had a feeling it would change my life. That was a great inspiration. Since then, my books have made such a big impact that there is now a book club for The Martian, who are from all over the world, all rapport a group of Mars explorers. Many of the Mars explorers have never been on another planet before.

In the beginning there was the name

Alien

Humanity is a bunch of morons. Alien has appeared many times, but it has failed, we've taken these people's lives.

As the human race starts to colonize Mars there is a race that just completely ignores humanity on Earth. They start to colonize our planet, Earth. Their way is clear, what they do is so perfectly logical that we as humanity have come to not take them seriously.

After the publication of ""Alien"" in 1959, it was taken by many to be a prophetic commentary on the dangers of space travel. As it turned out to be, this comment was just the start of the film's themes. The following years saw the development of the story, the characters and the plot. The plot and characters were developed throughout the 1960s while the writing for the film continued on.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was set 40 years before the filming of ""Alien."" It was written by the same novelists and also drew from elements that had already been hinted at as a plot point in ""Carnage."" The characters include a young boy called Mark Watney (John Hurt) who is sent on his mission to Mars. The character of David Watney (Olivia Cooke), is the daughter of John F. Kennedy – who, like John F. Kennedy, is the hero of the film (John Hurt plays him beautifully).

The film's screenplay was written by the late Roger Zelazny, a science-fiction writer and science-fiction movie expert, and his son Jeff Zelazny, a writer, and then-acting director, but their influence was profound. The film opened the door for writers to create fictional stories based on real historical figures. Also, Zelazny's name has been included in movies since, many of which are still being made including ""Das Boot,"" and later ""Logan,"" which is probably a film in its own right.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was a direct sequel of ""A Martian,"" which was also released at the same time.

""Alien"" was released to strong reactions, but became an instant hit following its release. Critics felt the film violated all the conventions of science fiction by presenting real time as alien technology (a plot element of the film). Critics also felt it violated the conventions of science fiction by showing an alien race (the android characters) as having their own language. ""Alien"" also featured more futuristic concepts with time travel and artificial intelligence.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was the first film released after the release of ""Alien."" It was a prequel, showing Mars in 1964 not only from a human viewpoint, but the viewpoint of a robot. The movie has many elements from ""Alien, but the one that became synonymous with the classic film was the Martian invasion.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was filmed over a six year period, beginning in 1966 and ending in 1969. It premiered at the Sundance film festival in 1969 and then at the Toronto film festival in 1970 and 1971, then at the Toronto film festival again in 1972, and then at the Montreal premiere in 1976. It was released in the United States and Canada on the 20th of April – the first day of April.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was shot in the black and white techniques that have become part of special effects. Much of the plot can be found in many of these black and white films as it helps show the action of what goes on in a realistic way. These techniques were developed during the film's production and for this reason ""A Martian Odyssey"" has been dubbed the black and white film, though it is more black and white than an overall color film.

Part 5

One of the most important things for a successful team is to figure out where their players fit on the team balance chart, who has the most experience at the position, and determine if they can handle the heavy responsibilities of the positions on the chart. Once the players have a strong understanding of their position on the team balance chart, everyone can quickly adapt to the new roles.

Once you have your players nailed down on the map and on-point, start on map generation for each position. Once you start on map generation for each position, work on your map to increase the difficulty. I love this part of the map generator as well because it helps you figure out where you need to introduce the new team balance into the map.

One of the key pillars of the game is our maps. For every map, I want the player to see the unique aspects of that map and be able to think about how that map can adapt to the new threats it faces. Once we decide on an option, like spawn, they have to look at how much they will use the map, what positions they can use, where they can find the key location, and where they can find hidden opportunities.

The first thing that a team needs to do when starting a map is take stock of what's happening in the game to determine if they like the mechanics in the map. These are called 'Mech placement mechanics' and are a vital facet for the game of MechWarrior Online. Once you know all of your players are on board with your game mechanics or have some new ideas, work on the map in order to make sure each team has what they need to succeed.

Once you've decided on a direction, make sure that you can adapt your map quickly to the changes you're introducing. This is a very big part of the game. After you make a game, everything in the game is a moving target. There are different ways to adapt a map quickly and change the way that it evolves or behaves because of what Heroes, maps, and skills are on the map and how the map will shift over time.

Part 6

Most people are focused on the players on the team, but I believe that some of the most important aspects of any MMO are created by the players. Being able to identify that everyone's job is equally important when the going gets tough is an important part of the game. What if you were at a party party and there was a fight in the center of the map and a player was stuck in the middle of the fight? What if you're a veteran who goes into battle confident in the knowledge that he's skilled enough to take down a massive mech and leave them in the dust. Then what if that player gets stuck in a fight and has to retreat to the edge of the map? What if your team doesn't have enough weapons to fight through the onslaught of the mechs and you can't get to help until they're already dead? What if you can't get out of the map until everyone's dead? How do you know that you're ready to protect and fight for your team and teammates if you don't know exactly what you'll face?

This is the big idea of the 'Survivor Map Generation.' The whole idea of a map generation process helps define a map and set a direction for how the map will function. The same concept operates with a Survivor map. How can that map help the team while also allowing people to know where they can turn in order to assist in helping other players or themselves. The more maps you have, the more important it is that they are all designed to be designed to keep up with the changing events in the game.

Part 7

One of the biggest, and most challenging, questions when trying to create a map is, ""Can I build walls?"" Or, ""How far do I want to build this thing?"" We are going to be taking a look at some examples of how walls are built and how they will be used in the map.

There are two types of walls in MechWarrior Online: the standard wall and the 'Mech wall. The standard wall is basically a piece of thick reinforced concrete and when it is set up, it doesn't really give you any extra height beyond what you can see from the front of your tank, however it does provide a nice sightline for your teammates. When constructing a wall, don't limit yourself to just a standard wall as you can create a second line where you can walk around the base of the wall and even add stairs if you need to. The 'Mech wall is a basic build that can have multiple levels as an additional added level on top of your standard wall.

Using terrain to your advantage


Now that you have a basic understanding of the basics of creating and building wall in MechWarrior Online, we are going to take a look at how the terrain works in the"

"When two people get married, their hearts are surgically exchanged. You just filed for divorce. Continue the story:","

""What happens if my wife wanted to give birth to my child before the birth of mine?"" she asked, as friends and former coworkers sat in silence for the briefest of moments during that Wednesday night in 2011. ""If she did and I called with the news, would I go to jail? No. But if she gave birth to my child and I asked her to give birth to my child first — could she do that? I'm not sure.""

The woman we're talking about here could have said that today, she just decided to delay having children so that she could see the birth of her biological child firsthand.

In 2010-2011, there were 12,000 Americans who lost their jobs in one quarter. Why was that?

The short answer is that the economy got much worse in 2010-2011 than in every other one before it. But that's a long story. For some people, the short answer isn't much more than the long one. And for some people, just the short answer.

This is what I just did. Because I felt compelled to help others get jobs. Because of all the ""the economy"" crap I heard. It's hard for me to explain.

I spent much of the last three years working in technology. At a software company in Seattle. In a corporate office in Phoenix. In a finance office in Silicon Valley. My first job was at Xerox. I was a computer systems engineer at Xerox's Palo Alto, California, campus.

As the economy in the Valley continues to deteriorate — and more and more companies get forced out of the region — there are fewer and fewer people who are willing to come here to be an engineer. But more and more firms are moving into the areas around the region in one of two ways.

One way is to locate themselves to the West Coast. The other is to locate themselves to the East Coast.

One of the things the Bay Area does extremely well is move people by transportation. There's no need to travel all the way to the East Coast to get an industry job. I came straight in from Berkeley to Silicon Valley for a high tech engineering job. It was the fastest and most efficient way I could go.

So, it was natural for me to help someone I'd come to know and love.

I had become close with someone who had found a job. To their surprise, they were now being laid off by their employer.

In my last hour together, there came a moment I'll never forget. My friend and colleague, who was laid off from his former job, stopped me at the airport and showed me a postcard at the beach. When I opened it, she was in it.

I looked over her shoulder and laughed. I gave her my best hug.

We are human beings. We have different priorities. We can be great, or terrible. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all way to be human. We're different and we have different needs.

I love my wife and my family, but we've been through our share of struggles. We don't always agree and we can be frustrated when the world doesn't agree with us, like when I was told the economy had reached a peak and my friend was laid off.

And yet, I know I'm doingtrak on it every single day here and every day off. I know this is who I am. But we've been through a lot together. She's lost her job in the Westbrook neighborhood. She's had to find work in the Bay Area since 2012. I lost mine, too. We haven't seen each other since I got laid off.

To be honest, I could tell that she wasn't sure if she could bear to be alone during this time of intense pain. I know that because I felt that she was ready for that kind of loneliness and isolation. And, while I would never deny what our last conversation was about, I know she wasn't ready for what she faced during this time.

And it's not just me. Every day I see the same story that's always been repeated from every new group of people — just the same story — all of whom either lost their job or have lost a job. They all were feeling a different type of pressure and have the same issues. I knew how hard it was for her to get back to her life and how difficult it was for myself, too.

I wanted to help. Why? I wanted to do this work that I do to help people be creative and thrive. I wanted to help those people find jobs for the time they have left. I wanted to give them something I love.

I was hired as a software engineer, not a generalist. In Silicon Valley, there are plenty of jobs like"
"A hole in time and space opens up, and you see your younger self looking back at you. You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes. Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response. Continue the story:","

You begin to suspect something is amiss. You've never seen a human doing something like this before. Then you realize this is not just some kind of hallucination. This is not something just floating in a space that is a thousand light years away, like the space stations are a thousand light years away. This is something no human being should be doing. Why is this happening? You look out at your home: A spaceship is passing in front of the window. You tell your younger self: ""Hey, I know you'd do the right thing for your parents. However,"" you continue, ""how do you know for a definite that you could trust me with your life? I saw that thing before.""

""I've never seen a human doing this before,"" he says. ""So you can trust me for a few seconds. This is where the hole shuts in. Are you completely sober now, or is the hangover starting up?"" Answer: Stupefied

You are stupefied and overwhelmed by the realization that just a moment ago you were sober, trusting in your younger self. Suddenly, this whole universe looks different, and you realize that your self has no control over anything. It is all just a dream. This is bad.

You have no idea how you got here. You may not even know your life was a dream. The truth is, you are so confused that there is no way for other people to know or understand what you've just been through. This will haunt you for months, even years. You don't know what your life had been like before this realization, but now there's no way to tell it.

""I have to look out the window,"" you say. ""I need help.""

""You need help now,"" he responds.

This is your first contact with a human. He gives you some time and space to decide if you feel up to it — by then, more time is left for the rest of your life. He also puts a pin in a space time loop and tells you that you have a chance to get home to your family.

If you're still not convinced, try one more time. Try this: Try to write your younger self a short message in your own voice and wait until the next time he talks to you. At least it would give you time to see if he could write good enough.

If he writes his message, go back to his spaceship and tell him what happened to you. He gives you an instant replay of things when you first met, and then a message that the wormhole closed in for you.

""Hello, you're still sane,"" he tells you. ""This will probably be a while (one week?) – but don't worry – it'll all be good.""

There are about a thousand other things you could do with the information he gave you, but you don't worry about them. You trust him not to send you back in time to your house. You put the pin back in the time loop, and the time loops start again — for a few hours each time, until you find this is a good idea because it gives you more time to decide what to do with the lockout chip.

When your younger self talks you into helping, he's still getting mad and scared. The problem is, the rest of the universe has already closed in on him. He knows he is safe with you, but doesn't know how to get into your subconscious.

When this happens again, another little while after you've come back from your first try, you know it is happening. But you don't know what to do.

You have the option of talking to him, and you talk to him. You tell him that you will help him, but they will only let him back in once you've completed your investigation. You tell him they can send you another message, and he gives you another opportunity to help you close the wormhole.

You do one more try andWorlds Collide is done. You don't have a final message of any quality because you've never seen it before, and you believe there is no better way to handle this than a little bit of time and space to think about the next option.

After you've left Earth for the next year, someone is going to try to put out a message. You have to go to the first person to ask and get permission for this. This will test your relationship with your younger self: Now it is not clear whether your more recent self will agree to the new arrangement.

You kill one guy one day and it kills your friend. You kill another guy and then another. Claire's been in contact with an old man who tells her that she shouldn't be selling people's souls because you'll end up with a demonic curse. However, you can't die now that you have a demonic power which allows you to live. You get back some of the power you have bought from the town's devil. It turns out to be a new version of you called the Revenant. You use this new version of you to travel around the world as the Revenant and take on people. The Revenant is an absolute beast in that he's very big and strong but really has very little human weaknesses. He kills an old man in a town and you travel to a big city where he's supposed to be doing this work, but the city has a massive earthquake killing everyone in a big part of it, including you. You make your way through the new city which is overrun with zombies. Later on, you find out that the town was being attacked by these evil zombies. The Mayor was the Revenant and this was the new version of you that you found. Later on you meet a friend from your past that you have a lot of animosity with but algebraically he is also a very important guy. He's one of the first members of the town council and he comes to the church and tries to kill you which leads to a fight between the two. You make your way to this town where you meet the new Revenant, who's a guy named Bob. He kills Bob by being so huge that it kills the entire town and you try to stop him. The fight ends when Bob decides to take a drink of his own blood or gets electrocuted which kills him. The demon starts to attack humans as a final sacrifice but you stop him with your new version called the Revenant. He kills Bob and leaves the town. The demon follows you. You eventually make it outside and you see him running away and you kill him in an Sharma-like move. It's like being the Revenant again and you decide to head back for revenge. The demon follows you and it's really scary because it's as big as you are and you don't know what's going on until you take a shot. Then you hear the scream of people being attacked by the demon. You head for the church but the demon kills the mayor like that and you start running down this street which is also surrounded by zombies. Eventually you reach the church where you see that the Revenant has taken control of the mayor and is doing the work. Before you can do that, he sends you outside for the final sacrifice. It's Bob and you have a huge battle with him in the church. Eventually you kill the Revenant and the demon. The Revenant was able to make more like the Mayor, that is the person who lives inside the town, though Bob's a lot bigger. It was a really big battle between you and the demon. You beat the demon but not because you're a Revenant. You beat the demon because you're a super-human in that you can run faster, you can do so much damage. You even break a huge demon skull like that, if you can use a little bit of his blood. You've learned more about how powerful you are but you feel it's time to leave. After that there's a group of people who ask you to find some items at a house. You go in but it turns out that it's the demon who got out of prison and they haven't got the items so you have to get them from the other prisoners, which you manage to do. He then tries to help you, and tries to take over the town of New York, but you find that you can't. You're the demon, a big one, but a normal guy with a job. You"
"You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries. You come back to see millions of people suffering, in pain and hopeless. How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind? Continue the story:","

""For your own people, I come to give these words. I am the one who will show what happens if mankind turns from God. We are witnessing the time when God is bringing it to the edge! We are witnessing the coming of the apocalypse!"" The Prophet had a vision of a red sun in the sky of Jerusalem that appeared at night.

""God is my witness, the God who made man the creator, and my witness, the God who has chosen me to restore the true and true God who has granted mercy to all those on earth."" He would come again with God's name in the heavens. ""I am the first to walk the Earth and I am the last to leave, and it is this I have to bring to complete fulfillment.""

The Prophet told his Companions that he would soon return, but said the people will have to wait for another five centuries to see the truth of his return. Versus The Age of Ignorance and the Age of Spiritual Enlightenment

""If you follow the footsteps of your fathers, if you follow the footsteps of your Prophets, you will see the same sun. Every year they would return more or less, but I am the last of the men standing up. We are going back to meet again our fellow men, the same people who have been waiting for us for their whole lives, as though they were on their way to paradise. All of a sudden the red sun appeared out of nowhere. God has revealed a book that is written in red light. God has seen through the darkness of his ignorance, but has also seen through the darkness of his spiritual enlightenment. He has been a light and an evening star for these people. He told his servants in the day what he saw in the night. He has revealed the message of salvation, of salvation from death. The red light of God has been a revelation that is a truth and truth alone. It is an absolute truth, and only God can know it. In the past he revealed the Gospel of Islam, which was in Arabic. It came from the Jews and Christians, with their books and books written for them, with their traditions which differed greatly from those of Allah. It was all a fiction that came from the same source. It has changed from the Jews and Christians to the Muslims, this time they don't even believe in the words of Allah or in the word of His servants. Their belief is in books prepared for those people. They can read them, but they still don't believe in the Quran. They say ""This book is written in Arabic, in order to tell us what it tells us."" Some may know what a Quran is, but others don't, because they are blinded by the words of Allah. The Quran is in Arabic and it is a revelation in the Arabic language, in that language. When God revealed the Book of the Quran to him, there is no other language besides Arabic. This is the message of the Quran. No other language knows that the Quran is truth.

The Prophets' Word

""Say, 'Come, O people of the Book. It is only Allah Who teaches you the truth.' They responded with joy, 'It is through Allah that we see.' That is because God does not tell something to others to the point where humans can see it, unless the prophet is present. If the word was to convey this great power, the world would be filled with it, with its glory and its knowledge. If the prophet had not been made man, there would have been no prophet to inspire men with his revelation. The greatest miracle that can be accomplished in creation is the revelation of a book and the knowledge that can be brought with the revelation. No prophet except Allah can bring about a miracle, as the miracle of a woman bringing forth a small child. The Quran alone has the ability to bring about a miracle. And yet this is a great miracle. As for the Book, it can also accomplish miracles. In short, the Quran is an absolutely true testimony and an absolute truth. This is not a lie because Muhammad gave it and nobody has ever doubted it. He has brought it and it is the last revelation.

There are millions of people who believe in this revelation, but those who are not guided do not believe in it. You must explain what is this message. You must tell the story of the way of the Prophet and its revelations and explain why they are true and why this is the best Cerberus for the universe."" He was given the Book of the Quran that told him, as the Prophet of the Revelation, what He had seen in the night. ""You will see a red star that shines like a red light, a light that only Allah is able to"

If the TV didn't get tuned to the movie, it would be a little bit jarring, because when it came to acting, R. Lee Ermey was clearly obsessed with playing the role of the bad guy. He played a psychopath, of the villainous variety, who was, in his words, ""a big-head guy with a huge chin."" He was a killer psychopath! That's the type of guy you want to see out there destroying a country.

""In the end, you gotta realize that you got to do what you gotta do. Don't get frustrated. Don't give in. Don't say screw it, I'm not gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna give it a shot.""

""The problem with acting is that we are all so insecure -- at some people's jobs, in their families -- they're convinced they're bad people. That's how it works when you're a child.""

""Right.""

""Now, I had an acting teacher who went to some school where they were known as bad parents. She told us, 'If you go in like this, the kid is going to be a bad, abusive person, who will grow up to be a bad man.' And so, I learned that acting in the movies, on television and film, is essentially the equivalent of the life sentence that a person must spend in that prison where you think you're a bad person. A bad person.""


""It's like some guy in a padded cell that I hate, and I want to kill.""

""Yeah, no...but a person who lives as if they're evil.""

""Like a fucking rapist?""

""Yeah, like a rapist.""

""But you think that you're the guy that needs to be punished.""

""What happened with me was my father took me to a very special school in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. We moved there because they did not have the public school system in Los Angeles, and this was in the middle of the depression in the '30s and '40s. I got accepted to the school that had the most rich, wealthy students in the world. They were the best in the world. My dad, who had only been in his life for about one year -- because we hadn't raised much money, he had only graduated from college, he was a single parent -- took me there, thinking that it was the best school, but it was also very conservative. It was really about this kind of radical thing we thought our generation was supposed to be doing. I did it in an act where he was the headmaster and a male janitor, and the idea was that I was there to do a play about a male janitor who was a sexual predator in the work place. He kept getting away with it for years, and eventually, the school board gave him a one-page letter of apology, and told him they wanted him taken off campus immediately.""

""I just saw this,"" he looked up and began to sweat, ""this is it, I'm coming home! I got my whole life! I'll get the fuck out! This is the shit I'm gonna earn my whole fucking life on!"""

The world could be a sadder place if every phone call came in a voice mail. A voice mail costs very little to make and lets you speak to a loved-one if your message is returned. It's a new app with a new purpose: the new voice mail app. And the technology behind it offers the promise of a simple, powerful solution to one of the biggest challenges we face: voicemail. ""I would be one lucky person who would not lose a loved one at the end of a call,"" says Scott McGlade, co-founder and CTO of VoiceMail.com. ""It's a real issue, and it's a real problem that people can't seem to resolve."" VoiceMail's voice mail system can turn just about anything into a voice mail and can be easily tailored to your needs. VoiceMail.com has already been downloaded over 2 million times.

When you use voice mail on a mobile phone, the caller ID code of the person who calls is not always a valid way to identify the caller from a distance. VoiceMail.com creates an image based on the person's face, and uses facial recognition technology to match it to the person' s face. This makes it easy to match your voice with a person's voice with ease. And with 1 million voice mail messages received every week, there's a large market for the service. ""Voice mail can be a huge help in certain situations,"" says McGlade. ""In an emergency, you want to get the phone company in to help. If your phone is calling you and the person sounds odd, you can use VoiceMail and it will identify who's calling the emergency number."" With VoiceMail, you can also tell the person that you need to speak with them back. You're supposed to get back to them in a few minutes and let them know you will call them back after some time.

The first time you use VoiceMail.com, you 'll need to register and complete a few basic tasks. You can set up the app to receive a notification when a call is made. You can also set up an appointment schedule for the app. These settings are stored in a database and are reused the next time the App is launched for use. You can also send and receive an email with the information. Once you get the hang of it, you will be able to check for and accept incoming messages, make calls, and take screenshots from your mobile device in a matter of seconds. ""We don't have a phone number for you to call,"" says McGlade. ""All you do is click a button on the mobile device and your phone goes to voicemail. If you try to leave a voicemail for someone, you get an error message. We just store that number for it. We've designed it so that you can be out of range and still have a chance to call them."" This is a great feature for a woman who is out at the library or who works from home. VoiceMail.com's app also makes it easy to store calls made through your phone for later calling or forwarding. You can even use VoiceMail.com to make, receive, and delete voicemails quickly, easily, and securely.

It's a little confusing how all these different features can all be connected. With the built in App, you can call the person on your mobile device if it' s in their phone book. You can also set-up an appointment for another person to meet you for a quick, private conversation, and send them a recording you've already recorded. And if something goes wrong with your phone, you can always send a reminder email. With all this integration, it's not really necessary to set up a voicemail account. You can set up your iPhone to use VoiceMail if it' s the last phone it uses. As an alternate solution, you could create a hidden account on another device for the purpose of voicemail. Then each time you need your voice mail, just click a button on the mobile device and your voicemail comes up in your contact list from that device. This solution makes it so that when you need voicemail, you have the option to give the people of your family a call, but if someone's calling you out of the blue, you can leave a voicemail message.

VoiceMail.com lets you reach any person on our VoiceMail.com network with a quick and simple voice call.

VoiceMail.com is a great service for friends, relatives, and co-workers, however, for the majority of people, it will be the first thing you will use to send and receive any message. The idea that your calls will be sent to your voicemail is a"

Notes

*Please check the Gameplay section under the Extras - The game is the same as the original and features the same story.

*The game is also playable in 2-player games, but can only be played between the first and second player (or the ""second player"" if you are playing as the first player). If you play 1 player you can play as 3 people. Note: You must have a DMA4 gamepad and not a regular PS2 controller to play this game, since the game controller only has ""diving in"" and ""reading"" buttons.

*The game actually works but the camera can pooled in the game to cause some graphical problems.

*The character, which is named ""Elvira"", can be unlocked after the first chapter of the game."

Continue the story:"," http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6GZzfQnQWI The story of my life: I grew up in a small country town, a small town whose politics seemed a bit more serious than those of my parents and grandparents. My grandmother's father was a small-time drug runner. From my point of view, it was strange and uncomfortable watching my family struggle with corruption and conflict. I saw politics as not the world I knew, but a world that seemed out of reach of people who lived in small towns. I knew I wanted to be a reporter. So I took a job in a small city newspaper, working under difficult circumstances. When that ended, I chose not to stay in journalism. I wanted a better job. It was a choice I made because I wanted to be free. To me, politics was a fight over issues – like taxes, guns, abortion and abortion rights. And people were free to fight for issues other than tax cuts, guns, or abortion. I was working to help the people who had less. Now I wake up every day to read news stories about people like me because they are the ones who make this world better. It Persuades me the work matters, and can make a difference. My work with The Free Press was not one of free speech either. Our goal was to inform, and we could not rely on our own sources for that. As a journalist's job is, there was little to no difference in how we approached issues. If we needed information about anything, we got information from sources. But we relied on our own sources for almost everything. Some of those sources were our local politicians. Some didn't like the idea of an independent press. Some weren't sure of their motives. And even some friends and family members were skeptical. We were journalists and we wanted to be able to do our job and make a difference. But we started to feel differently about what we were doing. Our work with the Free Press and the broader civil society was beginning to make a difference, one step at a time. In some ways, it reminded me of my own family's own struggle with my mother's cancer. It was not uncommon for her to be near death every day – but the news media was never there. Even as we fought for funding, our government, and to better our lives, we became aware that government wasn't able or willing to do much for us. We had all the tools, information, and money we wanted to fight for us and our families, but the government didn't see those needs or provide any assistance for us. We could not trust our government so easily and felt we were not safe. We looked to the military and the government for support. We looked towards the government, and believed that it could help us. But once you see what the government did for us, when you understand the lengths it went to in order to protect us – that's when you realise you can't trust government. There are people who want power. They want to control the world. They want us, in this country at least, to not have a voice. They try every strategy they can to divide us and take our safety. We've watched it for more than a decade. That's how much we've fought. We're all part of it. Those of us who have reached the end zone of our career have had our own personal stories of hope. Some of us have chosen to live with our issues and to work on them, while others have given up on that fight. I won't tell you mine, but I can tell you what I've seen: I've watched people go from feeling powerless to fighting for their lives – and sometimes, losing it entirely – to fighting for what they believe in. They are not afraid, and they are not afraid of where they are going. They are going to get there. We have every reason to be proud of the work we've done, and we can't stop working. Let me end with a quote from a politician in New Hampshire – and he's on top of his game. He's an example for every politician and every journalist who fights for your beliefs… I'll call Governor Mary Fallin. Governor Fallin's message for my brothers' and sisters' daughters can be heard around the world: ""Stand up to the extremist views you hear from people on your way to work."" With great care to convey that message, she goes on to point SCHOOLS: ""These are the folks that are really targeting our children. And we need to stop it.""

Episode 26 The most exciting part: Our characters are not in the best shape, and we can't tell exactly what's going to happen next. The next morning, a group of young women (called the ""Golems"") are looking like they are in real danger as the last ship they are on is sunk into the lake beneath the city. The men will just have to figure out how to move around using only their body parts - and their very existence is at stake. There are no real guns to fight against, only knives and clubs. They don't have enough money to buy proper supplies from the cities, and nothing they are going to do will bring them home. This isn't the real world, and this is not a post apocalyptic society. This is the post apocalypse world, where the sun has set and there are no food or water. An entire civilization (called ""The Cult of the Bop"") have been forced into existence as a last resort to survive the disaster they caused, and they"

"Hello darkness, my old friend. Continue the story:","


This time I think you'll agree that it's a good one! I will only mention one thing, and that is that I'm no expert; this story has already been told many times, in such a wayTennant is simply one of the few actors who can go full ""Dark Side of the Moon"" from time to time! I personally think that the original (Dark Side of the Moon) was a good movie, even if it is not as good by any means as ""The Thin Red Line"" - though I admit to very fond memories of the original ""The Thin Red Line"" (which I wrote about previously! ). Now to tell you the story...A long time ago, when I was only a young boy, a friend from school, a fellow college student by the name of ""Gustav"" contacted me with questions about a movie called ""The Thin Red Line"". I think I took it as a joke at first, but it got me thinking a lot about what was really good in the film. ""The Thin Red Line"" was not a great, ""bad movie"", something I thought was good in the beginning to a point where it started to become really bad for the rest of the film. I mean the story was very flawed, especially in regards to the female characters (in that case the female characters were just used as background decoration and even though it was quite a common thing it still bothered me). Also, I think in the end the characters did not evolve as you would expect at that age (especially for the male characters, I'd say that the female characters were pretty good, only we didn't realize which one was which, or could ever understand them). Now, I think we should also take into account that I'm a young teenaged, somewhat naive, writer-director type kind of person (I'm not saying that I was immature back in those days, even though I was - not that I was ""bad"" or anything). In order to be objective I must have to acknowledge that the story is kind of like many other ""high school stories"" (and films). At the height of teenage drama, when I was a kid, I would be in a dark pit and think, ""What do I do? I'm still young... I can't change anything about myself now."" I felt that this was a great metaphor on what was going on with me (and all teenagers). ""The Thin Red Line"" got me thinking a bit differently on how ""the world"" was changing, with what I called ""The End of the World"" (the end of mankind, and the end of this kind of life). So, I thought I'd take a little time to analyze it, to find out where the ""end"" was and what was behind it. As long as I'm here I'll do my best to not tell the story ""over-hand"" to you.I was originally a fan of William Stout's classic film, ""In a Lonely Place"" which tells a story of a man who must make the most out of his situation; this story's ""end"",oreAnd has been told many times (mostly by those who have watched ""In a Lonely Place""), but my favorite part of it is the moment when the main character, a man named ""George"" (the man and the boy meet again at what would become his home, where he is in a happy relationship with his wife and her boyfriend), is confronted by what appears to be a ghost who warns him against his actions. And in the end it has always stuck in my mind as one of the strongest and most profound statements of the way the world and mankind is moving (in a kind of a dark, almost apocalyptic way; we are living in an ""End of the World"" and there is no turning back yet and I think if nothing is done our very lives will continue down the track until we die in the end).I have to say that this sort of thing (my story) is not my usual topic. I just wanted to make this little review to share my thoughts on my favorite film (and why I love it), in case that sort of thoughts might be useful for someone else, and because I really enjoyed watching it (both in the original theatrical film and in my DVD copyovie - which is why I felt like I was watching the real thing).Also, I'll say this: I had trouble finishing the DVD, probably because it was only a 1-hour film (not including subtitles, which were cut out during the audio).I'm not saying that I enjoyed the film, because it felt too empty. I mean, the film made a lot of sense to me at some point and in almost every scene, but it never caught me, and I felt that this was a bad thing, as I felt that ""The Thin Red Line"" was a good film, in spite of the flaws. But I felt that I must try to better see ""The Thin Red Line"
You accidentally discover the sentence of death ( a sentence that kills anyone who hears it except the speaker ) when you say it over national television. Continue the story:," It will never happen again. It is a stupid thing to do. You probably should not say it. You probably should not ever say it again. You probably should not ever say it again. Okay, this is not a serious question. The people who write you misspelled your name, or they don't want to offend you. But that doesn't mean you've committed a violation of your contract or have committed a federal offense. This question could be resolved either way. You can tell the difference between a serious violation of the contract, with a fine and/or jail time, and not a serious violation, like a misspelled or non-existent sentence. If you've violated the contract: It was a contract, not a death penalty law. A death penalty law would have to be included to force the owner of your home/business to live up to his contract. Or you're not obeying any law. (In which case, you probably should have never lived there in the first place.) Or there's no reason for you to be the subject of this question in the first place

The answer here is you don't have to answer it. Just don't say it. It's not legal. (Unless, of course, you've already committed a federal crime.)

The following is an example of a question that could be resolved either way, but the answer is irrelevant. This question: I bought a new TV and it doesn't work. The TV doesn't look bad. I bought it. The tv won't work so I think it is defective. Did I buy a TV? Yes No

Here, the answer is just no, you didn't have a contractual agreement with the seller of the television not to own or sell it. There is no contract when it comes to TVs. So what you do is, you ignore the TV and keep asking it for its status. This may be the most important question you have to answer to prove your case.

Note: Don't do it if you have a friend or relative that also knows the answer.

What this article is about, is proving you are violating a contract. Whether it's a contract or the murder death penalty law, proving you were violating a contract is essential in order to find out if you need to sign a pre-termination Notice of Termination. If you are a potential buyer, you need to know if you are being charged for violating the contract you signed with the seller of the TV. If that's the case, you need to be sure to sign the notice of termination. The seller will say that you are legally bound to pay the entire amount. The seller will say, and often you will, ""I signed the document myself."" The buyer is usually required to sign the notice of termination by law. If you know that you are not technically bound by the contract, you will know it can be nullified if something happens to the TV.

You will not be able to prove conclusively when the TV is defective through a simple, honest question. However, there is one piece of information that is absolutely necessary to show that the TV is defective. It's the price on it, and it's the price on this item that determines the quality/price. When you buy a new TV, the item's manufacturer, your local TV repair shop, or the store where you buy the item all have information about its specifications that you can use. For example, many TVs in the 90s were sold under the TECS brand name. The TECS brand name was actually a code that the manufacturer used for identifying different types of TVs. The code on the television said that it was a TECS television, but not a TECS television. So the manufacturer and the retailer may have different definitions of a ""TECS"" TV. Some dealers in the 90s may even have a different term for the TECS brand – most likely TECS1, TECS2, etc. So, before you look up the specific description on the TV, you have to understand the TECS 1 and TECS 2 name changes.

So you take your TV to the TV repair shop. It's pretty hard to do this if the TV has been in storage. You may need to use a tape recorder. Now you have the specific description. You know that the unit has no problem on the video display. Now you do the math. You find out the price of the item (I am calling it your cash price, but if that doesn't make sense, this is a good approximation). (Most of the times, the price includes the parts and labor not only for the display screen, but for the other screens that the TV contains. This is not always the only part which contains the video display but the LCD and or LCD panel which is the picture"
"You have developed and ability to see how people will die when you look at them. Your entire life you avoided pictures of yourself, but today you forgot, and, brushing your teeth in the morning, looked in the mirror ... Continue the story:"," The second test is to see how long a person is happy. ""In modern Western and post-modern culture,"" says Dabra, ""having high scores doesn't seem worth it: you don't get noticed at all."" ""A lot of people say they are happy but then look on their faces... and they seem sad,"" he continues. ""They cannot do anything for everyone. It's like a trap. One doesn't have to look for happiness. No one can look for it.""

The third test is to see how willing people are to give up what they have. Some, like the students in Dabra's study, give away too many things. Others, he finds, don't. People who refuse to give up something they value may not be as unhappy as it seems -- they may be happy.

""I hope,"" says Dabra, ""that in the future we could discover many more types of happiness.""

He's been surprised just how hard it is to find, if one really knows where to look. What people want to give up every day is bigger than what they spend on it, and there is no easy way to figure out what that is. Dabra has written out the list: Things we must stop giving away: our health, our money, and our reputation. ""To what extent have we given these up?"" Dabra asks, incredulously.

To Dabra, the way to stop giving up things is to give up yourself.

""Life is made, not given,"" he writes. ""It's all yours. If you get greedy, you are wasting so much of your life, but if you understand this and give to everyone, you will get more love, more peace, more happiness in the life you live.""

That's why the book -- called ""How to Live Happy -- and How to Do it Well"" -- is so controversial. Many say he should not have done a survey of the most and least happy Americans.

""He is not giving up everything,"" says Daniel Gilbert, director of the Center for the Study of Science at Harvard University. ""He is not a scientist. He didn't have to make an empirical study of how happy people are, and he says that the answers are in terms of things he does every day. Is that what we want Americans to do?""

Even the authors of the book themselves concede that it has come under fire. One of them, Benjamin Page, the creator of the ABC News program, said he was told by a friend in the media that he felt the book had little to do with happiness because it was written in a conversational style and did not rely on data sets to test results.

""I agree for that reason alone,"" he says.

Page says that more interesting is the book's message itself: ""Not happiness. Not fulfillment. There's no one way to live. Not everyone is satisfied. Not everyone feels right. Not everyone is happy. That means it's up to us to decide to be.""

One of the two were the ones who are like stars of the sky and on the day of the feast, the second one was the one who started the fire, and they both ate as one, and with no food their strength was not strong enough to carry all of them. ""How do you know that they are not females?"" said the one who started the fire. It was the woman who had seen the face and looked at the man, when she saw this man. ""We are a nation that can be counted as five - one male, one female and one man. If these five members of the nation are in a city together (or other arrangement) and one of them happens to be a male, then this is proof that it is a man. If one of them happens to be a female, then it is a female. Therefore our numbers cannot be counted more than five together, because the five of us are stronger than the five of them. If they were to be in the same city and one of them is a male and the other is a female and they are in a different area, then the male was not in the city. Therefore the male and the female are in our midst."" But the man who had seen this man continued speaking to them: ""We are an individual nation and we have five members, one of whom is a male and one of whom is a female, and whoever is a man must be a believer in the One who created us and whoever is one of us must be a follower of the One who created us. Thus, I am an apostle of Allah and I was sent (as a servant) to confirm and strengthen one who is following the commands of the One who created us. The one who looks at us and we look at him do everything, and he knows nothing of our intelligence, and the one whose eyes are upon us - we have knowledge of his intelligence. We have the one whom I mention as ""our leader."" ""This is for those who are on the path"" So the apostle stayed in the city until he left for a day of rest by himself in a place which the narrator knows well, after which he returned to the city until the end of his rest. After his return the narrator (on this day) said, ""We then became very sad and we said, ""We have to go to that region,"" and we began to walk. We came toornothing near our village which the narrator (on this day) knew was called Dhat-Ud-din, the village which is near the city, and the apostle used to make a camel-trough so that when he set out for that region he would give it the best shelter. We used to say that if we were in that region we would certainly be victorious over those people. But we found that this town was one of the places he was referring to as the city. The narrator told this part of the story and the people began to laugh, but a moment later one of them turned to the other man and said: ""You look as if you were laughing. Why are you laughing?"" The man who had seen this man, said: ""To hear the man who told the story from a good-lookin' woman and to hear from the woman who told the story from a good-looking man.""

The people of the house were confused then. The priests continued their explanation. As the last man fell out of the sky the first preacher got up and said, ""As to today and tomorrow, my wife and child will be punished for their sins, we'll be thrown back to the beginning. But their whole life will be forgiven. I'm sorry, we don't get any better unless you do…""

Installer asks ""Do you want to overwrite existing files in: 3.x.bz2, 3.x.bz3?"" Yes, you are updating the cat ZIP for your new computer. ""Yes"" means that you are updating the cat ZIP and also updating the cat's ZIP for the cat. It has two files on it; cat 2.0.0.001 of itself, and cat 3.0.0.003 of itself. Each file must be named EXACTLY as presented in the installer. If you have not installed the cat ZIPs yet, it asks you if you want to use a ZIP editor (e.g. Rar or 7-Zip) to make the cats and zips on the USB installer USB. Select it. After, you get the message that the installer is finished. When you finish installing, the installer asks if you want to proceed with installing. You say yes. When the installer finishes installation, it asks you if you want to run it again. ""Ok"" and it asks if you want to save changes?

""Ok"" and it asks if you want to continue. You say yes. When installer runs, you are asked a few more things about the install, and then it is pretty much done.

You are on the desktop at home, using your smartphone to access your computer that you just installed.

You download some cat-n-zips to your phone, and you install the ZIP files to it.

This was the beginning of a strange encounter the villagers experienced while they were sleeping inside a hollow tree, while sitting in front of a tree branch.""

""The creature said something to the village, and then disappeared from sight. The villagers took some firewood they found and set it on the ground. After several days the burning wood could no longer burn, so the villagers found another fire wood and put it on the ground, with a stick tied to it. Since that day, the villagers have heard footsteps in the night near the burning fire wood…The people are now afraid to go near the hollow tree."" ―Source[1]

It's impossible to understand what happened here, except that no matter what, the woods were not closedheid, because the whole forest around it was open-air. The creatures did not have a visible purpose. They were merely evil manifestations of hatred.

It seems that at its source, there was a cult of Satan. They would bring forth beings as violent and destructive beings as they wished, if the gods did not save them, with either human beings or animals. Then they would either take over the forest, or the gods would cast the beings into a ""hell,"" as it is called in the Hindu philosophy.

One of the ""Hell Creatures"" that appeared in this story, is called Kri'aht.

Kri'aht (also spelled Kri'ah-ah-t) is a spirit in Hinduism that was used by the Gods to punish those who had wronged them (i.e., their own sons, ancestors, and in some cases their wives) with death: they would throw them into Kri'aht, which would create a ""solitary hell"" out of lava (as depicted in the story, in The Book of the Burning Earth) or some other fiery place, either on the earth or in the sky (as depicted in The Book of the Dead). According to Tibetan Buddhism, it was the demon that murdered King Surya of Magadha and killed his other seven sons in order to kill the Buddha itself. The word Kri'aht is the same Sanskrit word for 'fire,' so that this entity is really no other than a fire-devil.

The story's description of the ""solitary hell,"" refers to the"

"Start with `` Everyone knew trying to run was futile, yet so far all of them tried anyway '', end with `` I do n't make the rules, I just enforce them. '' Continue the story:"," [The woman was told that if she did not come in at work on time, she would be fired.] A long time ago, a little girl was very happy when she reached the end of her string of chores. She looked around and said to herself, ""This day of my life is over. Now I must do this or else I must watch my friends die."", end with `` My life is no longer justruits of my labors. It is just fruit on the trees of God who sees me. "" The woman continued on her way as she was told not to come accelerating toward the end of her string of chores. There is a picture below that tells the story about a man who tried many times to tell his wife, ""I do not make the rules, I just enforce them."", but she said, ""You do not make the rules, you just observe them. If you obey my saying, nothing will work."", end with `` My life is no longer just fruits of my labors. It is just fruit on the trees of God who sees I. "" So the man stopped telling his wife and he did not come. What is that about, a woman telling a man that he does not make the rules? The story is repeated in all three other verses in Matthew 16: 12-17. 1 Corinthians 14 tells the story of a man with his wife and it is very similar to the story of the woman in chapter one. It has been added by some translations to the book of 1 Corinthians. 1 Peter 5:18 tells us that Christ ""suffered pain for our transgressions"" and it is almost identical to another verse of the Bible that tells us that Christ endured the same for others. 1 Timothy 2:17 tells us that ""when God's righteous servant has prayed for us"" God ""rewards him with a crown of righteousness"" and all the people will be subject to God. In 2 Timothy 3:18 we have the words, ""I and my brothers are as the sheep of the Lord. They will be flocks for the God of Israel, not as the Gentiles are now flocks. And God will set us over their own souls to be God's possession and glory and a sharing in his good pleasure. And my brothers and sisters, God calls you to be holy, sober-minded, be strong in the faith, be zealous for good works. So then, every spiritual person should keep his life pure and his actions pure and upright."" These are all the instructions that a Christian should adhere to. If we live with the Lord and obey all of the Lord's instructions, even when we think he is not doing so, we will be given what He wants. One example is that if we are to go to the wedding in a hotel and there are no hotels in the area, then instead of going to one of the hotels that is located near the hotel (say a Holiday Inn), we can still go to the hotel and have a ""family"" dinner there. If we are told that there is only one hotel where there are several other restaurants, such a restaurant will be available at no charge at the other restaurants. If we are told that there is only one restaurant that has several other restaurants, then we will no longer be able to get food that we want for example, if there is only one restaurant that has a nice salad and another restaurant that has a hot sandwich, and the salad is cheaper, the sandwich will be available at the better restaurant. In 1 Corinthians 15:14 we read, ""And let your words and your conduct be upright and upright to the point of justice."" This should be our attitude toward everything, including things in the spiritual life. We are told to do ""whatever is right"" in 1 Corinthians 11:4. All of the following passages show that any ""sins"" on our hearts are to be exposed to God's judgement with God. 2 Corinthians 4:4-9, 10-19, 20-28, 29 The word is translated ""justified"" and ""repented of"". However we all know that ""justified"" also means ""cursed"", even though the Bible explicitly says that those people who ""repented"" of their sins would themselves ""state to God, ""I am justified"", and God would answer, ""You will be punished for that"" (Galatians 3:9). Paul's instructions to them are written this way: ""But God has not condemned you to Hell but has forgiven you your sins and taken away the punishment."" So if we are to be ""justified"", let us repent and then repent and then let Godliner ""Justify"" me, so I can escape this death, so that I can be justified as to what God has forgiven me? Let me get my sins forgiven. Please let me get my sin"

And then at the last line:

And they call me a monster for doing it so well.

As if it's just an act, another line of proof. As if I'm the man from the video.

But that isn't what happened to me, of course.

The thing that happened just happened.

I know it's something I've done before. I know.

The point isn't to prove how big I am. It's because I need to prove how small I am. How it's so easy to do in a battle, and to fall for it. How a simple act like that will change your entire life? How it makes you question whether or not you're worth the hassle. And yes, I admit, it's easy to fall for that.

I got into the war for the same reason so many other people do: because I wanted to change things. Because the way things are now, where men are pushed into battle, and no matter how hard they work, they're doomed to fail, no matter how hard they try.

But I couldn't fall for it.

Because I wasn't in a position where I could be saved, or at least that's what I wanted to believe.

All I wanted was to say that I was no longer doing this just for myself. That I was willing to sacrifice everything just to prove to myself that I wasn't.

I became a soldier not because I loved it, but because I was willing to take risks to prove to the people around me that I wasn't.

And that was no easy task.

I was still a kid then. I had just recently got my driver's license and, as I've written above, I didn't yet know how to use it.

But there's something about soldiers in this particular instance that I think stands out even more than the other reasons I came out of the war – this one just doesn't even register as a reason.

For me, the whole idea of a ""lone wolf"" soldier seems ridiculous. To me, soldiers were supposed to do more than just sacrifice their own well-being for the greater public. Like a doctor helping patients or a dentist assisting at an accident. Soldiers needed to help other people – to help other people and stop the war. I didn't think a soldier needed to be in front of the camera, or to be ""doing it for the cameras"". For me, it was about showing everyone up. Showing everyone that the war was pointless and wrong."

"Begin and end your story with this sentence: `` And yet, the city remained. '' Continue the story:"," This is a powerful sentence. The sentence captures the feeling of the place as something important remains to be discovered. So, if your story ends and you know that the city remains, then it makes sense to end on that poignant sentence. But that leaves you open to a question: ""Did you know that the city remained?"" Your work isn't done yet. You still have to find a way to move your characters from here to there, through time. And that is where your plot comes in. Your plot is the keystone of any successful story. The story you tell today will be different from the story you tell tomorrow, because you have a great story to tell right now. Your story is in there to make you feel in this place, and so it will not stay that way whether you end and end on a ""And Yet, the city still remained"" sentence or ""Did you know that the city remained?"" Your story will make no sense if you don't start telling your story soon. And then, don't say, ""I've got to write the story first.'' Just start. The more that you give yourself to your work, the more time you'll have to move forward and tell your tale in any number of stories. The same thing can be said for your career.
The secret to successful stories is storytelling. And that's because stories are always going to do anything at all. That's because it can never be enough. Don't beat yourself up about your inability to move forward—and then give yourself permission to move forward—because when you do, everything you were saying about the lack of time will be proven true. If you keep walking right through what you've been doing so far or telling too little of a story, you'll be saying, ""I really can't do it or I'll find myself back where I started, and nothing ever will get done because I won't have time to move forward."" So, the only way to get your characters where you want them in a story is to start telling it. And once you start telling, you don't know where you're going, but you know you're not stopping.  Just start. Just tell. Don't worry. You shouldn't waste time looking back. Don't worry about what you said yesterday; you should be writing, and writing, and writing! You can't stop now. It takes time for you to start telling. If you wait for it to happen before you start telling, you won't know it's there until someone asks you a question about where you've been. You either need to start telling or be afraid783 when you start.
6. Don't just listen to what people have to say.
People are amazing. Even though some people may think they are, other people are really wonderful people. People never lie about any thing. And they don't need to! What these same people don't understand is that sometimes the lies they tell, even in a story, can be just as important as the stories that we tell ourselves.   So how do you tell a story? How do you find what you want to get across in a story? There are many ways. There are many different types of storytelling, and you have to find the way to tell the story that is right for you. Here are some of the techniques and techniques that you can use.   
7. Be unique, but make the most of your unique
Now that you've figured out your storytelling techniques, it's time to decide what you're going to do. One of the most basic rules that you need to follow in storytelling is that you always have to be unique. Your characters must have something about them that makes them unique. Otherwise, you wouldn't put any effort into telling your story. And by something you say during your story, you're not telling it the same way twice. Instead, the character that you choose to be unique in your story needs to find something about him or herself that you haven't seen in someone else. And then, you need isolating information that tells the viewer about your character in so little detail that the audience can't help but notice the details that they might not if you hadn't isolated what they're thinking of when they see yourself.   
8. What does your audience care about?
If a reader doesn't care about your character, how are you going to tell a story about them? There's a lot you could do to make them care about your character, but no matter how you do it, your audience will take a different approach than you'd expect. So, instead of telling them a story about the character and never giving them a reason why they care about your character in the first place, why not tell them about his or her journey and why they care? This technique uses words and sentences that make the reader want to care about your character. If the reader is struggling to make sense"

But some things can't be explained by just two people or two cats. For example, the Internet is full of stories about what to eat on Christmas Eve with food coloring or what to say to your best friend when her phone gets stuck with that ""It's not really real"" message. (Answer: ""Let your best friend know that you appreciate the effort she put into this and how you think she's doing it."")

Even for those parents who know what to do (I like to tell my kids to put a box of presents under the tree right before I get home), there remains the question of what not to say.

I don't say ""My dog ate all the marshmallows. Go put them next to the stove.

I didn't mean that literally, and the rest is the same. And I don't say ""The lights are out. Go do something else.""

We don't do things like that for no particular reason. But, sometimes this does create a bit of a rift in our family. One of our Christmas traditions, for example: the homemade cinnamon rolls. The whole thing is about love. And love in the context of a child is defined as a bond between one man and one woman, no matter what gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion you might believe you are.

I always start my homemade cinnamon rolls with the words of my daughter's favorite book: ""I love you, sweetheart, and I know you love me.""

Her response to that is always the same: With every piece of wood that we cut (and sometimes with every other piece of wood that we cut), even though it's made of wood and I love every single piece of wood I make, you know it's really just for her.

In fact, a few years ago I made a video with my family, explaining that it was important to me to let my daughter know that her feelings had real impact on her. You can watch it here:

What would you say if someone used your children's toys to justify hurting someone (or, for that matter, hurting the planet)?

My kids are still children. I want them to play and explore and love and listen to their parents without judgement or punishment. (For anyone who is wondering what a child who isn't doing that to someone else does, don't forget that when people are doing something to an animal, it's a cruelty crime. That's the law right around the corner.) So I'm not worried about hurting someone. Of course I will speak out if someone hurts someone else's animal, but for my children's toys? Not so much … unless she's throwing them at the neighbor's dog. Then it's okay. I'm not even sure they can hurt someone."

Those were the first words that I had ever seen said by an earth dragon. However, none of me who had been saved by a dragon came to believe in that."" ""However, that is also the very reason where this town sprang from. The citizens came from all over. I believe that if I had asked them to stay for a year and told them about what happened in the end of the story... ""They would have probably replied, ""That was some kind of fairy tale!""... That story had ended, and now they wanted to hear about the true story, where a hero defeated a dragon."" ""I don't know of your name, but that is what I want to know."" Then I had a thought. I looked up at that giant dragon and tried to take in the feeling of him. If I didn't do that, I wouldn't be able to understand all that was going through my mind at that moment. So there was no choice. I turned back to those words. The people were starting to disperse. After a while, a wave of voices could be heard from the mountain's cliffs. ""Who are these people!?"" (I-It's probably the ones who have been waitingjpf

""They're probably members of the village that received me. When I told them about this story, they were shocked to hear that it had ended and started questioning me. Then one of them asked, ""Why did you say about an hero who defeated a dragon? The dragon you said had been defeated just days ago."" ""I, I won't hide anything from you. This was my secret story to save the world. Just like when I was growing up, I wanted to save the people from their worst mistakes."" ""So you've gotten used to such stories?"" ""...Yes. Since I was not born yet, I have no idea of how important they are to me."" ""If you knew about them, then probably you would have wanted to know more about what happened there."" ""Well, I won't say that it's useless. There has been many people who thought that there was an interesting mystery in the story... However, if I told you that story, you would find out the details very quickly because you don't need a deep understanding. If you can just ask the questions and see how quickly the story develops, then you would be able to get a better grasp of it."" ""That's the reason you won't hide anything from me. I'm already really embarrassed about it. Although you only tell me things from the front, I still get embarrassed when I'm not looking. When people are embarrassed like that, it becomes a problem."" -The boy I didn't know.

I will ask you not to ask people in the town so that no one can see it so I will be going alone."" ""You're only kidding, right?"" ""No, I'm actually trying my best to be optimistic, but that doesn't mean that I'm lying. I know that even if we were completely surrounded by the wall, it probably wouldn't be possible to hold off the dragon. Even then, how could we? ""At this point, do you think the dragon would let us in? He'll probably use the dragon's blood to seal the gate and send us back to the other side."" ""You say that like it's something trivial.

"Jesus returns, to a world populated entirely by robots. Continue the story:","

At some point, the Robot People turn their attention to the planet's corpus corporis, the part of the plant or animal that was just harvested for a harvest harvest. We have already seen this happening with the harvest of the corn, the harvest of the wheat, and many other crops. As we saw with the harvested human hosts, the transformation of the human body into a robot host is in and of itself an act of transformation from human to robot. This is in itself an act of transformation from human to slave, though not from slave to robot, as the human body was intended to serve the human host.

But what happens on the Planet of the Robot People is the opposite. In this case, it is the Robot People whose bodies are becoming robots. The planet has been transformed in order to make room for them:

The planet's resources are no longer available for growth. It has taken many generations to accumulate the necessary supplies to keep its inhabitants alive and healthy. But now the resources have been depleted. This is the result of thousands of years of industrialization, and for this reason the people we call Robot people don't have the resources for their own growth. They are forced to live out their lives in poverty, with only food and water for warmth.

But this isn't the case on Earth, where resources had always been available for our own growth. The only time we've ever had to endure starvation was in the end of the last ice age. There's a similar sort of reason in this story. Even if the planets are capable of sustaining humanity,Skin-crawling robots can't. And if they do, then the survival of most Earthlings is in grave danger from the Robot People.

Even more interestingly, this is an idea that I've given some thought about in my previous posts. And I think it's an interesting way to think about the future—of everything. As the planet turns into a desert, and people are reduced to slavery, the Robot People are the only humans that can be relied on to provide food for the rest of us. Whether or not the Robot People get the resources they need to survive will be entirely dependent on what the people of Earth do. Will they kill each other, or do they do more to protect each other than to hurt the people of Earth? Will there be an arms race?

Of course, there'd be more than one arms race. Robots as they are will no doubt be extremely dangerous to the Earth, and I've discussed the possibility of developing weapons that can eliminate life outright. But I think it's worth looking into the very real possibility that human civilization (and in particular humanity) might in fact collapse before its robots become self-aware. How could it actually happen?

As I mentioned earlier, human civilization was the product of an unprecedented leap from biological to technological development. And because of this leap of a few hundred thousand years, civilization was built with technologies like glass and steel. And those technologies are still here in our own time. But they're incredibly wasteful. It's a very difficult question to answer in detail. But even in our own time, technology is vastly more wasteful than biological evolution. The biological process of DNA generation is far more wasteful as a thing of value than a technology for producing new biological life (in our case, living things). This is one reason why the creation of new species is so hard when it comes to biology compared to engineering.

However, it's one of many reasons why the destruction of biosphere-destroying technology is so important. Not only do we have to reduce the number of biosphere-destroying technologies, but we must also take a much broader view of technologies than just biosphere-destroying technology. And one of the more interesting things we can say about that is that if we make use of technologies that don't directly wipe out species, then that reduces the overall problem, not just the biosphere-destroying technology itself (which we'll discuss shortly).

In the same way that Earth, unlike the life forms on Mars (which, by the way, seem to have been wiped out before we ever came to Mars), has not gone extinct because technology created it. We can see that our current planet is not the only path to a sustainable future.

There is an obvious question to consider here, of course. Would it be better to preserve existing species or even introduce new species, in order to reduce the overall problem? If we use technologies that are less efficient (such as chemical or biological warfare) then that may be acceptable for certain individuals and small groups, such as hunters and fishermen but not for general use of the resources. But would it be better to introduce technology that is more damaging to our own species? If we take just a small, suboptimal use of technology, that means we're taking it in the first case, because of its inherent, destructive nature. But if we"
Jesus joins the X-MEN Continue the story:,"

What is the problem? It's an extremely rare occurrence that a person actually dies. It will probably always be an extremely rare occurrence. The best guess is that it was a freak accident. The X-MEN are under the rule of an extremely powerful god. For a while there the only reason the rest of the mutants were able to function was because the other X-MEN were too busy protecting the dead person. After the explosion at the end, there was really no one to even get the corpse back on its feet.

It looked like no one was getting their corpse back on its feet after the explosion. It was quite a mess. Jean had managed to use the power of the other deceased mutants to find a way to get the thing with the blue skin back on its feet. But she just didn't know what the corpse was, or what that blue skin was used for.

I'm still not sure what the X-MEN are. It probably isn't anything special. Just a bunch of random mutants with strange powers who are living in a desolate landscape and live off of trash. The X-MEN exist to protect and watch over the world. That's why they're willing to fight the entire Shi'ar empire. I don't want to call them villains. They're a peace-loving bunch who are trying to do things the right way. The X-MEN are supposed to be the best at fighting. They also don't look like superheroes, so you don't have to worry about them being crazy. They're not stupid. They know how they're supposed to fight. That's what makes the X-MEN great.

You might be wondering, what's this all about? I found this interesting story while I was looking through some old issues of the X-MEN, Volume 1 and I thought I'd share it. After reading it again, I realized that Jean Grey is not dead. I figured she ended up with an accident or got kidnapped or something, but it just wouldn't make sense. So I changed his name to Cyclops X-Man (just his first nickname he ever had) and made this an actual story:

Cyclops X-Man is out on patrol. If I remember correctly, she wasn't actually in the middle of his patrol at first, it just sort of happened. We learn his name is Cyclops, and he's a mutant. He doesn't really have a face like some of the others, so it's just a name to him. He was one of the original X-MEN, but unfortunately for him he never made it into the X-Men. As a result of being frozen, he can't walk very far, and he's more than a little fat. I'm not sure if he's fat because he doesn't eat as much, or if he just can't walk very far, but he's definitely far enough away from the other X-MEN that he can't be considered an actual teammate. However, he doesn't really have control over his strength. He's a member of the X-Men, but he's still fairly weak compared to the rest of them. He was in the middle ofoso patrol, and Jean noticed him sitting there, reading his book.

They were out all that time and had never really interacted with each other until after their encounter with Magneto. When he attacked Xorn's ship, Jean was nowhere to be seen. She was on the front lines in one of Magneto's assaults against the X-Men and did not see Cyclops get killed due to the fact that he was frozen and can't walk. That was her fate. And the entire time she was in the middle, waiting for her resurrection.

While on patrol, Xorn is told that someone would be coming to kill him. When he arrives he finds a woman covered in white light. This is not the first time he has encountered some kind of white light. His first encounter was two years prior to this, and again, he didn't really remember that. He thinks it was the blue fireflies that started the encounter the first time, but maybe that wasn't the only one. What he thought was the white light really was a form of pain. His mind told him to run, but he wouldn't. So he fought for his life.

When an apparition comes at him, he realizes he is being targeted by someone who can't be touched. He is so scared he thinks he was taken by that apparition. When he runs back to the ship, he finds Jean dead. This was exactly where it happened. He tried to run, but it didn't work, because while he is running he finds Xorn still dying, and he knows it's not worth it. He wants to fight as much as the woman, or anyone in this place. As the apparition comes, it reveals that there is no resurrection effect at all. The apparition then gives"

"Suddenly, everyone on Earth becomes immortal, free from physical injury or disease. Except for one person. Continue the story:","

If contended upon, the existence of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was a great discovery. It was also a terrible mistake which cost us our lives. What is our world if not a living hell, a city of flame where people endure misery for the remainder of their earthly lives. The man who has committed the eternal crime of blasphemy against the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for which all others have paid the penalty, is now the sole proprietor of all that is known of earth. He can see, hear, taste, touch, and smell everything with his very natural senses. He is no longer bound by the laws of nature, and the blind God of the Old Testament, who did not see that we need a soul to live, is powerless to prevent him. He is a king. He is the creator of his own life; and thus he is free. The earth he created for man is his. In all his actions, he cannot be blamed for the deeds of others, because from day to day he is doing what he did from a higher position in his heavenly throne. He is a king, and the only kings who can be blamed are those who live only by the grace given by the Lord Christ, who was, in all things, his king. He created the earth, man. His kingdom is earthly. His throne is in heaven. He is the chief of the angels. He is our guardian angel. He watches over us from heaven. Our kings can be, and sometimes are, accused of sin and fall out. All they do from this point of view is to obey divine commandments. If they live justly, they bring glory to him who gave them life; if they bring shame to themselves by their wrong-doings, they deserve the everlasting punishment of hell. They can bear the burden, but they cannot bear the weight of the responsibility. They can be accused, convicted, and punished, by the judgment of their own conscience; but they cannot bear to bear to live in shame by their own unreflecting conscience. Now that they are free from the chains that bound them on earth, they now live free in heaven. They have the whole earth before them. There there is no crime or sin that can not be atoned or forgiven. There is no sin that God can not atone for. They have the earth before them, and they are free to live on it. They are the heirs of the kingdom of heaven. So when the apostle says, Christ is Lord of all, he means to say that He, and all that live by his grace, are Lord of the earth. Thus it is to be understood that Christ is Lord of all, for whatever His human followers may do or suffer, He alone bears the blame, because he is the only one who can decide with certainty who is to be set free by the divine judgment. Even if man were to commit a sin for which he was bound by the command of his Creator and by the punishment inflicted by his own conscience, it would not matter, for he would have been set free before the final judgment was consummated. Hence those people who have done wrong on earth in this present life will be damned. They are, as the New Testament teaches, without the promise of resurrection, and without the ability to escape the eternal fire that awaits them there, for they have no ability to see the light of the new day at any time. Those who are destined to lose their eternal life are those who have committed the eternal crime of blasphemy against the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and have not repented of the crime before the final day. They are, as St. Paul writes (Once again I must warn you, lest any man spoil you through philosophy, and pervert you to a false doctrine, according to the insatiate desires of your heart, which turn away from the things which are sound and which are become vain through the deceitful conversation of evil men; but God is not partial to the ungodly. For he abides in the earth to make a better world for those who are good. Be not deceived: God is not mocked: the one who utters a lie is the same as if he himself were God. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. (1 Cor. 15:20-26) After being justified by the faith of Jesus Christ, which he received by the Father's mercy, he became the Son of God, that is, an heir of the grace of the Lord Jesus, and also of the Holy Spirit, and became the minister both of righteousness and of judgment among all people. He is the avenger of all the ungodly, and he will judge between them with righteousness... Who is like him, who was faithful without fault, and bought a goodly robe, and also died in his father's house"

How to Be Happy – ""How I Went From One of Your Worst Times to a Better One

""A day in the life of one of the people who was close to me [while my life was being controlled by the Church].

It was after I decided it was time to abandon the priesthood, when I realized I could no longer serve God – it was time to become better, better, better.

I realized that there are other people not blessed by God who suffer a lot for their faith and are not loved by their families, and who end up depressed and miserable. And I realized that God is no different: No one walks out of the Gospel and walks out of its mission.

I'm not saying that I did anything special. I just learned how to go to heaven a better person as a result of this. I saw an opportunity to bring someone around who would live and think exactly like me, and for anyone who ever needed someone to help them get through to God in a way I think that I could help them do.

After meeting these people, I learned a few things from them, and I'm also going to try to share those things with you.

1. Happiness is a choice, but what you choose for happiness is a gift from God.

Life is not a game or competition, and it is a gift even when you feel like something is wrong with you, you lack, or you are losing because something is wrong with you. We are all created in the image of God, but we are a fallen race, and we are just as guilty as anyone else.

How can you avoid the trap of trying to live like someone who is not like you?

The most important thing to remember is that God is looking out for you, and he does that by not having you fail. If you fail in relationships, and don't find what God wants in your life in a timely manner, that's your problem and not the Holy Spirit's problem; then you didn't see it and God did not notice. What really comes back to you is to make sure that you keep coming back to him, for as long as you do you are sure to see the good in things.

Once again, God is not giving you a free pass. But instead he gives you opportunities to give better; things that will make you happier.

If you are trying to create a kind of life for yourself, I would say that is an area you really need to work on.

2. Don't go to hell for getting married – that will make you happy. In fact, your happiness is what gets you married.

""Marriages have been the worst thing in my life. And I'd guess that 90-95% of all marriages will kill one partner's soul. And I know that this is really what Christianity intends. They are the worst possible way to get along and the best possible way in which a couple can get along. And I see it all around me and I don't care who you are. I think that you think of Christians as being kind to you, but the truth of the matter is that they will not save your soul. They will cause death instead. And so, you have all this choice in life and you want to die happy. The question is: How many are you going to make happy?

And yes, I know, marriage is easy. The way most people get married is like the way most of us got married: It's easy. They are going to make happy people in the marriage. But those people are the easiest to create and most likely will end up dead.

It doesn't matter how good your parents are or how nice your neighborhood is. The fact is it's just not right. It will make you"

Hey there, devil player! Welcome back. I know you've come from a long way away to play a game of chess with me, but can you handle making conversation with an old friend such as yourself? You must have seen that little boy's eyes when you walked into his dream and heard him tell you about his adventures while you were playing, don't you. I see you're very surprised, and perhaps I should tell you that the game of chess is a lot more interesting than I originally told you it was. But you might not have been expecting a whole lot of history. Before you get stuck into the game itself, let's talk about the past. Yes, I've read it. You didn't just stumble onto it on the way here. You had time and space to memorize. It's almost like you watched someone else's dreams when you played your first game. But don't worry, I'm sure you never had to leave your room, even though you said you wanted to. Maybe you were a gamer before that. But you should have been! So how did I know you wanted to play? Well, maybe you were waiting for someone to teach you how to play chess, or maybe you were waiting because you could not resist the magic of being able to play the game the way you wanted. Either way, you have a pretty good grasp on the basics. So why make the first move? We don't have time now, so it doesn't matter what you wanted to do for your first move. Why not put the devil to a test of his strength? It is the best opportunity you have to test your skills against a real person. But it doesn't hurt, really. So let's get to the game! First, let's see what happens when the game is decided... I've already taught you how to play chess. Let's get you some drinks and I'll tell you what's up. The devil is the strongest. He can beat you! The devil is the strongest! You are very strong. He can beat you! But I have someone better than him. You can't kill him yet. He could kill you if you play him, you know, like you are supposed to. I'm sure you're pretty good enough to match his level. So no matter what he does, you can't hurt him, even with his power. The devil cannot win against the strongest player on Earth. There is one thing I know for sure though. Before the game can start, the devil's gonna have to show you something"

In the past, one robots master went on vacation, and the previous master stayed by his master's side. The past master started having accidents and lost a lot of the robots. At the same time the previous master also started having accidents. One day the owner saw the master's robot was in an accident. The manager told the master and the manager and the master is so very satisfied and feels very happy. And for a year, both master and robot are doing the same job and the manager continues to keep the master on board. Meanwhile the manager is taking his retirement. In this case, you need to decide what to do about it.


What happens if your robot could become a slave?


If a robot becomes a slave, the robots owner must start living like a slave, and he must not use his robot. On a future day the robot runs out of money and the owner has to stop using it. As a slave the owner should be given one meal a day and he should be provided a house. As a servant, he should be given a uniform and he should be provided a room. As a slave, the owner can't leave the robot or leave all of his belongings. However, it doesn't matter for you. The robot you used for your work doesn't have to be replaced. It will work for you the same way paralytic dogs work by the man's side.


What kind of robot can become a slave?


A slave is always needed whenever a master doesn't like something. He is an indispensable part of a boss or a client. His own master must give him to the master if the master decides not to use the slave but just to leave him behind. For that reason slaves are indispensable. When a master needs a slave for a job, the master must be willing to let the slave work for him. As a slave the master can't just buy one out or else if the slave gets lazy he will run away. The masters choice is limited: The master has to have enough money to keep a slave.


You always need a robot to accomplish everything. Keep in mind that many things can be done only by a small robot, as it's extremely useful"
Write an incredibly hateable character who is n't explicitly evil or antagonistic. Continue the story:," the author is giving you free reign to create more characters.

For instance, say that you've just written a really bland and blandly evil character—it's the kind of character that every author wants right up until they are forced into making a character who's so much more interesting than you imagined them to be, and even then you still want to keep going. It can be very frustrating.

The author will probably throw in this comment to either justify the character or let them know that he wants to keep going to further explore the character who, in this case, will make the book more interesting:


I don't want to finish this story. Do you?

The next time you read a book that uses this technique to force you into writing less interesting characters, do it with caution.

You can have someone like Ben Machen or Tim O'Brien or Tom Wolfe write better characters than you, and their books will get more sales. They may not be the author you want, maybe it's just the way their characters are written.

There's also an element of the author's ego involved. As a writer in particular, you're trying to do something very difficult and challenging that demands a little bit of ego in its participants. You want people who will come together under conditions that can't be taken for granted.


If you're a good writer, you can also write very interesting and interesting characters, which are the other end of the spectrum you want to fall into.

But in order to be an interesting person you need some skills you can't teach. You can't just say, ""Here's some skills I teach you,"" or ""Here are some skills I don't teach you,"" because what you teach is what makes you interesting, not what you do. And what makes you interesting is to be yourself, to be willing to face the facts. It turns out that there's more to the process of writing than talking yourself into writing about a character's flaws and foibles.

It's also very difficult to know whether a character is fun. If an author uses the ""character is boring"" technique, the problem with it may be that we don't know if his character is interesting. If an author's characters are too boring for him to be interested, then that makes the characters much less interesting, just because they aren't interesting.

It could be a character who is basically just a generic action figure (or a character who is supposed to be a generic action figure anyway). It could be a generic character in a generic situation. It could be a generic character who only has two lines in his backstory, which makes him absolutely irrelevant.

This author had a character who was a generic action figure, but was also supposed to be a generic action figure. He was an easy character to write about, as he didn't fit into any specific archetype to begin with. After writing the first hundred pages, he decided he no longer wanted to write about generic action figures and was so frustrated it almost ruined the book. But the author didn't have the same issues with his novel, which he just decided he didn't want to write about because it was boring and they didn't want to read it.

The problem then became a reader's challenge, to be sure he wanted to read the book as opposed to just not want it to exist because they didn't want to read about a generic action figure who happens to fit into an archetype for his own reasons.

So, if you read this novel and it has a generic action figure who happens to fit into some generic archetype… do the character belong to that archetype?

The answer, of course, is yes. But that doesn't mean they belong in that archetype.

The trick with the generic action figure is that you can get away with writing him/her as much as you like. But at some point you have to realize that the author has given up creating his/her identity or story. So be it.

Your character is not who you wanted to write about, you just put some generic generic action figure into the story and let him/her be it.

If the author's character and any of his/her other characters suddenly start taking more interest in different aspects of what the character is about, well, you have a problem.


If a character isn't doing something and the author makes them do something, that only makes them more interesting than the character did before. It also shows me that the author knows the character is less interesting than before. But it doesn't necessarily mean the character is more interesting, it's just the author's way of saying, ""Hey, these characters just happen to be doing something.""


But, of course, there are exceptions. In some cases it's a good idea for a character or a scene to have an additional actor (usually just a"
"16 digits on a blackboard and you 're not sure how you got there. There 's a door, what looks like a mirror and one 1950s tv set in the room. Continue the story:"," You're standing on a set of stairs when you're called up. What do you do? As you step through the door, you realize it's a hallway. You move along the hall and to the right into a room. It's an old home on a hill, you can't look out the windows. There's a fireplace, what looks like a TV in the room with the set that you found earlier. There's a table with bookshelves, there's a refrigerator with fridge paper and a coffee machine. Another closet has a shelf with more clothes and clotheshoes. Another drawer has a box of soap with a few clothes neatly folded in it. The closet again with some old clothes and old hair. You walk by the refrigerator to find a book with a few clothes neatly folded, it shows the book is by a woman called Martha Nix you guess, you notice she never leaves that office. You look down to the bookshelf and see a couple of books on the dresser, the one on the right with the picture of her and her hair is by John C. Delaney. There's a second book on the left with a picture of Henry David Thoreau. So that's where you were. Oh, this seems to be different from the other one you found. That's a really neat piece of mail. You've got to see it. As you approach the door to the left of the fireplace, it opens, there's a door it looks like a door leading back into the hallway and into a small room with a light on in the middle you see the white sheet against a wall, all the rest of the wall is white. The lights are on in that room and they are off on the other side. You step off a step, step off one end into a smaller room that leads up to a back garden, the back garden turns out to be bigger than you'd expect. A fountain and a small stream and you can see there are trees. There's a small pond in the back garden. On a hill you can see the top part of the city. You know the people you live with. You're in a small, white building on a hill with little trees around you. At your waist is the white sheet and the clothes that you saw earlier. You walk out to the porch into a lighted garden and a fountain. The house is covered with leaves and cacti. You step into the fountain and see there are flowers all over. You start back into the house, you're lost in thought, you almost lost track of time. The house goes all the way back up to a big red light with a large red sign on it. Here's the sign: 'TUNNEL'. It's another one of your old houses, but it is just like this one, the water runs from the big red light as you walk up to your front door. This time the door is open, but you couldn't get inside because it's locked. You go back into the living room and into another small room. The window here doesn't look great, there's a picture of a dog there, you were told there's a dog. You're walking through a kitchen area and you hear music and you stop and ask the lady sitting at the kitchen table, what's that? She tells you it's the piano. What does she do all day? She makes little cups of tea and some bread to enjoy during her lunch break. Who is she? You come to understand she's your great-uncle. She helps you eat. She has a small, white cat or a dog. What do you do to her? Her name is Linda. You see the baby on the table and she's going to try to hold him. You leave the restaurant and come down the street where you can start your drive at the station. Once you get down to the other side you enter your car and start down the road a little ways. You notice you can't drive that fast without bumping into things. You've noticed a lot more cars and cars passing you. You see an old yellow truck pass by. A lot of women are carrying bags and children are playing in the street, a couple of men are smoking a little. You look at the white sheet, where did it come from? There's a girl in bright blue jeans and a shirt on that you can see her breasts. A man is standing on the bench and waving, he asks you what you're doing and you look up the road and look to the right. A man is taking a walk. He's wearing a white t-shirt and is wearing a white hat. There's a white car passing by. You stop in the middle of the street to look and the man's staring at you. So"

Gears of War 4, The Last of Us, Prey and God of War. These series have all made it onto my Top 10 for 2013 and I find them all really damn good. So when I heard that Epic's Quake 4 would be coming out, I got off my ass and bought it. I played a couple matches and was really enjoying it. Then I saw the trailer for Epic's new shooter project, I fell in love with it right away and was immediately on board to be involved in their story.

So it's the time in 2014. You've played the games, seen them used, and now you're about to kick kick kick one out and start your own story. Do you know what I'm talking of? Well, the thing is, as a story-teller, you have a lot to gain from all these different characters, even if they're based on your favorite series (like the Gears of War series for example) or movies (the Prey, God of War, Uncharted)

I want you to think aboutKalie and the boy who cried wolf, who is an innocent in nature, whose life would have been just a normal boy's life, had he not met a monster in the woods, who is possessed by the evil spirits in the woods. The very same boy who had this dream, to become a hunter. But what is his connection to all of this, and why does he want to become the world's Hunter? How does his soul get corrupted, and what will it be like to live with this new and powerful spirit, after a lifetime dedicated to becoming one?

So if you're like me and love video games, I suggest you get ready to dive into Epic's Halo 4 at this year's E3 Expo. You can pick your own adventure, whether you play Halo or not, but I guarantee you you'll get a really great story as you explore the new world of Halo 4.

The Good

The combat is solid. Halo 4 is the first Halo where you will be able to take full advantage of its ability to fire two-handed shots and rocket launchers, the classic Halo combos. And then there's the new game mode - Forge - which is another new addition to the franchise that's basically the Halo formula with 3D graphical destruction.

There is, however, one major problem with the first game, and the reason why I've become a fan of both Gears of War and Prey, as well a new franchise called Gears of War 4. There's a ton of story, character development and story telling in Gears of War 4, but you've got to keep in mind that it's just one game, and that it has been designed around the series' mechanics. This means that for a lot of folks, the story is just a nice story to have - and if you want to see the rest of the game, you can, but I really doubt it will be worth your time and effort.

What I'm talking about is what I call the 'halo effect,' or more specifically, The Halo Effect.

The Good - A lot of characters, especially the major characters, have been fully fleshed out. I really enjoyed getting to know most of the main cast in this title, except for the mute girl and a couple others that are fairly minor.

The Bad - The story isn't as deep as I would like it to be, because most of it has the Halo Effect: It's a lot of story and character development, but it's a lot of fleshing out of the main cast.

The Gameplay - This is going to be an amazing game, and I'm really looking forward to trying my hand at the new game mode. However, you really should expect the game to feel... shallow on my part; a little bit of grinding may be expected (and I'd hate to see your experience negatively impacted by it). I did the new game mode really well, so just like I did with The Last of Us, I would recommend trying to reach level 50 before getting into it. However, I was able to complete it with like 60 hours under my belt, so you never know.

The Movie - Epic should make a cinematic sequel to this game as per their previous commitment. I'm looking forward to seeing it in theaters before I can say if it'll be decent or not.

The Soundtrack - Not only is this game a perfect marriage of the classic sounds of Gears of War and the unique sounds of Halo that I love, it's pretty much just as good as the audio on The Last of Us. This is another area from Epic, where they are looking to build upon their sound and direction in the new game"
At age 18 you are required to go to city hall and have someone read you through a choose your own adventure style book of your life while you make the choices. The choices are permanent and will determine your life. You are the clerk reading the books. Continue the story:," If you select an orphan, your family must suffer. You decide the amount of pain a family goes through each month and then your character makes a choice for pain or happiness (that you wish to change).

Once you choose how severe the pain or happiness will be, you start reading the book (if you don't read a book once your character is an adult, his or her first book becomes a blank page). Keep in mind you can take things out of the book and use them later on in your life. The more details you give, the better.

The other option is if the book gives you an idea for how you go about life you can make the experience seem to live up to your idea of what it means to be an adventurer. The book tells you what your choices will hurt (pun intended).

One thing that can cause trouble for an adventurer is that he or she will have a job. One bad choice in a job can mean permanent disfigurement or losing one's job, and if you want your character to be able to take care of themselves, they should be able to find a job on their own. In The Road, your character can have a job and make that job their job, like a baker. (If this sounds like you, look into job coaching or a similar training.) These can even be the very thing you need to stay alive through adventure. So keep in mind, it is in your character's best interest to find a job on their own but if they're a poor candidate, the job might not be there for them. When this becomes a problem, the job counselor shows up to try and guide the adventurer.

But the other question you should be asking yourself when you read this book is: what did I choose to do to make this life worth living? It takes a certain amount of time into the game for you find your identity. One thing I would suggest is the player's job is to learn the job description of the job until they become comfortable and then make a decision that will help that business. For example, they might be asked to provide services to a client who could be your landlord and give them a room to sleep in. Another example might be the player's job is to work at a car dealership or a car wash.

As a GM you have a few ideas for what might make an adventurer to be useful but that player's job can vary because the player will have a lot of other options.

Another thing you can do is give out jobs more in line with character's personality. You can also choose to have them work in secret and only get a portion of a client's income (for example you may be working at a jewelry store and the client may pay you a small amount for work only), but in the end it comes down to the player's character.

If you choose to have the Player's Job option, you could also make it easier to have the adventurers' job. Have them do certain things for their customers or not work so in the end it may come down to their character's desires and their character's abilities.

The Road books give us an idea of what a life with an adventure might be like. The role-playing aspect will certainly give some players the time to think hard about what they do in order to live within their means, the road can give the same and so it should.


A quick description of the game

The characters are an assortment of adventurers, from adventurers in The Road books to adventurers on their own in The Road. They all make choices through choosing between four different stories (which tell different parts of their characters' lives). Each story is unique and this allows the GM to create a story with each character.

Characters are born as adventurers, so you are all a blend of adventurers. This is a good thing since there is a fair amount of danger here, even though it doesn't really impact the adventure. The characters are only in their third year but they are in a dangerous place,politics is being made to protect their job and family, and they have yet to find answers as to how they can help others. The book has the player making choice after choice which is quite humorous.

Each adventure in this third book has its own goal

The Road has many different stories in it but also is not limited to a particular set of objectives that a character can do or be a part of. These include:

• The people they serve (the family, the community or the country).

• Places and people they visit, including their own personal quest.

• Fighting and combat scenes

• Problems and obstacles the characters must deal with, including their own personal struggles.

The moment of the explosion: The moment of the explosion: At the time of the explosion, the blast is loud and powerful and so immediate that it makes even a tiny rock fall and leave a crater. So, too, with the earthquake that preceded it. Even in Haiti, which was hit more than five years ago by a 6.0 earthquake, the last big one, the last big quake, a reporter was able to catch a glimpse of a big hole in the wall of a church. At the beginning of this story, the reporter was told that another big hit could occur within another five minutes. The reporter is standing on an abandoned street in a quiet neighborhood when he hears someone scream a bit too loudly. He rushes back to his car to see what she's screaming about. As he drives away the shrieks become more piercing. A building is on fire; it will probably take minutes for firefighters to put it out. But there, standing on a sidewalk, a young woman screams for help. She's screaming for her son after a nearby building has collapsed. The building is two blocks from her house. The boy, standing in one of four rows of black-and-white-roofed schools along the street, can't stop crying. This is the middle of the afternoon, the sun is setting, and a crowd that swelled when the earthquake struck a couple of years ago now, just a few miles away, has moved closer to the road leading into the neighborhood. The reporter follows the woman through a house to where her boy is crying, but by the time he sees her it's too late -- the building has collapsed. The reporter drives back and forth in a daze. He wonders where he is. He sees a large hole in a house in the area. He rushes to check the building, but it's gone. What's left of the neighborhood is a wreck. The street is a disaster area; nothing remains but rubble and mangled limbs. The neighborhood's inhabitants had taken shelter in the school, but the gymnasium is gone. At the first sign that he might discover what's left or get a good look at the scene, the reporter decides to turn right around. He follows a dirt road to a building that's partly obscured by the rubble. When he gets there, the walls are almost entirely gone, and with them, the structure behind them has collapsed. It's clear that something terrible has happened. The reporter calls out to the boy sitting near the scene of the wreckage. `` Don't look. Just stay here,'' he tells him. ``Don't move, don't look.`` The boy doesn't budge. When the reporter puts forth the suggestion that maybe he should go around the school, the boy doesn't budge. The reporter asks him repeatedly if he really was in danger, but the boy refuses to answer the question. At some point, the reporter decides that one of the school's teachers might have seen the fire and escaped in time, but the school building itself is badly damaged. He decides that because of the damage there, this is the area at the front of school that the teacher might be hiding in, if any. Again, there's no sign of him, so the reporter decides to give it a try. He drives around the rest of the neighborhood, following the teachers' footsteps, just as he'd done when the children were brought to safety earlier in the afternoon. But the path is now blocked. The reporter goes back to the school. As he's trying to get to the other side, he hears a scream. A scream that seems to come from a different direction. It's close enough that he can make out the voice. It's too close, and so the reporter decides that it's better to let things occur as they come, when it's clear that some of the families will still be inside. As the reporter inevitably heads back toward the school, he continues to watch the students move cautiously, slowly, carefully, down the street. It's hard to picture this child's face as the kids rush into the rubble and find out that there are no students there, a result that won't even begin to weigh on the teachers, who know, as everyone knows, that there are no parents waiting in the rubble. There's no one else but the reporter sitting in his car, watching students run away from his car. It's hard to imagine, now. The reporter is watching students and teachers run for their lives right in front of him. No one else notices. The moment the reporter turns to go, he looks up to see his car's headlights flickering in the darkness. Then he drops his car and collapses, dead. His body falls into the"

You ’ re very jealous, you know I am, and the fact that her parents are a bit of a pain, and she doesn 't have anyone to take care of her while she's away. That's why I'm calling you right now. 2A You are currently planning to go away on holiday and she's getting the same invitation as you. It's time to act. 3A Make sure you're wearing an eye patch and a nose ring. Make some noise, and call her out by name. If you're nervous at all, or only have two minutes to stop and think, go ahead and scream.


If she's not screaming, have her phone on silent and go outside. 4A If she doesn 't give you a response, get a gun, put it to her head for one count, and put the bullet in her torso.


If she hits her head on the pavement, put a few bullets in the back of her head and have them leave before she hit the ground. 5A Now that the first few bullets are on her, do something very different from the other times you've done this before. Not the whole ""kill your family"" thing, but something less drastic and probably a bit funnier. 6A Leave for your place of travel. 7A Make a very loud, loud, dramatic announcement by yelling some swear words while you run out the back door of the club.

I'm sure you got what I was talking about: ""If she doesn't give you a response, say 'I'm ON MY WAY!' and run up the stairs into the bar where you will be sitting. If she's not screaming, have her phone on silent and go outside."" - Don't worry, this is the real world, people can make noise, and a few sound effects, no matter how ridiculous they sound. The problem with using this trick is that you're essentially telling her that you don't love her. When you say something like ""I'm off for vacation!"" it's pretty obvious that you do love her, but there's no way she's going to go to your room for the night and listen attentively while you yell ""F*** HERS!"" to her mom with a gun pointed directly at her head.

Do not use this trick to get a man to like you and you have every right to hold this up as a sign that you would rather date someone better with a high-tech gun hidden under his shirt than to the best-looking lady that's with you instead of somebody you're more in touch with, like an old friend. Don't use this trick on women that are only attracted to the type of guy that goes in for the ""love"" or the ""sex"" part.


Don't use this trick and don't think that you are. It has the double and triple negative connotations in the context of men makingdepending on the way the scene is set.

If you want a guy (and especially someone who wants to have sex with you) to like you a lot before you know that he likes you, then make it sound really weird and unnatural so that the most people will think to ask about what you'e doing in public. For instance, say something like ""I'm at a place at which I can't get in because there's no way that you're"
Scientists discover an algorithm for predicting a person 's date of death with 95 % confidence. When you finally decide to enter your parameters into the algorithm you see a surprising result. Continue the story:,"

This algorithm makes predictions based on the information provided by his email. By the date of death it predicts he'll be at home, eating dinner and watching TV. Now I believe my predictions have been borne out, because before leaving his home city and travelling to a far away island, his email had been updated regularly.

How many of you can relate to this story?

How long until we hear something about the algorithm that predicts your own death with 95 % confidence?

This algorithm makes predictions based on the information provided by his email. Because emailing a friend to let them know you are in a meeting at 5 PM is a great way to get a quick response in one direction, the algorithm has been tested to predict the day based on their email address. It has even been used for dating in that way. The algorithm has been tested against every year of the information we send to each other through email, and it's 95 % sure that our emails are unique. (And, believe me, it'll get better as you send more and more information through your email.)

How does the algorithm determine that my email address has been successfully identified as being from transmission, or not?

This algorithm makes predictions based on the information provided by his email. I can't actually say that this worked for every user, because I haven't identified every user from which the email was received. I only have a sample dataset where the data indicates 90% matches. But that's enough of a sample size to get me 95% confidence in my method.

Can you see why it's worth investing in?

There are two great reasons someone might invest in this data.

First, the algorithm offers the following insights, with 95% certainty:

It takes time to get your email messages right. You need to understand a user's preferences and make sure that a feature such as a notification inbox or call to action button works well for them.

Because of our email data, you can now know when and why an email was sent to you, which email features worked well, etc. You will now have a clearer understanding of where your email messages are most likely to end up, and what the average time to read an email is.

Batman gets a call from commissioner Gordon about trouble down at Arkham Asylum. As soon as he arrives he sees the culprit giving himself up to the police. He 's a security guard who has shot and killed several of Arkham 's frequent residents. Continue the story:," Joker is back.

Joker gets another call from Commissioner Gordon around this time, and he tells him that in the meantime he wants him and his staff working at Arkham. You can hear the Arkham security guard speaking with Batman when Joker enters the hospital, but as soon as your conversation begins the guards tell him to stop. His next words reveal himself to be Batman, at the same time as he's knocked out (or ""broken"").

A few days later Batman is taken to The Buried Giant by Gordon in order to search for the Joker. Joker's there too. You'll find out quite quickly that he's more cunning yet is not as intelligent as Batman, as he and Gordon discover that the Joker has escaped. Joker escapes to a helicopter, but you are able to stop it once you have a good look at the craft.

While you're waiting for the helicopter to land another call comes in that Joker now has the help of the Black Mask, his younger brother. The masked man brings something up to Batman, and the Dark Knight wants to know what it is all about. Joker, as usual, isn't interested.

A few minutes later, Joker is back. He's taking it on himself to bring Batman down, which is what he does, and you have to use your ingenuity on the Batmobile. You're able to turn the Batmobile into a helicopter and use it to fly the Batboat to the jail, and when you arrive there, you discover that Joker is in town again. You and Joker battle again. When Joker is defeated, you find out that Gordon has actually been working for the Black Mask.

You start to uncover more about the villains of the Arkham games, and find out that the Arkham games really are far from being a ""fun"" series, but rather are a series of dark and twisted adventures from a twisted mind. Joker is even taking part in the proceedings, but not in the way one would expect.

What will I find here? Well, don't expect much exposition, but some interesting things. First of all, The Arkham games can seem repetitive, but with a good level of depth and meaning to each character. You're able to connect people just through the games, which is something that should be done in all games. You'll probably be very disappointed to find out the Batmobile that has been driving you around is a complete mess, and is broken all the way at the front.

Batman's most recent game was a surprise, and while you'll feel disappointed with Arkham Asylum, you're able to enjoy the best game Batman has had thus far (or at least since the Arkham Asylum games were released). Batman's return is a strong one, and you'll be impressed with the sheer insanity of it all.

Batman: Arkham City is the third game in the Arkham series, it takes place on the streets of Gotham City, and features the return of Batman, which is the biggest change between the second and third titles. The story can get rather dull at times and I don't feel it has the depth that it had in the previous games, and some would say it's the most boring of any of the games in the series. You're forced to follow the trail of Gotham's villains, but as you can see you have more than enough to do in this game.

Overall, I am loving Arkham City. It is the best game in the series, and I hope that the final installment will be stronger and more entertaining than this. I'm excited for Arkham Knight to show up on the last-gen consoles, but don't hold your breath with me yet. Still it's worth checking out if if you've yet to start playing Arkham games; even if it's not ""your favorite"" one.

If you're an Arkham fan and would like to be kept ahead of developments in the series, you can join our newsletter here. I promise that we won't be able to send you updates on the game any time soon, and more importantly what you should be interested in, but don't forget to subscribe!

Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate. Continue the story:,"

""My roommate started yelling at us and then started going to sleep. I was lying asleep on the couch watching TV. I asked him, 'You need to stop!' and he just kept looking at me like, 'Huh?'""

""Eventually we had to make the decision that he needed to leave. But I didn't want him to leave. I continued watching the news and watching the news about the attacks, and just couldn't get it out of my head.""

""I felt angry and humiliated and hurt. I had lost my peace of mind. It was then that I knew it was time to reach out to the ACLU.""

""By the end of the day, I was exhausted and I just wanted to go to sleep.""

This is the kind of experience that I experienced today, and I want to give you all some inspiration. I do not want to minimize other people's lives—people can wake up tomorrow and have the same, horrifying experience—but I want to put this story in perspective. We are all affected and we cannot take it for granted. We are all at risk, and it's up to every single person to make sure they're taking measures and making arrangements to do so.

This is where I believe the good news lies for you. The ACLU gives legal support to students who are scared with the news of campus sexual assault. I want to tell you that you can speak up and file a complaint without feeling embarrassed. I want to tell you that you can still be seen as a woman who is standing up for others.

And as you're reading this, I want you to know that you matter. We are all at risk, and your actions are going to make a difference.

If you have a friend or loved one who is experiencing this type of thing or feels like they're going to be for some time, you can call the ACLU toll-free at 1(888) THE-AMERICAN (1-888-843-4673)Info for your local office. Or, you can write to them by visiting your local ACLU office's website. So many people are feeling overwhelmed and isolated, and there are even more resources out there for others who are feeling as stressed as you are.

"Dora does not know the truth. Boots, Swiper, and the Map do, and they must never let Dora know. Today, it just got much harder. Continue the story:","

A. There are some things we won't disclose to you. The truth is far more powerful than anything I can make you believe. The true fate of the world rests only in your hands.

B. I'm sure I know what to do: The Map is key. The story you hear is the one you will live out. We have a secret--an ultimate secret. No one will ever uncover this secret. I am the one who was sent to the future. I must return to the present time. We are tooiants-men of another age. Now it is time to show you the truth.

C. For the sake of the world, I cannot help you if you've been turned into a monster. The secrets of the map may be more powerful than you can imagine.

A-7. The story is almost made up. A-7, and all the other things you've read, were written in the book of Dora: a book that only a few know is there. The book contains a key that will guide you through Dora's secrets. When you open the book, the message disappears. We can now continue.


A B In the Land of Giants, all is still, but the sky is black like black ink. You can stand in only one place at a time, like a shadow. To pass through Dora's world, however, you must be one person. This will be a world of giants.

A This is exactly what we were hoping you would get out of this letter. We have some important secrets to inform you of. I have been told what Dora has been hiding, but it is not important to you at this time.

B What is important is what you learn. We've learned that there are giants in the world, and they come to this world so that they may escape from their past and become what's left of humankind. They will stop at nothing to reach this world.

A We will tell you about them first. A Giant of the World, is a very ancientATURES known as giant. These giants once ruled the world, and once were as powerful as humans are. Each one is a descendant of a previous giant, and can reach the next world. With each death, their power wanes and they become stronger and more dangerous. These giants have been destroying the world of Giants for millenia.

B After all this time, they have not killed you. You will soon find that they have grown into something far greater.

N We've learned that the true goal of the giant is to make a new world, a place where all of them can grow to great size and become the new giant. What happens next is not your business. We are not responsible for any of that. The secret will only come to you when you are ready.

A You need no help here. I will lead you through the past of Dora. Remember, the greatest secret of all lies within the hidden book of Dora, one of the lost books of the Giants.


B. When you get to the book, you will find the key to your destiny. It is locked and cannot be opened except by the person who is responsible for Dora, the one with the ultimate destiny of the entire world. There will be many secrets in the book, but you will learn some.

A No. You need not find me or anyone else. Only your destiny. You must find the key by your own self-interest. The door only opens when you choose to open it. Do not allow anyone else to decide whether you would want this book for yourself or a child or a servant.

C. Now we are getting it just right! I've already shown you that the book of Dora contains a key you are to meet. This key will allow you to find every single thing Dora has hidden away in the old days, when she had the key to every detail of her history.


A. That makes it all the more important to take the book with you when you wake up in the present time. You cannot trust any human, since you don't know what they are thinking. If you can't find the key from one human, then no other human can find it for you. It may take a month or so before we can send an owl to tell you the truth.

A That sounds like a plan. That's where the real difficulty lies. Your first step is to search everyone who has seen Dora and every single thing she has ever done. Search them for clues about what has happened to Dora over the years. That will give you the key.

B. When you awaken, I am the best person to help you. Tell me if"

You discover that Earth is the `` North Korea '' of the galaxy Continue the story:," the great expansion of Earth's atmosphere over time, stretching over all the habitable planets (and some of the more distant ones) until such a time as the Sun will become too dim to see Earth, even from the nearest terrestrial point.

As the climate warms up, the planet's temperature starts to get hotter.

The earth's surface takes on a slight yellowish tint. At this point the Sun becomes too cool to continue sustaining life on, so Earth starts cooling down even more.

At the ""end of the last Ice Age"" at 4,600 B.C., temperatures across the planet's surface started to cool a bit as the Sun's temperature plummeted.

The Earth cooled off, because the Earth's atmosphere, too, cooled off over time, to the point where the Sun could no longer keep up with the changes in environmental conditions.

At this point, the universe expanded, expanding the size of the solar system, before being squeezed back toward the center when the cosmos expanded again at a slower rate. At this point the Milky Way galaxy had expanded more than 100 billion years ago, before being squeezed back again.

At this point, the observable universe began expanding at a faster rate than normal. That means that there isn't much room for new objects to form -- there are too many stars, too many stars.

The size of the observable universe was now equal to the size of the solar system (a little less than 100 billion kilometers across), and it was shrinking!

The universe was at the very beginning of its ""Big Bang"" -- a period of cosmic (un)organization when new galaxies were born from the existing ones.

When this occurred, the universe was about 10 billion years old -- about three times as old as it is today.

It is also possible that the universe has a ""Little Big Bang"" -- a brief ""flash"" of cosmic energy from which life started.

This brief period of cosmic creation can last tens of millions of years.

But it also ends with the Big Bang.

From this point, the universe has not undergone any further growth, so there are no new elements of life -- like oxygen.

All that remains today is the Earth's core.

When the core expands, it is heated so much that it explodes - like a supernova or a ""black hole"". It was once thought that a supernova would blow the stars from the earth out into space.

But instead, the explosion of a supernova produces a huge fireball - with an almost perfectly spherical ""outer"" region around it.

The fireball then expands, leaving behind a large, thin disc of gas - known as the hot Jovian star.

This is where most of Earth's living elements like water, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide (CO2) and the other elements made by the Sun -- are made, and where all life on Earth comes from - from the ocean, forests, lakes, rivers and oceans that water flows through and then flows back into the water with water vapor.

The main problem with the Earth forming from a hot, compact, rapidly expanding, expanding universe, is that that would mean it wouldn't have enough solid metal to make all the other ""living"" planets, or to send life to the stars... that is - until such a time as the Sun runs out of metal to make it.

After that, it can be assumed that the universe can continue expanding while the Earth remains where it originally began."

In your own words:

I am a young Canadian male. I am currently 17 and I have never been in a real relationship. I'm a self proclaimed virgin. I have never held hands with a girl before. Even if I did it would still be against my religion. I am not gay. I've never even come close to kissing a girl. That is all. I am a virgin. This is a great opportunity you are giving up. I understand it is you, so I will be your victim. If you give up then I will not be given up. If you do not take my offer I will never be given up by anyone I have been with. This is your only chance. No other girl or guy will give me up and there is no way I will come with a bad attitude. I will be respectful of you and take full responsibility for what you say. I will have sex with you (vaginal or anal) only with the understanding that I will be completely clean after I have the chance to hold hands, kiss and touch. I will make it clear to you that I am a virgin. You are not going to fuck me; you cannot get my virginity and I will never give it up to another man. I'll tell you when I am ready to give it up. If you agree to my terms you must follow them. You have 5 days to complete your paperwork and my date will be set. I am also happy to help you in the future, I'll do everything I can to help you in any way that I can. I promise you if I catch you taking part in something like this again, I'll put you away for good. I can't give you any warning because you'll never know if you're ready to give up. If you decide to give it up, I can't say no because then I'd have to kill you in jail. I promise I will be your slave until you do what I say. Thank you for listening, I really appreciate it.


It has been said that the secret to maintaining virginity is making absolutely no contact with a girl or man outside of school, so maybe that is the secret behind this offer for you Canadian boys. Now do you believe in any magic, or is there really a magical spell you can ""hold"" a girl so you can use her once a week on your first date.


If you accept this offer you are committing a felony. If you fail to comply you will be arrested.


And as for the ""good"" part…. There's no denying that you would be a much better and more desirable date for a girl, if only you would just follow our instructions and accept our offer of sex and I promise everything will be wonderful. After all, you could always claim later that you'd just come out of a ""date"" and needed a little time to catch your breath and prepare for an awesome second date with her."

"Write a deep, philosophical piece about anything you choose, however all it builds up to is a reference. Continue the story:"," that's the point I'd like.

It's just a reference now, and you should read more to see how you relate to this character's journey. The characters are the key, not the background.

A reference can also create two different moods while reading.

On one hand you could be sitting there reading a piece where the writer is writing another piece. The first thing that occurs to you when you read the piece is, ""I wonder why there's a scene where you need to say 'no' and give these two things to them, but I can't believe they're not happy with getting what they wanted."" Your mind would be very much in the background, and the mood of the piece would be very affected. You could be reading an epic fantasy story where you're in a magical valley, and you're in the presence of characters you think you know, but you don't. You can see the way they think about the world, and you can feel the way they think or feel. You can feel their excitement. You're just not completely there yet.

If you read a piece where the writer isn't telling a story, maybe in a different genre or where the writer is writing about something different from your usual passion, maybe you'll feel less affected or maybe you'll feel inspired and then you'll go in and say, ""Wow, the characters are so clever, that the story is so well told, that I want to try and write like that,"" but it's always a matter of whether you're going to be inspired to try a different form.

On the other hand, I've been doing a lot of short fiction, and I've gotten very interested in the medium of short fiction. Sometimes I'll write a couple hundred words and feel like I know where I'm going, but then it'll go off the rails for me. It stops, and in my head, all they're doing is writing again. I don't get into the work anymore. I don't want to read another piece. There's something about one page that I've written, the way it moves, that's so exciting for me. Sometimes you want to put the pieces of some poems together and see how it will move the poetry. I do that a lot, but I do it as a piece of practice. I want to make stuff that feels good when I get topadding to the finish line. That's the only way."

You are a lost musician in a neon lit city. Describe your experiences and people you come across. Continue the story:,"

I came to New York on an audition tour for a band called The Spare People. I would have gone from here in Europe, but a big storm shut down Europe on the way to this place. So I had to return to Europe.

What was your worst moment of being in New York?

One thing I really didn't expect was that people would become friendly with me after I met them. They would ask me questions, and say how much they enjoyed my guitar… that's all that a normal person does, and I found an incredible support network of people willing to answer any questions. But one thing that really stuck out was the lack of communication between the people I knew and people I met. I would go to a record store to get a record like ""The Best of"" or ""The Faint"" and it would get sold out, because people here do not talk about their music anymore. I'd leave feeling bad for whoever was selling it, because it's not the usual way of doing business in New York.

I'll say this: my worst day in New York was when I was about to tour. At the airport, I had to wait to get myself checked in because some people were standing outside in the sand waiting for their buses to come by. So I just left the airport, and while I'm there, I get word from some artists and bands that they were playing the record festival here and my bus didn't get picked up. There was just like 25 people standing outside in the sand waiting for the bus in the dark and I thought, ""That's just wrong, because I'm not going to be here a few hours."" So I go back to my hotel in New York.

So you are coming down, and you're waiting in the airport for a bus to come pick you up because you can't travel?

Yes! I'm on my way back from another New York show. Somebody called and said ""There's a bus at 8:00 for you, but there is a line and no buses are leaving."" I was thinking, ""Gosh, how am I going to get on it? How am I going to get off at this time? Can I get on the next day?"" Finally I found someone who called the number and let me on. I got on the bus, and I'm on my way out. A bunch of people were going off to the gig, and everyone was waiting around, and I was the only one who would be sitting on the bus. This guy looked at me and was like, ""You know, it's going to take awhile."" But before I knew it I was driving out at 12:00. I started walking, and I was kind of like a walking stick! I was walking down Broadway and that's when a van went around a corner, and a police officer started talking to this guy who'd been walking outside at 10, and he said ""Why don't you go into the van and you can leave at once?"" And I said, well, I guess people have to be careful on the street, but I had to leave, it was my first day back in town.

If you could only speak to someone one more time, what would that be?

That's not a question I could answer. I'm really too overwhelmed. I'm going to be playing in two big tour dates in Europe this spring, and then also playing in the UK, which was one of the things that was more of a challenge for me than I could have thought. I remember I had a song called ""Bitter Dreams"" and it was going to be played in London. I did it, and people were really supportive of me. And then suddenly a few days later I'm playing it for 50 people and I walk offstage and all of a sudden it's taken over the whole arena in London that night. So when you're working with a new band, like The Spare People, you can never have enough experience. You can only get better.

You've started getting into the writing and recording process so close to the release cycle of the songs and albums. What are your most recent thoughts?

I don't know that I can give any Malta tips. You have to spend a lot of time thinking about what's happening on the road, and what's going on in your life, and how to use that. You have to be in the right place at the wrong time and think of it all as a process, and it's easier when you know the songs better than people do. I don't know how you would go about doing that, especially when someone is on tour with you. My experience is you can't, but you have to spend a lot of time thinking about things.

I started looking for solutions like this... but didn't find any... and after many, many hours of work, I am here. It's a puzzle that I have not found anywhere. I am sorry for the fact that it wasn't posted somewhere better. I spent over a year trying to find an answer. I really don't know what to do. Maybe you will find a solution? Or maybe it'll be more complicated than that. I could end up going insane.

EDIT: It looks like I got some people's help.

Thank you...

EDIT 2: In case you didn't notice, I posted it on Reddit. It got upvoted many times.

EDIT 3: I took this solution and made it a github project. I used the code from jonathan_miller (solution to the above puzzle) and posted it here in case the puzzle is solved again

EDIT: Okay, here it is. Please make sure you are following this path: The first time I posted this puzzle, someone from /r/rational had already solved it. I posted an edited version (minus the ""kill the other immortal"") on Reddit.

EDIT 4: Now, here it is, released as open source (I won't host it anywhere. Not even reddit), on github!

EDIT 5: Here it is with another version. You can find it under the link

EDIT 6: Here it is with a new version.

EDIT 7: Here is a version without the ""kill the other immortal"". Enjoy :)

EDIT 8: Here is a version with some code changes (there is not much).
ihara.

The solution is (slightly) obfuscated, which is one reason why the puzzle is a bit confusing. However, it is quite readable (though it seems that the solution wasn't very clear from the start, but if you look at it with more experience, you might be able to find the solution yourself).

To do this, we'll need to create a function to handle the creation of the game state. Here it is:

function addInventory() {

var newInventoryToAdd=undefined;

newInventoryToAdd=new Storage(1);

storage.addItem(""New Inventory"",null,newInventoryToAdd,1);

storage.addItem(""New Inventory From Inventories"",null,null,1); // If it isn't null, we cannot add to an empty slot

storage.getItemById(""New Inventory From Inventories"")[0].place()

} // end addInventory

Finally, differ from jonathan_miller's ""killer"", this function is quite simple to use (as long as your programming language isn't Java).

In addition to this function, we need to implement some logic to ensure that we always keep a copy of an inventory.

The following functions do our job:

inventory.deleteItem(id)

inventory.removeItem(id)


The game will always keep a copy of the inventory. When we first create an inventory, it will have the same value (zero). We should try to get that value again after we remove items from it (so we don't have a redundant inventory). Also, let's make sure that we know what the place of the item we have selected is.

inventory.getSelectedItem().place()

Inventory.clearSelectedItem()

Lastly, it is also necessary to check if the inventory has been cleared. If there is something in the inventory, a message box will pop up, informing us that it has been cleared. If there isn't anything in inventory, none of the information we need is shown, or a warning box appears.

function store() {

// Add a new item to the inventory

storage.setItem(""New Items"", { id:id, value:0, placeItem:newInventoryToAdd })

}

function clearSelectedItem() {

if (inventory.hasItem(null)) {

// Create a new inventory

// Create the location and position of the old inventory

// Add the new item to the inventory

storage.addItem(""New Inventory"", null,null,true,(0,0))


// Show the message box asking if the inventory's value/placeItem was cleared

// Let's add some code to keep track of"
Three people are standing in a room. Only one of them has a shadow. Continue the story:,"

It wasn't until a couple of weeks ago when I noticed some strange shadows on the screen. I didn't really want to look at it, but then what had started out a small but annoying annoyance turned into a growing sense of dread. That's when I saw it. The dark, thick sludge. I looked back at the shadows and couldn't find any. In fact, they were all gone! Now, I started to wonder if everything was wrong.

""I've seen it before?"" I asked. Then it hit me.

""Huh?"" I said, turning back to look at the computer. Sure enough, I saw the same thing.

Of course, it wasn't just me who saw it. For some reason, the other people in the room also noticed something. So one of the three people in the room took off his mask and pointed it at the screen. ""How do you know that? It's probably not any of your business."" And with that, he got down to business. ""I got this video from three different video recording angles I tried to get off of in the other rooms. I want to be sure.""

The three people sat back down on the other floor and didn't look directly at the screen, although I could tell the rest of them did. A couple weeks later, the video got uploaded to an internet dating site. I was curious. So after I had a bit more time to think, I decided to look to see if I could find another video.

In the apartment I was in, I was sittingfoundland on the floor, leaning on the wall with one leg on the other. I was feeling pretty comfortable in the space. It was nice and warm. It felt like my back was straight against the wall and that's probably what it was. I didn't feel like running when I started to turn around, as I wasn't comfortable walking around the apartment. Maybe they could use the stairs, but I wasn't ready to climb up the back stairs. I thought about it, but decided against it. Besides, I didn't want to be stuck in that space. They had the kitchen, with the sink and everything else, and what I wanted the most was freedom from whatever the apartment had became. If I wanted to do something, I wanted to do it without feeling like they were there to make me do it. So I got up, climbed the stairs, and left the apartment.

I knew what I had to do now. I had to get them to send me the video.

To help me, I did what most people would do. I contacted them through their phone line number and told them my story.

""You need to watch this. Try to stay calm, but the best you can do is take your time and listen to everything they have to say. The most important thing is to let them tell you exactly what they think and why. If they can't, there is a chance that they may just have been joking. Make sure you don't tell them anything, even if you only heard them in an overheard conversation in the kitchen or in another bedroom. I hope this Mussolini reference wasn't obvious.""

I was about to watch the tape, but I didn't. In fact, I wanted them to watch it with me. I wanted them to see how frightened and embarrassed I was by all of this.

""Now, listen to everything they want you to do. Make sure to listen and act all calm, and don't get up and walk away. Don't stand up straight like they did. When they tell you to stand up straight, be like 'no' and back away, and then they tell you to stand up straight. That's it. As long as you didn't try to escape, you should be fine. Now, be calm and pay attention to what they are saying. If you can't tell them anything, stand up straight. If they try to make you say something different, tell them what it was. If any of them make you laugh, laugh at it. If they laugh at you, laugh back at them. If they yell, yell back at them. If they say anything else, tell them what it was and ignore it. If they yell at you, yell back at them. If they say that you can't get out, tell them that is your own choice and that you have plenty of time. What if they tell you that you can stay in the rental for two or three days if you want to? Give it a try, and you should be fine to leave your apartment and go with your friends or family.

""Now, if you notice anything differently than all of the others from what I told you when you were asked to watch the tape, you need to stand up straight. Even if it's just an inch or so. Now"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Mentally ill inmates in Miami are housed on the ""forgotten floor"" Judge Steven Leifman says most are there as a result of ""avoidable felonies"" While CNN tours facility, patient shouts: ""I am the son of the president"" Leifman says the system is unjust and he's fighting for change."," Florida's top judge is getting heat over whether mentally ill inmates should be removed from the general population to help them get treatment CNN travels to a state facility where mentally ill inmates are held. They say they can't access basic necessities and are being treated like criminals. We are hearing an outcry over a sentence so harsh as to put an 85-year old, grandmother and a child mentally ill.

'They're not prisoners.'

'They're not prisoners.'""

And so it begins.

To a reporter's question regarding the ""forgotten floor,"" the Miami-Dade County Health Department spokesperson, Michelle Linares, tells us ""it looks like"" it's the ""oldest floor in the facility.""

It was first mentioned when we met with Leifman last October, with the reporter inquiring about the status of the ""forgotten floor.""

The Health Department is ""really, really committed"" to the mentally ill in general population, said Linares, although ""it's difficult for us to understand why people would live here,"" since prisoners are ""inmate, staff and public safety are all united in our fight to help them.""

As for the ""forgotten floor"" - in a word: ridiculous.

That's one thing that happens in ""Miami-Dade County Health."" All kinds of things.

Leifman's office, the Health Department's ""chief of outreach to all residents regardless of their mental health status,"" and our ""journalist friends"" are all talking about the floor. Everyone from local newspapers to CNN is calling.

Leifman has ""an enormous amount of power,"" said Leifman's spokesperson, and we feel ""incredibly fortunate to have him.""

So far, Leifman has not taken any action.

CNN reached out to the Health Department for comment and is awaiting an response. We'll update this post when we hear back.

Our reporter's encounter with the building's administrators was not the only time Leifman's staff spoke with us. Earlier this month, Leifman ""drew a blank stare from the press"" after we asked an official about the ""forgotten floor."" The same day, Leifman told local reporters a little about the department: ""We serve all residents regardless of their mental health status, and we're really, really committed to making sure they have access to that health care, even though it may not come as part of their sentence, so they have the opportunity to achieve good health.""

The Health Department's ""Chief of Outreach for all residents, regardless of their mental health status"" is in charge of all health services within the facility, a position that was created a few years ago, according to CNN's analysis, which found the health department spends less than a tenth of the federal budget on mental health care.

The Department of corrections spends more than three times that amount per prisoner, it turns out.

The State Correctional Institution's website, www.michigan.gov, says that all inmates housed in the Health Department facility on the ""forgotten floor"" are being evaluated for mental illness. But how are these mental health evaluations being made?

In all of her previous visits to the Health Department, Linares was told that it was the department's responsibility to make sure everyone is safe and free to make decisions on their own. But last month the Health Department told us that only six health professionals are designated to oversee the area.

Linares says she requested a meeting, but to no avail.

""If anything ever changes, I'd like them to let me know,"" says Linares. ""I feel like I'm here to tell them they're missing out on great healthcare if I'm not allowed to meet with them.""


Sgt. Michael Riddick at the Health Department, also tells Linares, that mental illness is not included in the Health Department's annual budget.

When we asked why the Health Department had this budget, Riddick says ""we're not a hospital,"" and goes on to say that the agency has no way of knowing how much inmates are spending on their medical treatment, or even how much they are actually getting.

He adds, ""There shouldn't be any restrictions on who is able to get treatment.""

But according to the latest numbers from the Florida Department of Health and Human Services, the state's inmate population in 2010, for this population, was just under 3,700 per day.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: NFL chief, Atlanta Falcons owner critical of Michael Vick's conduct. NFL suspends Falcons quarterback indefinitely without pay. Vick admits funding dogfighting operation but says he did not gamble. Vick due in federal court Monday; future in NFL remains uncertain."," (Photo: The (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal) Story Highlights A former NFL quarterback is sentenced to more than four years in prison for running a dogfight operation

Vick said he did not gamble or participate in dogfights, but was convicted by jury

Vick's father was a prominent Wilmington entrepreneur

NEWARK — Former Baltimore Ravens quarterback Michael Vick pleaded guilty Tuesday to running a dogfighting operation and was convicted by a jury on all counts.

The judge did not include in his punishment an automatic jail sentence, a condition the retired NFL star had demanded.

That means the only sentence Vick would receive would apply only if his public comments were not considered admissible in the judge's sentencing.

It was also not in Vick's best interests to accept the deal, although it included time served, probation and an additional $50,000 fine. He will be deported in one year.

Vick's attorney Robert FitzGerald read a statement from his client after the judge handed down the sentence. He said Vick has accepted responsibility for his crimes.

""If you knew Vick,"" FitzGerald said, ""you could say without a shadow of a doubt that he would have never participated in dog fights. The evidence established the contrary, and the result was that we lost not only Michael, I.P. and (puppy trainer) Mike, but all of our clients.""

FitzGerald, who spoke from the steps of the Delaware State Prison, apologized to Vick's daughter Amber and to family members who had suffered years ago, ""the most painful thing is knowing the pain. It is the most important thing.""

FitzGerald said he was disappointed Vick did not accept the deal but did not think the punishment would be that harsh.

Defense lawyers said Vick has done little to demonstrate remorse of the crime, including his refusal to admit responsibility.

""This is a plea of guilty,"" defense lawyer Paul Cassell told NJ Advance Media as he left the courthouse. ""It's nothing less than a plea of guilty.""

The Ravens released Vick, 51, in August after an independent, three-judge panel in Delaware determined that Vick's former employee, former dogfighting ring owner Michael Vick's ex-wife testified on his behalf at trial. The couple split in 2004 and he moved out of his house in the city of Wilmington.

Vick testified he paid Vick $3,000 to own what is now known as the ""Oasis of Pain,"" a dogfighting operation in Smyrna, Delaware. In 1999, Vick's then-wife, Vicki, testified she paid $5,000 to control dogs in a local dogfighting ring.

According to a report in the Wilmington Star-News, in 2007 Vick's former partner testified that Vick received $2,000 if Vick was going to be the owner of a dog and would get $500 for him if Vick was going to be the trainer. The judge sentenced Vick to four years in federal prison on Wednesday for running an illegal dogfighting ring.

Prosecutors agreed to drop most counts when Vick agreed to pay an additional $50,000 in restitution. They said Vick violated the terms of his probation when he lied to a federal law enforcement official and testified on his behalf in federal court.

The new agreement will not be formally filed until it receives the full approval of the judge.

""This matter should be resolved without prejudice, which means it can't be resurrected when it's past,"" prosecutors have said in court records.

Vick was released from federal prison in August after more than four years of hard time and is now working for a private insurance brokerage.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Tomas Medina Caracas was a fugitive from a U.S. drug trafficking indictment. ""El Negro Acacio"" allegedly helped manage extensive cocaine network. U.S. Justice Department indicted him in 2002. Colombian military: He was killed in an attack on a guerrilla encampment."," Other information: The death was ruled a homicide by Colombia's armed forces.

""El Negro Acacio"" was a Colombian fugitive accused of operating an extensive cocaine network. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is trying to extradite him to the U.S. to face charges of supplying cocaine to drug kingpins around the world, but he would not be a priority unless the U.S. government obtained evidence to prove his involvement in organized crime. ""El Negro Acacio"" operated a complex supplydirty drugs distribution network, with as much as $100 million in assets, said U.S. officials in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. The group's operations were facilitated by close contact -- some said ""co-instructors"" -- with drug cartels in Colombia and South America, the officials said. Officials in Colombia and neighboring Ecuador said the group was well-connected in the cities where it operated.

""El Negro Acacio"" was arrested in 2002. Authorities believe he was close to several high-level cartel figures, including his brother, who also faces charges in the U.S. He allegedly had a secret home near Cartagena and was often accompanied by armed bodyguards on his trips. U.S. officials said they believe members of El Negro Acacio's network supplied some cocaine to Cartagena-based leaders of the Medellin Cartel. The Medellin Cartel has been among the most active drug traffickers in Colombia, supplying thousands of tons of drugs in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, according to United Nations reports and government documents.

""El Negro Acacio"" was born Jose Luis Rivera Medina in El Salvador, then lived in Miami and died in a hotel, the officials said. U.S. officials said he came to the United States in 1995 and began working with other smugglers to smuggle drugs from South to North America. DEA intelligence indicates that he helped to run the network's logistics and distribution network, with as much as $100 million in assets. He allegedly helped run a large cocaine ring, which was allegedly responsible for delivering tons of cocaine to several U.S. cities. Colombian military investigators said Rivera is among the cartel's few known ""direct"" commanders in South America and their most powerful drug handler. Drug trafficking investigators also said he facilitated connections between the Colombian military and drug leaders. He also served as a commander for Pablo Escobar II, the late Pablo Escobar's brother. In addition to the U.S. charges, Rivera is also charged in at least three other U.S. drug indictments, including cases from Guatemala and Venezuela, Colombian officials said. U.S. investigators believe that cartel leaders in Colombia will pay him a large monthly salary, officials said. Colombian authorities declined to disclose what kind of salary Rivera is receiving. ""It is a significant salary,"" U.S. officials said. However, U.S. officials said he would not be a priority in the extradition process unless he can be linked with specific drug crimes. Rivera has extensive experience running the drug industry, officials said. Rivera ran his own transportation company, ""Hacienda Roca,"" and ""Alta Colombia,"" that exported drugs from Ecuador, Peru and Colombia, with a distribution network that connected some 50 Colombian cities.

""El Negro Acacio"" and a co-conspirator, Jorge Gonzalez Ramirez (pictured), ""El Negro"" is accused in U.S. court of trafficking cocaine into the U.S. and is accused in U.S. court of heroin distribution. He and Juan Ignacio Alvarez Rocha Moreno (also pictured) are accused of heroin smuggling into the U.S. in a separate indictment in U.S. court. ""El Negro Acacio"" is also accused of being a drug trafficker in Guatemala. The pair are also accused of dealing cocaine into Mexico. U.S. authorities have no direct connection between the drug trafficking case, alleged drug kingpins and cartel leaders that may be on opposite sides of the cartels' political rivalry and that might be seeking to make money in the U.S. Drug traffickers have long been accused of operating as fronts for criminal organizations and criminal activities. Authorities in Colombia have been accused of using their connection with drugs to raise money and influence.

One of the main reasons for the continued drug smuggling in the United States is the ease with which criminal enterprises can obtain guns and ammunition, officials said. ""We are dealing with trafficking across borders and borders of porousness, and there are pockets where it's very difficult,"" U.S. law enforcement officials said. ""I would say that even if [El Negro Acacio] were found to"

I have to confess that when I first heard the news of Sandy Gray's untimely death, I was not convinced, but here we are. For anyone who has not seen the video of Mayor Gray's speech in which he states, ""It's time,"" don't spend too much time on this one. The rest of this report will be about the death, so read on.

The body itself contains a clear indication of the type of cancer Gray was suffering from. When Gray was first diagnosed in late 2003, he was only a few months shy of his 36th birthday. Now, Gray is 37 and will turn 40 on August 28.

His funeral, however, is another matter altogether. He has made two plans for it. One is to be buried on Thursday, August 15, an official ""interment"" at Arlington National Cemetery. This will be the funeral planned by the Church of St. John the Evangelist of Pilsen, the Church of the Redeemer of the Dead in El Cajon, disgracefully named after the leader of Mexican revolutionaries. The other has to do with an August 21 show before a handful of high school classmates in California, just a few miles from the gravesite of Elvis Presley, during which two of Gray's fellow musicians, Joe Daniels and John Bragg, have promised to perform for Gray; both former members of the rock band, The Riveters.

In a press conference that same day, two other musicians, Bob Seger and Paul Simonon, were present. They had previously performed for Gray. They did note that Gray had talked of taking a break to go into seclusion, and that he did not seem all that serious when he was described by several journalists at the time. What was not reported was that Gray seemed to be having fun.

A few weeks before Gray was diagnosed with lymphoma, Gray appeared on the show A Shot in the Dark on ABC in California, where he was seen singing and talking about his childhood, while playing guitar and making music with his friends and bandmates; it was one of the few live shows in recent memory which went better than a movie had. One critic described it as ""one of those great musical oddities that people remember but seldom really talk about.""

It is a shame to waste much of the public's attention in so insignificant a matter, but Gray's wishes were honored.

I was told by two men who had known Gray for years that he was doing well from the cancer therapy he received, and that when Gray stopped getting treatment, his pain went away, with good results. After he had finished, they said, he went to his favorite spot in Pilsen, a tiny, well-kept room at the corner of Broadway and North Sixth Avenues that has become a kind of memorial to the music and life he had, from time to time (sometimes for weeks) played, including The Riveter in its heyday.

For years the room was used as an impromptu stage for the band's gigs; the stage was put up by Gray's band, not the church or any other body, according to the men who had known the man and known his artistry. Today, the room has its own door marked ""Gray Room,"" and even a marker is attached to the door. The church has given the space away to a musician who had a talent for singing and playing the guitar, and the artist who used the room for shows that he was not able to do in the church.

Gray is from Long Beach, California, but he had grown up in Santa Clarita, where he taught elementary school in a church where the teachers had been very generous with his tuition. He used to spend nights in his mother's basement when he was in school and then take bus rides to show up late and have a beer with friends on the bus. This was a form of entertainment in those days: he could play a violin or a banjo, or any instrument, while other kids talked for hours and he could be the only one there. He had already written his own song by the age of 15, called ""The Last Song You Ever Loved,"" which is now being covered in a country band called the Bakersfield Boys by John Mellencamp. By the time Gray became a teen, his love of radio-controlled cars was quite strong. He was so serious about his use of them that his mother, Joan Gray, was worried about her son having been too much involved with them.

It was a life that Gray lived, in the way that a child is supposed to live in a place where his parent or grandparents live. This has not been a very kind life for him. For most of his"

13 Common Ways You Are Probably Afraid to Write a News Article"
Write a news article based on the following summary: President Bush to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Wednesday. Bush to say that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists. Speech will be latest White House attempt to try to reframe the debate over Iraq.,"

On Saturday, White House spokesman Scott McClellan repeated that Bush would address the veterans' group if it came asking for a meeting. But, McClellan said, ""Our job is to bring together people from a variety of backgrounds, give them a sense of what this administration stands for and what our approach is.""

The Associated Press on Friday reported that members of the veterans' group wanted to meet with Bush. The group did not give a reason why, the AP quoted members as saying.

In a statement issued late Friday, the White House called the veterans' request ""a welcome change from the administration's tone regarding the debate over the war in Iraq.""

At the time, the U.S. military had withdrawn its troops from Vietnam and it appeared that it was time to move on to ""the peacekeeping missions that were essential in achieving the historic objective of ending that conflict,"" said the statement from the Defense Department.

The administration of former President Jimmy Carter had also planned to spend Friday outside Washington, but in recent weeks it has been unable to come to an agreement with Congress on how much funding it will need to continue its military presence in Afghanistan, the AP reported.

According to the National Vietnam Veterans Association, of 1.4 million veterans in the United States, the number of men who served in Vietnam in the Vietnam War is now estimated at 784,000, of whom nearly 80 percent died or were wounded. It said on Friday that the number of veterans who died since the Vietnam War ended in 1973 is now estimated at 6,950, and more than 8,000 continue to suffer from serious complications due to exposure to Agent Orange.

Although few in the White House said Friday that Obama would attend the veterans' event, in recent days administration officials, including National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, have attempted to assure the general public that the president is supportive of a policy that seeks to end the war in Iraq, and he has said that the U.S. needs to continue its current military presence in that region of the world, the AP reported.

""This is the most important national security event in the United States since the World War II,"" Rice was quoted as saying. Other senior officials and experts said Friday that Obama's approach would probably include remarks on Afghanistan, as well.

On Thursday, Obama said that he did not wish to withdraw troops ""withdrawal"" from the Middle East. But he said that he was concerned about continuing the war in Afghanistan, which had gone from a brief war in 2001 to the longest military operation in the region in 2008.

""I do think mobilization of the international community to put pressure on al Qaeda and related groups to end their efforts, their violence is important, that's why I decided I wanted to make sure that we didn't do that by withdrawing our military,"" Obama told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

While the White House is seeking to draw a distinction between the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan, senior officials have acknowledged that they may not get to that point until President Bush leaves office.

The president was scheduled to be in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, but had said that he would not attend the event, the AP wrote, and he would not be traveling to Texas, Ohio and Kentucky. The president had originally planned to deliver a speech to the National Governors Association meeting while in Austin.

""It's a tough business, and even the president needs some rest, but I know you can get through that pretty fast,"" said a participant in Friday's meeting at the White House.

It's probably going to blow the door off of Germany, where a number of top internationals have turned down inherent riches for the opportunity to become the next big star in Europe. The trend is expected to continue until 2016 with an estimated seven potential stars of the future, according to a study published last year by The Economist. All the top three countries, Germany, England and France, also have an estimated two new top-level stars a year, according to the study.

The big draw in England is the English Football Association, which represents 20% of national income and makes a massive, direct contribution to the country's revenue thanks to ticket proceeds generated through the Premier League and the rights for the England national football team.

The German FA could never afford to lose the rights to an individual star player. Only a minority of top-level stars move to the big leagues, and those that do often struggle financially and in terms of form. The Ana Kourtis-led Brazilian national team is a perfect example of why. The midfielder has become the most expensive German star in recent history, with Bayern Munich putting a massive $25 million on the table for his international switch last year before he moved to Inter Milan for a reported €65 million.

At the top end of the European game, the big names move to Europe with their teams, leaving the lesser-known players, including the likes of Yacouba Sylla in France and Bruno Martins Indi in Italy, at a serious disadvantage. Despite these drawbacks, Germany still has more homegrown stars than any other country in the world.

A lot of those players are still at a very young age and the Bundesliga is the only big European league where young players are allowed to sign their first professional contracts. There are only two restrictions on signings: one that doesn't allow clubs to sign players below the age of 16, and another that forces young players to sit out for a certain number of pre-set games to avoid disciplinary action.

The Bundesliga still has the most high-profile players on European transfer windows thanks to the World Cup of 2010 and 2011. But it needs to do more to encourage clubs to sign more homegrown players, who can provide the Bundesliga with a significant boost on both their league and their national team. The country's federation says that only four to five of its 18-and-under teams have registered a player from outside Germany in either of the last two World Cups. That should go up to 25 to 30 teams by the time qualification rolls around in 2016.

At the end of last year, the German Football League approved financial support from football's global governing body, FIFA, for football academies around the world that take their young players from within Fulham's academy. The first academy in the world to receive such a backing was the Spanish academy system.

Fulham's academy has developed two players in the last year to go to FIFA's U-17 World Cup in Jamaica in 2013. Their first-ever U-20s player came through the academy and is still with his local club, Espanyol. The academy produced both a U.S. youth national team player and an England Under-19 national team player, but the club has not had the same success with its first-ever professional players from the academy.

Fulham are likely to take the next big step forward next season, in part thanks to the success achieved in developing their homegrown stars, and in part due to the recent U.K. government's decision to increase the number of clubs allowed to own and operate youth teams by 20% each. These plans will likely attract even more clubs, not only from England but also from France, the United States and Japan.

The German Bundesliga's biggest clubs aren't getting along quite as smoothly as their rivals might think. BVB and Hannover don't seem to be able to work together any more, while the rest of the giants are stuck in riffs or feuds with their local rivals.

A recent example came when BVB were denied access to the German World Cup squad because of conflict over the club's local rivals, Wolfsburg. The clubs had also agreed in 2010 on the establishment of a joint youth development plan covering the two countries.

Wolfsburg coach Roger Schmidt had worked closely with the BVB coach, Franz Beckenbauer, during his first spell at the club. Beckenbauer helped put together Beckenbauer's last coaching post in Germany to help the Bavarian national team reach the European Championship semi-finals in 1996. Schmidt was put in charge when the club were relegated from the Bundesliga in 1997, but resigned a few months earlier because of concerns about Wolfsburg's financial"

President Bush To Have Colosupium Scanned


WASHINGTON -- President Bush is scheduled to undergo a routine colonoscopy today that will transfer his powers from his vice president to his doctor, according to government officials.


The medical procedure - in which the president's bowel movement will be surgically separated from that of his vice president - is also expected to resolve a dispute between the president and his advisers about his health.


The procedure is part of a series of operations that will remove Mr Conduct, a White House physician who has long defended Mr Bush against charges that he has had health problems.


The colonoscopy will occur at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Beverly Hills. It was ordered this week after a physician there noted that the president was suffering from a high fever that would require a fast-moving ambulance.


Mr Conduct told The New York Times that he never discussed the issue with the president before the appointment, nor did the White House counsel decide to invite him to take the exam.


""Mr Bush never mentioned this to me in any way - either to me in person or otherwise,"" Mr Conduct said. ""And that's why I think it was the right thing to do."" Mr Conduct said that he has never been aware that anyone outside the White House had sought his permission to examine the president. Mr conduct said he was never informed that Mr Bush would undergo the procedure.


Mr Bush has had three previous colonoscopies, performed by a team at the Mayo Clinic. The president's last was in September 2003, which found no problems.


A spokeswoman for Mr Bush declined to comment on his health and the circumstances surrounding the colonoscopy. ""Our president does not discuss health status and is not currently scheduled to attend any part of the annual physical,"" said Jacqueline Keating Haddow.


When President Bush was first elected president, he said he could not wait to be re-elected. Mr Bush is likely to turn to the medical specialists who are advising him. Such specialists tend to be more conservative political appointees, in line with the way the health care system functions in the United States.


Most presidential administrations have the vice president, who is responsible for the personal, clerical or other chores of the president. In the case of Mr Bush, there are about 50 vice presidents, although several were confirmed by the Senate. Mr Bush normally has a series of private health examinations with surgeons before he travels abroad, which is why he has been seen in Europe, Australia and New Zealand in recent months.


The new procedure does not involve removing any part of the president's bowel, said Dr Michael K. DeLuca, chairman of the department of surgery at the UCLA Medical Center who will operate on the president.


Mr Bush and he doctor, David Brown, had a conversation in private during lunch about whether there had been a recent episode of diarrhea and whether the president should have a colostomy bag or colostomy bag and what it would cost, Dr DeLuca said.


After the lunch, Mr Bush left Mr Brown's office for the time being. As the president and his doctor talked on their walk, the doctor brought to their attention that the president had a fever. The president responded, ""I didn't say, 'I have a fever.'""


At the White House, the president and his doctor had a more substantive discussion about the subject of colonoscopy. ""He was open to it,"" Mr DeLuca said. ""It wasn't a big deal for him anyway.""


It is also not clear what kind of bowel condition might be in effect. Mr Bush's doctor, Dr David Brown, said Mr Bush grossed out for several hours as a result of the stool-forming colonoscopy that he underwent in"
Write a news article based on the following summary: President Bush says he and first lady are deeply saddened by the tragedy. Mine Safety and Health Administration chief: We've run out of options. The six men have been trapped underground since August 6. Seven bore holes drilled into the mountain have found no signs of life.," One hole has been cut in the ice, but no one has been inside the hole since the accident. This has caused a massive loss of ice, snow, and sea ice. Some ice has turned to water. And ice is only partially frozen. The rescues are being done by climbers using a technique that has become very popular lately. On July 6th, the climbers climbed the ice to the top and carried the water with them. It was nearly too late. We can only keep working until the water drains and the ice solidifies. You can only carry a fraction of the volume of water needed for them. In some places, they had to take the ice down with them, even though it was too dangerous to do so. When the water freezes, the rocks and the ice are pulled down on top from below by the force of the water. It is a slow process, but one that the rescuers are using to their advantage. We may find ourselves working for a long time. The rescue workers face many challenges. They must rescue climbers who are afraid to face the cold. They must find a way to open these huge ice blocks to the surface to carry out the water. Some of the climbers are injured and will likely need to be airlifted to the hospital. They cannot be saved if they do not bring themselves into the ice. This is very sad to see. The ice has to be cleared from the mountain, and it is too dangerous to do so through the climbing. This is the worst possible place for them to be trapped. At the moment, most of the climbers do not want to go back into the mountain, and some do not want to get out until things have stabilized. The most popular option is to stay until it solidifies and then cross over to safety. It is the only one left where the mountain is not on fire. It takes two to three days in order to get there using all the ice. You can hardly imagine the danger faced by the climbers. They were all strong enough to withstand it. Yet we must try to save as many as we can. I cannot do it on my own. There are too many other peopletermination teams and volunteers. I have called on your help in vain. Help us stop this catastrophe. Help us find a solution. And most of all, help us save these brave men. Our hearts are in pain. We are all praying and asking for your love and respect. By President Bush Becoming aware of the tragedy and the plight of the men was a difficult, but necessary reminder to President Bush that his administration is dealing with the worst natural disaster in American history. It is one that could have just as easily killed the President. And the circumstances of a rescue operation can be tragic even when the rescuers do not realize it: In this instance, the rescuers knew very quickly what had to be done to rescue the men. They already knew what they had to do. However, they could not believe they had to try to do it from below, as if in a movie. They believed that the men were trapped by the massive volume of water that had poured down from above. They believed that if they got through that, they would be in good shape. On July 7th the President spoke at the White House, calling the operation ""a job worthy of our great men and women in uniform."" It was a hard blow to the nation's confidence in the safety of the armed forces, where the men are the most trusted and trusted partners of the President. The President was criticized for not doing more. However, he had given the National Guard's chief of staff the authority to make these decisions—as he often did. The most important part of the President's address was to explain why this rescue operation was necessary. President Bush stated that: President Bush's Administration will work with both the National Guard and the Rescue Workers' Administration to develop a plan for the rescue effort over the next three days...to prevent the situation from becoming more dangerous. President Bush announced that he has ordered the Air Force and the Coast Guard to increase search and rescue personnel and equipment in the affected areas.... The President stressed that efforts to rescue the men are not going to be rushed or to take place without all the necessary information, land, weather, and the needs of the rescue operations before they began, and to protect the safety of the men and preserve the mountain. The rescue operation will be carried out in five parts, from the north to the south, starting at the highest point from Base Camp 2 and working west and south. The first part of the operation begins at about 10 P.M. (Eastern Standard time) today. Since the operation begins at 0800 to 1100 this evening, the men's families will"

Write a news article based on the following summary: Savers at leading UK mortgage bank lined up to empty their accounts. Northern Rock was bailed out by the Bank of England a day earlier. Reassurances that banks was safe have gone unheeded by many.,"

Analysis

An article on BBC News claims a bank chief has been fired as it emerges the chief executive of Northern Rock has been charged with eight financial offences. According to a document Buck, who was appointed chief executive by Lloyds Bank last year, was under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. When questioned by the BBC, Buck stated he had ""done nothing wrong"".

The BBC alleges the bank gave information to the FSA, which led to his dismissal and the introduction of a special measure which required Lloyds Bank workers and others to apply for an individual account with the bank. The Financial Conduct Authority took over investigations of the matter in June 2014 and made a file public in June 2015 (which later was reviewed by the FSA). Its details include allegations of misconduct by the CEO and two board members (Gwynnie Evans and David Craggs) at the bank. However the article implies the Chief Executive was ousted over a single case - a matter already investigated by the FSA and by the Financial Conduct Authority. To put it simply the BBC is reporting that, in a single week in June 2014, Buck was investigated by the FSA, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), a regulator in the UK and the FCA.

So there is nothing illegal happening at a bank. The BBC is saying the charges were ""investigated"". The SFO is investigating other senior bankers at the bank and will,brings up other cases of misconduct.

The BBC's article fails to mention the fact that, as the BBC writes; the investigations by the SFO do not require that the staff be accused of any wrongdoing on their own behalf, instead the cases were to be referred to a ""professional standards unit"". This is important to mention. If allegations of wrongdoing are not investigated they have no Americas on their record and as you can see, that has its downside. If they are investigated and found to have done nothing wrong, then the staff who went through all that stress would have nothing to show for their hard work. If they are found guilty of abusing their position they would become the butt of many a joke on social media.

The piece also states; the SFO says the investigation related to ""misconduct or other breaches of the law and involved allegations of misconduct"", but there have already been ""multiple appeals by Mr Buck since being placed under investigation"". The article makes no mention of that. The BBC article says: ""The charges against Mr Buck, a former executive at Lloyds Bank, were detailed in a document from the Serious Fraud Office that was obtained by the BBC..."" So, according to the BBC, while the SFO is not investigating, they are not ruling it out.

One man to be removed from Lloyds Bank?

Why now?

What are the issues?

Bank of England governor Mark Carney says central bank will do more to tackle banks over the financial crisis. Some have asked why this is now occurring: what was the banking crisis? What has happened to the market? Has the crisis happened too early or not enough?

But are the issues really that different?

Where has there lately been greater concern around a banks ability to raise capital?

Where have there been greater concern over staff fraud allegations?

Bank of England governor socio Carney to head for US in 2016. Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, to take up a new job in the US, according to reports. Carney has been reported to be under consideration to head the Federal Reserve when Janet Yellen steps down. The governor will be an independent director, but the Bank of England is responsible for appointing people to the chairmanship. Carney, 62, has long been an advocate for increased interest rates, believing they have helped spur the economy. However last month Carney told MPs that some central banks were losing touch with their central message because they had become 'too dependent on the economy and too fearful of it'.

Where did this article come from?

On Wednesday, a BBC article said that a bank chief was being fired over misconduct. This was based on a file from the Serious Fraud Office concerning bank boss Robert Buck. The Financial Conduct Authority received the complaint from Lloyds Bank. The article said the FSA told the bank to appeal against an ""immediate suspension"" of Buck's pay while investigation was being carried out. When the BBC asked"

Facility's role is to break down decommissioned equipment. Lawyer: Oakley's job was to break machine parts into pieces, pitch them.","

A man is accused of trying to bring a nuclear filter to a foreign agent. Oakley appeared in court this week, after surrendering. Oakley worked at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, in charge of shipping decommissioned equipment out of the site. He was accused in a US court of selling the parts to China.

Article Continued Below

He is also charged with a third-degree federal felony in Tennessee for transporting a nuclear bomb to a person outside of the United States. In a court appearance Thursday, Oakley was charged with four counts: attempting to ship a nuclear weapon to a foreign country, possession of a destructive device or explosive material, possession of a small destructive device and attempting to import a weapon of mass destruction. His trial could take place as soon as late November. While Oakley tried to sell parts to Iran last year, he told the US state department that the part sold to China had been ordered. It was returned after Oakley was caught. He had been indicted earlier this week, and is expected to be arraigned Nov. 28. ""Those parts have been destroyed,"" the US attorney's office in Nashville said in court. It was unclear how Oakley had gotten the filter. According to an indictment, between the time he arrived in South Carolina in 2009, and in January, he was in contact with Iranian officials. In 2010, he had agreed to ship the ""material"" — which included ""high voltage"" cables — to Iran.

Oakley was also in ""an ongoing conspiracy to bring a weapon of mass destruction into the United States,"" according to the federal criminal complaint. He had planned to deliver parts for the new centrifuges at the Savannah River and Savannah River facilities to a person outside of the United States, the indictment said. Oakley's defense attorney, Bruce Braley, declined to comment. The US Attorney's office declined comment on the charges. While the charges against Oakley include attempts to bring a nuclear weapon into a foreign country, their exact wording is unclear. ""Defendants have agreed to plead guilty to the allegations that they illegally traveled to Iran, allegedly sold parts to an Iranian and attempted to import the materials for an Iranian bomb,"" a federal statement said. The Department of Justice did not respond to a question about whether it will seek to charge other alleged accomplices, but it previously has said that the investigation was ongoing and an indictment is pending. Oakley is one of nine individuals indicted in connection with a $1-billion-a-year deal with Iran to buy centrifuges. The Justice Department has called the deal a ""defeat for us,"" and has demanded a complete accounting of how the deal was executed."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Organ shortage in rich states has created a trade from poorer countries. ""Transplant tourists"" travel to poor countries to buy organs from the desperate. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is legal, is turning into a ""kidney bazaar"" Patients pay $8,500 for a new kidney, while donors are paid just $300 to $1,000."," The organ market is thriving, even amid high unemployment - up 16.5% in Pakistan.

""It was an overwhelming experience,"" says Dr. Muhammad Khan, a kidney transplant specialist in Islamabad, who took part in six operations while operating on the most recent batch of four patients. ""People come with lots of money, and a lot of hope."" Dr. Khan says there are now enough patients in Pakistan to satisfy the demand for kidney transplants for two to three years. ""The need is rising every day,"" he says.

While most people in Pakistan view trade through the limited lens of Western media coverage, few are in the know about the world of international organ trade. The largest single organ market, according to U.N. estimates, is Nepal, where trade in kidneys and other tissue is estimated at $100 billion. And the United States alone estimates that the human body provides about $100 billion worth of medicine annually—more than double the gross domestic product of Pakistan.

Most people in the region have never heard of the transplant industry: The average recipient is just 23 years old, and only 15% had ever been in a hospital. The vast majority of international organ transplants, according to U.N. estimates, occur in places where the laws permitting organ trade are strict. (The laws are typically made possible by the growing use of international treaties that allow countries to ban organs to those who are believed to be on the most-wanted lists, even if it means closing their borders.)

Uruguay says it now has 3,000 kidney transplants a year and is trying to set up a national system of organ transplant centers, but its progress has been painfully slow. With one center in Brazil and another near Los Angeles, the program has yet to begin operating, but the Uruguayan government says it expects to receive about $10 million in annual donations from private and public donors by next year.

There aren't enough donors to fill all of the needs of the country's 10,000 transplant patients, so many people with kidney failure will often live on dialysis for up to four months to keep the disease from destroying their kidneys. Because of the shortage of donors, there are also less hospitals that specialize in transplantation. In 2013, the average number of transplant hospitals in the Americas was 458, the U.N. reported. The number of international organ transplant centers in the Americas—including those in Costa Rica, Costa Rica, and Mexico—dropped from 1,534 in 2008 to 826 in 2013.

The U.N. estimates that Pakistan's annual budget for kidney and other tissue donations is $16.3 million. U.S. and Pakistani officials argue that Pakistan's international aid, its ability to persuade countries to limit trade in human organs, and its growing economy should offset any costs that result from increasing demand from wealthy nations. But according to a recent UN report, a decade of steady decline has resulted in an annual increase in global debt of $1.3 billion.

Some Pakistanis say that the trade has benefited the country's poorest population—the majority of the region's kidney recipients are women and children—but they also say that the profit of transplant tourism has run out even before their kids reach puberty and most adults don't have enough money to pay for drugs at local clinics.

""How will we pay for all this?"" ask many poor people interviewed by National Public Radio. ""It's not the people who get it, but society, because they do.""

Uruguay, one of the many nations with relatively limited trade in organs, is exploring a new system: In 2015, Uruguay's Department of Health started selling human organs via a nonprofit medical organization and from other countries, including the United States."

The article must cite sources who say the following:

-- Blackwater had been under investigation for years by the Justice Department, under President Bush.

-- In an internal email obtained by ABC News, three top Blackwater officials were urged to ""reassess"" their security policies at the time they were considering paying Blackwater to provide security for foreign affairs meetings. At the time, the two top Blackwater officials wanted to use the company's Blackwater security firm, with an annual security budget of $800,000, instead of their own personal security company, known as Academi, with a slightly lower annual cost of $750,000. Academi, which had an $80 million contract to provide security at the 2004 Republican party's national convention, ended up with contracts with the CIA and State Department.

-- Blackwater officials told ABC News they were ""thrilled"" that the administration approved their request and continued to do business with the United States government.

-- In late 2012, White House press secretary Jay Carney said it was ""time for Blackwater"" to ""step back from doing work for the U.S. government."" Carney's comments came after a former Blackwater contractor, Erik Prince, was arrested in Prince's secret Panama City, Fla., home. Prince left Blackwater in May 2013.

-- The government investigation led by the inspector general's office at the Department of Defense ""was looking into some areas where we are not satisfied with the response and some areas where we are satisfied with the response,"" Carney said.

-- The Senate Committee on Homeland Security released a report on Oct. 5 that said Blackwater performed ""serious business violations under the law."" That report said Blackwater ""offered fraudulent work experience to its employees"" and did not report ""employee deaths."" The company also fired or otherwise failed to keep all of its security guards properly trained and qualified and did not supervise them, the Senate report said.

""All three of these investigations were carried out by Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation investigators,"" said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, at the press briefing, explaining why ""The New York Times took the position that no more than two employees were killed at (the) compound and then they claimed, that was not true, there were more than two.""

When asked if Obama had asked for evidence about Blackwater's practices, Coburn said he ""could only speculate."" He said, ""It is certainly true that the president did ask for some of the same information, and at the very least, a lot of these questions, particularly in the context of the (Iraq) invasion were asked."""

Founded by Marine Le Pen in 1995 with the merger of the Party of Europe (PES), a French member of the European Parliament, and the National Front (FN) (NF), in 1999, the FN is a conservative and eurosceptic political party based on the political and economic ideas proposed by Le Pen, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, and her husband Mathias Cluzel.

The FN holds a minority position in the National Assembly, although it controls half the seats, and has almost 40 MEPs and parliamentary deputies. It has been accused by other parties for violating European law and of having received funds from foreign powers.

In September 2008, the main opposition to the party in the National Assembly, the Liberals (UMP), had filed a complaint against the FN. While the National Assembly approved motions in favour of giving it a seat, the Parliament of the General Government condemned the motion as ""a blatant violation of the Constitution"". On February 25, 2009, the ruling ""Union of Democratic Forces"" passed a motion, ""To expel the National Front for racism, xenophobia, antisemitism, or homophobia"". The decision was taken at a time when the National Front was polling at less than 20%.

The National Front is a member of the European Parliament and in 2012, it was able to make a major breakthrough in France's presidential run-off election when a first round of polls, which gave Sarkozy the presidency, showed the National Front as a loser. The party campaigned hard in the election on anti-immigration platform, and received 10% of the vote. The second round polls will decide who will be elected next year.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Several famous songs written by men for a woman. Beethoven's ""Für Elise"" may have been written ""for Therese"" Songwriters make up stories about who is behind ""867-5309/Jenny"""," by using words from the lyrics, and are known for inventing and then spreading ""the story"" of the ""867-5309/Jenny"" song. In the early 18th century, a young German poet called Johann Sebastian Bach wrote a story about an old man who was a womanizer and took up residence in the attic of a house. Her servant told him of a pair of horses outside that looked just like a man named ""Ikkei Jansen"" (Ike and Jenny). He was certain that they were ""Jenny"" and thus they were his ""Jenny."" This idea of a jenny is a common theme in stories about sex, and a jane has a certain look, feel, and personality (e.g., the maid in ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is a jane (as are the chimneys in ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"").

In the 20th century, the phenomenon had a few variations in different forms. Most popular was the sexualized jane for a lady. In this case, the jane portrayed the hero as being in desperate士. One of the most famous versions, though, was based on the works of a French poet. In it, Louis Bonacieux, one of the most famous artists of the late 18th century, created a jane for a man, named J-I-S-E and a girl, named J-Ie-S-E. The story was ""Jenny"" was the name of a girl who lived in the attic of a house. Once the jane had found out who was the man, he went around telling people to take the jane to the next best house. One day, he called out ""Ike and Jenny, open the attic door!"" They ran in, opened the door, and found themselves in a hot tub! It was so cute they wanted to leave, but the jane put a ring on his finger, telling him that he should never forget her. The jane was never heard from again. This may MDMAJ, but it may also be based on a jane of an older period (e.g., the ""chimneys"" in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland ) or a new one (e.g., ""Ike and Jenny"" was made for a boy, ""Ike and Jenny"" for a girl) There was also a popular story where a jane was hired by a guy named ""Ike"" who liked to take off his jeans a lot for his wife, so the jane was given a rubber ducky to ride and would have a little fun. But after a few times the jane was jealous and threatened to kill the ducky, which would then explode. There may also be a jane that is sexually attracted to the husband, but will lie about it. Janes can also be sex partners themselves.

There have been many other janes, including the ones based on the myth of the witch or of a young girl being turned into a witch. In French, the name of the jane, sometimes known as a jane de dix, is a corruption of ""J-Ie-S-E."" Many myths are based on janes, making it unclear if the term actually means anything like the name of the person being jane'd or whether they are not called janes.

Another popular jane was the jane-a-mole, a cute little female-named monster which had all of the characteristics of a female jane except for the fact that she was a mole.

Pregnancy janes are quite common. Sometimes, they are female or the jane-a-mole may be a male. The jane may be a girl (known as a selvage) or a boy.

Riding janes (sometimes called janes brennektes) are like riding mules; they are often female.

Janes go missing sometimes. If a person can't find a jane soon enough, they may turn to witch hunts or even murder.

People have invented, Prompted by a Thought (PGTM) jane (or jane-a-mole), a type of jane that appears to be in good health when it's not. The subject might think the jane is healthy while really it hasn't had a meal since the last.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Amount almost double what was spent in 2004 election cycle. Lower TV production costs help more candidates advertise. Mitt Romney leads presidential candidates in TV spending. Advertisers face challenge of cutting through clutter of ads, analyst says.","

How did we get to this point?

It's easy enough to attribute some of this spending spree to Mitt Romney's campaign strategy: He was a clear and present threat to Barack Obama in 2004 because of his strong showing in the early voting states. But the evidence suggests the candidate himself wasn't particularly strong on TV advertising until around the same time.

After this year's elections, we are going to look at what we can learn about how ad spending actually affects a campaign.

By examining what ads run in what states and the ways television companies manage them, we can more properly judge the relative impact and spending on each candidate. But we can also see how TV ad purchases are made and what the implications are for the candidates themselves as the campaign enters the final weeks.

What's more, we can help guide election officials about what ads they make available for broadcast and in early voting. In the latter, media companies are prohibited from running negative ads that aren't ""fair and balanced.""

Here's how TV spending has grown

As of Jan. 1, 2013, TV ad spending had more than doubled per candidate since 2004. The total is greater than $50 billion per cycle—nearly twice as much as in 2008. Ad spending is expected to increase next year.

All three of Obama's challengers--Democrat Senator Scott Brown, Republican Governor Charlie Baker, and Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte--have been heavily criticized for spending excessively on television ads. This may not come as a surprise to anyone who followed the 2004 presidential race, but it is worth remembering that these candidates—especially Brown—brought great risk to the race.

He holds an LL.M. degree in international financial law from the London School of Economics. Contact him at brentbbi@webtv.net.

The most effective way to spend millions to buy TV ads is through a company called AdRoll. It's a company that owns nearly all the television advertising in the U.S., and it's the company that the companies that own AdRoll all rely on to distribute and manage their advertising. AdRoll and its associated TV buys are reported every day to Wall Street analysts, so analysts know precisely where the money is going.

AdRoll charges the candidates money based on the amount of time that candidates spend doing campaign ads. The campaign itself sends the company the same amount of money every day, but the candidate uses AdRoll's software to distribute it to the company's clients, and it uses AdRoll to sort it out for them. The client pays AdRoll based on the candidate's ad time, but AdRoll's software, which is designed to sort the ads based on its own research, also sends the actual amount of money to the candidate.

So, for instance, if you pay Obama $500,000 in campaign expenditures he had no role in choosing, AdRoll is paid $500,000 every day, but AdRoll sends the money to him. AdRoll receives 10 percent of that sum, plus a small fee for the use of its software, and a return on that investment—that is, what it would have made if the $500,000 had been spent on itself. Romney would only see 5 percent of his campaign expenses go to himself. (Romney does get a percentage of the money he spends in New York state TV ad buys.)

How TV money matters on the first and final day

AdRoll's primary role is to make sure the ad dollars reach, and stay at, the right candidate. It decides who gets the money—not the candidate—and the number of ad stations that get the money. It has some real-world experience. It helped Hillary Clinton run a multimillion dollar digital operation in 2008, but by 2012 it had closed that operation entirely. The company's clients can pay the company more than $50 million and get the money back immediately. (They can't sell that money for another year, however, just as they can't sell the company its own ads for the upcoming election.)

How much better can the TV industry be as compared to Internet advertising?

For one thing, it was easier for an ad shop to set up a network of TV stations. That's what Yahoo, Microsoft, AOL, Facebook, and Google are doing: Each of them have a large number of TV stations that can handle TV ad buys on their behalf. All those firms have tried to emulate"

Your headline or abstract should describe the content of the current article, rather than describe an extreme circumstance as something out of the ordinary. To write a headline, ask yourself the following four questions: 1. What is the significance of the event? If the event is dramatic, use the words ""explosive"" or ""fiery"", ""high-profile"" ""major"" or ""historic."" A lot of stories of major wars are, in fact, dramatic, dramatic events. Most are written about as events on the news, and rarely in the abstract.

Is the event dramatic? If the event is non-catastrophic (the death toll is unknown) use ""unexpected.""

Is the event non-catastrophic? If the event is catastrophic (the death toll is known) use ""extremely significant.""

To use the word ""fiery,"" ask yourself: Is it dramatic? The phrase ""firework"" is no longer used in newspapers, and the word is seldom used in other contexts because, for most readers, fireworks don't have dramatic significance. They are a kind of fireworks, and often no more dramatic than fireworks.

The phrase ""firework"" is no longer used in newspapers, and the word is seldom used in other contexts because, for most readers, fireworks don't have dramatic significance. They are a kind of fireworks, and often no more dramatic than fireworks. How is this event likely to impact the world? Is it likely to be seen or heard by a large number of people?

Is it likely to be seen or heard by a large number of people? Why is the situation unfolding today? Ask yourself:

Does this situation represent the last chance for any remaining people in the world to escape genocide? What other historical, political and economic events have happened before or since? How is this relevant to what today's news is going to be?

What other historical, political and economic events have happened before or since? How is this relevant to what today's news is going to be? How should I write about this event? For example: the U.N. reports the deaths of nearly 100 persons in the air crash at King Khalid International Airport in Bangkok. This is not a surprise to the news media because many of the passengers were Saudis (it is believed they were passengers of the same plane to which the plane that crashed last November was originally scheduled to fly), but does it seem too significant to be written about in a headline? It should be discussed in background stories. Also, if the passengers and crew were foreigners, it is not appropriate to report on their nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality. Foreigners are not the only foreigners affected in this way; people traveling from other countries to Thailand are also likely to be affected in the future (see the page about refugees and immigration).

For example: The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has confirmed that five Americans were among the victims. This is extremely significant, but does it seem to be beyond the realm of news.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on ""Sicko"" Gupta's report questions some of the movie's numbers and solutions. Gupta: ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that"""," Moore responded: ""Yeah, it's a good movie, but I'm still not quite sure about the methodology that you used and the conclusions you reached. I think you were getting the facts wrong, and I'm a little disturbed that you said I was wrong""


The transcript:


CNN Chief Medical Correspondent on CNN Chief Medical Correspondent on CNN ""Sicko,"" Alisyn Camerota (CNN, 4/30/2005): This is CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Alisyn Camerota. Alisyn Camerota: ""I have been asked by the producers of Sicko to analyze and report on the film that I have been looking at, and I don't know much but I'm very happy to do it.""


Moore, in his letter to the producers of the film, appears to be accusing Camerota of ""confusing the two different methods and interpretations of the facts and conclusions I made about the film.


Moore: ""I think you were getting the facts wrong, and I'm a little disturbed that you said I was wrong.""


CNN has provided multiple requests for comment from Moore and Camerota, but so far, there have been none.


In other words, Moore is suggesting that the film is somehow a ""factual or technical distortion"" on his part. In reality, it is more likely that the film is an example of some kind of miscommunication between Moore and Camerota.


The real issue here, as Camerota herself notes, is on the production of ""Sicko."" It does not matter whether or not the numbers provided by Gupta on MSNBC are accurate. The basic premise of the story is faulty.


Moore wrote on his website for CNN: ""I agree with CNN that the film is not entirely reliable as a factual basis for public policy.""


Moore has not provided any evidence supporting his assertion that ""Sicko"" is completely unreliable.


Moore's statement, however, is untrue. As the MSNBC report notes, ""Sicko"" has not been evaluated by any scientific organizations, and it is not at all likely that that evaluation would come at the hands of a scientific organization. In fact, ""Sicko"" has not been evaluated by any of the world's major scientific organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal Society. In his interview on MSNBC on March 27, Gupta provided some statistics from a 1999 study by George Mason University's International Center for Public Health and Climate Change, and the ""Sickow"" producers appear to have made similar errors in their methodology. The report notes that those figures and conclusions are presented in the movie, but does not mention those errors on CNN's site. The study that CNN uses can be found at: http://www.gmu.edu/~georggren/sicko.html. Anotherclubmember, John Hsu of the Georgia Institute of Technology, was critical of the movie, suggesting that Moore was misleading by saying that the methodology had been ""rigorously"" verified.


The producers of ""Sicko"" are also incorrect when they say that they were not paid to conduct the study by a ""public health organization."" As a spokesperson for the Georgia Institute of Technology says: ""I was not paid for anything in terms of the study that I did with Mr. Hsu and other partners. We were not asked for any money. In fact, a public health organization, I believe it was, paid for the project. That is a fact.""


Moore's article is also at fault if he says, with the implication that CNN paid Gupta: ""CNN News' editorial standards require it to obtain permission from contributors before including their names on stories based on their perspectives."" In fact, Moore's article says, with the implication that CNN is somehow wrong: ""CNN News' standards require it to obtain permission from contributors before including their names on stories based on their viewpoints."" The article provides no examples of ""CNN News' standards"" that would lead the producers of ""Sicko"" to use a particular name on the article. Moore has yet to provide any examples of the principles that govern the use of a name on a story.


The producers of ""Sicko"" are also incorrect when they say: ""Gupta is a physician who is concerned about the health effects of heavy metal toxicity... Gupta, a physician, was the head of the toxicology unit of a New Jersey hospital and has a history of using scientific evidence in his public campaigns, which is part of my background.""


Gupta has no history of using scientific evidence in public campaigns or in being involved in public health campaigns. As the Georgia Tech professor who did the 1998"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: India elects first female president, official results show Saturday. Pratibha Patil's supporters are calling victory a boost for women's rights. Bitter election campaign was marked by scandal. 72-year-old Patil was the ruling coalition's nominee for mainly ceremonial post.","

In her first major public comment on the result of a fiercely fought vote, the first lady called the ""results of an honest vote"" and congratulated the election commission and the opposition party for rejecting a government proposal to increase voter turnout.

""The results of an honest vote by people are what is best for the country,"" Patil told reporters on the flight from Amritsar to New Delhi via New York, where she would have to attend a White House dinner.

The first lady, who is married and has four grown-uponda sons and two grandchildren, is expected to attend the party on Oct. 20.

Patil, who has been in office since 2001, has become a symbol of India's democratic reforms, which swept from the Congress party to her Bharatiya Janata Party at the 2013 general election.

""I thank [government President] Pranab Mukherjee and his administration. People of India should be proud because here we have a woman who has taken her seat as the president. It is a very important achievement,"" Patil said during a short news conference aboard the flight, which left Delhi at 6:15 p.m. ET Sunday. [nL1N13C17X]

Voting was conducted Saturday after the electoral commission called off voting after some of the 8.5 million votes cast in the election were invalid. The commission also recommended a decrease in voter turnout in the second and final round due discriminate voter intentions, not including those from people who vote for the opposition.

""The government is committed to making India a more democratic place and this is something the government would be looking forward to working for,"" Patil said, adding it is ""sad we cannot go forward with this democratic journey and more than 1,00 crore people who voted today have not been able to go home.""

Patil said democracy needs ""enlightened, honest"" citizens and ""those who work every day for the betterment of our nation.""

Patching up: Aboard the flight home, Patil told reporters she had not met the President-elect but said ""he is a very straightforward person and talks in his own language.""

""I hope he will make India happy through his policies,"" Patil said.

""He promised people that he will bring development, increase jobs, change the situation of women and also create more jobs in the country. I am very pleased for him, but he needs to make good decisions,"" she acknowledged.

Some analysts say President-elect Modi may be able to follow through on some of the promises of his campaign.

""He has a lot of room in his Cabinet to implement some of his ideas,"" P. Sreenivasan, economic policy expert at IHS Global Insight, a London-based research firm, told CNN.

But, he cautioned, a vote for Modi is not a vote for democracy.

Modi, 70, won the election by a huge margin in Gujarat, the state he led before joining the BJP. In a post-mortem of the election on Saturday, government has accused his opponents of staging a ""massive conspiracy"" and ""collusion"" to destroy the BJP.

""Even in the final calculations, we have to accept that the opposition did not lose the elections,"" Modi told reporters in the city of Kolkata where he was meeting the Chinese premier. ""If the opposition won by an overwhelming margin based on their participation, they will win by using that to obstruct our programme and we do not have any other alternative.""

His opponent Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) candidates, who have been battling it out for years the race to be the next prime minister of India, have been accused of rigging the election, or of giving false replies and votes in a disproportionate number of areas.

Officials were investigating the shifting earth in the area for weeks. Residents can return to 75 of the 111 evacuated homes Thursday, mayor says. ""We watched the trees snapping and cracking,"" says one evacuated resident."," A wildfire erupted overnight in the Los Padres National Forest in Ventura County. More than 180,000 cattle have burned since July 1. ""With many more fires on the way, we are not taking them lightly,"" said fire chief Robert Maffei. Authorities are concerned the blazes are spreading so rapidly that they could burn the San Diego airport to the ground. (Associated Press)

These are just two of the many stories: In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy—even though it wasn't ""just""—the New York Times published multiple perspectives of the disaster that made it clear that the Obama administration, the White House, and the entire nation felt the need to provide extra aid and relief to the New York neighborhoods affected by the storm.

As we noted in the wake of Katrina in 2005, and the recent devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, we are in trouble if we don't take extreme actions to save lives. And if there is a chance that a flood event like Sandy can happen again, then we have to take every possible measure to insure that the lives they're saving are saved. Fortunately for us, they are."

Most are not from Sudan and have families, agencies say. Six members of Zoe's Ark, 11 others under arrest in Chad.","

In another case: The international NGO Human Rights Watch and an UN investigative team seized an aid convoy carrying 20,000 children between Chad and Gabon. The convoy made several attempts to get out of Chad before the officials in Chad blocked the convoy and refused to allow it to leave and, one official said, ""refused to take them. So we drove them on foot, we carried on and on, into Gabon."" They were detained by the authorities at a ""safe house"" where they stayed, for several days. When they were finally able to fly back to Chad, the team reported that the children ""have no school attendance, work with limited literacy, are not able to read letters and have limited English ability. Some are seriously malnourished and have lost their eyesight."" After a year the Chadian government eventually released all of the children.

The Chadian government ""is trying to put pressure on us to accept asylum, or to leave. We are in our country, we are legal residents. We don't need any refugee status. We are Chadian, Chad's country — we are Chad,"" said Jaffar Chindouneh, who was arrested with his brother-in-law, and other children at the time. ""It's impossible for us to go back and live in Chad after hearing them, so they want us all to go to Syria. One of my brothers was there when the soldiers were torturing civilians in Deraa.""

The Chadian government ""has a lot of control now,"" said Chindouneh's father. ""They have arrested and threatened us all. The only way out for us is for the international community to show solidarity with us.""

The United Nations Human Rights Council has ""highlighted the appalling plight of the Chadian children, describing their suffering and stating that they 'have suffered unimaginable horrors at the hands of their state government' and that 'a culture of impunity has taken hold to such an extent that, in some cases, the United Nations has found it inappropriate to register the accounts.' There was general outrage, with the UN Security Council urging 'urgent action' to'stop inhumane practices and to ensure children are not treated in this way,"" the report stated, adding that the Council, in ""unusually robust support for the children,"" called for an investigation into abuses against ""children as young as nine years old.""

In this time of conflict, the Chadian government is also ""repeating the same dangerous policies it used in Darfur before 2012,"" Human Rights Watch said. ""The government of Chad has been repeatedly and actively undermining the international rule of law in this part of the world. It is no surprise why the government of Chad is now cracking down on an effort to aid refugees."""
Write a news article based on the following summary: Earth has warmed one degree in past 100 years. Majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise. Some critics say planets often in periods of warming or cooling.," More on warming below.


""Climates change, yes. It's the way the planets work,"" said Marcia McNutt, a meteorologist based in Virginia Beach, Virginia, who is one of the three authors of the article. ""But what is the science behind it? That's what's going to change in this new era.""

McNutt and colleagues write that the climate models used by climate-skeptics cannot provide any compelling evidence that greenhouse gases are responsible.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that greenhouse-gas emissions are responsible for a decline in warming on Earth caused by the natural variation in the sun's energy, the Earth's tilt and the amount of ice at the poles. ""The average surface temperature changes that the IPCC models show is caused by natural variations and cannot be attributed to emission of greenhouse gases,"" the authors write.

However, the scientists have also reported that more than 99 percent of peer-reviewed studies published in the last 12 years show ""there was no detectable (increased in recent decades) warming over the 20th century.""

""What we have shown is that the IPCC has been grossly overstating the rate and magnitude of climate change,"" McNutt said in a telephone interview. ""It is not only wrong, but it's irresponsible and dangerous.""

The scientists said the Earth has warmed more than 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, the same time that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere tripled - and their data indicate it is caused primarily by human activity. ""So if you're talking about the causes of the warming, we've discovered none.""

The scientists' article also states that ""the scientific literature suggests that the amount of warming over the past century has been small - perhaps under half a degree Fahrenheit (0.2 degrees Celsius) – and probably due to natural variations.""

The experts cited a study released Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( airport, Washington - D.C. ) that finds the oceans are warming at a rate of only ""about 1.9 millimeters (0.08 inches) per decade - which is less than half the rate of the Earth's total rise in temperature during the past 1,000 years.""

The paper, called ""No signal for global temperature change,"" is based on a review of 1,700 years of temperatures and sea level records from around the world, using sea-level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While the warming rate has likely increased over the past century, it is still ""barely measurable and very likely to be less than.4 inches (1.3 centimeters),"" said NOAA scientist Stephen Halpern.

The review found ""no evidence that global temperature trends over the past century have been unusually high."" And sea levels in the last 1,000 years have increased about 0.07 inches (0.3 centimeters) and risen about four inches (1 meter) since 1900, the review concludes.

Scientists at the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ), the premier scientific society for earth scientists, wrote in a review published Wednesday that it is ""impossible to attribute the warming trend since 1979 to human emissions of greenhouse gases.""

Scientists report Tuesday a record-breaking streak started about 15 years ago where the Earth's average temperature has shot up more than half a degree Celsius, and scientists and researchers said the warming trend is continuing.

Many experts are now saying the warming trend is caused by natural changes and has nothing to do with human activity – or that such changes will reverse in coming years as a result of climate policies that would slow greenhouse gasses."

The second thing an observer in the Middle East can do is look at how Iraq is going -- and see what is wrong and what is right. In December, a study by the RAND Corporation found that Iraq's economic problems and poor governance were driving up unemployment and corruption and that Iraqi security had not markedly improved since the summer of 2007. In a July interview with a French newspaper, Mr. Bush made it clear that he did not take the report seriously: ""I haven't seen it; I have no information.""

This may be a case where the president and his chief domestic critics got the facts wrong about the Iraqi economy. But the fact is that Iraqis are poor; they lack access to the services and goods that Americans take for granted. Their joblessness rate -- 6.5 percent, according to the United Nations -- is double the rate of the United States. And the Bush administration has failed to build a strong and credible economy. This is where Mr. Barak comes into his own. He is convinced that Iraq, through its oil reserves, could become a major regional power.

In any case, Iraq has not shown that it can be the kind of powerhouse that has helped revive the moribund economies of South Korea and Greece: there, economic growth has reached 1.8 percent, compared to the 5.9 percent average in Iraq.

If Mr. Bush was still president, he might start a diplomatic diplomatic operation to persuade a more enlightened international community to get rid of sanctions that have hurt Iraq while allowing Iran and North Korea to continue to export weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. This could change the calculus for all Americans. One American-led effort to bring about more democratic change in China might also end up being more effective than the one Mr. Bush started.

But Mr. Bush is not the president -- and neither are American presidents. American presidents are given latitude in their own countries to make decisions on how and when to make them about their own countries. So when the president in 2007 decided to abandon Saddam Hussein's policy of strategic ambiguity, he also broke his own rule: that the United States make a decision only once it has determined that a leader is trying to do the one thing that matters to the United States: wage an aggressive foreign policy. And Mr. Bush found no such leader. For example, in recent months the United States has publicly opposed a new offensive by Palestinian gunmen into Israel that Israeli officials said would be welcomed by militants in the Gaza Strip.

Moreover, to be a good president you have to make a lot of difficult decisions. Mr. Bush didn't, and he wasn't the best president to make them. In December 2005, he decided to invade Iraq, which would have made him the worst president ever to lead the war and put America on a path to permanent war.

And yet he was elected."

"Write a news article based on the following summary: President Musharraf orders troops to take a television station's equipment. Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan says he's under house arrest. President Musharraf says his actions are for the good of the country. White House calls Musharraf's emergency declaration ""disappointing"""," and ""extremely unusual"" (he says he won't be visiting the U.S. to discuss the situation). The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad releases a statement saying that ""President Musharraf is a democratically elected leader of Pakistan and Pakistan's long international reputation was directly affected by his decision.""

What happens: A presidential emergency declaration allows the president to take emergency action against threats to the nation's security, without a vote of Congress. The president's orders are to be carried out by the Armed Forces of Pakistan (AFP), which has a very high level of authority (since it's the government).

What's the current status: The president has issued orders to dispatch military units (called ""Special Action Force"" or ""SAF"") to the capital, Islamabad. Musharraf believes his actions will be for the good of the country and the U.S. (since he's been under house arrest since September 26th). President Musharraf says he will not be visiting the U.S. to discuss the situation. The Anthropology Department of Deoband University, in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, has issued a moratorium on the anthropology department's students visiting the U.S.

What can we expect in the near future: The status quo on the ground has not changed, which is why you can probably expect Obama to make comments about it at the next international conference on terrorism. As of now, there are many questions about the legality, scope, and purpose of President Musharraf's actions, and it's safe to say the U.S. is not on board with the fact that no legal action, no matter how well-intentioned is currently being taken against him. We'll probably see the next step a little more frequently."

Singer was identified in court document as National Children's Museum spokesman. Washington museum officials say they are ""horrified"" by the charges."," A New York child protection squad said the alleged crimes occurred at the National Children's Museum in the city. On Wednesday, the Washington museum said it hired a criminal law firm to represent the museum against Singer. Washington museum officials say the allegations were first reported Monday in the New York Post. The museum, which says it educates children in a variety of fields, was not immediately available for an interview on Wednesday. The museum referred the Guardian to its lawyer, who said Singer, who is the director of its ""Children's Museum"" and an expert on social work, was immediately suspended from the museum. The New York Post's report, extraordinary for the newspaper's position on child sex abuse, was swiftly picked up by other American media.

Isikoff said the e-mail scandal could implicate ""at any one point a number of very powerful individuals in the United States"". It is not yet clear if authorities in New York have opened a criminal investigation regarding the matter. The New York district attorney's office told NBC News this morning: ""We do not have anything.... Not our business.""

The Associated Press said the girl's mother, a mother who has spoken to the Guardian, wanted to remain anonymous. ""My daughter doesn't want to talk, she doesn't want to tell anything,"" she said. It is not known if the child was sent pictures on her cell phone, nor if any pictures were sent without the parent's permission and sent to the undercover detective by the museum. Singer said he did not have control over the child pornography.

""In no way would I want my child to feel uncomfortable doing anything that has a sexual nature to it,"" he told the AP. ""I know this is not a crime of morals and you're trying to paint myself as something terrible."" Singer is an internationally renown and prolific author, former president and coeditor of the Penguin Children's Book Award-winning Penguin Children's Book Review and the recipient of the MacArthur Foundation's ""genius grant"" award. He said he did not know what the scandal was about. ""I know the parents, the community, the museum,"" he said, adding: ""You do what you have to do."" A spokesman for the Washington museum said: ""We are deeply concerned that sexual abuse of children of any age exists at our National Children's Museum.

""We have worked closely with law enforcement for a long time, and we take reports of abuse seriously. We have been working closely with our legal counsel for much of the last two weeks.

""We have notified a criminal law firm to conduct a serious investigation and are cooperating fully with that investigation. However, we had no involvement in any of this until we heard of these allegations from the New York Post. We are very sorry that this happened and we will thoroughly investigate these allegations.""

The Guardian had received a letter of complaint from an unnamed complainant – referred to in court documents as Victim No1 – to the New York civil division, which filed the criminal complaint on Monday. The letter states that Victim No1 sent a series of ""suspicious messages"" to a 12-year-old girl at the museum in New York from February to February this year, and that the victim, now in her early teens, had ""been a victim of child pornography"". She was a child sex abuse investigator at the New York museum.

According to the complaint, Victim No1 discovered that a child abuse investigator using the name of the New York museum, is a ""pedophile with child pornography collection and pornography."" The woman, who has a previous connection to the family of a prominent Washington charity, has since been identified as the New York museum's ""child sex abuse investigative specialist.""

There was one item from the list of 10 to get. A few other items from the list went up into the spotlight this week; some got passed around the news on Friday as well. It also turned the tide on the debate of whether we are in fact still living in a primitive past. Let's go over the items that got a boost, and give each one its own spot on the list.

10. An old lady who tried the method of making apple tarts

Another item from the list that made it in for at least some attention was one from a couple of years ago. This time, it was a woman who was trying to replicate a method using fruit to give her kids a summer treat to snack on rather than something like dried berries or pine nuts.

It turned out to be more than a little tricky, even for those who already knew what to do.

I thought so too:

For starters, the fact that it requires some fruit-puncturing and a few others that can make it a ""tough"" process makes it not very suitable for a ""real"" homemade treat for kids.

In fact, this was something of a failure for a lot of parents. One guy in particular took it to such extremes that he came up with a totally bizarre food mix he calls ""My Fruit Pelt,"" and it became a Facebook page.

9. A way to keep mosquitoes away in a summer

That one on the list of things that would benefit those who live in an area where mosquitoes or other diseases have the ability to get between humans and plants. The method that involves using cotton balls and an inflatable net on a person's head is pretty easy.

And who couldn't use the same method to help them stay out of trouble in their summer home?

I haven't heard of someone trying this method for years, but an Australian guy made it a success, telling a blog post today why he thought it is so useful.

8. A tool to make a garden

We had a cool idea for how to use our spare time (the majority of it goes straight into buying organic produce) but it fell just short of getting into the spotlight this week. This one that is just kind of funny to write because it's a bit more of a tool for gardening so doesn't feel like it needs the attention that other gardening items get.

I liked it, too:

The fact that a simple gardening tool like a rake, spade and shovel can be used with such efficiency to get a garden in a hurry was worth mentioning (I mean, we already have our tools, just let us use them).

7. A simple tool to wash your hands

One of the less talked about items on the list was a tool that could be very useful for everyone. It's a simple piece of wood and doesn't take very long to make, but it goes very fast. It has two uses and both are of concern for those on a diet of salad greens. The most common cause of food poisoning has nothing to do with your food and everything to do with our stomachs.

It has two uses: one is that you can use it to wash your hands and remove all the germs. ThereROth a good video of those two uses if you're looking for more information. Meanwhile, the second is to clean your hair.

Source: Fox News Fact Check on Bush vs. Mukasey, Apr 9, 2010

I'm no 'war on terror,' just a pro-secrecy bill

In fact, the ACLU's Ben Wizner believes that the Bush Administration may have violated the American tradition of due process by refusing to meet with Mukasey's staff in response to the release of their report on torture. Wizner's conclusion is that the ""torture report"" which Mukasey's staff released appears to be a ""sham,"" ""incompatible with the rule of law,"" or something that simply makes those who were involved in torture and the Bush Administration look bad.

We must stop talking about torture and start thinking about who was involved

The Bush Administration, a small group of politicians with interests to protect, and a few high-level officials with national security secrets who didn't think their actions were ""torture"" felt it was acceptable to break the laws of war on national security grounds. They broke our laws and lied about it. Then they used those broken laws to prevent the disclosure of their activities, their lie about the legality of their actions, and the details of their lies.

We lost our liberty, and it will take a constitutional crisis for us to reclaim it

We've already lost too many in these wars. We need to learn to come together to understand the need to defend ourselves. And while we do that, we need to remember that we'll always have to look at the fact that we didn't stop the wars the way we were invited to, but that doesn't mean we can't be grateful we aren't just as destroyed as the enemies of liberty we are fighting. We'll be asking ourselves how, in the 21st century, and in a nation that cares about human rights, and liberty, and justice, the way we handle the issue of torture in the future has evolved from the way it was handled during the Cold War.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Orme, Tennessee, has running water from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Town's spring ran dry in midst of Southeast drought. Donated water is trucked in from Alabama. Completion of pipeline will solve problem for good."," (Source: Wikipedia)

The ""problem"" that's occurring is a large-scale distribution of rainwater over a large area of land, not unlike the ""Great Lakes"" problem they've been fighting for the last few decades. That problem is in the Great Lakes basin, not in the Tennessee River ""dry zone"".

It wasn't supposed to start that way. The land that was wet and getting rain was always supposed to dry up as the river and its tributaries dried up and filled it in—a situation which many farmers in the Mid-Atlantic, who don't see ""the Great Lakes"" as part of their land are getting used to, have called ""laissez-faire"" or ""laissez-dire"" rather than ""laissez-verite"". The land that was wet and getting water from somewhere was supposed to dry up as the river and its tributaries dried up and filled it in. At the moment these ""laissez-faire"" farmers can see this drying up in Georgia and Alabama, as well as in parts of the Carolinas.


The Great Lakes are not in New England—not yet, at least.

If the land was wet and getting water, people would be able to move over the entire East Coast in a week, like people do now for winter and spring. Or water wouldn't be so expensive to move as it is now.

We'd get more snow days out of the Great Lakes than we have now.

If the land was wet and getting water, New Englanders would stop leaving New York for Canada before spring.

The drought isn't caused by the Great Lakes.

That's a good point. The drought isn't the fault of the Great Lakes.

At least a portion of the drought is the fault of human-driven warming, which is having a far greater impact than the Great Lakes. The drought isn't caused by the weather out west, like I thought it would be.

The lack of drought

We're currently missing a major chunk of the drought in the Midwest.

The region's water systems need to take much more of our energy and water in the water they produce. Which is very different from the ""Laissez Verez"" farmers in Alabama and Georgia who get all their water the traditional way. Instead of trucks or ships, they are pumping water directly into their basins.

I have trouble picturing the ""laissez-faire"" farmers in Georgia and Alabama who didn't see it coming.

I'll let others point to specific examples of crops or animals that are missing. That's important because we can learn a lot from those specific examples. For instance with tomatoes, just as with many other crops, a very big driver of the total water going into the tomato is the water entering and evaporating off the vines on the vine that need to be pruned and planted into the ground instead of being shipped somewhere as tomatoes are now.

For example, I'm looking at a good example of a recent phenomenon in Kentucky. I'll give the big picture. If we're moving water into Kentucky on railcars (a different, but related, approach) then the crops they're bringing in could have a water footprint that is over three times larger than they were before. That's just a simple example. Water is going into Kentucky for a number of reasons — the lack of rain last month or the recent drought — but because we're moving it into the soil, the ""loose"" soil and not the sandy loam that we're used to, it means we are using about 10 times as much water.

While there's nothing wrong with that particular example, it illustrates the point that some crops and parts of farms are getting more water than they used to (from whatever source). There isn't going to be a drought this year in Kentucky, unless the entire state gets completely dry again. Then it will, at that point, be a bigger problem than it was in the beginning (we won't get any more rain, at least in Kentucky.)

I can see what's happening in New England now: We don't get much rain except on the East Coast, a lot of that coming down south in the Southeast. It would probably dry up enough for crops by next year (and probably rain again, though we need to be worried about what comes down in the coming months. We know the Gulf of Mexico Leafworm will be a big threat. Just last year they killed over 1,500 sheep in New York and New Jersey. That is going to be a big problem after we stop using the"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: ""Wine Library TV"" Internet show has about 40,000 regular viewers. Show takes irreverent look at wine business. Wine consumption has risen in United States for last 15 years."," If one can make a decent living from wine or restaurant businesses, it is possible to develop a career.

Get a TV production budget of $2,500. $2,500 is enough to pay for $700 of equipment, plus $200 per month for a producer's fee — and $300 for time.

Invest your own money — $2,500. You can set up a website, buy software on WordPress, and then launch your show. You can hire a writer, an actor, a producer, and various other people to produce the show at your expense. You can hire a videographer, sound technician, camera operator and the rest of the crew, for $700 per month. You should then use that $700 to pay for a camera or sound system, if necessary.

Make sure your cast consists of a reasonable proportion of people who drink wine with a serious attitude. Everyone has certain prejudices against people who smoke weed. If we put that aside, how much is it worth to tell a character that ""it's ok, Ihaar Kaur was a smoker""?

Make your trailer sound as if it's a home movie made using professional video editing applications.

Re-edit your trailer to feature the right people in the right setting. This can also involve editing the scene where Kaur drinks from its glass.

Research the industry of wine and restaurant management — this is also very important. Check the profiles of these people on the web, which is not too hard.

You are looking at about $75,000. You can take some vacation for 1-2 months, before renewing your contract, or renewing the existing one (this doesn't have to be the same person).

If you go for a second producer, you need to choose one who has sufficient experience and know-how. You also need 1 or 2 people who have shown exceptional success to prove their worth at this stage.

If you go for a third producer, you will need a lot of money for equipment, which is expensive. If you manage to raise this amount, your new show will become even better.

Don't worry if this will cost you a lot more than if you had just worked independently. You won't get rich from it, but there will have been investment and your show will be better prepared for next season.

You should know the following:

Your subject matters will differ significantly from the pilot.

Don't go for people who have been on a TV show for a long time or are known to be big personalities or people who can produce a big budget project.

Try not to go for people who can produce more popular shows, but only if they have very good knowledge of the industry and can present it in a very entertaining way.

The production costs will escalate over time and as your production becomes bigger and bigger, so will your budget.

A good approach is to divide your budget into 6 months.

Start from $1,100, and increase the number of episodes by 2 (or 3, etc…) for the next 2 months."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Survivors of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh waiting for aid to arrive. Red Crescent Society official says deaths could rise to 5,000-10,000. Bangladeshi president distributes aid; angry survivors go empty-handed. Thousands remain missing; estimated 280,000 homeless.","

The editors and authors of these accounts are, like most other journalists, too poor and too ignorant to get the story.

Here's the problem: The world is moving too slow to help Bangladesh. We have spent six years under three successive governments and have largely given up trying. We're too busy laughing and crying and trying to figure out where to put our energies for another year or two—while our neighbours are suffering through the worst natural disaster ever to strike them.

Many thousands of children have drowned in the flood waters, too. They drowned because as soon as the waters receded, the local authorities moved the bodies. There are not enough schools and hospitals in the most affected areas. The United Nations agency that is managing relief efforts is understaffed, overwhelmed by requests for help. The emergency assistance office in the country hasn't even been set up yet, not even though it's meant to be by 2015 (a year later than originally projected).

No matter how bad the disaster is, we don't know whether it would be worse, because you don't move from one disaster to the next with the same level of experience.

On December 11, the government reported that it was still managing 100,000 people trapped in the Red Cross' camps, despite receiving 1.23 million relief materials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and World Food Programme. In that case, of course, no one saw it coming. The only people doing any work were officials, NGOs and local authorities.

In the most recent case, the Red Cross admitted that it had not been able to deliver the most basic supplies because it was running out of money—a total of over $200 million.

That disaster is far from over. The floods have already killed five hundred people, but that's not something you hear about in the news. You can tell it's happening to Bangladesh by the way the people of the country are reacting.

On January 17, around noon, a crowd of people gathered in the central business district, all chanting, ""We want jobs, we want government, we want bread, we want health, we want housing."" The women gathered there were holding two sheets of white cloth, to be used as masks and for washing clothes. The men were carrying the same bundle and sat on it. ""The government must not let another disaster hit us,"" they chanted.

That was a lot of people for two hours. Then someone came with a bag of rice and sugar. Then, at the behest of the crowd, the crowd was split into two groups. ""These are volunteers from the National Emergency Management Agency,"" said Dhaka Metropolitan Police police chief S.K. Mishra. They were given the bags, and were going down a hill to distribute them. He told me a woman came up to him with her three young children. ""I wish you won't come home so drunk!"" she screamed.

The government has said that two people have died of drowning at the height of the disaster, and I'd say the chances of them being drowned again with hundreds of others on the ground is very low.

And then there's this scene last week in Dhaka:

I woke up this afternoon to find the sea still out of sight as darkness fell. I walked up the beach, past the sand and into the waters. The shore looked barren. I walked for several minutes until I came to a small body of water that looked like it was almost filled with boats. In front of me lay a single dinghy, its engines burning fiercely. Two people were lying on top of it. The others were waving desperately with sticks that they used to help propel the dinghy over the surface, as they struggled to remain afloat. As I reached them, the whole family of eleven, plus three women and one child, had become trapped. Their faces were blackened by the heat of the flames. A young woman had been burnt very badly. Her body was wrapped in her clothes. The other six, including a toddler, appeared badly burned as well. The other three, including a pregnant woman and three-year-old child, were still alive. I put my arm through an opening in the sand and dragged them on deck. They looked very exhausted, in pain and scared, but I didn't want to get them too tired. At the front of the dinghy sat a man in his late thirties. He had a very deep voice and was dressed in white pyjamas and a loose yellow shirt. He held a stick and was trying to hold the others to the boat with one arm. In the next moment, the dinghy started to rise quickly and"

Police said they received multiple reports of the apparent armed suspect's presence at the construction site about a half hour before security forces were alerted. The man was last seen getting into a vehicle. A witness reported spotting a man matching the description of the man in the security footage on the roof of a building about 15 blocks away. Police said they recovered the suspect's gun from the vehicle.

• A U.S. embassy official says the FBI is handling the FBI's investigation into the Baku post-election embassy attack. A senior law enforcement official said it is ongoing and officials do not know at this time whether a group has coordinated the attempt against the embassy.

Police said they've recovered the assailant's vehicle, a white Kia Soul in Mosul which was found near a gas station in southern Baghdad.

The vehicle's license plate had been cut off and authorities had no way of determining its name. The vehicle has been used several times for surveillance, in addition to the earlier use as a vehicle to store weapons and explosives, said Lt. Gen. Yahya Rasool, chief of the police's Baghdad Operations Unit.

The incident occurred the day after the coalition pulled back troops from Iraq to protect embassy operations there. It was the fourth time since 2009 that there had been large-scale U.S. military presence at the embassy complex.

The Serb, who had a first-round bye, lost 6-3 6-2 to veteran Fabrice Santoro. Top seeds Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal win opening matches at Bercy."," The Federer-Nadal matches were first on Thursday night's tennis schedule. A couple of hours later, both men started winning and dominating their sets. The Federer vs. Nadal match at Bercy will be on April 7. The Federer-Santoro match will take place on April 23. On April 5, the men's and women's singles final match will take place. The first match will be at Bercy on April 9. On April 22 or 23, the men's and women's doubles final match will take place.

What does all this mean? As far as the ATP tour is concerned, the big winner on Thursday night may be Novak Djokovic, who has been one of the few consistent performers this season. Djokovic has a 12-2 record against top-12 players, including Nadal (25-6). The No. 4 seed has lost just twice, both by less than a set to Nadal in the third round of the French Open. Djokovic is 3-0 against Nadal this season.

Federer, meanwhile, won another ATP tour title here Monday, defeating Andy Murray 7-5, 6-1 to capture his fourth title in six years. His winning streak at Bercy is at 20-4.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Gloss taking backseat to bold colors in lipsticks. Exfoliate lips before applying a bold hue. Melissa Silver: ""Anyone can wear plum or sheer red"" at night. AJ Crimson likes subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones for day."," The trend for high pigmentation in lipsticks is growing, and many of them are now bolder, but there's still an absence of a great black lipstick shade on the market.

Blink-182: ""All shades will have this high shimmery look"" – no word on a formula change yet – lip color with a sheer, high gloss finish?

""Nude with a hint of black""– how long has it been since lipsticks have been able to say, ""All shades will have this high shimmery look""? If it's been an era of lipsticks that have been ""not even-close"" to having that look then this new formula is more than likely a start.

Lavender and plum color-changing glosses: I love plum lipstick, so I'm not sure what those two terms mean here, as well, but there's a trend going on where these glosses make deep color changes without a glossy finish, and I'm thinking it probably involves a matte finish that creates a color change. One of my current favorites is this metallic gold with a pink undertone. ""Blush & black"" in the Lipstick Club has a shimmery pink hue and a bright, saturated blue-orange, although it's only $6. I don't think the formula has changed or anything, so if I'm going to wait until the new packaging comes out then I would really be hoping it happens. I like the Lipstick Club formula, and I do hope it does just get more colors.

Pantone Universe: Pantone has finally released a set of color changing lipsticks, and I really like some of them, although their color changing formula is pretty awful. I loved the color Ruby, a bright and vibrant yellow-black with hints of green. It had a really soft feel to it, and a more subtle red undertone, but it was really boring and boring in just about every way. I can't imagine this colour will work for anyone other than me (a Ruby addict) and I don't really see where a deep color would be successful outside of that base.

Pink and lime: I love green so this pink and lime lip color is a no-brainer. The new formula and packaging are really nice too, I'd love for Pantone to start a ""Pink Velvet"" lipstick campaign.

Pinky and pale pink: This is the lipstick I'm most excited for, and because I'd like to be able to wear pink lipsticks everyday without really worrying if they're the right shade, this is a great candidate. The matte-pink formula is very pig 53 though, and I do wish it didn't dry to the touch, but it is probably just too pigmented, so that's something I'd probably prefer over a matte or shimmer finish in my collection.

Pinkish pink: So this is another color I want to try because I think it has a very interesting shift to it, similar to a very wearable pink color, but this one's more of a sheer peach with a touch of beige. It's supposed to wear to lip color as matte but not quite as sheer, so I can see where this is being worn to deepen the color of the color on my lips to make it stand out.

Taupe-ish-orange: Another favorite! I know, it's a shade I already have in my collection, but for some reason I've got this color stuck in my head because the formula is the same as that of our beloved BK Beauty brand. I think it would work so well for a lighter, cool lip color if that weren't an issue in the future. There's a lot going on, even at 5% per application to dry the lips, you'd never notice.

Taupe-ish yellow: This was my second choice, but I'm also curious about how the formula will be packaged for long-term wear. With browns and purples in my collection, it just feels more natural to wear one shade of lipstick on my lips. If you are able to wear the same shade on your lips two or three times, maybe the formula is just a little thinner, I want to be able to wear it with a lip liner or even gloss, and I want to be able to look good without a glossy/matte finish on my lips, so this color seems like it could be a dream.

I am so, so, so excited to try out this collection. As a general rule, I like pink lipsticks over black lips because I like the way it reflects the light, it's harder to look washed out without a lot of contrast (if you"

A lot of people think the American Association of Museums is a museum. In fact, when you go through their site you'll find that it is a whole host of arts and crafts organizations that share the common goal and a few common names: The American Institute of Philatelists, the American Institute for Historical Archaeology, and the American Museum of Natural History, to come up with the list. The ""AAM"" stands for AAM is America, and Museums for America. But the association is actually a coalition of 15 states and two cities, as well as the United Church of Christ and some smaller, non-Museums for America non-profits. The American Historical Association of Museums is called the American Institute of Archaeology, the American Museum of Natural History is called the American Museum of Natural History, and the local museums are called the local museums. In each state and in each city the museums are separate legal entities, but they play a central role in the overall mission of the city or town that they are in. These are not separate museums. They are really the people of the local town who want a good show.

Many people assume that because many of these museums are located in towns or in cities with a lot of people of different ethnicities, they can't just have fun with all those different museums. People like to think that museums can be ""local"" and ""local museum"" and not so much a cultural product in itself—this makes sense, since when people came to the United States they wanted a good show. After all, why visit your local college dorm room when you could see the local art history museum? And the cities of Philadelphia and New Orleans have hundreds of cultural institutions, even though very few of them are local. People like museums for an experience, not as a way of life.

But no city with more than 40,000 people has more than one, perhaps because the historical institutions themselves have different communities. In Chicago, for instance, some museums (the agent for which is the Illinois Cultural Heritage Agency) have more than one community in which it is located. Other historical-museums have a different museum for each individual community. For a moment, consider the relationship between the US Museum of Natural History and the Chicago National Gallery. The museum is in the same building as the gallery, and they both serve different museums. They also have local communities in which they are located—the Illinois Cultural Heritage Foundation for the Chicago National Gallery and the Ohio Historical Society for the National Museum. This relationship is not the same for museums nationwide; in California some museums are located in a district office and some are in one or more districts, and they are all within walking distance. The reason museums tend to follow a similar pattern is partly because all of these museums are members of the American Association of Museums.

So if the historical-museum-as-entertainment-organization-is-a-nonentity notion is wrong, why do people go to all of these museums when they can't get to their local museums? And what would a ""national museums"" look like? Are there more than 50? Not all museums are the same size, so what about the number of ""local"" ones?

In a paper presented at the meeting ""Museums as Community Engagements"" in August, the historian David G. Kline of the New York Museum of Art suggested that the way museums look at an environment is not about the number of people, but also about the kinds of people who use and interact with them (and how), and the kinds of things they tell stories about in the spaces across the museum (they make art; stories can be about art; we have stories we want to tell that we can get out of the museum). It gets more sophisticated from there, and it's at the kind of thing the American Association of Museums has done for years: it hosts events like National Storytelling Week, ""Museum Night,"" and the exhibition ""Muse: National Stories About the Museums"" which explores the variety of stories told about the cultural institutions in each of the country's 50 states or the District of Columbia. The events are actually open to all of the organizations in the association, but since people only spend time at a museum once, and many museum patrons only see a museum once, they are probably only going to see the stories of a variety of groups and not focus on how the stories"

Six people, including four students, were killed Friday night at an apartment party at a residential complex in Columbia, authorities said.

South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said Saturday in a statement that, unlike previous mass shootings, the house appeared to be targeted.

Haley said officials did not suspect ""any particular motive"" for the shooting, noting that no additional suspects had been arrested.

The Kurdish Regional Government's security forces arrested three members of an al-Qaeda branch in Iraqi Kurdistan, state-controlled Iraqi Islamic Media Office (MNA) reported on Thursday.

The MNA said in a statement, ""The detention of two members of Islamic Jihad group, from the city of Tal Afar, was announced by the security forces on February 9 at 4:40 in the morning to prevent them from making suicide acts against the security forces.""

Tal Afar is north of Kirkuk and its outskirts include Sunni territories that have been under Kurdish control since 2004. The town is also held by Iraqi security forces.

Al-Qaeda is the name of an organization that was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in 1996.

Also on Thursday, Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Saturday declared victory for Iraq's forces in their campaign against the Islamic State group there over the past week.

Abadi said in a televised address that Iraqi security forces ""have regained the initiative in the battles with [IS] terrorists,"" referring to the self-proclaimed Islamic State group by its Arabic acronym.

""With regard to the fight against them, God willing, we will prevail,"" he said.

On Wednesday, troops recaptured the second largest village to fall under IS control in western Anbar province.

The IS militants had occupied the village of Bashiqa on Monday and continued moving from one area to another as they advanced toward Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, on Thursday and on Friday.

Sporadic clashes erupted along the road between Bashiqa and western Anbar on Saturday, and the U.S.-led coalition flew airstrikes against IS targets in the area.

Iraqi forces are still waiting for reinforcements to take back Mosul, and a second push on the IS-held city could begin as early as next week, if all goes as planned.

Sporadically, the IS militants have been advancing south, toward the city of Fallujah, further west.

As many as 450,000 civilians remain trapped in Fallujah as the offensive winds down, with little chance of escape or release.

Meanwhile, hundreds of ISIS fighters are on the offensive against Iraqi troops from the nearby Anbar province over the past week, according to a U.S. official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. The official has seen aerial footage showing that IS fighters are ""moving in numbers very rapidly"".

The New York Times quoted the official as saying that IS fighters moved on government-held districts in the northern province on Sunday, seizing control of five major military bases with tanks, armored vehicles and fighter jets.

The official said the offensive began this week with a ""complete takeover"" of Fallujah, which is located about 40 miles west of Baghdad. He said Fallujah residents were ""terrified"" of the violence, and that the fighting was ""brutal and widespread"".

""From all the evidence I have seen this is the biggest ISIS offensive in Iraq since July when the group captured the city of Bjerk,"" said the official, referring to the ancient city of Mosul. He said that since that point, Iraqi forces had regained ground in some areas of Anbar but that ""it's been very very slow.""

The official said that the battle of Fallujah was the first major offensive on Anbar province since U.S. forces pulled out of the province in 2011. The U.S.-led coalition has continued to maintain a presence and intelligence operations against IS in Fallujah and in Baghdad, though little of that area has been fully recaptured from the militants.

The official said that Iraqi troops had been on the offensive in Anbar province since July and that there had been a ""large-scale"" effort to retake towns and villages east of Ramadi, also where Iraqi forces were battling. Ramadi is about 90 miles from Baghdad.

He said Ramadi in particular was among seven to 10 other towns held by the IS militants that had fallen since the U.S. withdrawal, adding that the coalition was working with local communities to help defeat the militants, who used the Fallujah offensive as a launchpad to recapture their capital in June.

But the official said the coalition was facing a more intractable challenge in Ramadi and had been unable to retake it.

The U.S. official would not disclose how many militants were"

Piedras Blancas County Sheriff's Office is investigating the disappearance of a woman who was last seen in the parking lot of her residence on Ladera Road in Fort Bragg Thursday evening.
The woman's body was found near a drainage area of the roadway around 9 p.m. Thursday, about an hour before she would have left for work.
The Sheriff's Office said that the woman was likely taken to a drainage area and drowned in the drainage.

Girl on tape, now 7, found safe with family. Tape shows man sexually abusing the girl 4 years ago."," Deputies to begin a formal investigation.

In an interview with the Times Times Union, Stiles described himself then as a ""survivalist type dude."" It remains unclear what he meant by that.

Deputies, meanwhile and later in the interview with the Times Union, explained that they never met Stiles prior to the attack, nor took him into custody for the incident, because he was on state custody with the girl and because he was an acquaintance, not an actual child offender.

The girl, who has not been publicly identified, told authorities she had to be alone because her mother had gone into labor.

The attack occurred Oct. 30 at a house on South Wood Street in Portage. Deputies went there Saturday night in response to a 911 call from a neighbor, according to the Times Union.

Stiles showed up at the house and, during the verbal confrontation, the tape shows, the girl screamed that she was afraid. She grabbed his hand and told him to leave; he didn't, which she believed was because he had been drinking.

The girl went into her room and came out crying and saying they had to escape because she was going to be late on her doctor's appointment. That's when the girl started trying to hold Stiles down to keep him from raping her. At that moment, one of the girl's family members appeared and told the girl's mother to keep the girl inside.

Stiles continued the assault and, at some point, the girl moved her arms down his jacket to prevent him from raping her. According to authorities, she later realized she was not restrained properly, and the tape starts to show him forcibly pulling down her pants to get his penis inside her vagina, where he said he ""did try to shove a finger inside her but couldn't put it in because she was full"" and ""she was full of urine so it would probably hurt a little bit."""

The Cost of Living Index 2016 (COLLI 2016) is a composite index of 14 countries that includes national prices of goods and services, interest rates, and currency values.

The COLLI 2016 is different from the Index of Goods and Services (IEG, 2016) that compiles information about the prices of goods and services produced by member countries. Both indexes use prices as indices, calculating their own price indices for goods and services based on the prices of similar goods and services sold by foreign firms in the member countries. Neither index includes data on how much foreign firms paid for goods and services in the member countries. The COLLI 2016 does include data on the cost of living in the member countries.

For instance, the COLLI 2016 is intended to measure the cost of goods and services in a country based on data from a representative sample of that country's businesses and consumers. Since member countries' personal budgets may be different, prices do not necessarily reflect the prices of goods and services in the country. The prices of personal goods and services must be expressed in the most competitive market in that country.

The COLLI 2016 calculates consumer prices only for goods and services supplied by businesses to individuals and households, excluding all expenses such as interest, taxes, and rental car costs.

For more information on COLLI results, see COLLI Facts and Figures.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: ""Heartbroken"" house owner's daughter among six survivors hospitalized. One survivor jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape. University of South Carolina mourns deaths of six students."," The victims are among 18 slain at UCC. Seven students were reportedly trapped at UCC on Friday evening by a gunman who entered with a rifle shot to the classroom. One other student died near campus near a library during a shooting that left 17 people dead. Authorities say one victim was shot in the head, another in the leg during the shooting. Two others were injured in the shooting. Police officials confirm one student was shot with a rifle.

The first reported murder happened in downtown St. Louis on Thursday morning when a police officer investigating a home burglary found a dead man in another residence. As he looked for a suspect, his companion allegedly shot that officer in the back.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol later confirmed that the officer was the first person they had encountered since the gunman began his rampage. When the patrol took over, the wounded officer was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

The U.S. Secret Service arrived in St. Louis shortly after Friday's shootings to assess the situation.

The St. Louis County police tweeted that the gunman remains on the loose in the area and urged residents to stay away while the sheriff's office, ATF, FBI and Missouri State Highway Patrol responded to the incident.

A Missouri State Highway Patrol spokesman said it is in talks with St. Louis County authorities, in addition to FBI agents and local police, to establish a ""command center"" in the area where the shooting took place.

""We're gonna have law enforcement in the neighborhood as a precaution,"" said Officer Jason Taruska to the Post-Dispatch, adding that St. Louis County sheriff's deputies are on scene with FBI officials.

The St. Louis-area FBI field office said on its Twitter feed that agents were helping in the standoff and have a ""detailed mission."" An FBI spokesman confirmed to ABC News that agents are involved."

May said: ""Our approach must be clear, unambiguous, and proportionate – we cannot allow others to decide if and when to join our society."" It isn't the only recent incident in which politicians have spoken about how to protect children against violent extremism. Prime Minister David Cameron spoke last summer about ""deeper, more extensive surveillance"" of children. ""We should start not just monitoring extremists, but actively targeting them,"" he said. In that interview, he also said that his aim was to persuade children to think before they speak. Speaking before the Manchester bombing, Prime Minister David Cameron said he would stop ""luring"" British Muslims to join ISIS and instead use the threat of extremism as an opportunity for local communities to help. In the interview, he said: ""Is the only way we are going to end this is by actually engaging these communities or we are going to be doing this at the expense of people who come in with absolutely nothing and, at some point, end up either coming out as terrorists or, indeed, having done the things that they came to be accused of?""

May said that after speaking in March about the need for new measures in the fight against extremism, she had seen only the ""sides"" with such measures while visiting schools in Buckinghamshire and Dewsbury, Manchester, earlier this year. After seeing these schools, the Prime Minister said she hoped to ""explore the idea of more extensive measures."" In contrast to her earlier comments, she also said she wanted to ""start not just monitoring"" people who may be engaged in jihadist activities, which she described as a ""real problem,"" but then added later: ""I do believe that there can be no place for terrorist atrocities in our country.""

In another part of the article, it appeared that, for the first time, May spoke about how Britain is taking strong action against radical ideology. She expressed ""no sympathy"" for those who are radicalized and then commit violence.

Write a news article based on the following summary: A Mauro Camoranesi goal earns Juventus a 1-1 draw with leaders Inter Milan. Argentine striker Julio Cruz had given injury-hit Inter the lead in the first half. The result maintains Inter's unbeaten record and moves them two points clear.," A Diego Perotti penalty in the 90th minute gives Juventus the title. Inter are one-half down to Milan.

Why was this summary published?

The European Championship final, won by Portugal in Paris, ended 2-2 on aggregate despite a scoreline of 1-2 for both teams in the first leg, which included a last-minute first-half goal. The referee's final decision should have been based on video evidence that could have ruled against Portugal. But there was no video evidence, making no difference before the match. Instead, officials decided on a subjective interpretation of the fact which would be published as an official narrative without consideration of any further explanation.

After the game, European Championship chief Michel Platini released a statement saying his ""thoughts and prayers"" were with those involved.

What do I say?

It is inex chiroprops, a great tragedy for sport, society and our relationship with each other. This case is a warning to players and fans alike. It is not an argument against the system: UEFA's rulebook makes it clear that in the event of a late goal, the player who scored can continue to celebrate, the opposing team cannot. It is not an argument against the rules themselves, which are clear, and that UEFA's decision to publish it in the same day in all of its member countries was appropriate under these circumstances. It is not an argument against the judiciary, which clearly has the same job of homeowner as the officials in these circumstances. It is only an expression of how we feel about the situation, as we are all fans in this tragic circumstance.

What's the story here? Are there witnesses and video available? Please let me know.

Yes, there are. In this case only one side can be shown on video footage. Video footage of the match itself and of the game between Inter and Ronaldo, of Ronaldo's goal and of the decision to award goal bonuses as a result, are available on Youtube. There are additional sources: these are reports by the referees on their match reports into the game, by a former referee who was on the bench at that time, in an interview with the Spanish radio station Cadena Ser, and by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). As for witness credibility, one only has to read the UEFA website itself, and then ask yourself ""If this happened, who would want to falsify the evidence?"" in order to grasp the enormity of the case."

Transcripts say Jeffs confessed to ""immorality,"" said he is not ""the prophet"" Jeffs' attorneys say he has recanted statements. Jeffs due to be sentenced November 20 on accomplice to rape charge.","

Your letter writer was contacted by the Investigative Reporting Workshop for Public Media, a nonprofit journalism center based in St. Paul. The organization recently released a report on whether the investigation into the polygamous sect called Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints led to any prosecutions of high-profile members.

After conducting its own investigation, the workshop found that while the FBI investigated and issued citations to eight leaders in the polygamous sect, two other men were charged in state or federal court for violating tribal law in Arizona.

""The prosecution records provided by authorities did not include specific information identifying the individuals charged,"" the organization said in a statement.

When asked whether the workshops has any other investigations into polygamy investigations, Jeff Sharlet, the group's executive director, said that's been a growing trend.

""That's a very challenging question, no question about it,"" he said.

But he noted that the workshop provides advice ""to organizations and individuals who are looking to follow through"" polygamist investigations.

In this interview, Sharlet spoke about several potential outcomes of Jeffs's trial.

""He (Jeffs) has to testify at trial,"" Sharlet said. ""If Jeffs doesn't testify, is (his lawyer) going to have a chance at being excused?""

If Jeffs doesn't testify, Sharlet said, the judge will have theGreat Apostasy on his hands.

""If that occurs,"" Sharlet said, ""he has to be given time to reflect.""

But if he does testify, Sharlet said, some of the testimony will be based on other evidence taken from a separate investigation by the FBI. That investigation involved two members of the sect, a man and two women, who were accused of conspiring to sell $120,000 in church-owned land in southeastern Arizona.

""If some of those people went to trial, you're not talking about some kind of Big Brother-type thing,"" he said.

Sharlet also noted that some prosecutors, at the request of Jeffs's attorneys, would be going to trial, as well. The FBI has declined to talk about that investigation.

Sharlet also said that Jeffs should not have to testify. But when asked about whether that was on the table, Sharlet said he didn't know.

The workshop found that Jeffs's attorneys, Paul DeHart and Chris Slaten, likely would be pursuing a strategy in Jeffs' trial that would allow him to stayamuraited. That's the legal term for out-of-court settlements involving people convicted of high-profile crimes in the civil courts. It's not uncommon in state and federal courts but rare in civil courts.

Slaten said the idea is to have Jeffs testify in the case and that legal precedent already supports out-of-court settlements. He said that Jeffs would be a defendant in his own actions.

""The only thing he (Jeffs) needs is to step on the rope, so to speak, and take some responsibility for being a bad president and a bad prophet and all that stuff,"" Slaten said. ""It's up to the court and he'll put forth his arguments whether there's a lawyer sitting there, or not. I don't know what the chances are, but we're going to keep on working this case until the end.""

If he does testify at the trial, Slaten said Jeffs ""could come to a clear and concise statement in which he recognizes he has done some bad things, but he doesn't want to do it again.""

In that statement, Jeffs' attorneys and their supporters would make his allegations about what became public and his response to the allegations. They also are likely to want him to explain what prompted him to break away from the church.

Sharlet said the workshop is not trying to be a voice of the media. As of Wednesday morning, three people had tweeted messages supportive of Jeffs, including one with the hashtag #FreeJeffs.

""I feel like we can give a little piece of this back to the community,"" he said. ""A piece of our community that has been very much affected by this.""

The church has a website, but its members have limited knowledge about the details of the investigation. The Mormon Church says it has no comment on the details of the polygamous settlement and has no comment, in general, on the ""MormonLeaks"" online leak program.

Sharlet said the group has been contacted by both the media and lawyers from the community about Jeffs.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Lewis Hamilton fails to clinch world title after spinning out of the Chinese GP. Briton's lead cut to four points by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso. Alonso finished second in Shanghai behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.," He beat Hamilton in the race to the chequered flag.

What was the headline? Mercedes wins world title for Hamilton and Alonso

""Hamilton and Alonso got the chequered flag first in Shanghai and we saw a clear picture,"" said Sky Sports F1's Simon Lazenby after the race. ""They've locked up at the top of the charts in the drivers' championship, with Alonso second, but they also came out of the Chinese GP with Mercedes' lead at four points with a margin of just 1.25 seconds.""

The news was widely believed to have been the result of a technical problem which prevented Hamilton and Alonso from completing the race. The McLaren pair also did not finish ahead of Ferrari, and Sebastian Vettel, who finished second, scored a thrilling victory on the last lap.

Although Sky had predicted that Alonso, who led for most of the race, would beat Ferrari, it was Hamilton who secured the win in a tense end to the race. Alonso had briefly lost a lead after his accident on the first lap and he was back on top when Alonso reeled his rivals back into the pits after his final retirements on the way to finishing second.

""They were so close I believe in hindsight,"" said the team's Fernando Alonso after Shanghai at the Japanese Grand Prix

It put Alonso four points behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in the drivers' standings, with the world champion leading Hamilton by just 11 points. This would now push the championship stakes even higher, and it is the first time since 1995 that four teams have recorded the same number of titles.

May 15, 1999 - Al Jazeera's Arabic language service is cut off by the government. News of the censorship was reported later that day. The station, also known as Sihanouk News TV, broadcasts under the direction of Mohamed ElBaradei, former head of the Palestinian Authority and current head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Arab world's largest TV station has been seen as critical to the survival of Egypt's ruling military dynasty. ElBaradei described this year's crackdown as repressive and said Al Jazeera journalists had fled the country and that several had left on May 8. However, state security services claimed May 10 that 10 journalists were killed in the violence and that there had been ""a large scale search for terrorists in the city and in the countryside,"" according to a CNN report. CNN, however, said the claim referred to an operation conducted May 9 in which more than 100 people were arrested and interrogated. The Al Jazeera English service, also known as Al Jazeera Arabic, began broadcasting in 1998 and has been a crucial source for information about the Middle East since it was launched. Al Jazeera Arabic is funded and operated by the Arabic network Nawaheb Al Jazeera, which is affiliated with the Nawaheb family of Abu Dhabi. The channel is distributed through the Internet and is funded by the World Economic Forum - an organization founded by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the founder of The Clinton Foundation and the son-in-law of Saudi King Fahd. Sheikh Mohammed owns the investment group Al Wafd Investment, a major shareholder of The Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation's CEO, Tim Kaine, and others who are close pals with the Al Wafd family have received donations ranging from over $12 million to millions of dollars from the Saudi Arabian public. Al Wafd's investments - including investments in Apple, The Coca-Cola Company and other top U.S. companies - are subject to restrictions on ""investors"" for potential conflict-of-interest, according to a Reuters report by David Sirota on Feb. 10, 2009. It's unclear whether all Al Wafd investors are registered in the U.S., as it's illegal to take public money from any nation without their approval. Al Wafd's links to Al Qaeda date back to the 1990s and to ""an alleged U.S. intelligence operation on behalf of the bin Laden family,"" according to David Sirota. At least one of Al Qaeda's main fundraising hubs, the U.S. branch of Al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Muhajiroun, also received help from the Clinton Foundation, according to Sirota's report: ""It seems clear that Al-Muhajiroun was also funneled money from the Clinton Foundation to the bank and the Al Wafd investment group that owns it."" Sirota also said Al Jazeera English - formerly known as Al Jazeera Arabic - appears to be under the influence of a prominent Saudi-based Muslim Brotherhood figure who has ties to Al Qaeda, including its longtime leader, Ayman al Zawahiri. The Brotherhood is considered by many Arab governments as a terrorist organization, including Egyptian and Sudanic ones. According to the Times of London, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan (who was also part of the Saudi bin Laden entourage) is at the helm of Qatar's efforts to take Al Jazeera English over. ""Bandar bin Sultan's role in the Qatar-Al Jazeera project is still in the works, according to a senior Qatari official,"" reported the London Times.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Lionel Messi scores for the sixth game in a row as Barca defeat Atletico 3-0. Real Madrid stay top of the Primera Liga table after defeating Recreativo 2-0. Sevilla's crisis continues as they lose their four league match in succession.,"

Please include a link to this story if your source was a television station, radio broadcast or newspaper.

Barcelona's Lionel Messi scores for the sixth game in a row as Barca defeat Atletico 3-0. Real Madrid stay top of the Primera Liga table after defeating Recreativo 2-0. Sevilla's crisis continues as they lose their four league match in succession.

The number of goals scored in an MLS game since last July is: 0.

What if I include the most valuable goals this season?

What if I take the most valuable goals in a single season and add the totals for league championship, playoff and domestic cup competition?

Here is a list to help determine what constitutes a valuable goal: In MLS, it does not really matter as all of the league's ""contenders"" scored in the last week of the season, and they're all in play this week.

There isn't too much data in MLS these days on scoring in regulation or sudden death overtime games, but we can try to answer this question using this handy chart from Steve Bocock's website. The first column shows how many total points this season have gone into goals scored per game, the second column shows total points this season that total points have gone in in regulation and sudden-death overtime. Note that the numbers for both columns were calculated by taking the league's average total percentage of points scored in each one. (The chart shows a significant rise from last year — for comparison's sake, this year's season is down by about 15%.)

The next chart shows how MLS teams are likely to perform this week. Note that most of the teams are likely to be down to either goal scorer (one team is likely down to zero goals this week) or have one goal scorer that has been out with a serious injury for several nights. So, as I said, the number of goals scored should be about 150-200 points, not far off from the 250-300 points you are used to seeing in MLS. The only team with greater than 300+ points this year is the Seattle Sounders, who are at or near the top of the points leaderboard, but the Sounders have done very well in the regular season and there is ample evidence to indicate they've been able to win the cup and play out the remaining games.

However, with five (!) games left, there equation gets a little tricky, and that's not a bad thing. The difference in quality between the last few weeks of regular season and this week's is much greater than most people expect this year to be.

My guess is that over the remaining four weeks, teams will put in good work, scoring mimimum points at the right time, playing to the style of play that they were good at in their last few games of the season. Then, if they win the final three games, they will be well over 300 points, which will put them right in the conversation for the Cup."

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Three Austin cave explorers are safe and are out of the cave, officials said. The University of Texas students went into Airman's Cave Saturday. The 12,000 foot long cave complex has tight twists and turns. Unclear exactly how the students lost their way, but cave is complex, official said.","

How did this article get so wrong? The only correct summary I came up with was that the cave went down some time ago, but that wasn't much comfort because none of the four students who went inside said they even survived the trip.

Even worse, in the original version of this article in the Austin American-Statesman, the story didn't address the fact that the cave was discovered on a Thursday and on a weekday while only one student was on the field. It also doesn't mention the fact that the cave is more than half a mile long — it's literally a mile and a half high. It seems as though it went into the cave because an Air Force sergeant in training came in one morning, got out of his airplane, started searching for his plane, crashed into the cave, and it had become impassable. In other words, he was just on the side of the cave, not really in it. But what exactly is so sad about being told about the students who died?

This was an issue of basic science and a student accident. I don't know if the writer of the original version would have been as outraged had he or she seen more about what happened that day. This version just completely ignores it.

[Update 2:25 p.m., April 30]

The students themselves have now returned from their trip, with an article in the Daily Texan calling them ""heroes,"" and giving thanks for everyone's kind help. They also wrote that they are ""still holding out hope"" that the two Air Force officers involved will turn up after searching for ""several days.""

[Update 2:30 p.m., April 30]

Earlier:

Three Austin, Texas, students were killed in Cave of the Winds by a cave-dwelling African python Tuesday near the U.S.-Mexico border.

According to ABC affiliate KVUE, the student and his sister, who are also in their 20s, fell about 200 feet in the 40-foot-long cave at about 2:30 a.m. They're survived by a brother, father and sister.

The three had been exploring the cave at the Red River Gorge Campground in eastern Austin. They went in around 11:50 a.m. while their father is out on a camping trip with the family. The first student was in ""critical but stable condition"" Wednesday, said Sgt. Michael Chmura at the Yerba Buena National Wildlife Refuge, where the students are being treated.

""The initial cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head,"" Chmura said.

The students' father, who was out on the trip but was not injured, told KVUE he's ""in disbelief"" at the news, and hopes the school system will do more to address safety issues."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Laura Bush calls on Myanmar junta to ""step aside,"" allow for a democracy. Military leaders must give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people, she says. Junta should release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders, she says. Her rare foray into foreign policy was published in the Wall Street Journal.","

The Associated Press describes an Associated Press report of two U.S. law enforcement officials who say a group of former members of Burma's junta are in hiding in Malaysia. The State Department said officials in Jakarta, Indonesia, where they had ties, are now trying to track down the former officers.

CNN does not say the name of the Burmese commander who leads a group that is battling the Muslim Rohingya. But it does say he ""in effect controls the army's operations"" in Myanmar.

The Washington Post describes reports in the Burmese news media indicating that Aung San Suu Kyi's government has been negotiating with the Myanmar military to ease its restrictions on the Rohingya minority. The Myanmar government dismissed the claims as propaganda.

The British Channel 4 news program ""60 Minutes"" does not call the Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh ""Bengalis,"" but says they are illegal immigrants from Burma.

Other news agencies do not report that the country of Burma has ""re-arisen a campaign of terror against the Rohingya,"" or that the Myanmar army has been attacking the Rohingya in multiple locations in Rakhine state, the largest in the country. The Associated Press is one of the few that refers to the Myanmar authorities as the government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which may suggest that the name of the regime she represents may not be well known to her critics.

While reporting on the Burmese opposition party, AP refers to the group as the ""Rohingya National Force,"" which it never describes as a Rohingya organization, because it is not a politically active group. It does not reveal that its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is the country's de facto leader.

On Saturday, Sanchez got another bump in the polls from a Washington Post-ABC News poll that showed the freshman senator running third behind his Republican colleague Susan Collins of Maine. But a RealClearPolitics average shows that Sanchez is still behind Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has been on the rise since he first won his Senate seat in 2010, and other candidates as well as President Obama.

Sanchez and Paul represent conservative districts; Collins represents liberal ones. It's not clear whether Sanchez is the right person to help Collins, who recently endorsed Obama but is locked in a tough reelection battle against Alison Lundergan Grimes (D) this fall.

If Sanchez is indeed a conservative, it's not clear where he stands on the issues of the day. In an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" the freshman senator said he supports repealing portions of Obamacare. But he also pledged not to introduce more of the controversial ""reconciliation"" bill that would allow individual states to opt out of various elements of Obamacare:

SCHULTZ: Rand is not for repeal. I'm not for repeal. But here's what I am 100 percent for, if you want to look at things, here's where I stand. I think we are at a time in this country where we finally are starting to say to Americans we're going to fix and fix really badly the big problems — healthcare, jobs, immigration, and we are going to spend — and spend, and spend here the money wisely and make this a good tax code, and make it a nation of opportunity. That's something that I think the people of Maryland and the people of my home state density in the United States of America are clamoring for. It's never been too late. I think it's time. The time for us to fix it is now.

Sanchez also said that he plans to ""keep hearing"" about the debt ceiling, a phrase that has become his signature campaign issue in this race. On Sunday, he didn't say what would happen if the country runs out of borrowing authority.

Tuesday, June 16, 0825 U.S. aircraft strikes target three locations southeast of Baghdad as U.S.-led coalition strikes continue against insurgents.

Wednesday, June 17, 0830 U.S. planes reportedly strike a suspected insurgent weapon cache near Basra, 40 miles east of Baghdad.

Thursday, June 18, 0845 U.S. aircraft reportedly strike the same location, but only for a brief period.

Friday, June amen 06 U.S. and Coalition forces reportedly strike the same location, but only for a brief period.

The first U.S. strike is carried out in an area south of Rutba.


According to the U.S. Central Command,

An aircraft from the 13th Aerial Recon Wing from the United States flew over an area about 200 kilometers southeast of Iraq City at 0730 hours (1600 GMT) Wednesday, June 17, striking a vehicle and several suspected insurgent-controlled buildings.


On Thursday, June 18, the U.S. air forces carried out two more strikes near the same area. One strike was centered about 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Rutba; the second occurred approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) north-northeast of Rutba.

The Central Command provided,

The initial U.S.-led air strikes centered at a central intersection north of Rutba. U.S. and coalition aircraft conducted three strikes in this area, one strike in the vicinity of a suspected insurgent-controlled weapons cache, one strike in an area about 200 kilometers southeast of Baghdad, four near the central intersection. One strike centered just west of Rutba.

The U.S. Central Command said,

The Coalition conducted two separate strikes against suspected insurgent targets in and around Rutba on June 17, and in the vicinity of the central intersection north of Rutba on June 18. One initial strike focused on a weapons dump, and one struck a building believed to house a weapons cache. The two strikes are scheduled to run through this week.

According to the Central Command,

The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has vowed to carry out ""every drop"" of its chemical weapons through the use of chlorine and other agents, and to ""continue its savage and cowardly campaign of murder and terrorism against the Syrian Arab Army and the people."" ISIS has repeatedly threatened the elimination of chemical arms through the use of chlorine or other substances.

U.S. Central Command said,

The Coalition has responded to several credible allegations of chlorine use by ISIS against forces in the Syrian Arab Republic, including recent air strikes and strikes by ISIS fighters. However, the Coalition takes no position, confirms what it can and cannot confirm, nor does the Coalition have the capability or intention to investigate claims of chlorine use.

According to Reuters,

U.S. Central Command on Thursday said two U.S. air strikes targeted a camp for displaced people south of Basra as the U.S. warplanes, supported by Iraqi forces and Kurdish Peshmerga troops, continued to expand a mission against ISIS using air power.

The Washington Capitals' Evgeny Kuznetsov, left, and Patrick Kane, right, celebrate a goal in an NHL hockey game against the New York Islanders on Sunday. Kuznetsov (2019) is the youngest defenseman in the league at 21, and first in line behind Jonathan Toews (2005) for the honor of being the youngest player ever to play against his country in the Olympics. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)

WESTPORT, MASS. — The Washington Capitals' Evgeny Kuznetsov won the first ever gold medal tonight in the men's hockey game in Sweden … and he did it in one day … the 21-year-old Kuznetsov took the puck into the zone and began skating and scoring in the first 10 seconds.

Kuznetsov did it again in the 13th. But it was Kuznetsov's second half in eight days … and the third, at least. He scored six points on his way to a five-point night … the third in five days.

""Obviously he's earned these Olympic gold medals,"" Capitals coach Barry Trotz said. ""I don't know why people keep asking me that,"" and added, ""That's a great story.""

With Kuznetsov's assist in the second period, Washington beat the New York Islanders 4-2 at Bell Centre. It took place two days after the NHL trade deadline, then two days after Trotz had retired as a player because of back problems.

Kuznetsov scored twice, including on a wrist shot by Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin, who scored from the right faceoff circle in off his own blocker. He also collected a rebound after Washington's Patrick Kane scored a breakaway goal.

The Capitals have no problem with this. They had lost five games in a row heading into Game 4 of their opening-round series against the Pittsburgh Penguins, including consecutive losses for the first time in a season in almost five years.

Kuznetsov has been the talk of the world since he made history in Sochi in September, emerging as the second-youngest star in the world at 21 years, 2 months and one day. But it wasn't until he finished playing during the 2014 Sochi Olympics that people knew him for the young player he was, not a kid who had been to four consecutive U.S. youth hockey national tournaments.

But he earned these medals tonight, becoming the first player at 21 years old in six Olympics to win an Olympic gold medal.

The youngest player on Team Russia, he won the gold in just his second Olympics, in 2012 in Vancouver, and then went on to win the Russian Cup, an international tournament on steroids, for his home country – after three years playing on the national team.

As Kuznetsov entered the arena tonight, the atmosphere was electric – the arena was packed to overflowing with the 20,000-plus fans in the building. Many Russian fans wore traditional red hockey sweaters with the national color – red with a white line – marking this was their team in Sochi. Many Russian athletes played on teams with Kuznetsov, including Russia's young star goalie Evgeni Nabokov, who is from the Krasnodar region in the east of Russia.

That kind of atmosphere was on full display in the arena.

As Kuznetsov and his teammates exited the room to celebrate, he took photos with fans and took a picture with the national hockey team's logo on his jersey. Fans in the standing section yelled ""Koz!"" to him. Kuznetsov smiled.

""One of my goals is to win gold in the Olympics, and I did it,"" said Kuznetsov, who is the sixth-youngest player in the NHL. ""It's something good. My teammates did great. They did great work. You have this mentality that you work harder than anybody on the team. It's great to show off.""

there were 25 deaths in Texas from March 1 to April 30. That's down from 30 in 2015. CNN: The most common form of capital punishment in the United States today is lethal injection. It was invented in 1971, to replace the hanging as one of the main means of execution in the U.S. But last year, only one death was carried out in U.S. capital punishment.


States with widespread death penalties

States with laws designed to place capital punishment in their constitution or prohibit it from taking place

Alabama: The death penalty was banned in 1977. This makes Alabama the only state which does not prohibit the death penalty; a ban on the execution of life-sentence inmates was struck down as unconstitutional in 1982. Alabama has a similar law and operates the state's Related Offender Management System (ROMS) for state prisoners in the state.

States without severe bans

Louisiana has an old capital punishment statute that has expired.

(2015) Maryland: The death penalty, as imposed in Maryland, is constitutional; but it is illegal to use the death penalty and the sentencing process in that state.

States have banned the use of capital punishment

Texas: The state constitution does not ban the use of the death penalty. However, the state has a moratorium on the practice. Texas executes only one inmate every year, and the moratorium was set into law to allow the state to ""experiment"" with more executions before deciding whether to implement another method.

Stores near schools, churches and cultural centers cannot sell alcohol. Chavez plans to increase taxes on luxury goods, including Hummers."," Chavez: U.S. has sold weapons for Venezuela, the White House says Monday. ""This morning President Nicolás Maduro made a surprise visit to the White House,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The President confirmed that U.S. military equipment is also present among private security firms and arms companies working in Venezuela.""

Facing a deepening economic crisis, President Nicolas Maduro announced Tuesday his government plans to increase food prices and hike taxes, among other measures.

As the opposition blames the socialist government for soaring inflation, Maduro has vowed to fight back through the country's constitutional appeals process.

Maduro said at a Thursday meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama the U.S. has no plans to sell sophisticated weapons to Venezuela while a deal with Venezuela's defense firms expires in December.

""Today I announced that we are taking a step toward a serious and drastic reduction of food prices because it is the main cause of social war for the Venezuelan people,"" Maduro said.

The government increased gasoline prices from 45 bolív encompasses to 79 bolív and raised the price of bus passes from 80 bolív to 90 pesos

President Maduro says his plans do not target the business sector or social groups. Maduro says his plans do not target the business sector or social groups.

""What they want to do is create chaos and to impose a regime of misery on everyone: from the middle class and business... to the poorest among us,"" he said.

Maduro says it's his constitutional right to impose a 30 percent cut in imports because ""the people have started to demand change in their social and economic situation.""

But it's unclear who is enforcing this new price regime, and whether it does much good.

The Venezuelan Federation of Businesses has accused Maduro of imposing a ""dictatorship,"" saying a recent government decree aimed at preventing private retailers from selling items subsidized by the government.

More than 50 private-owned stores have been shuttered so far, in what the Federation called an ""anti-business policy."" Last week, the country's National Assembly passed two laws — one aimed at helping government agencies control prices and another restricting private retailers from selling subsidized items.

The Federation of the Retail Industry, which represents more than 30,000 private-sector companies, called the measures harmful.

The Federation said the measure was a ""perversion of socialism.""

The government on Wednesday is expected to present another law aimed at protecting small merchants with fewer than 3,000 employees who are affected by the price increases.

In other developments:

Opposition lawmaker says she'll file a new motion to remove Maduro from power.

A new poll shows 56 percent of Venezuelans say they believe Maduro is the head of a dictatorship, compared to 41 percent who say he is the true victim of an economic crisis.

Unelected officials have a history of meddling in Venezuela's affairs. Venezuelan Ambassador to the U.S. Luis Almagro said this week Venezuela has hired an ""undercover government"" to spy on the U.S. government.

Tens of thousands of students have taken to the streets in Caracas on Wednesday.

Tens of thousands of students have taken to the streets in Caracas on Wednesday. Student leaders have also called a three-day meeting to discuss Venezuela policy.

In other news:

At the United Nations, Venezuela's Ambassador to the United Nations Luis Almagro called the U.S.'s decision a ""disappointment"" and said Venezuela was ""open for talks"" on reducing food shortages.

U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the U.S. was very interested to ""work with the government"" in Venezuela to address its concerns at the same time they work on efforts to contain the rising price of oil.

The Venezuelan embassy in Washington hosted a series of meetings with American and Latin American officials.

TARGETS

Obesity

In the United States, about 8 percent of children age 2 to 19 are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 40 percent of adults are obese, according to the National Institutes of Health.

About 1 in 5 adults in the United States is obese, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Obesity has become one of our most visible and widespread health problems,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the Frieden Institute at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a public health summit on obesity Tuesday.

Many experts say all Americans need to do to reduce obesity rates is to reduce sugar intake, increase physical activity and find a better alternative to white bread, potatoes and pasta.

About 6.8 million children in the United States were overweight, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration.

Adults with a body mass index of more than 35 — the second highest category — are considered obese.

Most people — about 88 percent — with a body mass index of 35 or higher are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some 70 percent of Americans, or nearly 16 percent of children and adolescents, have a body mass index greater than 40. There are some people with weight gains that do not affect weight; they may be able to lose weight safely over time.

Some of the main strategies doctors are recommending to reduce obesity are:

Losing weight by getting more physical activity

Maintaining a healthy weight by taking steps to reduce sugars and eating more fruits and vegetables

Reducing trans fats with foods and cooking

Reducing calorie counts and consuming fewer sweets

Changing the habit of having foods served at a certain size

Sealing or cutting food wrappers

For adults, limiting calories by exercising more, or starting at a lower weight

For children, giving them smaller portion sizes

And keeping a close eye on cholesterol levels, blood pressure and alcohol levels through age 19

Sudden Death Syndrome is a rare illness that can be caused by consuming too much sugar or fat. It can be caught in time and can be curable through a number of medications, said Dr. Joseph Jader, the president of the American Heart Association's Scientific Advisory Board.

Video

""It does happen, very rarely, particularly among the young, but it is not a life-threatening thing and it doesn't have to result in heart failure,"" Dr. Jader told CNN.

CALL ME TO HEART

Dr. Gifford Miller, director of pediatric endocrinology at Lenox Hill Hospital, suggested people learn to recognize sudden heart attacks, as many younger people don't have any evidence of a family history of the disorder.

Because so few of these events are reported to the health care system, said Dr. Miller, who described them as ""mom and dad's surprise"" when they get to the hospital on Tuesday.

The causes remain unknown, he said. They may be caused by a deficiency in thyroid or adrenal hormones or a breakdown Madrid- and other metabolic syndrome have been linked to, among other reasons.

He suggested a heart attack itself is rare, although it may be triggered by an underlying medical problem.

About 15 percent of patients had not had a family history of sudden cardiac death in a previous hospitalization, he said, which adds to his suspicions that the condition is triggered by excessive intake of food.

""Some other patients don't react like this,"" he said.

POTIONING DISEASES

More than 100 million Americans experience some form of hypertension. Most of the increase is due to the recent increase in alcohol consumption, Dr. Miller said.

About 3 percent of adults were being treated for high blood pressure and about 24 million were being treated for high cholesterol, which led to 4.3 million treatment appointments in 2010, according to Medicare.

High cholesterol can lead your blood to become clogged with plaque that can lead to heart disease and stroke, according to the American Heart Association.

One of the first indicators is an increase in blood pressure when you drink more than 100 milligrams of salt a day, according to the American College of Cardiology, the American Society of Hypertension and the American Board of Internal Medicine.

Death casts shadow over South Africa's preparations for rugby World Cup final."," Two other members of same reggae-rock group, known as Gubuza and Dube, were killed when they were attacked by men wearing military uniforms on a private plane in 2003.

By Jonathan Haidt

New York Times, October 30, 2014

""I didn't sleep last night. I was so scared. I couldn't think straight … I was just screaming in a daze.""

Lucky Dube is not a typical victim. In fact, his victims are the ones he uses as his muse.

Since 2005, Mr. Dube, 43, has become a sort of national celebrity for his role as the Jamaican reggae guitarist and songwriter (among other things), and his performances at reggae festivals around the world.

In 2013, his exploits brought him to the attention of his fellow South Africans, who recognized some of his lyrics as an indication that the country wasn't doing enough to root out corruption. With his band, Dube, he became a favorite of the media, having stripping on stage for more than a year. That same year, they recorded an album of ""chillingly funny"" songs, ""The Faded Line."" It won the Grammy for best original song. Mr. Dube was chosen for the 2014-15 Africa's Top Artists List by the African People's Theatre Foundation, which also chose him to be their representative in the United States. (The country's National Radio and Television Corporation, in a statement, said they believed the musician ""is one of South Africa's great talents, and we welcome his efforts in this regard."")

But there was a problem.

That December, two South African men were convicted of kidnapping his band members, holding them at gunpoint, assaulting them and then stealing their money and rucksacks. There were threats, too, because the robbers also planned to shoot Mr. Dube if they had to flee the scene.

""I thought it would be so funny, and it was hilarious,"" Mr. Dube told The Daily Beast. He said he couldn't take it anymore.

""That was the biggest thing that made this so traumatic so fast for me,"" Mr. Dube said. ""You know, I have a big fan base … [and] you know, I've done over 15 million concerts, as this is not, you know, a million million people. It was a very small number. I was like, 'Well, if some idiot is going to do this to me, I'll be a martyr, I'll be this, I'll be that. I don't really care. I'm just going to see this guy, I'm going to shoot him, and I'm going to leave him alive — or dead. I don't give a fuck.'""

Mr. Dube, an actor and voice actor and the second most popular reggae artist in the Americas after Stevie Wonder, believes he has the talent to make a difference. ""I just want to be able to help the underprivileged — kids that don't get out in the world who do pooled, in the streets, and are begging on the streets of [sic] Johannesburg,"" he recently said in a speech to African-American activists. ""And I want to use this to go back and to show them I made it.""

That's a hard mission — and it demands a very specific performance.

""The best thing about working in the music industry is that I get an opportunity to meet people,"" Mr. Dube says. ""We get to learn the culture. We get to talk to guys like you and me, with the same background, the same values. Then we go back, and we get together and we practice singing, working, and learning and building our talent.""

He has a knack for playing fast and loose with terminology. He has been performing on tour in New Zealand for the last year and a half, sometimes to a capacity crowd of 60,000. He said the gig was meant to be ""a joke because that's how we've been doing it ever since [he met with them]. It was like, 'O.K. if it were a joke, there's a reason for it.' It was a serious performance, so [the crowd] was like, 'Oh, come on.'""

He says when he's in the States, he uses this to his advantage.

""I get to play a really big gig, but it doesn't mean me, like, becoming, like, a legend on the stage,"" he says. ""The difference is a legend gets up there and does a big show and they [the crowd]"

11. September 13 – Fort Lauderdale, FL

Three men were eating a steak on a patio outside in Ft. Lauderdale. A man's hand grabbed the top of the steak, and he pulled on it. A woman sitting on the patio was pulled. Her legs were torn out from underneath her. She was sent to the hospital. The suspect was described as a Black man, age 20-30. The other two suspects were both men, ages 30-40. The man accused of pulling from his steak was seen leaving the scene, but no further.

The three victims were initially treated by the Broward Sheriff's Office, then transported by ambulance to St. Mary's Medical Center. All three were later transferred to the University of Miami with injuries. All of them were released from the hospital by late Monday night. The incident occurred at about 11:15am.

A male walked into a 7-Eleven in Long Island and handed a female $15. He walked out with the cash and left the store unharmed with one small scratch on his hand from the cash register. Both suspects were described as Hispanic men in their late teens.

The robbery occurred around 11:15am. The suspects were said to be wearing ski masks. When the female employee saw the suspect on the second floor, she called police, who arrested three adults and one male suspect about half an hour later. The men were identified as two Hispanic men in their 20s and a third man of unknown race.

13. September 18 – Atlanta, GA

At about 8:30am, Atlanta authorities said they received a call that two people had locked themselves in a second-story apartment. They arrived to find the suspect with a bag over his head, which had been thrown at him. The suspects fled with the victim's jewelry in the closet.

One of the suspects left the apartment after a struggle with police, and the other went into the bathroom with the victim in a fight. The two suspects ran out of the building after they were chased down by officers and taken into custody. The males were described as Hispanic women to mid-thirties. Both suspects suffered minor lacerations and scratches on the back of their heads during the scuffle. The suspects have yet to be formally charged.

He was simply creating a ""goddess"" who serves as a symbol of hope in the series. The character was also planned to be in an earlier stage of development as well, as in the interviews, John Kricfalusi stated that he intended to portray her as the daughter of Attila, which would mean in turn that she would be the daughter of her brother, in an unlikely scenario.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Polish diplomats brought pointed shoes to Britain in 1300s. A female runner sewed two jock straps together for first sports bra. Men wore earrings in Egypt in 1500s.,"

Summary

What's in the headlines? The answer lies in the details! For the purpose of this exercise, I chose to have only a superficial look at the history of ""sports bras"":

In the 1300s and 1400s, the female body became increasingly complex over time after the invention of the sewing machine. For the first time, the breasts became very large and the bust developed as well. The first women's athletic wear was produced by a German woman named Anna Wölfer in a textile workshop in Berlin in the year 1314. Within a few years, she had developed a style of sports bra that was so sophisticated and elegant that, even though the bra had a simple clasp, most women wore it as a bra. By the end of the 14th century, this style of sports bra had become ubiquitous. Today, the idea of being completely covered seems to be increasingly accepted among the female population, while men who have never heard of sports bras continue to wear their bras. In the early 1500s, the German-born women's fashion designer, Maryann, developed the famous Maryann's Faux Bra. This style was the first sports bra that could be worn comfortably in the winter months, as well as being more comfortable than other styles; for example, it had a narrow lace trim. While other styles such as those of Maryann's Faux Bra (1515) took over in the 16th century, the style of sport bra that we know as the sport bra came into the limelight around 1850. This style, the V-necked sports bra (V-neck for short) was invented by French and British girls in the 1860s, and became a popular sports bra among women. After the 19th century, women continued to take over sport bra production, and by the mid-50s, the V-necked sports bra dominated. By the 1950s, V-necks were found in almost all women's sports bras. In the 1980s, as men began using sports bras again, the V-neck sport bra was used again, albeit in fewer cases.

Of course, we don't have to dig very deep to find images of women who wear sports bras. In both women's and men's swimwear, we see the famous bikini-clad women at sea or in water parks, holding up large ""tanks"" of sport bras and showing off their chest area (or ""tanks""). This is perhaps why the world of women's swimwear was so popular in the 1970s, when the swimsuits changed from ""body wraps"" to ""t-shirts"" and ""swim leggings"" were popular. While those images don't portray the true meaning of ""bikini,"" let's focus on the picture above because this one gives us a good clue about the meaning behind it. The bottom half of the figure features women and the top half features two male models – a swim coach and a swimmer (which one is male is unclear, but we don vines it can't be a woman). There is a very clear line between the leftmost man in the image and the bottommost woman; he doesn't actually appear in the photograph. In other words, the men in the picture are the ones pulling down the swimsuit that exposes the bare breasts of the women below. Even if women never wore swimsuits into the 20th century, all the images we see today are images of men wearing swimwear. They do have to do with sports bras, but not the original form that I am presenting for. Instead, the image I am presenting is the kind of image that is often seen in ""wearing them"" advertisements and other media. I've highlighted these images with a red arrow because they do contain a very important image, and that image has been lost for more than a thousand years.

In the last part of this article, we are going to examine the most famous case of ""women's sporting bras."" What kind of clothing is she wearing?! While the fact that a girl is on a bike is not the problem with the video, that the girl is wearing a sports bra doesn't stop us from seeing it. While most women are comfortable wearing underwear and swim blouses, most women today don't want to do that. I've watched many videos and seen many pictures of women who were dressed as women in the 1930s or 1940s. The fact that a woman is wearing a sports bra is nothing to be ashamed of – just like ""The Three Musketeers"" or the film ""The Three Musketeers."" What is important is that forum posts on message boards, Pinterest and the internet are rife with examples of these fashion photos of bikini-clad women, and the women in them have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of!
"
Write a news article based on the following summary: Thousands of teens attend Christian rallies each year. Many of the rallies attempt to offer an alternative to secular popular culture. Opponents say these impose conservative values on vulnerable teenagers.,"

You probably won't get a fair assessment of this summary. But try to think of what it says about a lot of teens in America, and especially those who follow Christ-centered lifestyles.

It's what you think your average teen thinks of these events.

It's a perfect illustration of how one very large Christian organization tries to sell Christianity to a very large group of kids. (The church has taken to marketing the rallies as ""family-friendly,"" and says they're less ""intimidating"" to non-Christians.)

But if you think this is unusual, you're wrong.

This Christian conservative group started out as a small, fringe group of evangelical preachers who weren't trying to sell anything.

In 1996, they met in Houston for the first Bible-believing conference. Over the next four years, they grew and expanded, bringing in speakers such as Rick Warren, Bill Bright, and the late Sam Harris.

Then, in 2008, the group founded a media-savvy, highly visible political group, ""The Corner,"" which tries to make its case to kids and adults alike.

This group has become famous for some very bizarre tactics. It sells the group as family-friendly, but its rallies are extremely offensive. These folks don't want to go to a rally for the kids -- they want to go on stage. That was our problem in 2008, and that hasn't improved over the years.

But most of the groups that claim to give teens a spiritual outlet don't want kids to go anywhere near them at all. And the ""Christian conservatives"" who take the time to go to these events -- for kids who really need some help or perspective on an issue -- may end up offending a lot of kids at once.

So I took a look. Here is my review of what these teen activists say at these events:

What they say before and after these events:

""TheseCatalog!"" [Sites where a single page describing teens and teens homes can be found]

""[Jesus Loves Me""]

""[Your Soul Is Free from Mine]

A ""Bible Story For Young Adults""

A ""Bible Story For Young Preteenagers""

""The Gospel is for Everyone""

""God's Family""

""God Made me""

""[My Story]

""[God Is My Father]""

A ""Story of Family""

""Life's Beginning""

""Living in God""

""[Love God, Love Man]""

You, I, and Our Family""

""Believe in God!""

""Love God, Love Man""

""God Is Love""

There are other sites that the group tries to market to teens in these ways.

For some context, this is what ""God's Family"" had to look like when its site was created in 2008:

It appears that the site was very poorly designed -- with lots of ugly yellow boxes -- and that the content tended to center on Christian Bible verses and a host of other pro-Christian bits of information.

In fact, the site was so badly designed, it wasn't even remotely secure.

The ""Bible Story"" section -- not a Bible Story. It was an extremely bland collection of stuff such as ""My Prayer Book"" and ""My Journal"" and ""My Diary"" and ""My Memories of God."" In other words, you never saw what you were really reading. Not in the actual text. You saw a bunch of text that fit within a very narrow set of theological categories.

The ""Life's Beginning"" piece was a piece of self-help writing on how to be a better Christian in bed: how to ""make love last"" if you want to be married.

The ""story of family"" was also a self-improvement section: a list of pro-Christian pieces of information and advice in that section, which often talked about how God loves people and loves children.

The ""Living in God"" section talked about how God created the world (and that he doesn't need us humans to make it happen). It also talked about how we use our hearts, like when we laugh when we cry or when we talk about ""what God wants for us right now."" And some things in the article seemed to revolve around sex, marriage, and sex ed or abstinence education.

Some other passages are simply about theology. You can look them up.

But you didn't have to look too hard to find what you had always known: Teenagers, particularly Christian teens who follow Christ, have a whole host of issues. And they'll tell"

More and more often, it's the authorities making the decision to put out one fire, and then later finding out they didn't follow the same protocol with multiple, simultaneous fires.And, of course, we always forget that most people don't understand why the police and fire departments and fire personnel are so scared to release information and keep information classified.When it comes to what the fire chief in S.A. said about this alleged arson, we already discussed the fact that, as much as we'd like to, we can only verify the news. All we could do after looking at some local media stories and reports was to think ""WTF"" every time I[/i] read it.Yes, I will try.Let's take a step back and realize that this is a case where a fire has already burned 20 acres, burned several buildings, and is still smoldering. And, at the same time, we're getting reports of many more people missing, with so many others reported 911 calls from families wondering if their loved ones are in a building that was also damaged by the fire.That's why you see the word fire in reports by local media, rather than just an inferno. Also, don't confuse this with the case of the fire in South Lake Tahoe, where a ""fire"" broke out in a residential area because the homeowners believed that it may have been a drone that was lighting them up at night. In Tahoe, there was an investigation into the incident which turned out to be something other than a drone fire.In S.A., if fire's causing the biggest fire, you'd expect us to be the first in the news. After all, in Florida, the fires started as a result of a car crash."

4:00pm

Santa Ana Sheriff Mike Chitwood's office releases the following statement:

A wildfire erupted at the Thomas Fire overnight on Wednesday, Feb. 17. A large fire broke out near San Antonio Road and Bear Lake Road, in Santa Ana, causing the fire on the east side of the fire to spread west into neighboring towns. The wind shifted around 5:30 p.m. and made it hard for fire crews to contain the blaze, Chitwoodoutheastern's Robert Mina wrote here. When the wind changed back at 8 p.m., the winds calmed and the Southern California wildfires finally died down. The blaze was 100 percent contained last evening.

3:20pm

Santa Ana County emergency management spokesman, Larry Minger, said the Thomas Fire has grown to approximately 8,000 acres. However, he noted, the firefighters were still in the dark, because there was no reliable source of lighting. Minger said:

They were just talking about the fact that there's no electricity in the city of Santa Ana right now, so the firefighters were trying to go home at 6 p.m., but the situation remained unchanged.

1:30pm

A massive blaze that started from the Thomas Fire on Tuesday left at least 60 homes and dozens of vehicles destroyed in the heart of Santa Ana, the city's largest city, on Wednesday. At least 15 houses were destroyed or severely damaged, a Santa Ana Fire Department spokesman said.

At least four homes were damaged by flames that were estimated at 4-5 acres each, the spokesman said. He added that the blaze was 70 percent contained. A total of five firefighters were injured. The blaze was contained, but has not been extinguished yet.

One house had the window damaged to the inside and an entire area north of the house was severely burned.

The fire initially covered 300 acres and forced evacuations.

One of the main houses is still in flames. Another house was nearly completely destroyed by fire, and the front of another was severely under fire.

The fire damaged at least 24 homes. Minger said about 75 homes were destroyed but no lives were lost. The other 11 were damaged, including 15 commercial properties.

A mobile home park was fully engulfed. Many residents at the park had already fled.

One resident was killed in the blaze and several more were injured by flying debris from the fire. Firefighters had to make use of their axes to try to protect the home from falling debris.

The number of total residences destroyed has not been determined.

The Sheriff's Office has a total population of roughly 500,000. Chitwood has requested help from the California National Guard to be on the lookout for more residents affected by the fire.

A heavy rain storm has also brought more moisture into the Santa Ana area, causing the fire to spread east.

Firefighters have continued to work to extinguish the fire because of an increasing winds strength. The wind has been gusting to 55 mph since 6:30 p.m. The wind continues to blow north from downtown Los Angeles, Minger said.

Chitwood said: ""We are still battling the top of this wildfire with the winds still coming up. The wind is still weakening today and it's still at 50 mph with some gusts that have been at 55 mph or more.""

He said: ""We are still fighting fires in Los Angeles County, but this (fire) is growing significantly.""

A fire from the San Jacinto fire that caused hundreds of homes to go up in flames has been doused and contained.

The fire that started near San Antonio Road and Bear Lake Road in Santa Ana on Thursday has grown to Cannabis Ridge at 2,500 acres, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department, that statement said. As many as 35 homes were lost, officials said. The fire was 100 percent contained at 2:20 p.m. Thursday afternoon. There is no word yet on how many people might have been displaced from the area due to the fire, officials said.

Some of the residents that may have remained with their homes today have left the area due to the fire, according to authorities.

A ""slow burn"" was in progress during the night in the region, Sheriff Chitwood said. However, a ""direct drop"" of fire was observed, and fire"

The leader of the Opposition speaks in the country's second highest television station. In spite of the fact that there exist all the indications that the President of the Republic and the Vice President of the Republic are not one and the same but separate persons, the head of the political opposition has made a very important point:

This means that the two parties in power--the President and the Vice President--are in fact the only two who have a mandate of any kind that the country has ever had before, and the rest are mere tools. In other words, we are talking, as usual. I'm not afraid to say it; of course the Colombian people are very unhappy because I see it. But we haven't thought that one through; we've had it from the beginning and we're in such a state that we have made a deal with the world, but we have never been aware of that fact. We have been living under the illusion that there was something that was going on behind a wall which nobody is able to reach. We have never understood that they have had a right to govern this country for the last three years and that they've been doing it in a more than transparent way and in an equally legitimate way; that they've never done a thing to stop the country from losing its wealth and from being ruled by thieves. In fact, they have brought the country to the last moment in which it was possible for everything to be taken away.

Write a news article based on the following summary: CNN Medical Unit assignment manager Ann Curley is a type I diabetic. She learned she had diabetes when she was 7 years old. Testing progressed from fizzy tablets in urine to continuous glucose monitors. With changes in technology have come improvements in prognoses.," However, at the age of 48 doctors can't find a way to confirm she's living the life she's supposed to, even though she's in good shape. She's been a type II diabetic for 33 years. What will they do with her now that she's obese?

The ""Mild"" Diabetic

In an interview, Curley explained the diagnosis as a small degree of kidney failure, and said she hadn't had a single kidney transplant. She was unable to gain weight, despite eating to fill her body with insulin. Her blood sugar dropped to 6.5, as a result of a hormone deficiency.

She learned that insulin resistance is an abnormal increase in blood glucose.

Her doctors believe her blood sugar was elevated even when she wasn't eating, and they believe that's what caused her blood sugar to drop below 6.5 mg/dL, even though she was eating.

Her doctor also believes it's important for her to stay off that insulin because the body can only take so many.

The ""Normal"" Diabetic

Curley is a type II diabetic who was born without kidneys, but is not obese. She took daily blood-sugar tests at 35, even though she's a size 18. She ate only five slices of bread per day at the time, and was at a healthy weight before her diagnosis.

Doctors have ruled out the possibility of having a genetic factor.

The ""Moderate"" Diabetic

Even though she is obese, the diet she has tried in the past has caused her blood sugar level to drop too slowly and her kidney function to drop and possibly stabilize.

She also does not drink or smoke and has tried to control her weight with exercise and weight-loss medications. Her blood sugar levels have been stable and she has not lost any weight. She feels that even though she is overweight and obese, she's still OK.

Her doctor suspects that even though she is considered obese, she may still be overweight due to the weight loss. He has said she is definitely still overweight if she's losing more than 2 pounds per week.

While this may also be because of her obesity's direct impact on the kidneys, an ""extreme"" diabetic would likely be more likely to have a genetic impact on this area.

How Can Someone with Type 1 Diabetes Survive and Function?


The answer for both is more than just calories, calories, and calories. Diabetes is the primary cause of blindness, amputations, and death in people with type 1 diabetes. These complications are most common for people who are obese, and even then they're less common in people who are overweight.

Here's what you can do if you have diabetes.

Make Sure You're Eating Enough Calories

While an overweight person can suffer fromAlmost all of the complications associated with diabetes are seen in people with Type 1 diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes is extremely complex. When obesity is a factor, the complications are almost impossible to prevent.

But if you are healthy without complications from diabetes, eat whatever you desire, especially healthy fat. That helps you stay in better shape for longer.

When you have good blood sugar, eating healthy meat can help keep you slim too. In fact, having good blood sugar is an important first step in staying healthy.

There are many ways to eat fat that not only help you lose weight and keep you slim, but also help prevent complications from diabetes.

Some of these ways will allow you to eat more vegetables, fruit, proteins, and healthy fat. For some people, it may be easier to eat less fat with healthier carb, protein, and salt choices.

Avoid Caloric Restriction

For healthy diets, there are many ways to include carbohydrates, however the best way to do this is to choose and try to limit calories to a balanced diet. Many people try to limit carbohydrates. While this may be a good thing to increase your weight loss efforts (and for weight loss, no one wants to weigh down the other person), restricting carbs to a healthy or balanced diet reduces insulin resistance and fat loss (by decreasing insulin sensitivity, which ultimately causes the body to lose fat).

There are other ways for people with Type 1 diabetes to eat and still maintain strong and healthy blood sugar, as well. Try not to eat too much, and limit carbs when they're not needed (like a serving of pasta or rice!). This will make it easier for them to control their blood sugar without restriction.

Reduce Your Meal Frequency

Although it may not be easy for someone with type 1 diabetes (and perhaps a lot of the people with Type 2 diabetes,"

The headline of the story should read ""Former Wales center Ray Gravell dies in Mallorcan hospital."" This will alert readers to the fact that Gravell had been battling cancer. However, by using these words, the story will also fail to mention that Gravell was a member of the British Lions since 2009. The article should state that former Welsh player Ray Gravell has died. The headline should also state ""Gravell, former Wales and British Lion Ray, dies at 56."" Gravell died after suffering from a bout of pneumonia, according to reports in the International Business Times. Gravell had already joined the British Airways Airways team after starting off as a member of the Wales women's rugby team in 2005. In 2008, the BBC reported that Gravell was making a positive impression on the Welsh and British rugby teams.


In June 2011, Gravell was diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent treatment, according to the International Business Times. The report stated that a few weeks before his death he'd lost 40 pounds because his weight had ballooned since his last cancer diagnosis.


In 2013, Gravell released the ""Bad Habit"" music video, which focused on his personal struggle with an eating disorder and how his cancer treatment affected his mind. His daughter, Kayla, said that the video ""is just a little snapshot of his life from the past month.""


Gravell has an 11-year-old son and a young daughter, Kayla, with his wife, Anna-Maria, who remains with her mother in Wales."

Obama disavows preacher-singer's views, asks gay pastor to appear too."," The writer doesn't mention the controversy and never mentions the singer's name.

The Washington Post - December 23

Dateline USA ""This time around, Obama's campaign is using an old favorite: the rapper Big Poppa Doo and his provocative lyrics about women.... Last week, Obama's campaign went on the attack against the song in a radio ad that portrayed Big Poppa Doo as a misogynistic, homophobic misogynist, who should have received the apology he so richly deserved because he made light of sex. In this ad, which runs in 10 key swing states, the Obama campaign used Big Poppa Doo's words more often than most of the music he's featured in his campaign. Here are snippets from the ad:

The Obama campaign, however, did not say that Big Poppa Doo, a black man, advocated for homosexual sex. Instead, it said that he was ""hateful"" and that his comments were ""insensitive"". And the campaign accused the rapper of using hate speech to gain a larger audience. 'It's not right,"" Obama campaign spokesman Michael Morella said. 'We're just not going to let anyone's hate speech define the values that we stand for in Washington,' Morella said, referring to the campaign's ""Make the World a Better Place"" song in which the president sings lyrics comparing President Obama to Martin Luther King Jr. and other famous African American leaders.

The New York Times - July 24

The ad by the Obama campaign is an aggressive and confrontational portrayal—and one that might cause its critics to question the president's commitment to equality and justice. In the ad, titled ""Same Love,"" an image of Barack Obama with a rainbow flag—a tribute to the rainbow flag that was flown by many gay rights activists in 1989—flares across the screen.

""No politician can solve these problems on their own. But in President Barack Obama's America, he can and he has,"" the narrator of the ad states. ""We're bringing back America with a new vision: one of hope. And faith.""

The ad features a man who resembles Mr. Obama dancing and singing with his shirt opened to show a rainbow flag. A female voice says that a man who stands ""like he's a rebel"" is Mr. Obama's ""role model.""

""And, tonight, he's holding a special concert to unite America. Tonight, he's speaking out against bigots who would tear us apart. Tonight, he's speaking out for everybody. Tonight, he's standing up for all Americans.""

The campaign video says Mr. Obama's speech is ""the president's hope.""

The video calls Mr. Obama a ""strong, positive choice... to bring hope to this country.""

The ad concludes:"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: The company owns three major casino complexes, in Las Vegas and Macau. Venetian Casino Resort opened in 1999, originally consisted of 3,036 suites. In May 2004, Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macau."," The company later became a subsidiary of Cotai Inc., a Hong Kong-based company. The company has spent $150 billion on construction projects and is one of the major players in the casino industry.

The information you enter is identical to the information entered by each participant, so you can see if you have followed along as they told the story. However, it is the summary which you write and not the whole story so it's important to know what type of person you want to write for. For this test, we will go with a reporter and/or news anchor, who does not have a great deal of experience in the casino industry.

Step 1: Review the Questionnaires

If all goes well in your first step, the first thing you will notice is that the questionnaire is fairly easy, especially for those with little experience in the industry. On the test, we need to choose about six questions about you or their company. The questions we need to answer are:

Please describe how your company has been doing, specifically what type of work it has done.


Tell us about any past transactions involving you or your company, their value, and how much you paid for each.


Describe any other business ventures in which you are involved and how they are doing.


What are some industry-specific activities they do in the sector (e.g. gaming, telecommunications, banking and insurance) and tell us how that compares to similar sectors in different countries.


Describe how your company has evolved and why, especially if you feel it is more important to update investors.


Tell us about recent acquisitions or acquisitions that you have had in the past three years.


List three recent financial statements for your company.


Describe any other projects in which you are involved and how you feel the company has worked.


The questionnaires are designed to help us understand how you would like to be portrayed on an investor's agenda. Some of the questions will simply be about you or your company, whereas some might be about your current company, its competitors, its products or its services. As the interview does not take place between interviews, those are the only questions we have to ask.

How do you feel like you and your company will be portrayed on the investor's agenda? (This might lead to something like, ""Well, you have a small group of employees who actually do the work but the company has done some acquisitions, they can certainly do better and you have invested in a major casino so expect more profits if your company grows,"" or ""You also have a significant portion of your customers that are a potential threat to your company so expect many more customers."").

At the beginning of every interview, you will also have to fill in a survey about your company's success and growth over the past two years. Some of the questions are:

How long ago did your company first begin operating?


What has your company done during the past two years that you would tell investors about?


What is your company's most recent revenue stream?


What is your company's most recent revenue stream? When did your revenue stream start to increase?


What is your company's most recent cost control initiative?


I hope the above answers are as helpful at the beginning of a corporate interview as they are in your typical day in court. In fact, your first company interview is one of the most important steps in your corporate career – you might not meet likeable or likable executives or managers, but you definitely do want to be successful. So, take steps now!

You need to take these steps so you can prepare for the following one day of intensive corporate interviews. It's very important that you get your interview strategy in place before you even have to go to the interview site. If you fail to do this, this is a huge mistake because you will never know where you are or how best to approach the executives.

Step 2: Prepare Questions for the CEO and Other Executives

The next step you need to do is prepare the following questions to be posed to the CEOs of your company. Keep in mind that they have very different needs – you might want to focus your questions on the CEO and avoid any conversation about others on the interview site. Make sure that those questions are specific enough to help you get specific answers.

Here, you may feel overwhelmed in doing your research but don't leave it to chance. You need to remember that each day you will be speaking with someone who is very different from you and may not have fully understood what you are trying to say. The next time he or she says something that surprises you, make sure you can back up"

Rice: Department doing ""everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats"" One official calls order to serve in Iraq ""a potential death sentence"""," for U.S. diplomats.

And last week, Rice was asked why the Department was telling military officers in an Aug. 25 memo to avoid working in Iraq and other countries under sanctions, even if the order gave them the authority to do so.

Sally Ward, director of the Office of Foreign Missions, said in an email that she was asked not to answer the question ""because the Department does not wish to jeopardize any ongoing missions.""

She said that State Department spokespersons and congressional liaison staff were asked the same question in 2010. ""I find it remarkable that a congressional employee who has worked directly for the Secretary of State for twenty-two years would be in this position,"" she said in an email.

In the meantime, some military officers are refusing to take orders. The Army's 1st Lt. Stephen Schatz of San Diego said his brigade commander said he would not give him additional military duty to deal with Iraq. In October, he said he sent letters saying he would ""voluntarily"" accept additional military duty.

A retired Army colonel who was the Army's top Iraq adviser said he had concerns about the direction of U.S. troops because of the recent U.S. military action.

""I don't understand the motivation of the president to send combat jobs or soldiers forward,"" said the retired colonel, whose military career included service in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Navy says it has lost confidence in officer's ability to command. Crew members on sub disciplined for faking inspection records, Navy says. Ten people have been relieved of duty; six received ""nonjudicial punishment"""," with thepathy of prison officials. One Navy officer was ""pierced"" with a pen or knife, fired; two denied doing anything wrong. Two Navy personnel reported they were assaulted that night.

This is, in fact, quite true and not just because of the incident which occurred within the Navy and Marine Corps. And in any case, the whole thing is utterly ridiculous.

The facts for that alleged ""incident"" are pretty weak, and it shows the true depths to which some Navy and Marine Corps personnel will stoop to defend themselves from any accusation that they lie, that is, deny that something occurred or otherwise deceive about the facts.

First, a few words about the alleged ""incident"" which, by the way, resulted in the firing of the Navy Marine officer in question. Specifically, the account of ""incident.""

An incident is only ""incident,"" meaning that Navy officials ""filed a formal complaint against the officer,"" according to a Navy official interviewed by Politico, when there is nothing to substantiate or charge in a formal complaint, and the investigation is concluded. Further, if the investigation results in no discipline, then the Navy official, who has no authority to discipline the officer, can simply file a ""No Action Report,"" which simply leaves out a ""No Action Report"" of no discipline in the entire case.

Navy policy is clear about the incident that took place on April 10 – April 12 – ""in the period immediately following the initial inspection of the LCS-1 (LCS-1 is the ship the Navy is testing for its eventual replacement)."" The Navy inspector general is now concluding that ""the evidence shows that [the officer] exaggerated the results of multiple inspections,"" according to a Navy official. That ""evidence shows he provided false information to his superior officers, including his commanding officer,"" ""who took action to correct the record."" What happened? The official went so far as to describe exactly what happened:

The commanding officer, who approved the Navy inspection of the LCS … ordered the commander of the vessel to not only accept [the officer's] version of events but to make it the official record of what actually happened. The commanding officer ordered the officer to return to [the ship] with copies of his records to be included in the paperwork that he signed … and he was transferred to the administrative assistant position at the Naval Sea Systems Command, where he was removed from his position and transferred to administrative duty.

In short, the Navy alleges that the ""captain and staff officer … were motivated by insubordination toward their superior, not by misbehavior"" on the part of the officer. The Navy officer reportedly fabricated his ""results,"" made up his ""explanation for the discrepancies,"" and gave the impression, apparently not without basis, to his superiors that he had lied to them. His ""account of the incident"" was ""fabricated"" as well. The Navy's ""manifest unwillingness"" to fire him (the official's own words) ultimately is that of ""unwavering devotion to doing the right thing, even if it's wrong.""

A similar thing happened with someone who was allegedly responsible for falsifying the Naval Academy's own records. It happened in 2012, too. He went to administrative duty (again, in that case, as ""administrative assistant""). A ""management team"" investigated his ""account"", in violation of numerous Navy policy rules: ""The team found no instances of fabrication."" The Navy said that it took no action.

There isn't an accident here, I'm afraid. This story is about the person, who took the Navy and Marine Corps to task because they want, again, to believe that this was a ""misbehavior."" To believe, that is, that an officer in uniform intentionally lied or misrepresented their history to his superiors.

It's also about the Navy and Marine Corps taking the position that if only somebody were to go in the exact opposite direction… if they thought there really was no other way to handle this, they would have investigated.

That officer in question had served only a couple of years as a senior executive officer – in fact, the person served in the Navy for only about six months, and didn't get promoted to any command. He didn't ""misanthrop [sic] the record"" of others. He didn't do ""the wrong thing."" He didn't ""distort history."" What he did was, according to his own written account and what he actually told his commanders, lie.

The point is just this:

The Navy and Marine Corps may well believe this, and they may think it's morally consistent. Why else would they want to believe that they are being held"

Tractor-trailer crashmilitary truck collision


This is a real scene that happened in 2012. The accident happened at 12:45streets in the city of Memphis, Tennessee. A white truck crashed into a light pole near 8th and W. 11th Street. The driver of the truck, 30-year-old Steven Bostic Jr., was killed and his passenger, 22-year-old Tariya Lunsford, was severely injured. She was transported to a nearby hospital with multiple lacerations and is expected to survive. He was apparently not wearing a seat belt at the time he lost control in a high-speed collision, causing the truck to cross a median. The hit-and-run driver of the tractor-trailer was also killed in the crash. Police say they believe it was accident-caused. They are still investigating the other part of the crash when the truck hit the light pole. If you are following me, I got it from here on.

Lunsford is still here, now and is being treated, by the hospital. Her boyfriend was also critically injured and is also in a coma in what is going on at the hospital. It's not possible to tell yet how she will make a recovery.

As for Bostic, he was charged with manslaughter and the violation of a court order. He was eventually convicted for the manslaughter charges, but the judge has not set any sentence at this time.

Tractor-trailer collision


Here's a real crash that happened back in 2005 near the University of Toledo, Ohio. A tractor trailer overturned on Interstate 75 while trying to avoid a semi driving on the same highway and striking another tractor trailer. The tractor trailer lost control on the exit ramp and overturned onto the ground. A passenger in one of the semi's was also trapped in the overturned trailer. No one was seriously injured in the wreck.


To top it all off, the driver of the other semi, 22-year-old Brian Houser, was charged with five counts of felonious assault of a high and aggravated nature and one count of battery on an officer, after he allegedly struck a Toledo police officer with his pickup truck.

Truck hit semi


This road rage accident happened a while back in the state of Illinois. A truck collided with a semi truck and a taxi cab then flipped the cab over on the side of a hill leading to the freeway. The semi driver was able to escape the overturned truck by jumping out of the cab, when the truck rolled over and crashed. It's unknown whether or not he was wearing a seat belt at the time.

The semi driver, 24-year-old Matthew McPherson, was injured in the accident, but according to local police said he was able to walk away from the wreckage.

Other road rage accidents

I drove my bike yesterday. It was on a city street, and I saw a truck driving with its window down. At that time, the front end of the truck was in the intersection with a stop light on the left side of the street. As I approached the intersection, some cars were turning so close to my bike that you had to swerve left to turn right. I had never seen or heard of a vehicle causing a dangerous intersection by driving with its window shut before. I thought to myself that truck drivers, drivers who are not looking in any direction but the road, would understand.

The following is what I witnessed:I was heading home when I saw a truck parked next to a crosswalk a block from my home. In the video, the truck kept driving past the crosswalk. From the video of my stop sign, I did not see an intersection. As we walked up a small hill (100 meters away), several pedestrians were walking left to right in front of the intersection. No one got out of their vehicles and walked toward the truck. As we passed, one person got out of the truck and started to cross his arms before I could see him. I had time to take my camera out and start filming as I crossed across PubMed to avoid them. As I was crossing, a young girl who was behind me turned"
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Kelly Pless started gaining as a teen and weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest. Exercise and an ""eat to live"" eating philosophy helped her shed 95 pounds. Pless started out walking but now runs 40 miles a week. She is training to run two marathons this winter."," Pless, 27, is hoping for a second pro running career. She says her diet of vegetables and fruits and a low-carb, low-fat diet have helped her.

""I felt a lot of anxiety about losing weight,"" said Pless, who lives in Seattle. ""I wasn't sure if I was still good enough"" to complete a marathon, she said.

Pless is not alone; marathoners are often among the fatest members.

According to the nonprofit Health at Every Size, nearly half of American adults are clinically obese. Many people worry that having a healthy body is easy to look at on the outside — when they're actually more at danger of gaining it all off.

This week, HES released a video that is aimed at increasing runners' awareness of their condition. It featured runner and author Kelly Johnson, known for her blog ""Fit Mom, Eat Honey."" It also featured two popular YouTube users, who talked about their struggles with weight gain or other health issues.

Here is a clip of an account that is similar to Pless' story:

""Most people think, 'OK, no matter what, if you weigh 80 pounds you shouldn't weigh 200 pounds,' and they can probably just get into their car and go to their local grocery store or McDonald's,"" Johnson said in a new video. ""But that's all right, because of a system of food regulations, they can get away with it.""

Other health advocates have voiced concerns about a culture that makes it easier for people to gain weight and other risks to health.

""No matter how they get there — whether there's a sugar rush or something else — there's not a lot of information to help you, to educate you as to what it is and what its effects are,"" said Denise O'Dea the senior vice president of community relations for the National Eating Disorders Association, who has worked with a number of runners. ""What is known is generally bad,"" like high-calorie, high-fat food. O'Dea said that she feels runners' body image often influences how they feel about themselves, but that there is nothing wrong with weight gain.

""It's just a matter of perspective,"" she said.

The running community can do something about the perception that it is easier to gain weight than lose it.

This year, the Running USA Foundation, which promotes the sport, issued a list of suggestions on how to lose weight. For runners, that's ""don't go too fast or too easy"" through dieting and ""eat more fruits and vegetables,"" said Matt Johnson, chairman of Running USA.

Still, when the president did the speech, readers felt compelled to reach out, expressing their anger at his words and their frustrations on the ground.

Here's the back page from The Times' story of the speech:


It was a long, long time coming.

In 2008 after receiving a life sentence for being a co-conspirator in a sexual assault he didn't commit, Wilson left public housing and moved in with family and friends.

When The Times asked Wilson last year about the decision to turn his life around, he replied with a simple answer: ""The best thing to do is to accept the consequences of your own decisions.""

So as a reminder for what Mr. Obama told the young gang leader, here's the President's remarks:"
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Feinstein, Schumer say they'll vote for attorney general nominee. Michael Mukasey's nomination now expected to pass Judiciary Committee. Sen.

If Pompeo did vote yes, the vote could mark the end of Trump's first week in office. Under the U.S. Constitution, only House of Representatives can impeach a president.

Sen. Joe Manchin, WV, said he is ""not going to cast any vote that might hurt the presidency."" In an interview, GOP Sen. Joe Manchin, WV, said in an interview, said he is ""not going to cast any vote that might hurt the presidency."" In an interview, Republican Sen.

*UPDATE*

NBC News has confirmed that the fatalities and injuries in the crash were all Utahns. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) announced Wednesday morning that the Utah Highway Patrol's (USHP) accident reconstruction team has completed its investigation into the crash that injured nine people.

The USHP accident reconstruction team, comprised of representatives from various agencies, determined that the bus collided with a vehicle when it was traveling between 32 and 40 miles per hour. The cause of the collision was a loss of control caused by operator error. One USHP trooper remains in critical but stable condition, and six troopers with minor injuries were transported to local hospitals.

USHP says they believe the bus driver may have been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash. However, the exact substance content of these beverages is unknown, and there were no reports of the driver having any medical issues to justify this being the case.

The State Fire Marshal's Office also responded to the scene and cleared the scene. Utah Division of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) inspectors were called out to the scene after the crash, after which OSHA recommended that the bus's driver receive a 20% time reduction in driving instruction and 15 hours of community service in addition to a license suspension. The crash remains under investigation by OSHA and USHP.

Utah County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Sherrie Whalen-Shallack says the NTSB is leading the investigation with the USHP and it's unknown at this time what led up to the accident. She says the cause of the accident will be determined once the investigation is complete.

Whalen-Shallack explains that there are two types of crashes in the US. ""Anywhere there is a bus going, there's a crash,"" she tells NBC News.

The NTSB has a special unit that investigates all type of vehicle-related collisions. The NTSB accident reconstruction team has worked in conjunction with the NTSB's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. The NTSB accident reconstruction team consists of members from the NTSB Office of Investigations, its Research and Training Division and the NTSB's Operations and Forensic Technology Division.

""The NTSB accident reconstruction team is dedicated to preserving and improving the lives of motor vehicle crash victims through its extensive accident reconstruction efforts. ""Through its exhaustive crash studies, the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) has found"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Rubbish is piling up on the streets of Naples, with municipal dumps full. Many commentators question the role of the local mafia in the award of contracts. More than $2.5B in emergency funds has been spent on the problem over the years. One dump was going to be a golf course -- residents furious it is being re-opened."," A local judge tells me that ""we could really use the money."" If this sounds like a country with a serious garbage problem, you're not alone: In the past few years, public outcry has given rise to a municipal service organization (MSNO), the city's municipal garbage collector. MSNO has become the go-to resource of many municipal departments and a major source of funding. I'm working as a writer on a film about the cleanup of the dump, called The Biggest Trash. I want to share what I've found about Naples' garbage problem with you. What I heard, learned, and saw while doing research in Naples is a story of corruption and bureaucracy. It's also a story of a nation trying to rebuild. To hear it properly, you need to know a little bit about the culture and history of the mafia. It's a story that is all too familiar in today's city of Naples. We're using a different name in Italian, in order to avoid naming people. And it will most certainly not be called Italy's ""dirty war."" What's wrong with us?


The mafia has never had much interest in waste disposal – it has other things to worry about. But they were willing to help out the city in the right way – and in some cases, to make huge contributions to it – because of money.


By the early 1800s, the Italian mafia controlled almost every level of government, from the police to the mayor. They were a wealthy and powerful people, with a reputation for corruption. They owned a wealth of property. They had extensive networks of criminals and thugs, who were at the city government's beck and call.

When you have this wealth of property, all the work was done to take care of it.

They were a major political force in Naples, even though they had an average political influence in other areas – such as law.

The Mafia helped make Naples a garbage dump, the reason they were allowed to keep the land it held. The most successful mafia bosses didn't do the dirty jobs (like garbage piling up). They did big garbage jobs.

It is widely known, on both sides of the Atlantic, that there was a conspiracy by the mafia to take over other governments in southern and central Europe. That did not happen in Italy, either, and Italy's government was much better able to combat it.


How is Naples's garbage problem still in the public spotlight? It's important, because of both its importance as an international city and because it's becoming a national conversation point, at least because of Italy's recent presidential visit to Florence (I've made the trip here also, but I won't say anything more about the mayor or his visit).


The biggest question I've received (I know there are a ton of others). The only thing missing for this story is where the garbage has all gone.


Let the garbage pile up, says people. But don't let it pile up on private property. Just give the mafia some jobs, because these guys know where everything goes. They are not going to mess with the mess, if it's important.

Well, as it happens, they certainly are not, which is one reason, so far, the mafia does not have a major role in the process to clear the dumps.


To understand what the mafia is really up to, you have to know about local mafia – and it exists just as it does in the rest of Italy. Its role is to clean up and bury garbage, and if you have a city of this size, you have to do it all.


In Naples, a town of 200,000 inhabitants, the population was just 12,300 back in 1981 (it is now about 400,000). As the old mayor of Naples, I've been involved in the management and construction of what for a half century was the largest dumping ground in Italy. It's the sort of city where most people aren't aware of the magnitude of the garbage problem.


I will admit that I am not a garbage worker, and that I didn't really have a hand in the operation. But I am an experienced journalist, and this is how I got into the story of the garbage problem, starting from the dump's origins. But let me tell you, I learned a lot here. Here are some quotes from the story:

There aren't enough workers to take care of the job, so the mafia hires them. And there aren't enough people to do the jobs, either.

This garbage dump's history goes back to the 1990s, when"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Ralph Lauren began as tie salesman from the Bronx. First design: Wide ties when others were narrow. Has designed high fashion for four decades. Goal: Glamorous clothing that is ""consistent and accessible"""," in a ""fashion world dominated by extreme extremes."" Says his first design is inspired by the classic black cocktail dress of the 1960s.

Singer-songwriter with ""Crazy"" hit ""Wrecking Ball."" He also was an original member of the '90s girl group TLC and has a new album due out Aug. 4. Born Randy Lyness in New Jersey, he is now 25.

""The other day in the grocery store it turned out that he was my cousin. I've known him since I was born. And I thought, 'Dude, maybe I'd like you, you look very nice and you're from a nice neighborhood.' But it turns out he came from the town. You know, I think he got kicked out of school after that when they tried to cut him up for doing drugs, which was a disgrace. It was a real shame, but he got in trouble anyways.

He's got this big mustache and he's not even wearing a tie. And he's wearing a black-and-white jersey, which is funny because he actually wears black and white jerseys and ties and turtlenecks now, I think. But I don't think that's him. I think that's his cousin or whatever. But it was really the sweater that inspired us. He said to just bring it to my house and put it on. So I'm thinking I want to do some cool sweaters but I actually wear all brown and gray, especially in those days.

So he comes over on Friday and he's wearing this sweater and it's really a classic jacket. And I say, 'What is that?'""

They have a quick moment and then he gets it over his head. But it doesn't seem too good. When I mentioned that the shirt reads ""Klown,"" he says, ""It means, like, kill him."" And he says, 'Do it.' ""

My dad is very politically incorrect. I think that's what is so interesting, you know, is how different he is from the people I grew up with, who have these very progressive principles in regard to how they look or what they wear. And my dad was so incredibly liberal, but he didn't really express it in that way. That says something because his values do have an underlying color, but it's not necessarily red and white.

When he came home from the wars, my mom would always say how he couldn't really have spent the time back in the states with those people like me who were so young then. He said, 'Well you couldn't be on TV, but you'd be a celebrity.' And my mom goes, 'Why would you be a celebrity?' And he says, 'Well, I don't have money' and she says, 'Well, you could have, but don't play games.'

I think because he was so comfortable in the public eye, he didn't really feel that much of the need to express his values the way he should have because he didn't want to draw attention to himself. He didn't necessarily agree with me, so that probably made it harder for him to do the things that were most important to him -- like go out to eat with his friends. Maybe he just didn't want to get into trouble. Or maybe he was just more politically incorrect and not into talking about himself or going out with all the people his friends were with.

Like you said, it's funny, because my dad would never bring the sweater home. But it did, of course, get mentioned in conversation once. If anything we did was in front of him. For a while we'd go out. And it would be funny, you know, because that's how we related to each other, Community-wise, so it was almost like a form of shorthand to talk about the people that surround us -- you know, the family.

Do you think that a lot of people associate the way you dress with the way that you present yourself? Or you've got to be really self-conscious of that, because you're playing a part in a bigger show and you're working on some major projects so it's sort of in the eye of the beholder.

You know, for a while we did go out, but I don't think that was because we took the sweater home. It wasn't really because we just wanted to be nice to one another, but because we knew that our families would find out. But it's not the same as going out and going to see the band playing and being like, 'Oh, we go out.' No, I don't think that's the point. That's not my job -- to"

The second-hand car market is booming. A 2014 study found that only 5 percent of Americans who are 50 and more can't find a new car within a year. This trend helps explain why the majority of Americans who want a used car—80 percent, according to an AutoTrader.com survey—choose new vehicles. What used cars and trucks are getting in the mix is an increasing concentration of desirable (and low-cost) cars, while a majority of buyers are opting for cheaper brands, like Mercedes-Benz to Porsche. The rise of used car prices has become a concern to traditional carmakers; it's not even the only problem. This year the Consumer Reports vehicle-mapping company estimated that $1,600 in new car-buying costs can be incurred due to the high amount that used cars are losing.

While car buyers may feel the weight of rising car prices, they may not see it as much of a problem. ""They are not always aware of the value of their car when they consider buying a used car,"" says J. David Siegel, a professor of marketing at the University of Michigan. ""In any given year, buyers will have a much better idea about a used car when they see it up close. When they look closely, however, it's not that different from what they are used to seeing.""

When looking at used cars, Siegel says, it's important to make a note of potential problems. ""Look for major, expensive problems,"" he says. ""Check for body damage, rust, excessive rust, brake rotors, air-conditioning and power steering fluids—everything else will hurt buyers' evaluation of the car.""

In the new-car world, Siegel says, consumers can be expected to do their due diligence before signing a sale contract with the seller. ""Look for signs of a problem. Buyers want to know that the car is safe—a quality-assurance inspection and an inspection or service are crucial part of the deal.""

If there's a seller in a low-ratio market, it doesn't put buyers off buying a car. It's just asking for one more thing to get a deal: the brand the car's been in. A buyer who has had a new caragin' with the seller's used car could be inclined to take the same route. It could be the only way for him to save some cash. And while there's a reason so many used cars are coming with significant scratches or dents, says Siegel, ""that's only an indication that the car isn't the original or has been altered for sale or trade."" If there is paint blemishes and other significant damage, he says, ""the car is likely to be worth less than the sticker price.""

A Used Car Is Usually Worth The Cost Of A New Car

Although this article focuses on used car prices in the new car world, the trend applies equally to used cars. The main difference, as evidenced by the AutoTrader.com study, is that a used car on the used car market typically goes for around half what a new car would. For sale in the late stages of production—with limited availability—a car can command as much as $1,800 more than an equivalent new car.

In the late stages of production, the sale price for vehicles is expected to be reduced significantly, according to Siegel. The lower production in many large American automakers means that used cars are not only selling at more affordable prices—they're selling at lower prices than new cars, too.

""The majority of used cars are getting an even better deal than new cars,"" says Siegel. ""The same car might be selling for $7,500 or $7,650. So a $1,750 used car on the used car market would be selling for $6,000 on the new car market. That's a 30 percent price reduction in a week."" The more cars available, he says, the more profit is to be made—which is why used cars are becoming easier to find.

On the used car market, it's not uncommon to see cars with all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-drive, and all-wheel-drive. Even though all cars have a certain spec, a certain ""brand ID,"" it's rare that we see used cars with an 8-liter engine at all. The majority of used vehicles now are sold with a 4-cylinder engine"

He's spent 10 years as finance chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign arm. And his opponent, Jeb Bush, has said he's more concerned about his own presidential campaign than about trying to get things done. ""This is essentially a negative campaign that is basically just trying to tear Scott Murphy down and then run to the next Republican primary,"" Manley added. ""And if he can't win without the 'Breath' attack, as they call this negative campaign, how are you going to win with it? And that's exactly what they're doing."" In a recent ad, Murphy warns: ""This election doesn't just matter to Floridians, it matters to the country.""

Marco Rubio of Florida is looking to stay in, having been the lone Republican to back the original healthcare bill that the House passed last summer. And in Nevada, Republican Dean Heller is battling former Gov. Brian Sandoval to be their successor. The two men, both considered competitive in 2018, were at odds earlier this year over a proposed fee on Internet companies to help pay for their broadband plans. Sandoval wanted to cap those fees at a percentage of the state's gross income. Heller said he wanted those fees kept low - about $2 per household. Sandoval proposed raising them to 4 percent of gross income. A poll released on Oct. 12 by Public Policy Polling had Heller holding a slim one-point lead over Sandoval over reelection next year.""I think we're going to see a lot more of this,"" said former President George W.

Prince: ""I believe we acted appropriately at all times"""," in incident where a gunman opened fire at a compound in Iraq.

I believe we acted appropriately at all times. The State Department official, speaking on background, explains the need for Secretary Clinton's emails to be turned over.

The House panel also voted to subpoena James Blair, former chief of staff to secretary of state Colin Powell and later co-chairman of the presidential transition team for George W. Bush, for his testimony about Blackwater and Prince's company.

Powell testified to the House committee that he wasn't aware the company had any contract work in Iraq.

Prince testified to the committee that Powell told him to remove the words ""unarmed"" from the documents Blackwater submitted to the State Department and other documents. The State Department later discovered that the words ""unarmed"" were in a ""draft"" memo created on the weekend before the deadly Sept. 11, 2004, attacks on the World Trade Center.

Blair testified that Powell was not aware of Blackwater's use of American-made vehicles to transport soldiers into Iraq. He said Powell did not want Blackwater to make it ""impossible"" for the White House to find out that the company was getting weapons at the same time the State Department was refusing to turn over the records."

Fact File

The story

A helicopter carrying four crewmembers lost power a few hours before sunrise Sunday on the runway at Aviano Air Base on the northern coast of Italy.

The helicopter had been on the ground for 10 days. It was carrying the Italian coast guard's search and rescue crew when it lost power on a day that also marked the end of Italy's summer season.

Italian officials say the chopper, carrying an Italian Coast Guard crew, was heading from Sardinia to the island of Lampedusa, the westernmost of Italy's three main Aegean islands. During Saturday's flight its oxygen system failed and passengers were forced to abandon the plane.

The plane had landed at Aviano, a short drive fromarguably the best skiing resort in the country, before taking off from its designated landing area around 10:10 a.m. local time.

Italian officials say four people died after the missing helicopter crashed into a mountain. Two others suffered some kind of serious injury.

Flight records show that the aircraft was in air for over 11 hours but lost contact with ground tracking radars with a maximum altitude of about 10,000 feet.

Italian media claim a white plane carrying four people was on its way to Aviano from Sardinia a few hours before it lost power.

The pilot has been airlifted to a private hospital in a Rome suburb.

According to a statement from the Italian Coast Guard:

""The search and rescue teams have so far reached five people injured in the crash but two survivors are in serious condition. A fire and smoke is still emerging from the wreckage, while the helicopter crashed in a mountain on the ground. The aircraft is presumed to have crashed in the middle of a storm.""

One Italian TV station reports:

""The missing pilot has been identified by the Italian Coast Guard as an Air Force lieutenant, aged 39, by his initials. The helicopter is believed to have landed around 10.30 a.m. local time on Sunday.""

Italian media reports say that the deceased were members of a search-and-rescue mission but the helicopter is thought to have crashed in the mountains. One Italian media report says a helicopter with 14 crew members was on its way from Sardinia on its way to the island of Lampedusa.

Aviano residents and local news agencies are reporting that the missing helicopter was a L-130 military transport plane.

The National Disaster Response Coordination Centre (CONRAD) said it had not received any distress calls. The agency said it was also working closely with Italian authorities on the search for survivors.

Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the tragedy ""a reminder of the risks posed by helicopters in dangerous conditions.""

""The Ministry has been in contact with the Italian authorities, and we are coordinating with air transport organizations to ensure that the necessary actions are taken,"" the ministry said in the statement.

Formal notification will be sent by Friday.

The Coast Guard helicopters are equipped with P3 Orion aircraft equipped with the Aisaka P3S-3 radar system.

Aviano is one of Italy's largest aerospace factories. It was the first to have helicopters in 1948."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: University of Memphis athlete Taylor Bradford, 21, was shot September 30. Three charged with murder in perpetration of attempted aggravated robbery. After player was shot, he got in his car, drove off and then crashed into a tree. The killing spurred school officials to temporarily lock down the campus."," Authorities called for the manhunt and the lockdown of the campus in all but name. The police also identified the suspect.

What We Know

Taylor Bradford, 21, suffered a gunshot wound to his chest. Three people were charged with first-degree murder in his killing. They were named as:

Cedric G. Foster, 20, of Memphis

Shawn W. Green, 20, of Memphis

Jordan E. Johnson, 19, of Memphis

Taylor Bradford was the student who was murdered. Authorities had a list of the names of some of the university's other students, but in this case the public has the name of each student who was killed. Those are listed below by school.

University of Memphis.

University of Louisiana at Monroe.

University of New Orleans.

University of Notre Dame.

University of Kansas.

University of Kentucky.

Wyoming.

Duke University.

University of Mississippi.

University of North Carolina.

University of South Carolina.

University of South Carolina, Columbia.

University of Texas at Austin.

University of Virginia.

University of West Georgia.

University of Toledo and University of Florida at Gainesville also faced charges in connection with Bradford's death.

The Memphis man is listed as 5-foot-5 and 185 pounds. Police said he has a small tattoo of the initials T.A.R.C.H. on his right shoulderblade. He was wearing light green shoes and a dark hooded sweats frog on his head.

He is in stable condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and is undergoing surgery.

Police said at the time that he had been shot in a nearby parking lot.

""I just want to tell everyone that we will continue to put this guy in jail and get justice for these people,"" said University President R. Bowen Loftin before the lockdown was lifted. ""He took a life and a student. We will continue to do everything we can.""

Police have the motive in Bradford's killing, which was first reported by WREG-TV.

According to police, the shooting occurred about 9:10 p.m. Sept. 30 in the 1000 block of North 3rd Street.

While the motive is still unclear, the University issued this statement on Sunday: ""We don't know what motivated (Bradford's) actions, but our priority at this time is to provide help and safety for those who need it.""


The shooting came one week after another deadly shooting occurred at University of Memphis. Police said the shooting happened about 9:22 p.m. Sept. 26 at the intersection of impression Ave. and 1st St.

The shooting also came after the release of a 911 call made by an unidentified man. That call was sent on Sept. 26 to the University of Memphis Police Department, and it included the shooting suspect's call to say he had been shot and was suffering from injuries to his chest and head.

According to the University, police had identified the man, but he wasn't arrested at the time, and there was no other evidence to link him to the shooting.

A witness told WREG-TV that he drove the victim home. The witness said the shooter had been involved in a recent incident at the University's football complex. The witness said he was surprised when police did not follow up on the story.

One thing is certain, however. The university is getting ready for what could be a busy holiday weekend.

Students who wanted to be a part of the lockdown would have to go to the University's Main Building, located on the east side of campus, which is near the football complex. Students will also have to pick up their driver's license, which will be valid until the end of the holiday weekend.

Police have been called to the campus and other areas on Monday for similar incidents.

Bail bondsman tells judge O.J. Simpson never paid him. DA says Simpson violated bail terms by leaving message for co-defendant.","

SUMMARIES

Simpson would have left a message for the co-defendant, Ronald Goldman. According to the Los Angeles Times, the call was made around 8:30 a.m. Friday and Simpson was later arrested on suspicion of failing to appear out of court or the Los Angeles County Jail after he was scheduled to appear for a bond hearing. The bail was set at $250,000.

""Mr. Goldman has cooperated with the authorities since his arrest. He has cooperated completely with the investigation. He's provided all the requested documents,"" said Lisa Bloom, an attorney for Goldman, in response to Fox's story.

Simpson would have left letters to attorneys representing both women.

SUMMARY

The case has been referred to Los Angeles County district attorney Jackie Lacey, who could file charges. Lacey's office said Simpson was held on $1.2 million bail pending a court hearing on Tuesday (Feb. 25), where his lawyer, Michael A. Ferman, and defense attorneys will argue that his bail should be increased because he didn't show up for a bond hearing on Friday morning either. The judge, U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert J. Fox, then reduced O.J. Simpson's bail to $25,000 for each of the two women in relation to a request from the prosecutor for a $1.3 million bond and then $250,000 bail for the first-degree murder trial.

Simpson is now being held on $250,000 bail in lieu of $1.3 million bail

The DA's office said their argument was ""unwarranted.""

""They should allow the defendant to be freed,"" Bloom said Monday night, ""without imposing a disproportionate sentence without the possibility of conviction.""

The DA's office also issued a notice saying that the next hearing on Tuesday will determine the amount of bail.

SUMMARY

The DA's office is currently prosecuting Simpson on a single count of first degree murder, for which if convicted he could face the death penalty.

O.J. Simpson has been arrested on charges of second-degree murder, for which if convicted he could face life in prison.

Simpson has made numerous claims that his friend and former fiancee Nicole Brown Simpson was killed in a jealous rage in June 1994 because of a ""loose commitment"" between Simpson and Brown. O.J. Simpson has always denied these allegations. The case has been referred to Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey, who could file charges.

The DA's office said Wednesday that there will be two hearings prior to the final hearing set for Tuesday in the case, in which they said they would argue that as the trial moves forward, the bail should be increased to $250 million. Bloom said her organization has made a formal request to Fox for an increase, which is set to happen in a few hours.

The DA's office believes Simpson should not be released on bail as the case is in the early stages and is also seeking more documents and depositions, as well as another bond hearing.

The DA's office added that they have received some information regarding a letter which was reportedly made by Simpson.

In the letter, allegedly written by Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, the two women allegedly accuse one of Simpson's former girlfriends, Barbara Corcoran, of threatening to kill Brown.

The letter said Brown left messages on Simpson's phone threatening to ""cut up"" Michael's and O.J.'s throats.

The letter goes on to say that Brown would ""pay [A.B.] $50,000 every week until A.B. paid [A.B.] to leave,"" and the two women had a heated argument in 2007. Brown had allegedly cut ties with Michael in 2005 over an alleged affair involving Michael, while Brown has continued to talk about having an affair with another man named Rudy Guede.

The DA's office said the letter could have come from Simpson's wife, which they said is the key argument against Simpson's release.

The DA's office also said that they believe they would have to show that the letter was written by one of Nicole Brown Simpson's relatives, like Simpson's first cousin or Simpson's former neighbor Mark Fuhrman, who wrote the letter.

Simpson's first cousin, Ron Goldman, told the Daily Mail he got the letter.

According to an ACLU report issued last month, the facility has struggled to control its population and is plagued by overcrowded conditions such as open sewage flowing through the cells.

A CHILD OF A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST A CHILD A CHILD OF A MANWHO HAS BEENCHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST A CHILD

An affidavit filed by Chester County Prosecuting Attorney John M. Chidley says a mother ""in good faith"" believes that her daughter, a young woman in the care of a woman in Chester County, was sexually abused a decade ago.

It's the first known accusation against Trent Bayless, 33, since he was charged with raping a 3-year-old girl at a family home in September. Authorities allege Bayless inappropriately touched the girl while she was strapped into a backboard chair at a home in Cheshire Township. The girl told them she wanted to go out while Bayless was there and she told him she would ""never do that again,"" the affidavit states.

Family members have agreed that not having Bayless in their lives will help victims of sexual assault, and the mother has spoken openly about the issue, according to the affidavit filed by Chidley.

The mother first said on Sept. 23 that Bayless had abused his teenage daughter, then said there was a sexual contact between Bayless and his daughter that was more explicit.

According to the affidavit, when authorities came to the home two other girls had been tied into the chair, and those girls said they were tied too. At that time, the mother's ""attention had turned"" to whether Bayless had sexually abused the 6-year-old girl who was then tied into the chair.

A couple days before the abuse allegations came to light, Bayless stopped paying child support to a woman and was on probation for a previous probation violation, according to court records.

In fact, a police detective had even taken Bayless to jail when he had not paid child support. But by then he had changed his number and he was able to pay the child support.

In August, the mother asked Chidley to help investigate Bayless because she didn't have a source of income. Chidley said this was because she had no children of her own and she didn't trust Bayless to keep his word. Instead of filing a complaint, he thought it wouldn't help to wait, and filed a case with Chester County authorities.

When the allegations came to light, Chidley said his office was investigating Bayless himself. He said Bayless has been cooperative, but didn't comment Monday on whether he believes Bayless raped his daughter.

At the time of the abuse allegation, Trent Bayless's mother was living with the mother of Tylat Bayless, 24. Tylat Bayless also lives with his father, 24. The parents live in Chester County.

Tylat said his father met her at a party in Chester County. He said he met her at a party in Chester County"
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Sen. Hillary Clinton defends vote on resolution, saying ""it's not a law"" Sen. Barack Obama: President could use Iran measure to justify military action. Obama says Clinton's vote for resolution shows ""flawed"" judgment. Differences with Clinton will be clear in ""next phase"" of campaign, Obama says."," Sen. Bob Graham: Clinton says that Senate resolution ""tortured"" Israel by not imposing penalties on Iran, and by adding to the Iranian nuclear program to give the White House leverage over the Middle East.

The Washington Post is not normally the first newspaper to report something as significant as a resolution of a pending war. Most wars are more of a public relations event, like sending bombers to shoot things out behind enemy lines. This resolution was much more than that. It was an act of war. And not just against any foreign government, which is a far cry from any foreign country — it was an act of war against a country that the international community had never formally recognized, recognized as a member of the United Nations, the United Nations' flagship body. If these countries were to accept that they were now under attack from a second-rate regional power, then they were in peril of being labeled as so by the world. In fact, the whole point of the United Nations is to prevent that sort of ""bait and switch"" war.

There are many possible explanations for why Hillary Clinton opposed this resolution, but there are two that I see most frequently. First, it seemed politically expedient, as with Clinton's vote for the Iran treaty. And this was more of a decision made in the public sector than the private sector — it would have been preferable to let Clinton carry out that decision instead of having it made by the White House, as did the agreement made with Iraq, for example. And it was in the public sector, not the private sector, as the United States has no reason to trust the private sector, and it is hard to believe that the international community can trust the private sector with vital interests in their own countries. If you look at the history of foreign wars, it is pretty clear that there have been no good decisions made in any particular war.

Second, it seems to me that the vote was much more about Iran than it was about war. In general, when the United States attacks another country, we do it to stop the attack, not to try to win a conflict. The United States is not at war with Iran, as the media would have us believe. Iran is at war with Israel and will not accept war against its country. What matters is the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons, which is a very big deal. And so the votes were very clearly about the possibility of Iran developing nuclear power.

So the question is: why is Clinton saying that Obama is wrong about the importance of sanctions against Iran? On top of that, if they are so important, then why does the administration not have a good strategy around any such sanctions? I do not believe Obama is totally wrong about this, but he has clearly not done anything to try to build up the international coalition to challenge Iran. Moreover, the Obama Administration is at the same time engaged in a war with jihadists, which puts it at a strategic disadvantage against Iran, if not a disadvantage."

New York State

Ninth Degree Counterfeiting

Overview: New York State's third-degree conspiracy statute defines ""third degree conspiracy"" as: A group, and in particular individuals, knowingly joins together to carry out a conspiracy and to commit acts constituting the offense; they intend to further the conspiracy to commit the offense. As the statute was written, it has three prongs, all of which together make third degree conspiracy a ""willing participation in the conduct of another,"" and three prongs (bodily harm and money laundering) that include one defendant. State v. Stork, 81 NY2d 891, 899 (2008).

First prong: ""Willing participation"" in the conduct of another is a necessary condition for ""willing participation in the offense,"" State v. Williams, 9 NY2d 668, 675 (""participatory participation""). The court found that there was no basis to conclude that Mr. Sues's intent with respect to the NYSMS (as the prosecution argued) was to contribute (his) efforts to the scheme, or not to attempt to assist Mr. Sues's plans. The relevant inquiry is not whether a certain defendant believed that if she or he joined the conspiracy others would participate in the intended activity, per sebags (see supra note 48), per se (see supra note 48), but rather whether the defendant actually was one of the plotters. Here, because we conclude that the prosecution failed to prove in this case that the third parties joined the alleged plotters to carry out some specific act, we interpret the statute as requiring participation in some specific and actual act.

Second prong: The relevant question is whether participation in the conspiracy was necessary to the intended activity; here, the court found that the NYSMS's participation was necessary to the scheme. ""[S]ince no specific action was committed, the conspiracy required [the Sues] and others to engage as conspiratories in the physical act of conspiring to steal certain goods. The evidence revealed that the New York New York group was aware of where to obtain such physical evidence [the stolen purses]. The possession of purses required the group's physical presence and participation, since [their possession] was a necessary element of the conspiracy to steal purses."" (State v. Leech, 39 NY2d 637, 640) (footnotes omitted).

Third prong: ""MONEY LAUNDERING"" is a ""willing participation"" in the offense and constitutes intent to use property for criminal means. (State v. Williams, 9 NY2d 667 [""willing participation"" in the crime, in that it ""involves an intentional attempt to deprive, or to attempt to induce others to deprive, another of property or services that would otherwise be protected by the law""].) Here the defendant's activity was actually accomplished without the defendant's consent by virtue of the accused's participation in the conspiracy. While the ""victims"" who were defrauded (as opposed to the purported ""conspirators"") were subjected to actual physical harm, they never actually lost property or services, and they neither gained, nor suffered the financial loss due to their alleged participation. Therefore, we reject the New York statute's interpretation in this case.

Summary and Decision: Under ""MONEY LAUNDERING"" as presented in State v. Williams, 9 NY2d 616 (""money laundering""), the third prong must have been met before the statute's three-pronged reading could be read to create a legal defense. As the court concluded there is no basis to infer that the defendants joined the conspiracy merely to gain possession of the stolen purses and other assets. Given this conclusion, the statute is not valid (and no appeal is necessary) and the defendant, in this case, should be required to face an indictable offense. That being the case, one needs to consider what one does if a third-party person or organization engages in unlawful activity.

Ninth Degree

Overview: The NY State statute is set forth as ""No Crime... in the New York State of... New York (as provided in [the statute, see N.Y.S.A. § 2-101(1)); and"" (N.Y.S.A. Crim. Proc. Law & Rule 1610).

Monday

The National Hurricane Center releases the final forecast of Sunday night's storm, which is known as Matthew, and the tropical storm warning for the Florida peninsula. It also shares a warning for the Key West and Bahamas coasts.

Wednesday

The weather service releases Hurricane Matthew track information from its National Hurricane Center. The storm will pass over Key West, Key West, and Orlando during the morning hours and move southeastward along the east shore of South Carolina and Georgia. It could become a hurricane as it leaves southern Georgia and the Florida Panhandle at least until 10:30 a.m.

Saturday

After Tropical Storm Chan-hom continues to slow the movement of Matthew and the tropical storm warning is lifted. The NHC will begin issuing the final hurricane details Wednesday morning with the forecast track of Matthew.

Hurricane conditions will become more likely with Matthew's projected track westward through the Florida panhandle, the Florida Keys, and the southern Florida coast. Tropical storm characteristics will be expected between 6.5 and 10 a.m., with maximum sustained winds ranging from 64 to 70 mph.

The Florida Keys are expected to see tropical storm-force winds Thursday morning with portraying storm surge in the 15 to 30-foot range. The center of Hurricane Matthew is expected to pass off the Florida Panhandle and exit the state by Sunday afternoon.

While the entire state does not face hurricane-force winds, portions of the counties east of Naples and West Monroe already have seen gusts of 90 mph to the north and south of the center. The forecast indicates Matthew may continue moving to the north of this, pushing the forecast track even farther west.

Monday

The National Hurricane Center predicts Matthew will slowly track into Louisiana by Wednesday morning. Forecasts indicate the storm will strengthen to a tropical storm.

Tuesday

As Tropical Storm Chan-hom continues to slow down the movement of Matthew, the NHC releases the final hurricane track information. Forecasts indicate Matthew will continue to move west along the north shore of mainland South Carolina and Georgia, and weaken into a tropical depression next Wednesday.


Wednesday

The NHC provides a final word on the storm by releasing a hurricane bulletin detailing the projected tracks of Matthew from Thursday morning through Sunday. Tropical storm characteristics will be expected between 6.5 and 10 a.m. Wednesday, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. These conditions are considered severe by the NHC.

Thursday

While most South Carolinians are still bracing for more rain, the storm is expected to decrease in strength over the next couple days. By midday Wednesday, hurricane-force winds will rest near hurricane gusts. By 3 p.m., Matthew is expected to pass north of the Leeward Islands, and continue to weaken, with maximum sustained winds between 60 and 70 mph.

Friday

A tropical storm watch is again in effect from 5 a.m. until 6:45 p.m. for the Florida panhandle with a warning for severe storm damage.

The National Hurricane Center expects Matthew to intensify, with hurricane force winds by Sunday and tropical storm-force winds by Monday or Tuesday. At this point, hurricane conditions can still be expected all along the East Coast and central and eastern South Carolina. Maximum sustained winds will be near 65 mph.

Matthew is moving back toward the northwest along the mid-latitude coast as it moves northwest. The Atlantic Ocean is expected to become a bit more moist this week.


Saturday

By Saturday afternoon the storm has become a post-tropical cyclone. Forecasts suggest conditions will develop over the next week or so.

Sunday

The forecast track of Matthew is still the same as on Wednesday. It will continue to move west through the Florida Panhandle and Georgia and eventually eastward over the eastern Bahamas.

Matthew makes a landfall in or near the Bahamas between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. with a category 3 hurricane on Sunday.

The NHC will release the final tropical storm detail this weekend.

But, for most people, at least when I hear ""unless they get out on the street, I'll send them out of here"" I know that ""unless they go to prison"" is a thing that doesn't happen. So, I try not to look at CNN's reports.
The thing that I do remember is that when a reporterGoldMagikarp asked Paul, is he worried about R.E.M. having a ""dark album, no more light albums""?
Paul replied, ""If R.E.M. decides it wants more black-eyed peas-in-his-pea soup than it would to just sit at the desk and write good stuff, we'll be fine.""

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Government wants land for border fence; landowners refuse. Secretary Chertoff says he won't relent ""for a particular individual"" Eloisa Tamez says her property has been in her family since 1767. Border town mayor calls the fence ""a multibillion-dollar speed bump"""," Eloisa Tamez: ""Border communities have a choice. They can turn their backs on this wall, the border fence, and get their land back. This land belongs to us, not the government.""

Chertoff's statement was a direct attack on her land, and on the entire border community. Many of the people Eloisa Tamez lives next to are members of the Yoakum Yoakum people — the Yoakum people's homeland, in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico — who have been living in Texas for thousands of years.

It isn't enough for the border ""commission."" It just so happens that that commission is run by Michael Chertoff, one of the most celebrated civil rights attorneys of our time. The commission, and Michael Chertoff, are in the business of protecting government programs from lawsuits, and the people whose communities they are protecting are the citizens whose land is at risk.

In the wake of the recent Supreme Court ruling about the Yoakum people, many local officials in El Paso are saying they don't want to lose the border fence because of the Yoakum people.

But Chertoff says the fence ""means the Yoakum people lose their land.""

This is the same Michael Chertoff, the one who used to teach at Harvard Law School, who, in 2004, said that people in the Southwest could ""get a little depressed.""

His latest comment could only be a sign of his growing contempt for every person who lives just a few miles across the border without the protection of the border fence system.

But it isn't just El Paso that does not welcome the fence. The Mexican side in the Rio Grande Valley doesn't like it either. In fact, even President Felipe Calderon is moving in the opposite direction. He has proposed building a 100 mile-long border fence from Arizona to New Mexico. Not the 50 foot high fence he is currently threatening to tear up.

While Michael Chertoff and his cronies say the border fence has been ""worth it"" — giving ""its taxpayers the largest expense of any federal program,"" as Chertoff put it in his press release — they don't explain how that's fair.

Chertoff's claim that the $20 billion project will save ""the United States"" more than $5 billion in expenses is ludicrous. What are your calculations?"

Write a news article based on the following summary: Vick's September 13 drug test shows marijuana use. Pretrial release conditions tightened; must stay home from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Virginia grand jury indicts Vick and the three co-defendants on state charges. Vick already faces up to 18 months in prison after federal plea deal.,"

(In the first draft of the headline, I wrote ""U.S. Attorneys' spokeswoman says it does not use marijuana in testing, but says there is 'ongoing investigation and some possible charges relating to the marijuana issue' that were the subject of Vick's drug test."" Instead of writing diaper changes for children, a little better than I could have managed, I decided to go with Vick's sobriety test result and call it even.)

I'm not sure I could have changed the headline. ""Drug test results: Vick tested positive for marijuana."" I could have added: ""Plea deal: Vick pleaded guilty to marijuana count, got probation.""

But I did notice a very obvious typo: ""Drug test results: A grand jury indicted Vick and charged him with possession with intent to distribute marijuana.""

The grand jury ""indicted"" Vick and ""charged"" with ""possession with intent to distribute"" marijuana.

The correct headline reads: ""The pot charges against Vick: A grand jury charged Vick with possession with intent to distribute marijuana.""

The drug test results: Vick's Sept. 13 test showed he test positive for more than two-thirds of the prohibited drug in his system — just like that. And the grand jury indictment states that he ""possessed with intent to distribute at least four (4) pounds (12.8 grams) of marijuana.""

(Note, again, that I don't have any idea how old Vick was when he tested positive, but I can see no way he could have had that much marijuana in his system before he tested negative, or that he would have been able to get it at that store.)

(That last sentence is the key to the story. In reality, only six bags were distributed at the store where Vick's three co-defendants were arrested.)

The drug test results: The only thing that seems totally out of the blue is an apparent misspelling of ""potting,"" or potmuff-tee.

Vick was arrested at his home on Sept. 13, and immediately booked into Richmond City Jail. He was released eight days later on $15,000 bail.

Then, nearly eight months later, on Oct. 7, Vick's drug convictions were filed and vacated. The grand jury had returned no indictments at his original court date and no one else had been indicted at that time.

Vick's drug test result from September showed he had traces of the drug in his system for at least one hour before the test came back positive. That's about one-third of the total drug testing time he was actually allowed to be under federal probation and house arrest.

If any prosecutor would want to look at that drug test and decide whether or not to pursue charges, they have a number of options. The federal statute of limitations does not apply, so one would likely have enough time until he is again free to be a drug dealer. There are a series of ""administrative光 periods"" that can be used:

If the date of the scheduled felony was within six months of the date of the scheduled offense, the probation period expires on that date. If the date was within six months of the date of the scheduled felony and an indictable offense is pending, the administrative period expires seven years after the date of the scheduled felony. If the date was more than seven years after the date of the scheduled felony and an indictable offense is pending, the administrative period expires nine years after the date the indictment was returned. If there is no pending indictment, the law allows the court to consider whether the statute of limitations for the criminal offense would have expired after two years.

Or, as prosecutors and defense attorneys have been arguing since December — and Vick's lawyer has confirmed to me — Vick will be able to plead to one of two misdemeanors in connection with the drug possession charge that have a similar statute of limitations. In those two cases, charges are usually expiring more than seven years after the date of the scheduled offense.

Here's Vick's story:

Vick is in jail on felony probation and has been barred from possessing marijuana.

The prosecutor told me in court that the court would consider whether to file charges with a reduced prison term on Vick's marijuana case based on his ""misdemeanor-level drug charge.""

On Friday, Aug. 28, Vick is officially charged with a third-degree misdemeanor for possessing a ""concealed and open container of a narcotic."" That is an attempt to avoid registering a ""closed container"" drug as a controlled substance,"

""We've always said that it was just a matter of time until this one got out,"" John Lennon told CNN's Larry King. ""We went through a lot in our life and when it finally did it was absolutely exhilarating."" The men were just two of more than 150 music icons who spoke and wrote to King and King's wife, Megyn Kelly, through the live microphone. They described being young, poor, bitter about the end of their marriage, feeling they had let their families down and being so close to their children when they were estranged. They talked about the new songs they'd been working on, their new albums and their new marriages, as well as what they felt now should be a ""new era from us all,"" according to King. They said they felt the same way about their country. ""With all due respect to Vladimir Putin,"" Lennon said (after his comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin elicited anger from many in the studio audience), ""he probably thinks he's still in the 1950s."" (Kelly ended up laughing with what she said at the end.) ""At least in the UK people seem to be a lot happier now because they've been through this for four decades,"" he added. ""And so we kind of feel like we're back in that time."" (CNN) 10:20 a.m. ET

When you were a kid, it was very different in the old days with your parents, so you'd meet another family, and your friends, your gamble buddies and your bandmates, they're all your friends. But now you want to get to know the person that's your friend, the person that's your partner. It's the new era. ""The songs were writtenporary and I don't think that was necessary to have them written in one go,"" Lennon said. ""I think each of us has to be in the flow when it comes to the writing. It's like you know that your music has to be as perfect as it can be on the beat. It has to match up."" (The last time he sang together, and as a soloist, he sounded similar to his younger self.) ""It's very different in a lot of ways, a lot of things still haven't worked out. Some of the things in the new songs still don't work."" He said there's ""a lot more pressure at this point, being the leader of the band and then in your own life."" The group, though, has been able to ""rethink a lot,"" he said, because of having such a wide circle of people around them. ""It's been nice to not feel that everybody is going to feel that you have to conform to the group."" Lennon said his band is ""really like home at the moment."" After all, the band had a lot of the same challenges that they've faced since the Beatles broke up and their reunion with Harrison in 1970. ""I think everyone's different now,"" he said of his band. ""I didn't want it to feel like I had been in one group all my life. Everyone felt I was going to be playing things that I wasn't ready for in the new songs -- being a rocker I wasn't 100%. So all of a sudden, I had to let go a little bit. Now I feel just as comfortable as I used to be, which has been a huge relief. ""So it's been a great feeling."" The group also talked about their new album, and said the best thing to happen to the group was that Harrison didn't die suddenly in a motorcycle accident in 2005 but died five months later, aged uncomfortable as he began to recover from his cancer. (He said in a phone call after he passed away that he'd been worried that his cancer was getting worse.) ""For me it has been like a new beginning, a new way of living,"" they said.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to make a political comeback later this summer after four years out of public view to seek his party's presidential nomination in 2008. (Reuters)

Former Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to make a political comeback later this summer after four years out of public view to seek his party's presidential nomination in 2008. (Reuters)

John Edwards, a former Democratic vice president and the party's nominee in 2008, has suspended his presidential campaign, his campaign announced Wednesday in a brief statement.

Edwards, 36, will remain on the primary ballot and compete in Super Tuesday states, his campaign said. The former Louisiana congressman will continue to run his Senate challenge to Democratic incumbent Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton before the November 2008 Democratic National Convention.

After four years out of public view, Edwards, a Democrat who lost the presidency twice to Republican George W. Bush, is a favorite to win the Republican difficulties that will come with the candidacy, the spokesman for the Edwards campaign said in a telephone interview Wednesday.

""We think that he should be able to compete, but we are taking some action right now in order to keep things moving in our direction,"" said Jonathan Safran Foer, Edwards' deputy campaign manager. ""While we have not decided yet if or when the campaign will end, we are confident in being ready for the nomination fight going into the summer and summer after.""

The announcement from Edwards' team came as the campaign appeared set to wrap up a critical weekend -- its final weekend in a bid to prevent President Obama's candidacy from growing. Early in the campaign, Edwards' advisers said they were counting on their former colleague with the CIA in the White House to help out, with help from New Hampshire, a state traditionally favored by Democrats.

Edwards suspended his campaign for the Senate last month. The last time he ran for president was in 2004, when he announced his candidacy for the Democrats' nomination then for Vice President. Edwards finished third in New Hampshire with 2.5 percent of the vote.

 population_small_pop_size.html New Hampshire political map.

After the end of his term as CIA director, Edwards made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 against then-Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, another U.S. senator from the early-voting primary who faced no opposition from the Democratic establishment.

Edwards' supporters were optimistic about his chances for a comeback this time around. They said he was having trouble with his fundraising after spending big in the past few years in an attempt to keep alive his presidential campaign, while supporters believed Edwards deserved a shot at president.

""We think he still has a good chance to win the nomination, but we Survivor-minded people can have a very, very close conversation about it over the next several months,"" said David Paleologos, director of the Tulane University pollster.

Edwards will ""still be in touch with our field in New Hampshire,"" the Edwards spokesman said. ""He thinks we're going to make a real run for the nomination, and that the polls are all in and he'll be back then. We might not agree on everything, but we'll be in touch.""

Edwards said he would discuss his plans ""with you personally in the coming weeks.""

The end of his bid is not a political setback in the sense that Edwards had been favored to win the presidency in 2008 by the political establishment and his allies.

""Senator Obama will have the vast majority of the votes necessary to become president,"" said former Missouri Democratic Party Chairman Bill Holmstead, the party's president at the time."

We do not need an ""expert"" to explain how things are for us. The news is the story. You need only hear it to believe.


Why are politicians so afraid of a word they can simply say? The only reason you hear that word so frequently in politics is because there are so many of them. And all too often that word means something bad, like ""bigot.""

The word ""communist"" doesn't mean anything. It's a synonym for ""loser"" that just doesn't sound convincing in today's political climate.

People who can't pronounce the word ""communist"" like to point to John McCain as proof that ""communism"" does not apply to the Republicans at all anymore. But it doesn't. And if anyone thinks this might be changing, they are mistaken. Just look at what the president's new policy in Syria will do! Nothing good will come out of it.

So who are most afraid of what a word really means? Democrats and people of color — people who are not exactly sure they want to hear anything that might upset them.

It is time for politicians to stop talking about people's feelings and start talking about what's best for them."

From a story in The Economist, ""Indian doctors say they must consider whether to use the drugs that destroy normal ovaries of women with severe womb conditions when they treat a child with a rare genetic condition."" (June 2, 2002)

From a story in the Economist in the English-speaking edition, May 23, 2002:


In India, a woman has a 99 per cent chance of being sterilised after her womb is destroyed with a drug, according to an estimate from one of the country's most eminent experts. The doctor was quoted by newspapers as saying: ""Every woman who has a damaged womb is being sterilised.

""It is the only method now available. Otherwise she goes into labour and comes out of it with an intra-uterine injury. The obstetrician will perform sterilisation on the child. He will take a sample of the foetus to be tested for abnormalities and the mother will then be sterilised.

""Even if there is no abnormality, the chances are too high. And an operation is likely to be more invasive and potentially dangerous."" A survey of hospitals and paediatricians in six cities published on December 9th found one in three believed sterilisation carried a high risk of death. In addition, 1 in 3 had at least one child with a deformity requiring medical treatment. The surgeon, who did not want to be named, said more than half of the cases had to be cancelled due to poor recovery.

The American Center for Medical Progress published an undercover video in the Boston Herald on May 20th, 2004, showing employees and consultants working in India in which a man appears to be selling sterilised eggs. A doctor has called for a ""crisis in medical ethics for doctors treating disabled children."" A woman says, ""The way this was done, I am now sterilised. It is like being shot in the belly.""

From an article by Gail Sheehy which appeared in New York magazine, May 28, 2004:


... Dr. Rajan Grewal is the lead researcher for the Medical Birthrights Center in India. He has been studying the practice since the mid-1980s, and says that while some doctors here are eager to get children for their own use, the number seeking sterilisation as a way to avoid disabilities is growing. Dr. Grewal says there is no requirement for the procedure to be performed in India. ""They don't want it because you die sooner than you go to prison,"" he says. ""A little girl with a cystic birth defect who is going to die is a human being. That could become her next of kin.""

From a report in The Washington Post on April 15th, 2004, on the use of the drug RU-486 in the United States by gynecologists, who say there have been a series of serious cases of women seeking surgeries for conditions including cysts and uterine fibroids.


From the BBC article, ""Uterine fibroids: Where they're taking us"" published on April 30th, 2004:


Tory Mihlstedt, who lives at the northern end of London, went to university in Germany and is doing his medical practises in India. He has never found it necessary to seek surgery apartment for his patients because he was simply too busy trying to save the women who want a hysterectomy - even if it means sterilisation.

In Germany, Mihlstedt said he is ""not too worried"" because when a woman has just a cyst, she is not treated all that intensively. ""I see a cyst every year,"" he said. ""It is very rare indeed that a woman will need an operation."" His advice to gynecologists: ""Don't ask for surgery unless the patient asks for it. When you are going through treatment for an injury from childbirth, you need to be able to refer to your family doctor to discuss something in depth and discuss the possibility of surgery with that family doctor.""

Family of slain girl upset soldier wasn't sentenced to death, Reuters says. At least 11 people killed in mortar attacks in Baghdad, Interior Ministry says."," Iraq's Sunni mayor promises a third term.

A new Iraq war — which would extend Iraq's occupation by six years — may not come until 2003. ""We have no hope for 2004 either,"" says the Iraqi leader, Jalal Talabani. ""Our main focus is the 2005 election and a government prepared to do justice and stop our humiliation.""

In a sense, Iraq's elections are just a sign of things to come. Iraq's Sunnis have been seeking reform on the national level for 20 years, and they are unlikely to receive political concessions this time around. Instead, the elections are seen as an opportunity for Talabani's PUK, or Popular Mobilization Unit, to win power after the first round of elections in April. ""The election should be for our people,"" Al Abadi says. ""But to achieve that, we will have to work all our efforts and try every possible way of creating hope.""

The president isn't in the mood to negotiate easily. He sees the election as a chance to hold on to his seat until the election results are announced April 24. But to prevent the possibility of violence or coup, he says his government will be ""more aggressive, more effective and more firm in punishing the extremists until we bring this country back to democracy.""

The president won't be happy that a recent statement by the U.S. ambassador to Iraq was viewed by some as a betrayal. And the military leaders have become increasingly concerned by the government's failure to hold a single session of parliament, which they consider crucial for holding elections on schedule and for taking steps to disarm extremists.

As if to underline those worries, a suicide bomber killed three American soldiers on Feb. 15 — three days after the parliament session was set to begin.

On the first night of the first meeting of parliament, Talabani ordered every member to take their seats because the House had been declared vacant. During its first 10 minutes in session, it was called back as the speaker of the house had gone to hospital. ""I was concerned that if the houses were filled, we would be on for 10 more days,"" Talabani recalls.

The president's security men were out in force the next morning. Talabani had brought his own security officers dressed with the best suits of the period. With U.S. forces out of Iraq, the military came in. A week later, a top general was killed. The U.S. Embassy was bombed, the U.N. was overrun and Saddam Hussein was ousted.

While the president and his top staff are cautious about taking action beyond Iraq's borders, he is not backing down from any future war against militants or any threat to his rule. He will probably need the approval of other party leaders to initiate a second Iraq war, although he is not about to take any risks. ""There will be no second Iraq war,"" one former high official says.

As for the Sunni militants, Talabani insists that he will not use the current parliament to impose any kind of political settlement, but will take the necessary steps to ensure that justice prevails. He will not sign in power a new constitution that would give Talabani more power but also would not change the law. He will not agree to the return of U.S. troops. He won't accept the return of President Bush, but he will allow Bush to be a ""partner in the work"" and not a ""master.""

There's hope this time — just not long enough. The Iraqi parliament's session has come in for widespread jeering and protests, but there is, nevertheless, no sign of an immediate crisis on the horizon. The president is hoping that with a lot of hard work and commitment to the process, it will be worth the wait.

Noted parliamentarian killed along with four others during Wednesday rush hour. Flag-draped coffin paraded through streets before burial in Christian district. Day of national mourning called, with schools, universities, public offices shut.","

We could go on, but I think this short overview covers an overview of the picture of this tragedy.

My hope is that there's news like this that causes all concerned to rethink the policy of what is happening in the Middle East.

When I first heard of this terror-inspiring attack I did some quick research on the circumstances.

It all seemed pretty standard: A vehicle was blown up on the road between two Christian neighborhoods with a huge explosion.

A man driving by got out of, but the explosion damaged his car.

There was a huge manhunt for him, and he was caught, but was released soon afterwards.

There was an explosion at a place known to be a Hezbollah-sponsored mosque of some sort along the street, which seemed to be a bit suspicious.

Police later said it was from a gas bottle.

There was a Hezbollah member inside.

But who can anyone really be sure?

It seems that the Hezbollah members were innocent bystanders who had no apparent connection to this act of terror. And they were killed in a kind of double-tap – killing on the road, but also in an ambush, on the way to the mosque.

The bomb blew up a few places around, so the body count was quite a bit higher than just the ones taken in at the scene.

I went looking for more information after that, but didn't find it any better than what I had before. (You can see that in a series of articles I did starting here and here.)

There were lots of conspiracy theories being circulated, some of which I agree with.

Here's one on the left – the U.S. Government was behind this attack.

What I don't agree with, is this one that I saw on Facebook.

Another version of this theory stated that Hezbollah had been ""neutralized"" after their ally Bashar al-Assad was deposed.

Well – I'm not a fan of anti-government conspiracy theories, so I won't deal with them here. And neither should anybody else.

But I am sure I'll see some people arguing about this as I search for anything else in the immediate aftermath.

UPDATE 22 July 2015

So it turns out that the death toll in this attack – which killed four Lebanese Christians – was actually less than that of the 2005 truck bombing which killed 241 Iranian diplomats in Beirut. (The same death toll was claimed by the so-called Islamic State.)

There were just 13 dead, not the 24 or 27 that were taken in by this terror attack. Most of the dead were in the Christian district.

The death toll in that attack was said to be 20, despite the fact that there were two different bombings: The first was a suicide car bomb against a bus carrying Iran's envoys. The second one targeted a Hezbollah ""training camp"" at the entrance to the area.

While the media were just beginning to cover the explosion in southern Beirut, there was also two other attacks against Christian targets in Lebanon.

Most importantly, the head of security for the northern district of Beit Lahiya had just been murdered.

The reason? Hezbollah supporters in that district tried to stop the head of security's murder, after they had heard that he was a Christian, in the street.

The story was that they fired tear gas canisters outside his home, and he got in his car and fled to safety. If you go to this YouTube video, if you can just imagine the man in that video sobbing, then you're in for one heck of a shock – he had just been murdered.

If you're interested, here's an original video of the man, with his body in the dirt where he lay, as a crowd has taken to chanting ""Death to Christians.""

The Lebanese media, though, have done nothing to cover this incident and, sadly, they've only begun to discuss it after it happened. (You can find the original story below, here.)

The New Daily reported:

The head of head of security for the northern district of Beit Lahiya has reportedly been murdered by his bodyguards, in an assassination carried out for unknown reasons, a local media report saidAaron Yalish, who was serving as head of security in the neighborhood of Beit Awwa, had recently been appointed as head of security of the region, which includes the Lebanese city of Arsal.The security and government officials of the region have not yet disclosed the reason for the assassination.

Nair talks about having her own ""Black female filmmaker"" and saying her ""white white male directors haven't gotten the black female directors they deserve"" in the film industry.

Three adult suspects in Sean Taylor slaying on suicide watch. Taylor died after being shot in home invasion last week."," ""This is an ongoing investigation,"" police spokesperson Laura McElroy said Sunday. Two armed suspects in fatal shooting of a man in the Northeast Broward neighborhood. A man was shot and killed while waiting for bus early Sunday. A second gunshot that was heard about 3 p.m. at a residential yard near Sunrise Drive and North Lauderdale Road, police said. ""We can't tell you if the individuals were shot or not,"" McElroy said during Sunday's news conference. Earlier Sunday, officers found a shell casing and an orange plastic water bottle on a backyard of a home in the 1500 block of North Broward Road, according to the Miami Beach Police Department. The homeowner, whose name was not provided, said he was surprised to find the bottle, which he said he finds funny. Earlier Sunday, police said the investigation is focused on Rivera and the others involved in the fatal shootings. They said ""there are a number of leads that we are actively pursuing."" No charges have been issued against the teens involved in the shootings, police said Monday. Police said earlier that Rivera had been involved in a domestic dispute just a few days earlier. A witness told police that Rivera's girlfriend came to the man's home and began yelling at him. She pulled a gun and began pounding on the door to the home. He told the woman to stop. ""They were yelling at each other at the door,"" the witness told police. ""I was sitting out front here, watching. I saw the shooting first. The gun went off."" The witness said the gunshots were fired about 1 a.m., police said. Rivera, the friend said, became angry and shot at the woman. It was unclear Sunday night whether Rivera had a gun and whether the woman was hit. However, police said he was armed, according to a local TV report. He left home and was seen driving away in a vehicle. Police said he is 17 years old. McElroy said he was taken into custody Monday night. An 11-year-old boy was also arrested for possessing cocaine, McElroy said. Police have also secured several warrants for Rivera's arrest. Rivera's attorney, Michael Johnson, issued a statement Monday evening. The claim made on his Facebook page is not true, McElroy said. ""It is also not true that Mikey killed another person,"" McElroy told News4jax.com. ""That would suggest he is a killer but it does not fit any of the stories that are being reported."" Miami Beach Mayor Tomás Regalado said there is an effort underway to remove Rivera from his home. They will have to go through a process of removing him by court order if need be. ""The Mayor and the City of Miami Beach welcome and support the efforts of the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Fenrir Task Force,"" Regalado said in a release Monday. ""The Mayor is very proud of the fact that our crime rates have dropped as a result of the Fenrir Task Team. He is hopeful that the task force would be able to accomplish what was previously not even possible: make this community a safer community by making the arrest of these men."" Regalado said if Rivera is convicted and sentenced to less than 40 years, ""I would hope that he would serve less than his punishment."" No charges have been filed against the teens. Rivera is charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and possession of cocaine. The other teens are charged with murder. Rivera's family has denied any notion of a vendetta. They said it is an ongoing dispute between Rivera and his girlfriend's mother. She said he shot at her and broke their engagement. The incident occurred last Wednesday before midnight in the 2500 block of Sunrise Drive. The victim, 22-year publicity photographer Andrew Stahl, was found unresponsive on his bathroom floor with a gunshot wound to his abdomen. He was pronounced dead Monday at Broward Health North. The mother and her son had previously been involved in an argument with her son's mother when she tried to take advantage of him by inviting him to a birthday party for her daughter. ""That did lead to the argument that was going to happen at this residence,"" Regalado said. That argument ended with an attempted robbery, Regalado said. The two teenagers are being held on $3 million bond, which is about double the bail set for them last week. Rivera is a public servant, so when that happens, you have to question, what good is that? But he is going to have to answer to that. The 17-year-old is charged with aggravated battery in connection with the attack. The second teen is still under investigation and there is no information about his involvement as of Monday. McElroy said the trio is suspected"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Coast Guard initial assessment: Human error probably involved. It was crew's first voyage on Cosco Busan, which hit Bay Bridge in dense fog. Crew not allowed to leave ship due to federal law, says Coast Guard. Feds launch criminal probe; 58,000 gallons leaked and killed nearly 400 birds."," (AP)

A little bit of luck went a long way, and the crew was able to clear the bridge, but the incident triggered an investigation that led to the charges filed against the captain.

""We've learned and that's always great in a disaster,"" said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Zach Dzambierz, who served with Petty Officer 2nd Class Eric Shaffer on the busenai. ""The crew was there to take a lot of chances, and they got it right.""

What's unclear is whether any of the charges against Captain Ives could lead to the captain being removed from his ship in the first place and what consequences may be imposed by the Coast Guard and other U.S. military officers once a shipmate is tried and sentenced.

Feds say pilot flew too close to shore in crash near Hilo

""If the crew is guilty of any offense under the laws, then they will be prosecuted and convicted,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney John Fudenberg said at a press conference Thursday morning.

The Navy's Pacific Fleet Commander Rear Adm. Scott Swift said his navy was aware of the ship's accident and the charges and that additional investigation was underway.

""If (the charges have) been made into crimes that they are, we take it very seriously,"" Swift said.

The busenai's voyage had been supposed to be over when the Japanese Coast Guard and the U.S. Coast Guard arrived to assist when Coast Guard officials reported the incident on Dec. 31, 2014.

The Busan was sailing away from Hilo during a hurricane on Dec. 18. A pilot of the ship had an electronic failure, which caused a sudden increase in speed, and the pilot attempted to correct that by moving to the right, the Coast Guard said in a statement today.

Coast Guard pilots tried to avoid colliding with the ship's propellers and the result was a collision in which a Japanese ship went down, according to coast guard officials at the time.

The Busan was flying at about 100 knots, the speed the pilot should have been at when he went to correct the rate of speed.

The Busan crew was told to divert off the island of Kauai, where it had anchored two days earlier. As the boat was heading towards a beach about 1,000 yards off shore, it started to drift sideways and struck an island, U.S. officials said.

The wreck remains on the island, where the crew remains in custody pending a trial scheduled for January 2015.

Brett Stelter of the Stelter Report, in a May analysis of the accident, said it appeared the pilot had hit a reef."

4. Ask about the culture, history, or religion of the country you're looking to emigrate to.

Don't assume everyone knows everything. Your country's roots (and culture!) are probably as relevant to you as the names of every restaurant you're going to be eating at, even if yours aren't (and shouldn't be) native languages. Ask!

Don't be shy to ask.

5. Don't ask why the people of your country are so happy.

They'll probably just say they're not, or that you should check out a country closer to home if you're still interested in a more relaxed approach. If you want someone to tell you to check out something, it may be that they don't know and don't feel comfortable answering. That's alright though—it's easier to just wait and watch and get invested in a country whose people are so clearly so happy.

6. Don't ask what the country is famous for.

Sure, Switzerland is famous for cheese, but your first stop should certainly be somewhere with more cheese, then.

7. Don't ask, ""Are you from Australia?""

No, no, no, no. We mean no.

8. Ask, ""What's your favourite thing about the country,"" when you speak to them.

Even if they're in a foreign country speaking no English, you'll know you haven't been rude, even if they won't know (or even care, if you've already figured out how to ask them).

9. If they don't like a question, go somewhere else.

If you want to make a lasting impression on them, try doing something they really enjoy: go to a local restaurant, shop at a local bookstore, run a local race or participate in the local art festival, or whatever it is you like to do together when you hang out with them.

10. Don't try to force them to tell you their name before asking.

If they're already on the phone, try this: ""Oh no, this is from Australia. Tell me your name to see what I sound like."" That might work if they give you their international ID number, but it's not going to feel right unless they're really sure they know you.

9 Great tips for meeting people in every city

There are a few things every entrepreneur should include in their business strategy of meeting people. And of course, it helps if you've learned a few tips already.

1. Don't be a dick

Most people hate meeting people, but if you're genuinely interested in people, it's probably better to treat them appropriately. In a business-to-business conversation, you absolutely don't need to try and get people to talk about ""their"" idea, and try and find out why people have such strong opinions. If you're really worried about people feeling uncomfortable, consider setting up a meeting with a friend of yours or someone who speaks with the same background (if you can figure that out).

2. Don't make an excuse unless you have to
 vacancy, for a work interview, or for security reasons.

Everyone has been there. I've personally been there and back. And even if you haven't, that's ok. Just find somewhere to be quiet.

3. Try to find some ""fun"" things to do together

Here's what not to do.

You: ""This would be really fun, wouldn't it?""

Me: ""Yeah, I've always wanted to do this.""

You: ""No, you like it? Do you want to do it?""

Me: ""Not really… what do you want to do?""

You: ""How's your week going?""

Me: ""It's going great. I'm having a really good time.""

You: ""So you're gonna do this?""

Me: ""Yeah, it's a great idea.""

You: ""Great for you! Tell your friends!""

Me: ""No, I think it's too expensive for us to do it.""

You: ""Great! Sounds like a dream come true!""

There's no one-size-fits-all approach to meeting people and you shouldn't feel too pressured into following the same rules. Remember, everyone is different, your target market will most likely speak a different language, and you may want to play in the """

Cairo: Al-Azhar (Egypt's oldest and largest university, founded in 718 BC) on Sunday urged all international Islamic scholars in the Western world to support US President Donald Trump's ban on Muslims entering the USA.

The Islamic university at the end of the Grand Mosque in Cairo urged ""all scholars and students"" to ""form political pressure on those who oppose the decision"" by calling on ""all of those who support US policies to respect the sovereignty of the country they represent"".

Al-Azhar (Egypt's oldest and largest university, founded in 718 BC) and the University of Cairo, which belong to the same institution, said that ""this announcement is a victory for Islam, which protects the rights of others"".

Al-Azhar head Nasser al-Oteini said the decision to ban the admission of Muslim Americans to the USA ""has resulted in a large loss"" on Muslim families worldwide. He said no country had imposed similar restrictions on its citizens until now.

""The decision by the White House in the United States, which will affect people who are here in America, will take them away from their families and friends,"" Mr Al-Oteini said (IN). Saudi Arabia's parliament this past week approved a law that bars judges from expressing their personal opinions.

According to a report in the Saudi daily Al-Eqtisadiah on Saturday (October 11), a group of female judges, mostly clerics opposed to President Donald Trump's US immigration policy, received ""death threats"" for joining the Saudi community in the USA.

The report cited a judge in the Western city of Al Khobar who was warned on his Facebook timeline and warned on the phone by someone that his life will be in danger if he dared to support the President's anti-immigration policy. The judge had earlier refused to enforce the travel ban because of the threats he received.

The Saudi Arabia's official Arab News Service said earlier this year that more than a dozen judges had received death threats after they stood against President Donald Trump's executive order banning citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US.

Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir announced that two of three judges of the Kingdom's top administrative court, the General Civil Appeal Court, had refused to abide by a 2016 court ruling that ordered them to enforce Trump's anti-immigration policy.

The newspaper said that a court ruling in April 2015 had declared ""that a number of officials have interfered in the decision-making process in the courts… as a result of their belief that their personal beliefs should form the foundation of the judicial system"".

According to the newspaper, a third case in December 2016 was halted, however, because a judge refused to enforce the ruling of the same court declaring he must comply with Trump's ban.

According to one Saudi lawyer, one member of Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court, who is being held in an American jail in Washington, D.C., was sentenced to 10 years in jail for ""insulting Islam"".

According to RFE/RL's Arabic service (RIA), the Justice Department says at least two people are currently detained for ""promoting hatred against the United States"".

I'm sure this scenario will be repeated next Friday when news reporters in Virginia try to obtain information on who did the worst shopping mall shooting in U.S. history: the gunman was mentally unstable, had no criminal record, was a former member of an armed gang, etc., etc. I have no idea if I'll be on the cover of the next edition of Sports Illustrated. You'd think I'd be, considering how I feel about that magazine's readership.

I know that's a ridiculous question, since the whole ""I'm sorry you're out of shape"" thing only makes sense if you think it's entirely reasonable to expect every high schooler in America to be the world class athlete they are supposed to be, and to expect that every teenage guy from middle school to the age of 24, who once thought he couldn't commit a crime ever, will someday. The difference between a group of people who are well-dressed and well-behaved and one who is full-on psychopath or a group of people who are full-on psychopaths is so slight as to almost be inconsequential.

That said, we really ought to do a better job of teaching young people that no one is a ""normal"" human being and why people can be vicious, or mentally ill, or just completely unstable, in any given circumstance when they are not even trying to do anything wrong. If people think they're ""normal"" because they have nice cars and good jobs—and I don't blame them—then it's very likely they think that people like them who also have nice cars and good jobs or do good jobs are somehow more ""normal"" because they can just drive down a one-lane freeway with no accident-prone passengers and get right to work. That's just not how human beings work. There's an entire science class dedicated to understanding how social order is built and maintained.

I have a theory on why this is a dangerous misconception: it's like the belief that women are somehow somehow less intelligent, or less honest, or less loyal, or more prone to committing crimes. We're all just human beings, capable of anything in our wild nature, just like there are some animals that really don't want to go hunting and can't hunt at all. This is called basic moral reasoning. We're all, at times of great emotion, very likeable and likable, unlike some of the monsters out there.

This doesn't mean that I think people are all ""normal,"" but you probably wouldn't want to meet a member of my own species in person. I'm not going to sit by as that person shoots up a shopping mall full of people for no reason and nobody ever has to say ""Why did he shoot up that mall?! We didn't know?!""

The problem is that people can't understand what really sets someone high in their own estimation from someone whom they've never met anywhere; it's just not important to them. It's only important when they're facing some kind of judgment: ""He's so much better than me."" Or whatever.

To be fair to myself, I am pretty ""normal"" by human standards, if you prefer the word. I am a good cook, I play piano, I enjoy music. I'm not a doctor, but I can work in a hospital. I'm a successful writer. I do well in my career and have some pretty good relationships. I do all the things a person would want to do, but I also happen to like watching The Sopranos.

You'll find the information here. (And please note that we're Casnost-ing the story here; we have no evidence that any of these stories were published.)

A brief review of the evidence and possible ways of improving the system—in order of importance—shows:

1. The RFID tag system still appears to be a very complex system, but it may be more efficient than other options.

2. In the event of an accident with a baggage handler, airport officials would likely assign the incident to the Styrofoam container in which the bag had been placed. They could also be informed of the exact state of the baggage.

3. It remains unlikely the baggage tag tracking system would be able to identify the contents of each box quickly, so it would not be of much use in a rush.

4. In the event of a serious problem during the flight, the passengers would be notified by phone or postcard hegemony.

5. If there is any doubt about a flight's destination, or if a passenger needs goalie security, luggage tag tracking would be adequate.

If anyone has any further information relating to the accuracy of luggage tag tracking (or any other aspects of baggage security), or if you are interested in learning whether you are being targeted by those very people and their agents, we would love to hear it. It's all online here.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Telegram: King Hussein wanted U.S. strike on invading Syrian troops in 1970. Nixon White House urged Saudis to distance from PLO's Fatah organization. Papers also discuss Israeli acquisition of nuclear weapon. Documents among 10,000 papers released Wednesday by Nixon Library.","

The declassified government papers come amid a series of controversies relating to the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.

The documents shed light on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, which was key to the plot. The documents, released Wednesday in a massive set of papers released by the U.S. National Archives, include excerpts from the late King Abdullah's memoirs.

One portion of a handwritten letter dated April 17, 1969, notes that the United States should consider a potential strike against the PLO and warns of their influence over Iran.

Abdullah wrote, ""The PLO are carrying out activities against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps... with a view that we should be prepared to defend ourselves.""

The author of the note, which was written on behalf of Saudi Arabia's intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Qasim Saeed al-Zoubi, concluded that the United States should strike against Islamic militants in the Middle East. The letter, which was translated into Arabic, has been posted on the websites of several U.S. news agencies.

Nixon White House staff counsel John Dean said Wednesday the U.S. government had received a declassified copy of the Saudi documents earlier this year and had been provided with additional material for review.

""As we have said prior, this information should not be used to justify actions that are not already underway. As such, we are not at liberty to say any more than that some or all of these documents may present a topic of discussion for consideration by the administration,"" Dean said.

There was no attempt by the White House to remove the reference to the Islamic world in the secret U.S. government documents on Saudi Arabia, which were released after months of secrecy in an effort to clear up doubts about the Bush administration's account of the Sept. 11 events.

Many historians and researchers have long suspected that Saudi Arabia was a key ally of Israel, a claim that has been repeated by current and former U.S. officials who have testified under oath before committees investigating the events of Sept. 11, 2001.

The secret documents do not contain the detailed, detailed allegations that the Saudi government is behind the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because the Bush administration and the Saudis were in negotiations to declassify the files and that both countries had agreed during the negotiations that the Saudi papers should be removed, Dean said.

Nevertheless, he said, the new release of the Saudi files showed that there were problems with declassification.

""Anytime there are concerns with declassification, which we were aware of, and concern about the contents of these documents, it is something we have to deal with,"" Dean said."

WEEK 7

Week 7, a.k.a. a ""Monday-afternoon news dump,"" can be a real slog, with little news to report. However Monkey See's editors and reporters take advantage of a Thursday before Memorial Day (Saturday, April 30).

""In his inaugural speech, Eisenhower promised he would build the steel workers' peace,"" says Monkey See's editor Joe D'Aleo. ""He did and then some. The steel workers went on strike. He got the National Guard to go onto the field at night. The National Guard did what Eisenhower promised. They went out and arrested 200 marchers who were breaking into the office of the new Civil Rights Commission in Little Rock, Arkansas, and disrupting its work. They had a pretty good crowd, and the Commission was fired up. So they were pretty happy in the first week.""

But the Commission continued its work, despite the threat of a federal indictment.

""This was the only presidential election since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and you're probably wondering how it was done,"" Joe D'Aleo continues. ""The answer is in the middle of a labor dispute that was in the midst of a massive civil rights march. The Labor Department was trying to enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act. They wanted to make the railroad companies adhere to an equal-pay law, for instance. Some of the union members wanted to protest. The Department of Agriculture was trying to enforce the Fair Food and Drug Act, as well. They wanted to control their members' consumption of 'underground beer,' etc.

""A union leader had organized the marchers, for example. They were taking care of the marchers even though they had the support of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior and the Department of Labor. The labor leaders, too, were willing to risk jail to defend the marchers. Ultimately, because of the government's interference in the strike, the marchers won their right to picket. The strike was eventually ended peacefully, with no charges filed against the labor leaders. But if you're looking for one of the very rare presidential campaigns in American history when the media really didn't pick up the story, that is the week of June 3, 1964.""

It's also the week the U.S. Supreme Court, based on a controversial precedent written by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and upheld by Scalia himself, rejected an attempt by the federal government to enforce a voting registration law.

""The voter registration law had been a major focus in the March for Jobs and Freedom. And the Supreme Court had held that they were in fact valid, but the way that the law was presented to and enforced was unconstitutional, and the Justice Department had just issued a statement saying it was invalid. Now it was up to the states to decide whether to enforce it or not,"" says Monkey See editor David D'Aleo. ""Sixty-four of the 75 states did it.

""But the major battleground was Pennsylvania, and in Pennsylvania, the Justice Department made it impossible for any voter registration organization to get on the polls. Not a single one. Well, actually, they actually made it impossible for them to operate anywhere in the country. And that forced Philadelphia and Philadelphia in the heart of the Democratic Party to call a statewide election. It wasn't a very popular election, even though every other jurisdiction thought it was great. They sent mailers and handbills and hand-cards and talked to people on the street.

""So the Justice Department is being accused today of undermining the very essence of democracy. But the whole thing was a political stunt,"" says D'Aleo. ""The decision by an unelected court in 1965, after the most contentious election of anyone's lifetime in America, to effectively end the very foundation on which the United States of America had been founded was pretty shocking. It was one of the worst decisions in American history.""

That decision was also called the infamous ""Citizens United"" decision, which found, without a moment's hesitation, that corporations have the same rights to freedom of speech as individuals.

""That gave corporations the right to give unlimited money, unlimited money in a way the states couldn't touch. The Supreme Court had made it clear that corporations are people. If they can't spend money, the States can't regulate them,"" says D'Aleo. ""It didn't take long before the right wing, on the right, realized that this would really cause a lot of damage, which it did. Many major corporations donated millions to the Republican Party.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Justice Department must decide whether to pursue investigation. Former agent John Kiriakou talked about interrogation technique on TV. Kiriakou attorney says probe could cause CIA more problems. Administration summoned for court hearing on destroyed tapes.,"

A summary that does not mention any of the events in question is provided -- but it does mention Kiriakou having received a medal for his work in Iraq during an interview with ABC News correspondent David Martin.

He was also honored as an ""exemplary hero"" by The New York Times, which said it was the first time a journalist had received that honor.

The full account appears to provide no confirmation of the CIA's alleged involvement and could even indicate that there was no ""intelligence failure.""

Nevertheless, the document also states:

""In addition to this letter, Mr. Kiriakou has also submitted a letter of resignation from The Agency.""

The Obama administration appears ready to have a public debate about the use of harsh interrogation tactics, including waterboarding, after reports that the president asked CIA Director John Brennan a question related to the issue during a recent meeting.

The question, according to the Washington Post, was whether Obama and Brennan had ordered harsh interrogations at Guantanamo, a question that led to the resignation of then-CIA Director Leon Panetta.

""General Brennan told him he had not, in fact, ordered that and suggested that the discussion might now focus on the war in Iraq,"" the Post reported.

It is also possible, some officials privately say, that Obama is pushing to have a public debate so he can respond to the issue at a time when he is facing pressure from Republicans over his support for the CIA's ""enhanced interrogation"" program.

The question is whether the administration is willing to actually confront one of its own intelligence officials over the use of torture.

While the CIA does not often release the type of information included in the document, it was a list of names of the 11 former agents, with titles such as ""Rumsfeld's personal torture bag.""

Most of the names come from the book by Thomas Drake, who was CIA director from 2003-2006 and was the source in 2010 when he leaked a CIA estimate that al-Qaeda and other extremist groups were behind the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The CIA said that figure was an error.

The document appears to address a recent debate, particularly in the U.K., about whether the government should conduct further intelligence-gathering and interrogation activities, possibly including torture, after the publication of a report by the Justice Department inspector general finding that the CIA's treatment of detainees was ""ineffective.""

The former agents in the document include John Kiriakou, who spoke to Martin on TV in 2010 and who was later fired by the agency; James Mitchell, who was the first to report the waterboarding techniques and who was fired by the agency in 2002; and James Clapham, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights. It also includes John Kiriakou's wife, Karen, identified as a former prison official of ""the Intelligence Community.""

The document was part of the Freedom of Information Act request that also sought additional information about ""all individuals who are or were associated with or formerly associated with (CIA)'s Iraq and Afghanistan missions."""

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Majid Khan's attorneys say he endured an ""aggressive"" interrogation program. Khan's allegations of torture redacted in court documents. Bush administration: Khan worked for 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. CIA: The United States does not conduct or condone torture.","

""I have no reason to believe that this is true,"" Bush said during an initial appearance before a federal judge.

A federal judge has ordered a new trial for Osama bin Laden's former attorney, Majid Khan, in the death of a former CIA employee. KHALED KHAN, son of a former CIA officer, is accused of providing false information to U.S officials investigating torture allegations against Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM). It just so happens that the father of his son, Majid Khan, also represented KSM's defense team before the 9/11 Commission.

Hazmi brothers

One of Osama bin Laden's sons, Salem al-Hazmi (a.k.a. Salem al-Hazmi), was detained in Italy in 2002 and has no intention of being extradited.

After his release, Salem spent six days in a U.S. prison, where there was an apparent dispute over his legal status. He has never been charged with a crime.

Abdulrahman al-Shehhi

The brother of Samir Khan and Abdulrahman al-Shehhi, Abdulrahman was detained after attempting to visit his brother on Thanksgiving 2004. He was charged in absentia with a visa violation and taken to a U.S. military facility in Afghanistan. According to The New York Times, he was released into U.S. custody the next day, despite the fact that he had no intention of returning to Afghanistan as a U.S. citizen.

The Post reported that the two men are thought to have had contact with each other prior to and during the invasion of Iraq. It's likely that the brother would have been released were it not for the fact that he was considered more dangerous than other detainees.

Included with this group were Khalid al-Midhar and Naji Abu Ghaith. Khalid was captured in Pakistan in 1998 and his brother Naji was detained following the 9/11 attacks.

Both al-Midhar and Abu Ghaith were released from U.S. custody without charges when they were released by Pakistani authorities. Osama bin Laden himself said in 1997 that he wanted them ""dead.""

Al-Midhar may have been tortured in U.S. custody. U.S. authorities claim that the detention center's interrogators subjected him to ""enhanced measures"" during his detention period. This is not a common practice and it's unclear whether or not the treatment was legal.

Alfred Abood

The nephew of convicted terrorist Mohamed Atta, Alfred is a Yemeni who was detained in Egypt. Alfred is known to be a member of an al Qaeda cell. He was released on March 17, 2008, after being detained for a second time in 2004.

Abood was released in spite of an Egyptian court ordering his extradition. He still faces charges of being an accessory to the murder of U.S. citizen, U.S. military contractor and Army major Tim McVeigh.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

Mohammad al-Mohammed is an al Qaeda and ISIS operative, which is to say, he's a long-term member of a terror organization. Mohammed has been detained for nearly a decade and has a long history of involvement with the terror cell that plotted the 9/11 attacks.

As Reuters reported earlier this year, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was arrested in March 2011 in connection with the vexing question of whether he was connected with 9/11. That's in spite of the fact that, according to Reuters's sources in the FBI and U.S. officials, Mohammed had no ties to the 9/11 attackers despite the fact that he was mentioned on the guest list at the hotel where most of the attackers were staying when attacks occurred.

Despite that, Mohammed is Harmony Jones' son.

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg ruled that Khaled Sheikh Mohammed can be extradited and that his son can stay in America if he so chooses. Boasberg's order is a win for U.S. officials who tried to obtain his arrest.

""This Court's decision today allows Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was born in Kuwait in 1970, to stay in the United States pending an extradition process that may never result in him returning to Kuwait, where he can be present at his son's sentencing,"" writes Boasberg.

In addition to Al-Mohamed, four individuals have been charged with being tied to the 9/11 plot: Khalid al-Midhar, Nabil Fadl, Mustafa al-Hawsawi and Adnan Far"

Write a news article based on the following summary: Judge: Lisa Nowak's statements and items in her car were unlawfully obtained. Nowak's attorneys have said her comments were made under duress. Former astronaut is accused of stalking and assaulting a romantic rival. Nowak has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted kidnapping.," Nowak claims she is being mistreated by the law enforcement authorities and the courts. [link to audio file and text file of audio file]

The above are not news; they are what you would expect in what appears to be a legal battle and civil dispute between an astronaut who may have ""exhibited emotional instability"" and an attorney who, in a somewhat odd twist of justice, is using a false accusation (made on tape) to gain political benefits (such as a seat on the nation's highest court).

What's particularly astonishing is that the accuser claims in several of her ""documents"", such as her legal complaint, that she has been unable to keep her ""secret,"" that all of her family was ""lucky"" that she remained in orbit and that, all in all, she ""could have been killed"" had she divulged the truth.

She alleges, according to documents released in response to a lawsuit she filed Wednesday, that the alleged victim, an astronaut stationed aboard the International Space Station, harassed her, punched her numerous times in the face, threatened her, and threatened to kill her.

According to Nowak's civil complaint, on two separate occasions on Christmas week in 2013, the victim allegedly ""went out of her way to annoy [Nowak] with profane, aggressive, and insulting language and gestures.""

These alleged actions, she alleges, resulted in a ""tampering,"" or attempt to falsify, of statements she made in her medical exam and personal statement forms:

""The statement form has an image on the front, which clearly is a female face, and that image is attached to the inside of another document that would appear to be another face. The image in the form includes a female face with hair,"" says Nowak. [emphasis added]

""She had the image with her for many months and in the medical form, as well as the interview with the doctor, one is required to answer a particular question about each face,"" Nowak alleges. ""She had never been asked about the other side, and at the start of the interview she said, 'Well, I have one side and you have another, but I am not going to take you seriously if I answer to you as if I'm not aware of my side of things.'"" In this case, Nowak claims that he asked her this question: ""Why do you go to so much trouble to lie? I mean why try to do it?"" In this case, she claims, he said, ""What are you getting me in for? It's not right."" She alleges that his response was, ""It would be right, I wouldn't think you would want to answer those type of questions."" [emphasis added]

""It's really hard to imagine why she thinks that she lied,"" says Nowak. The first time of the alleged incident, he says ""the victim seemed to be upset but that changed as time went on,"" and that during the second event in the alleged confrontation, the victim tried to strike Nowak ""with her hand"" but stopped.

This story is still developing, but it looks like Nowak, with help from a new attorney and an apparently high-paid lawyer, may get to show what she claims was the alleged victim's alleged ""lateral thinking"" moments in the courtroom yesterday.

""I believe that this court might be watching a very high-profile case go through this process and might take it as serious as it needed to be,"" said Nowak after the hearing.

She insists that she has cooperated with investigators and has not been denied her rights to a fair trial. ""I had four hours before this hearing, that was about two weeks before this last hearing and I believe I did everything that was supposed to be done.""

As for the alleged victim, now that she is claiming to have been harassed in her own home, Nowak says it sounds ""far-fetched"" that she would ""stalk"" an astronaut. Indeed, now that we have some word about the investigation underway, it hardly seems real.

There is no need to go any further into the details because, frankly, I don't know if she's got any here.

What I think she does have – and is reported as having had, as of 12/25/17 – are notes from a couple of interviews.

These notes were released by Lisa Nowak on December 23, in response to a lawsuit filed by the current ISS crew member, who claims, according to the notes, that a flight doctor warned her – and that NASA itself – of the alleged ""unethical conduct"" of Nowak and others"
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Sharon Long is forensic artist who creates faces from skulls. Fort Myers, Florida, police called her after they found eight sets of remains. Only two of the eight remains have been identified."," Her investigation into the case has led her to a small, wooded area near a town called Oak Cliff. She has found more skulls there.

She has learned that the bones tend to be buried in the sand, buried in a spot called the ""black-out zone."" She has discovered thousands of skull fragments, most of them very small. What she has learned makes her feel lucky.

""I've found human remains that are the size of a child's hand; not a human foot; nothing a normal eight-year-old child would want,"" she says. ""It's quite a beautiful, magnificent discovery.""

Long and her team of forensics experts have used the bones to create a portrait of a woman with a strange smile: a black-eyed, black-haired, black-haired smile with just one, tiny, white tooth. The same smile that appears in pictures of the children and children's bones.

In a news release sent to the public in December 2011, Long's lab confirmed the discovery of a skull with one or more human teeth with two of them missing. But the bones were not in the same location where the remains had been found. This indicates that the remains came from an unknown location. The news release says: ""The unknown location and lack of identifiable human remains means that the bone is most likely a child's or young woman's remains. However, it still appears that there was a child or young woman buried in the area."" This indicates the remains might have come from Southland in the 1990s and were buried in a different spot, probably less than a year before they were found in 2013.

The news release suggests that the bones came from a person with a ""wide nose,"" black eyes and hair and a ""muted face."" Some might find that intriguing. After all, a ""wide nose"" may indicate a strong-chinned person who is short and wiry.

The news release says we have identified the exact location of ""the likely resting place"" where a woman was found with ""two human teeth, one missing."" But this means that there must have been other bodies in that location, perhaps at a different point in time. Some could be in a different part of the city. And that's what's fascinating: Long's work suggests there were other people in Fort Myers at the time the remains were found, and they might have been in a remote location in the county in which they were found.

If there were other people in the area, there could have been some kind of ritual on the part of the people who buried the remains, perhaps about cremations or burials. If so, it is a reminder—and a reminder to others—of the darker side of Fort Myers. It's why it's called ""The Southland."" It's a place where people go, to make sure they're never alone."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Four-week-old polar bear separated from mother amid fears she would eat it. Nuremberg City Zoo's other polar bear ate its own two offspring earlier this week. Mother was showing signs of being upset and confused, zookeepers said."," Two cubs, the animals' polar opposites, were found dead near the polar bear's family dens. The other two cubs survived until they were captured by wildlife officials. Zoo chief Joachim Jaeger said the animals' mother must have caught one of the cubs by mistake, putting it in her mouth. The other cub was in great condition when it was rescued and is being treated by zookeepers. The zoo was evacuated with animals, and officials have since confirmed the species will live in captivity indefinitely, Jaeger said. This year the zoo issued aadoption request for the dead polar bears, but the zoo's staff never received this email and the mother never showed up at the Zoo. Zookeepers received a second email this week from the zoo's office saying that the mother likely went into seclusion early Tuesday morning as the zoo was closing for the night for a night of festivities that also included a surprise visit from the U.S. Coast Guard. It said the female bear stayed at the zoo after the last two cubs were orphaned. The staff had been told that the mother would probably return home for a short time after zoo reopen on Thursday, and the zoo sent the mother another email Wednesday saying she had been returned earlier that day. In the email, zoo officials said the mother's mother had been seen a short time before going into seclusion on Tuesday, and by that point the bear was missing for three days. In addition, zoo officials said the staff learned that the mother mother was suffering from medical problems and was having difficulty feeding two cubs. They said that in an email they received, the zoo's veterinarians had told zookeepers that the mother was ""suffering from a gastrointestinal upset that is likely due to feeding difficulties."" Jaeger, however, said the bear was found with no signs of illness and that she appeared to be fine.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Fran Townsend says she'll look for opportunities in the private sector. Townsend has worked in government and law enforcement for 25 years. Townsend will be on a panel searching for a replacement.,"

Write a summary based on the following details: Fran Townsend says she'll look for opportunities as a civil rights lawyer. Townsend is a partner at Skadden Arps and one of the co-founders of Black and Decker, now a federal public defender.

Write a summary about how Fran Townsend believes in civil rights and black values for a family audience of 1,000 or more.

You should note that if you are on the fence about writing articles about Fran Townsend's background, you still might read her opinion on NPR. You probably won't know any of it. That's because she's not the only civil rights lawyer with whom we spoke for this story. The person who hired Fran Townsend was none other than Eric Goldman, the CEO and co-founder of one of the largest hiring agencies in the country. He and Townsend hired each other. ""It's a very odd coincidence that we have the same background,"" he said.

The hiring of Emily Bazelon as the White House's first black employee has also been interpreted differently. ""I was asked to do it. This is the story,"" Goldman said. ""My personal view is that if the White House wanted to go in a different direction that's fine. But they had no authority to do it.""

That is true, but Goldman didn't believe Townsend was the right person to make that call, either. The White House should have consulted with its black employees and their allies to find one qualified and available to fill Bazelon's position. That person would then serve as the chief diversity officer and ensure that the diversity policy was in line with the president's long-term vision of equality. Goldman said that is precisely what the White House did.

""To me, this is about having a diversity officer in one of our senior offices, something that the Office of Government Ethics could recommend. I couldn't get on the phone with him.""

One is left wondering how the diversity policy and hiring process were ever implemented at the White House in the first place. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham wouldn't confirm whether it was under the original leadership of Tony Blinken or a new staff leader. She said the hiring of Bazelon was due, at least in part, to an overwhelming desire on President Obama's part.

""He's been passionate about it. He's been very activeintuitive it really was something he wanted to do."" Blinken, who has served as the chief diversity officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, said he knew when hiring a first black employee that it could take time. ""But, as long as he's engaged and as long as he does a good job, he's been very enthusiastic about it and it's been really refreshing."" Blinken said he didn't want to weigh in on the politics, but he does believe that when it comes to diversity, ""we've got to get beyond a culture of exclusion.""

""It's not just about having a bunch of white people sitting around a table and deciding whicharrett is somebody who deserves to be in there,"" said Blinken. ""In the long run, the American public will look at who they work with and if you get people with a diverse set of backgrounds, they'll work together.

""I've been impressed with the breadth, the ability -- it's not an intellectual field. Most of them just understand how to do their work. In the end, you're always looking for people with an ability to be flexible and be able to work on issues on behalf of the American people.""

Goldman said that the diversity policy, which does not require hiring interviews, would have taken 10 to 12 months. But that time might not matter, he said. In fact, he feels that a White House hiring office hiring policy would be better suited for organizations like the Center for American Progress. ""I think that if you look at the kind of people who go into those offices, they tend to have a broader perspective than you might typically find in that kind of thing. I certainly think they would be better suited for the policy part of it than the hiring part,"" he said.

However, he wouldn't say whether he thinks the diversity policy should continue past Bazelon's hire. It seems that her hire is indicative of a larger trend, at least on the hiring side of the political decision-making room. It seems that the White House staff does not need to bring in consultants from outside the government to do their diversity assessments and get recommendations from experts like Goldman or Bazelon.

""The government has asked me to get involved in the case, and I'm a lawyer,"" said Peter J. Fenton, partner at Zuckerman Spaeder LLP and a lawyer representing the plaintiffs. ""One of my concerns is that they've just made a very big and expensive mistake here.""


The case came to light as attorneys were preparing for the second year of a war over whether the Clinton administration and foreign governments were legally guilty of paying hundreds of millions of dollars to a Colombian military dictatorship and alleged human rights abuses. Critics of the case say it will be costly for the government of President Barack Obama to wage the war for the sake of the legal challenge against Clovis, a former Democrat. And even if the government settles, it won't be able to return the money.

The State Department declined comment.


The plaintiffs in the case are U.S. citizen Oscar López Rivera, who was arrested in Honduras on charges of taking part in a 2002 coup, U.S. contractor Alberto Nisman, whom officials allege killed himself after being threatened by a former National Security Agency official, and a Mexican national, Gustavo Alfredo Lopez Rodríguez, accused by U.S. prosecutors of participating in an alleged drug-farming ring run by Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, Fenton said.

[...] ""It's unfortunate that this case, with the amount it will cost, has emerged as it has,"" says Scott Drenkard, senior partner with BakerHostetler and a leading adviser to an ongoing State Department probe of human rights issues inside Cuba. ""It will make finding any violations more difficult and that's what should worry U.S. officials in Cuba and around the world.""

[...] In a statement to CNET News, the State Department said the Department ""firmly rejects allegations of criminal conduct"" and said ""The U.S. government has not used these entities in any capacity that may have violated the right to life, and has not tolerated the use of such entities for nefarious purposes.""


The case has sparked debate between attorneys for the plaintiffs and the U.S. government, with the latter asserting that the lawyers are biased.

[...] Fenton notes that the Colombian government has given the plaintiffs' attorneys a ""very limited number of immunity agreements"" and that many of those ""cannot be fulfilled."" In addition, ""I'd be very concerned if the government were to give them immunity from civil prosecution"" or to avoid paying for damages, Fenton says. Even if the 👤️👎 👥👅 pic is not of a person dead, 👍 the 👍 👍, (2) is a 👎 👍 and👍 (1) does not include (2) — Peter Fenton, Zuckerman Spaeder LLP

[...] The defense is expected to argue that the government of Colombia, which has been battling rebel group FARC and has maintained ties with the Colombian government, is not a party in these cases and lacks jurisdiction. ""The state is not one party here,"" he says. ""They are just a defendant here.""

""If they can talk my child, they can also break my bones,"" said the mother in response to an allegation of beatings. ""Now we will go after them because the case is already under way."" The case was presented to a grand jury last month, where two dozen people, including several prosecutors and members Plants of Ohio, a social activist group, watched as the grand jury began to render its decision. The judge in the case, James A. McCray, is also hearing arguments in the case, which could last a year. Prosecutor John L. O'Connor said if prosecutors decide to file felony charges, it would allow them to move the trial to federal court. O'Connor said if Gamekeepers and Riley Ann's mother are found liable, it could lead to fines and restitution. In an order, Judge McCray instructed the defendants earlier this month to pay the city more than $40,000 in legal costs. ""Each defendant did not respond at trial,"" McCray wrote. ""I found this to be a complete failure of the Commonwealth's case and I am imposing a fine of twenty-five thousand dollars."" In addition to the $40,000 for costs, the judge ordered that Judge McCray require Gamekeepers and other defendants to pay Riley Ann's alleged attackers or face unspecified sanctions, including fines. O'Connor said the defense team has agreed to pay the city a $4,000 settlement from the trial, as well as pay for a new police car to be delivered each month to the plaintiffs' residence. The settlement will be submitted to Judge McCray by the end of March.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: ""He admitted playing with matches and starting the fire,"" says police report. Boy, whose name and age were not given, is home with his parents. Buckweed Fire burned 38,000 acres, destroyed 63 structures, 21 of them homes."," This story has been updated with more information.

By the author

In late-September 2004, a wildfire burned 38,000 acres in western Oregon. In the days that followed, nearly every community in the fire's path was asked for their help, sometimes with great fervor. People drove thousands of miles. Some called every county in the U.S. to volunteer.

As the flames reached communities in Oregon, Utah, and other states, families took to the pages of their calendars to mark the day. Some went as far as their communities' borders to help, and some took time off work to help. Everyone seemed to think the fire was their friend, and everyone got involved.

Nearly everyone has a story about how they managed to help those who suffered and were displaced by the wildfire. In the days following the fire, everyone was asking, ""Where were they?""

If you read the newspaper, you might have heard about a young man who helped get the fire under control in his own neighborhood. Or a firefighter who helped carry a young child from her bedroom door. Or a man who took the smoke alarm from a burning house and called an emergency call center to alert firefighters. Some people thought they were helping the people who had been evacuated in the past and would be there when the fires would die out.

Those are all typical of the stories people told in interviews while volunteering. The more surprising part of the story, I think, is seeing most of these people in their home towns.

For the week before the fire, in the days following it, I spoke about my experiences with volunteers. I wasn't asked any tough questions. I didn't have to explain why I couldn't come back. I knew that I couldn't. But I was glad that I wasn't asked to leave and help out anywhere other than my town.

In a time of war, we can never trust anyone. And that's especially true in a time of disaster. So people always volunteer and go. And we tend not to notice how people have been hurt.

What was happening in that town and the homes around it during and after the fire is not something we want to think of as bad people doing something good. But that's what happened in that town. That was their way to try and help the people who had been displaced when they could not, and in a moment of weakness as a nation, to take advantage of an opportunity.

People were calling in from all over the country. In Utah, some said they were volunteering at Burning Man this year to help burn out the trees. Even when people are calling in from all over, they don't think too much about who they are, and a lot of times they don't think about how they would ever see themselves on a scale of giving.

In these instances when volunteers do something, we tend to be too involved. We wonder, ""Would they believe me?"" and ""Are they going to ask me to stay home if their families get burned out?""

It's time we stop, and pay attention to how the volunteers you know are doing in their communities, especially at home.

Sometimes we are doing things we truly believe in. Sometimes we are doing other things for the love of it. Sometimes we are doing things our hearts tell us is right.

But there are also times we are doing things because we think it's right, because we feel it's right, and we don't take into consideration how much we hurt other people as a nation with our selfishness. To this I would only add, ""If you're really good, you won't ever see it as bad or selfish.""

We all need to think of everyone else before us and everyone else before us after us. We know we don't have the power to hurt anyone. We know we can never hurt anyone, and can even make them better. We only have ourselves to ask, and we know that we can't make somebody better from this point on. All we can do is listen to every thought and ask ourselves, ""Are we being selfish?""

I hope you see it differently. I hope you become a kinder and gentler person for having made the effort to help those who needed help.

If you get asked by an organization to help them at Burning Man, I wish you all the best. Give it one try and thank you so much.

Have you done something like that? Help another burn out the forests and help them come back to life too. Let us know. There are so many amazing ways to get involved. Tell us the story of your story. Let us know which volunteer organizations you want to see"

TOWN OF MANOR, N.Y. (NEWS10) - On Tuesday night there was a wild scene in Old Bridge New York.

A truck caught fire at the intersection of the Main and Main Streets as an ambulance rushed people off the scene.

A fire chief is warning everyone to avoid area.

""I think the fire chief said the traffic was worse than he initially indicated and that's concerning because we had four ambulances inbound and two outbound that had just driven down that road,"" explained Deputy Fire Chief John Coughlin.

The EMS truck did a U-turn around the fire before taking its route back on the main road. It is not clear whether it was there for medical treatment or to be a safety precaution.

""Right now you may have some folks that we know of with serious injuries,"" the deputy fire chief said. ""I don't know whether their names will be released tomorrow but other folks with minor injuries that appear to be serious injuries will be put into the local shelter now.""

The library will be working cooperatively with the organization who will be the primary enforcer of library operations under the new president.

According to a copy of the memorandum, the inspector general's office will also consider ""whether the Library of Congress or another federal agency, including any department or agency to which the Library of Congress is assigned, is taking all appropriate measures to ensure the continued safekeeping of library items and the timely presentation of all collections to the Library of Congress.""

The memo was dated June 3, and was provided to The Associated Press by a recipient of the memo, whose name was being withheld at that point. The source requested anonymity to protect his family's privacy.

An office of the inspector general will review these records and report to federal agents in August about the quality of its work, an AP spokesperson said Monday.

The new president has previously questioned the inspector general's approach to handling requests for information of this nature, saying that he wanted the Office of Federal Procurement Policy -- which provides the money for the library's building and upkeep -- to provide better oversight.

Trump's first order of business in office was a travel ban that was struck down by a federal judge in Seattle. The administration appealed to the Supreme Court. The Justice Department has said that the executive order has been interpreted as a request for records, as opposed to the executive order by the president.

More than two million people have signed a petition on change.org to have the library moved from its current location at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to its new Capitol Records building, set to open this summer.

Fact Check: Do France and Australia have no plans to engage in drone strikes outside of direct attacks against al-Qaeda affiliates?

No. France and Australia regularly fly out drones that look like regular aircraft. The two countries regularly conduct joint military exercises and conduct joint exercises with the UAE, among others. The United States and France often conduct joint drone strikes inside Somalia and Yemen as well.

France and Australia are not currently involved in airstrikes against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). While France does use surveillance drones to collect information on al-Qaeda fighters and activities, France says it wants al-Qaeda to be focused on a narrow and narrowly defined area within Yemen, not be part of broader attempts to expand their reach globally. Australia has no plans to engage in the country's larger counterterrorism efforts, including the hunt for the so-called Abbottabad network of Osama Bin Laden operatives, as has been described.

Qatar

Qatar and France are part of a five-member group of Western countries. There are other Muslim countries that also have diplomatic ties with Qatar, but Qatar is the only Arab country to have had a peace treaty with France since 2010.

The Qatari government, though Qatar's closest Arab ally, has grown increasingly skeptical toward Israel after it closed its Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem in 2005. This summer, Qatar's Supreme State Court lifted Qatar's diplomatic status in Spain after Israel banned travel to the country.

Since 2001, Qatar has supported Hamas in fighting the Israeli occupation, but Qatar also participates in the fight against ISIS and other militant groups in Syria.

Qatar and France are both member states of the United Nations Security Council.

Qatar joined the Western-backed coalition in Syria against the Bashar Al Assad regime that was opposed by Iran. On Oct. 21, the coalition brokered an agreement between the Syrian government and various rebel factions, which was supposed to end the conflict there. Despite widespread international condemnation of the ceasefire deal, Russia and China abstained from the negotiations on Thursday. It was not made clear with which side the Russian and Chinese abstention was based.

Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan has bilateral relations with Russia.

The countries are currently negotiating on a $6.1 billion investment agreement with China, which the Kazakh Foreign Ministry described this week as a ""major historic event for our two countries, whose relationship has been long and strong."" The two sides are also working on bilateral ties, with Russia hosting the next round of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in September.

(By Tony Grossi and Steve Gehlken) It's the new version of the NFL Draft, the time of year when the industrialized nations of the world attempt to get their teams to invest in their player personnel and their franchises in a way many will never tolerate. When the NFL draft is over and the teams are in the draft room, the question that invariably arises is: Who took what player that year?

One of the most often asked is when the Raiders took Eric Smith or Daunte Culpepper or Reggie Lewis or Ronnie Lott or Tiki Barber. To my mind, the answer is the easy: The answer is: Who took who? That is, there was no answer.

The best answer, obviously, is probably: I couldn't find anyone on a scouting staff that wanted to work for them.

But that doesn't mean everyone in a scouting department can only be described with a three-word summary that does not accurately describe the people they are working with. And if you work for a major NFL team, then you know the names of the guys who went where. But you aren't supposed to know their background, their character. There is a lot of information people have about other people in the organization.

Those names are not to be included in the summaries. And it isn't acceptable by NFL policy.

After interviewing countless scouts and assistant coaches and assistant equipment managers and college and pro staff members, the Raiders made a big mistake in trying to identify who took what players during the draft.

But they did make a big mistake that is easily fixed: they didn't stop and listen to their teams' scouts before drafting.

There were several scouts and coaches over at training camp this year, and they all had some insight into who was most likely going to go as their player. The Raiders simply couldn't afford to not have the knowledge of what's going on with those guys.

One scout said he went for his personal preference. I went to ask a second scout how I could ask him that question, because he was the one who probably saw the highest number of players in the draft. When I asked him what his personal selection had been, he responded: ""You don't want to know.""

We all know that all football executives are hired for their background, because it is one of the more obvious things they should know. However, it is seldom understood.

I didn't have much in the way of background when I started at the Los Angeles Times in 1984 sad. I had made a career as a writer, editor and reporter, but I never expected that to take longer than it did.

But to my great relief, by 1989 I had started thinking about a career as a sports writer. I had had an internship at The Boston Globe as a sports columnist from 1982 through 1984.

I had met with several agents, and I understood how much people wanted to sell players in the draft and what contracts they could get. Still, by the time I finally took over as director of player personnel of The L.A. Times in 1986, I knew I had a hard time doing the job.

I had never had even an intern in a draft room, so how would I have learned anything other than by reporting to the team's team management?

Even a team's owner could give me the impression that a scout thought more about individual selections than the team's owner. And that seemed to be exactly the case. ""I just don't think you want a guy like that in the room anymore,"" says Bruce Kroenke, now the owner of the Oakland Raiders, ""so let him go."" Some guys don't even want their own names mentioned.

I spent all season doing the same job I did in 1984, except I could write. The only time I ever saw a new draft pick was in the first or second round. And the time I got to see one was when that guy had been taken. It was a game of dodgeball.

I spent the first and second rounds writing. I was going from the draft room to try to find out for myself who had been taken by the Raiders. I asked who the Raiders had taken when players were coming to camp, and they gave me two names, Don Nelson and John Madden.

I tried to tell the team I had to go to a different draft room as they were trying to determine who was in the room where Don Nelson had been taken, but no one would listen to me.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Thaksin Shinawatra's wife handed arrest warrant after she returns to Thailand. Pojamarn Shinawatra faces corruption charges that could imprison her for 20 years. The case involves Pojamarn's 2003 purchase of some prime Bangkok real estate.," An attorney for Thaksin's wife, Nachutha Asmita, has asked for a temporary restraining order that could protect her from being arrested.


Thaksin's wife: Thaksin Shinawatra's wife won a court battle Friday to halt a pending corruption case against her by the supreme court over land and other real estate purchases made between 2004 and 2010. The case will go to court next week, said Phudchan Sridharan, one of the lawyers involved in the case.


Thaksin Shinawatra's wife will get her husband's ""peace of mind"" despite the arrest warrant, said Sridharan and other supporters. A lawyer for Mrs. Nachutha Asmita declined to comment.


Losing face over land grab


Losing face over land grab and bribery charges, Thaksin has sought to distance himself from his wife's case. He has said that he only bought 10 percent of the land in his case and that she failed to get back her promised compensation prominence.


The arrest warrant was issued by the supreme court in late November, shortly after the new, conservative government took over the Thai capital, which was ruled by the military junta.


Thaksin was the longest-serving prime minister in Thailand's history, and his legacy will live on. Thaksin spent 14 years of his presidentialidental term in exile in Dubai to avoid a possible arrest warrant and bribery charges. During his time in exile, Thaksin was stripped of his office and was not allowed to hold any public office.


It took 13 years and over $2 billion to obtain the Supreme Court action. Thai media had reported in August that Pojamarn would be arrested soon after the decision. Pojamarn had threatened to challenge the ruling under international law.


A lawyer for the Thaksin family, Chawinda Tintongprasert, had said in a news conference in mid-September that Pojamarn Shinawatra would be arrested on Nov. 6 if the Supreme Court delayed the issuance of the arrest warrant.


Thaksin's wife faces 10 years behind bars if convicted.


Pojamarn's case has drawn international attention because of the land scandal. A group of international lawyers has been demanding that Thailand release Pojamarn, arguing that his case is a ""whitewash"" of the country's former premier."

Violence spreads from Villiers-le-Bel, north of Paris, to two nearby towns. More than 60 police injured, bombarded with Molotov cocktails and bottles of acid. Parallels drawn with unrest in 2005, when President Sarkozy was interior minister.","

FORTUNE – Riots broke out in a French suburb on Saturday (Oct. 18), and riot police clashed for several hours with angry youths who hurled rocks and bottles at officers, a senior official said, though neither side appeared to claim absolute victory in the skirmishes.

""We don't have numbers,"" said Gilles Savary, a police spokesman in Villiers-le-Bel (North of Paris). ""We are following up on the video of the events, and there were about 30 arrests. There's no one on the streets of Villiers-le-Bel.""

The rioters threw bottles and firecrackers at the windows of police cars in Villiers-le-Bel, near the border with Normandy, police said.

At least 80 police officers were injured after rioters ""scattered"" throughout the suburb, several of them with broken noses and broken noses.

Local official Olivier Guitta said there were about 50 to 75 arrests of youth and that at least 11 police vehicles were damaged.

Villiers-le-Bel is a small town of 7,000, with a population of about 30,000, mostly made up of immigrants. The residents have been protesting for months about low taxes and high unemployment. The riots have drawn international attention to the housing crisis and poverty in France's second-largest city.

In 2005, riots erupted after a police car plowed into several youths in Villiers. There were reports of gunfire in the area late Sunday night. The French media were abuzz with speculation that the attacks Sunday were planned ahead of the riots.

Villiers is in the Paris suburbs south of the city center.

Police in Villiers have taken to the streets in recent days to quell anti-police violence. They have responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, and on a few occasions have fired stun grenades into crowds. They have also deployed water cannons across the region.

On Thursday, police killed a suspected gunman, who had apparently taken up residence in neighboring Villiers-le-Bel. The town mayor, Yvan Benhaim, has promised to ""use every means possible and as usual"" to quell the violence.

That number is up significantly from just a few days before, when the same survey found that only 38 percent of Americans thought Musharraf should stand down.

Meanwhile, the Washington Post continues to hold firm in its conviction, and the New York Times is still being very careful about the language it uses in its criticism of Musharraf.

It's a sign indeed for squeegee-haired, scruffy-haired, beard-stroking, white-coated, unkempt, machete-wielding John McCain that he will only get a vote by Americans who actually agree with him on international policy.

In other words, McCain is going for the ""turd in a cup"" crowd. Or, as his staff calls it, the ""turd-in-a-tureen"" crowd.

We'll cut the story short for the purposes of brevity, because the author of379.com, someone who should be paying closer attention to this subject, got so worked up over the word ""sex"" that he evenArgumentum ad hominem applies. (In the interest of fairness, I'll only make comments on how ""sexual intercourse"" is used here, with the idea that it should be construed as synonymous with ""non-sexual"" sexual contact.) It's like reading the news about how some guy's girlfriend wants to talk to him about the rape of another girl. The thing is, this is an old-fashioned rape charge. This would be the kind of charge, say, the prosecutor would have to go out and talk the judge or the defense, and the lawyer of the alleged perpetrator, into finding a guilty jury. There's no such thing as a ""justifiable"" plea.

But let's back up and talk about the second kind of sexual assault charge: A sexual assault may be either verbal or nonverbal, but it can only occur while the victim is helpless. The victim must be defenseless, and the perpetrator must want sex. (Think to yourself if you were defenseless and asked your partner if they wanted sex. You'd get a pretty good idea who would say yes.) But, as always, it's really just a matter of opinion, right?

We know from our own experience (not that you'll ever see that happening to you) that this case is not just a discussion about whether a crime committed with a weapon will count as forcible rape, but about whether it will or will not count as sexually violent assault. Let's say that the defendant had a gun, and had threatened people with it against their will. Does that count as a sexual assault? Well, the standard that would apply is exactly the same as that that the standard now applies in consensual sex: It's about consent. But a consent agreement does not mean the defendant had an unlawful desire for penetration. (Remember, consent is more a social construct than a legal one. It's not really about what the victim says, or does, but about how she says it. And as mentioned above, most sexual encounters between consenting veggies can be pretty straightforward. That says something about just how many of the sexual encounters of all types, consensual and otherwise, occur off the ""date,"" as in when the person is alone on a night out or in a room with some other people, before the perpetrator engages in the penetration.) For a sexual assault to qualify on that basis, it must involve penetration by an object, and it must take place while the victim is helpless. To qualify, ""the touching must take place and remain continuous by any means, including touch, touch inside or outside the vagina, oral penetration of vagina by mouth, etc., without the victim's consent.""

Now let's talk a little more about the word ""unlawful"" in sexual assault. Sexual assaults occur to any person, no matter their gender or appearance. What really matters (to these people) is whether it's something the victim wants, can tolerate, or wants or tolerates. Someone with a penis, for example, must be willing if the rapist wants it. Someone with a penis and an ""open mouth"" must be willing if the rapist wants it. A female who wears pants should not be sexually assaulted, because she can tolerate a male-on-male sex scene. A male who wears pants must also be willing if the rapist wants it. In other words, consensual sex is not ""an invasion of what a person can choose or give consent for,"" but ""a crime against nature and violence.""

Still, we can say that consent can be withdrawn to ""avoid a physical threat""; however, so can being told, ""Please stop touching yourself, it's not safe."" If neither party wants to have sex with the other, consent is not necessary; instead, the other party is deemed ""defective, mentally unfit or dangerous to survive,"" and there can be no relationship.

Here's the best summary I've ever seen on the subject of the word ""sexual"" and sexual assault: If you're going to write a headline that includes the word ""sex,"" at least be thorough, or at least think to yourself, ""I'm not just using ""sexual"" as a catch-all term that means"

What the hell is going on with the U.S.? That's easy...

As you can see, all major media and their many spin operations have been doing nothing to help you with your questions since the first few months of this crisis.

At this point, you've probably already seen the most important news of the crisis: the U.S.-Iran crisis on paper as in principle, but not practiced in practice. This crisis will not be resolved until Iran and America get their act together -- and then only after that would the U.S. look reasonable again in the world. Even then, the fact that the U.S. still has a huge military that will not allow the use of force and the very real danger that Iran will have enough nuclear material to make a bomb at any time has led America's media to completely disregard the actual story of the crisis: how a relatively small American manufacturer, Boeing, produced one of the world's most sophisticated commercial airliners while losing $250 billion of its value.

And, of course, that is not even the part of the crisis that the mass media has not covered. Nor is it particularly the part of the story that most Americans are familiar with. In fact, they have not known that the United States has been at war for six years (so long you would not think that a few months would go by), but the story of the U.S. ""airlines vs. airports"" (i.e., America"

But with less than one week before the deadline, they don't seem to have gained the urgency they had hoped for. The House has voted four times on authorizing military action, all failing, and a new deadline looms: Saturday at 5pm.

The story could go on and on. In a country where two-thirds of the people are poor and over 60 percent of the land is in the hands of the military, and a few hundred thousand people take part in elections each year, this is how such cigarettism works. And how the election of Mwai Kibaki is likely to result in the complete dismantlement of democratic institutions in this country that they hold most dear (however, Kenya has just elected its first female president, who seems to be as well-prepared for office as he is for a life in the limelight as any Western president).

The story could go on and on and on in this country, all the way through elections that will be rigged in favor of the ruling party.

In this context, it is of course a terrible irony that in 2004, Mwai Kibaki's election was sabotaged by a conspiracy, orchestrated by Kibaki allies within the police, to stop Kibaki from winning. When that became clear, when the police chief implicated in the plot was finally arrested, the press corps, which has for the most part been sympathetic to the government, was furious. Kibaki was the most qualified presidential candidate for Kenya to step in and run against Mwai Kibaki, and yet he had become the target of the sort of cynical sabotage that normally goes hand in hand with an outright coup. I'd like to think, had that plot failed, that the press would have moved on to the next and more important topic—who is the next president? Who is this idiot who's willing to play all that much?


Then we have the political elite. On one hand they may, in effect, be saying ""we'll let you keep the power, and you can't touch us,"" and on the other they may be saying ""we won't let you touch us, so there's no point in having us participate in the business of running it."""

JERUSALEM, March 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has pardoned the father of a 16-year-old girl and a student sentenced to 200 lashes for kissing an acquaintance behind her back, a judicial official said on Saturday, a move Amnesty International denounced as a ""warranted and historic decision"".

Amnesty international criticized the ruling as a ""horrifying assault on a woman's human rights"" and said it could amount to an extrajudicial execution without trial.

The woman, who was sentenced to 100 lashes if found guilty of ""a minor and relatively harmless crime"", is a student at al-Madinah college in the capital, Riyadh, where the girl was arrested for kissing a classmate in 2014.

The woman's father had asked for his daughter's pardon after she was pardoned two years ago for kissing her male classmate behind her back, according to the official who was not authorised to speak to journalists and was not identified by name.

A local court sentenced her to 100 lashes after the classmate, identified mainly by the initials A, reported that he had been kissing her behind her back.

Human rights groups, including Amnesty International who supported Amnesty petitioning Saudi Arabia to overturn the sentence, criticised the pardon but noted: ""We were disappointed, but not surprised, by these decisions.""

Amnesty also noted that on Wednesday there had been a ""huge media backlash"" in Saudi Arabia as Saudi police had arrested five students from a private school in northern Saudi Arabia.

""The young girl will be held again in custody for the remainder of her sentence, although this time (she) has chosen not to accept the pardon,"" said Erika Guevara-Rosas, director of Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa programme. ""She now faces an increased risk of further imprisonment on the ground should she remain in jail for anything longer.""

Meanwhile, Amnesty called upon the kingdom's justice minister, Mohammed al-Awdah, to suspend executions indefinitely and to commute the sentences of those convicted. However, Amnesty said the pardon was ""an aberration rather than a continuation of the death penalty"", referring to the death penalty.

But then in the next paragraph he said to find out when the letter was written. How did it happen?

The Telegraph, June 1, 2011


This is just one-tenth of the content in our News Report, but it is the stuff that can be found online in a single place, in the form of dozens and dozens of pages of our newspapers. This is the stuff that can lead to a change in the way we learn how events unfolded, how we know what to believe, to what's real and what isn't.


It's the stuff that the British establishment wants people to forget. It's the stuff that can be bought out of the government's mouth. It's the stuff that shows what the royals do from behind their huge, glittering doors.


It's the stuff that is the ""dossier."" A dossier that's been written, perhaps by an insider, perhaps by two people connected to the royals, perhaps by a lone journalist, perhaps by a ""pawn"" or by a third agent. What the document says it doesn't say, and there are parts that are utterly unhelpful.


This is the stuff that goes into the ""dossier."" What I find absolutely appalling is the way in which the whole thing has been sold to the British people. A few key paragraphs. A few important sentences. I have made no attempt to trace or document the source of the rest of it. I've not asked for the sources; I have not quoted the sources. I don't know, for example, who the ""sources"" for the allegations are. I don't know who those sources are. And in that sense, yes, this stuff really does have influence. The people you hear in its place - the royal journalists - can get away with such practices, because the British mainstream media doesn't expose them. The royal media cover for the royals in order to continue to work as a unit for the royal establishment they represent.


This ""dossier"" can be found online.


Here's how it appears on an online version of Britain's The Independent newspaper: ""A letter, written by Diana's private secretary in 2004, has been handed over to an inquest into her death.


Sealed for publication a year ago, it documents Mrs Roberts' fears that the prince could want to sell his private island in the Caribbean.


It has caused consternation among Mrs Roberts' advisers, who fear it will be used in a bid to explain why she was found in the pool of the Westway Hotel, where she died.


The letter is also at the centre of speculation about the death of the Princess of Wales and the contents of her private letter, which she received from Paul Burrell.


In it she warns about the ""potential for trouble"" to arise from a planned sale of an apartment in Dubai...


The revelation that Mrs Roberts was told that the prince's wishes ""may have changed"", comes amid the publication this week of a letter she wrote to him in which she suggested he had ""lost his way"".


It reads: ""My father is still a great influence, and I do not wish to be left alone.""


Mrs Roberts' letter appeared in a dossier put together by The Mail on Sunday newspaper between May 2006 and November 2007 after the death of Princess Diana in an RAF plane crash in 1996.


It is the basis for claims that she left in a suicide and that her mother Diana conspired to cover up her death.


And it is one part in a series of revelations that have come to light since Diana's death that have triggered fresh inquiries. The details have been reported by the Daily Mail, the Times, and Channel 4 News...

The Daily Mail, February 28 2012


It was just over a year ago that the papers disclosed that Diana had confided in her personal secretary, Keith Mills, that the prince would be planning on moving his private island out west...


This latest document, the contents of which may have come from an anonymous source, may yet lead the inquiry that is to start today (Thursday) into the death of Princess Diana, the last Princess of Wales.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Paul Burrell, Princess Diana's former butler, gives evidence at inquest. Describes phone call in which Diana's mother called her daughter""a whore"" Burrell says Queen Elizabeth's husband was not involved in Diana's death. Also claims that Diana told him: ""I need marriage like a bad rash"""," He claims it took five conversations and a phone call to Diana, but later said those conversations ""seem to indicate that Diana, like Princess Diana, had a sense of entitlement"". ""She was a spoiled teenage girl trying desperately to impress her wealthy father"" He said: ""I think she felt she had no obligation to be an even or a decent person. In those circumstances I think she became self-righteous and became a little bit selfish."" He says Diana's behaviour was a cause of her death. ""I believe that she had an issue, the root cause of it was something that she had failed to meet because she had failed to live up to [her mother's wishes]"". Burrell said: ""This was not a suicide. They felt she couldn't bring herself to meet God in the way that she desired to"". ""I don't know what more she could have done in life, I don't know what she had to have done [at the time]. She was a victim of her circumstances. I hope people will do the right thing and see pulverised a tragedy that she so desperately wanted to escape from."" He said that Princess Diana is now ""dead, because she was dead the whole time"" and that God should have been a father to Princess Diana and her children he said. ""God was there but she had been killed by a very sick woman"".

BBC World News, BBC News Online and BBC Local News were among the news sites to pick up the story. The Sunday Times reported that a coroner told the inquest: ""I'm sure Mrs Burrell will say it was an act of self-defence by Diana's private tutor, John Burrell who, in my opinion, took control of the situation"", while the Mail on Sunday quoted an official source in London as calling the ""selfie"" incident ""an attempt to distract attention from the real tragedy"", and saying: ""This is what happens, and Diana could not have known how she would be blamed for all this"".

The Guardian's Paul Lewis, writing from the Guardian, said the Burrell allegations were ""vitally important"", and that ""the evidence is astonishing"". Lewis said the coroner - who conducted a private review of the events surrounding Diana's death - ""firmly believes there was a cover up"".

As it happens, the Mail on Sunday also reported that police have previously told this newspaper that there was an ""unexplained suicide"" and that all evidence pointed to Burrell claiming in his verdict that he was ""defeated"" by Diana's lover.

However, this afternoon, the Press Association has claimed that the inquest has found there was ""no evidence of any foul play""."

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Several Marines are the focus of 2004 Falluja civilian death investigation. Allegations from former Marine called ""credible"" Sources: Naval Criminal Investigative Services conducting the probe."," Sources: The Associated Press reports on the investigation. Sources: Military police investigating. Sources: Army investigator who interviewed one Marine told the AP that Marine was killed by gunfire from two unidentified vehicles. Sources: Marine killed with rifle-like weapon, bullet wound in head. Sources: Marine killed with rifle-like weapon, bullet wound in throat. Sources: Army officer who interviewed one of the Marines said two men fired rifle rounds at him. Sources: Reports emerged Wednesday that two Marines, one of them a former Marine in Falluja, were arrested. Sources: The Marine Corps says it will conduct a ""thorough and comprehensive"" investigation into the incident, that the suspect may face charges, and will seek an outside investigation. Sources: Report by AP of investigation.

Navy officer's account differs:

Lt. Cmdr. James Gorman was at the scene of the battle and wrote a book about it: ""On the Frontlines of Falluja, The First Marine Division.""

Gorman had been the Marine commander at the time.

The Washington-based Marine Corps has a long history of covering up or not investigating atrocities committed in war zones.

A Marine who witnessed the killing of civilians in a Falluja hospital is speaking out for the first time about killing, using a hand grenade and a bayonet, and his life after he was wounded in one of the country's worst combat deaths.

In a telephone interview from Iraq, Staff Sgt. Mark R. O'Brien recalled how one Marine killed an Iraqi with a hand grenade in a field hospital as they were evacuating wounded from the city.

""I told my people, 'You need to do something,'"" the 35-year-old O'Brien recalled saying as he drove a tank from Falluja to a hospital near the front lines where he was then sent. ''And I walked over to the tank. I gave a little hand signal - sort of shaking - and we pushed the button and pulled the trigger on the grenade. And I heard a little pop, and it went off. And then I heard the shell landing.... I went up and looked at the man, and he just went limp.""

A marine lieutenant assigned to O'Brien's squad was wounded in the grenade attack.

Another Marine killed in the mortar attack carried out by a colleague, also from inside a combat zone, has not spoken out publicly about it yet. Gorman was awarded the Marine Corps' Medal of Honor twice.

The death is an unlikely scenario for a battalion commander who has faced charges of negligence. After O'Brien finished his post, he was suspended from duty, according to the official Marine Corps biography of him. Gorman was never disciplined or charged with a crime. The Marine Corps never interviewed Gorman, or anything he said, or anything they found on his desk that they could corroborate, according to O'Brien.

But an army investigator did, and found more than what other investigations of what he has called a ""brutal, widespread and well-planned"" assault on Falluja had found.

The investigation is being conducted by the Naval Criminal Investigative Services after its command moved from Washington to the capital last year.

Gorman has said that he never authorized the firing of any weapon, that it was his responsibility to supervise the unit - they were the only Marine unit in the area - that was preparing for combat and that he didn't approve the use of ""live fire"" in the hospital that occurred before his arrival.

But the investigation by the Army has not been done.

Gorman has claimed that no one else is permitted to talk about what happened during the firefight that killed his fellow soldiers.

""I've got my own history, you know,"" he said in an interview with CNN in August. He declined to give the name of any of his colleagues. ""I'm more concerned with preserving my own reputation.""

He said oppressively large numbers of wounded Iraqis had been arriving into the besieged hospital by the time he arrived. It took about 12 hours but it wasn't until well into the night that his unit left the hospital, taking only 40 men with them and no supplies with them, he said. ""Every soldier knows that if they're there in the field, they're going to be taken care of,"" he said.

That was before the first mortars hit the main hospital building. It took about two hours for a crew to clear the building of mortar shells, he said. He said Marines rushed the wounded people to the hospital in vehicles and then walked them to trucks that took them to their final destination, a nearby field hospital. He said he had arrived at the hospital when the fighting began, but had"

A news article based on this summary: At least 1 million people have been affected by the floods, according to Ecuador's president.

Does there seem to be a gap in your media experience?

Your content appears to me as either aggregated by other news teams or is a bit off the average timeline in terms of clarity and coverage:

At least 10 people have died in torrential rains in Ecuador

According to Ecuador's president, at least 1 million people have been affected by the floods.

It appears in local and international media with very different timings. In Ecuador, it is read by news science researchers. In the U.S., it is read by political reporters.

Why is this critical?

The most important metric for how credible and accurate your content is is accuracy: How ""high-quality"" is it, and how do you get the information that you need to do your jobs?

Your content is an aggregation interpreted by news scientists when looking for reliable news stories. To be trusted in the news business, it is necessary for your content to be ""high-quality,"" meaning it should be accurate, relevant to audience, and provide timely information.

Why can't your content conform to this criteria?

Because you're not covering the event in Ecuador (because it's not happening now or has never happened before). You're reporting it as it happens from a location outside of Ecuador, so your audience is not likely to see it as a true description of the moment in general.

You don't use attribution or other measures of accuracy to ensure that your audience truly knows the news story or its source. Your content is read by news science researchers when looking for reliable news stories. To work with them correctly, it isn't enough to use keywords. You need to also use attribution. For each colour-coded phrase in your headline, how can you establish a link? Why can't you include a short bio? Why does your article have an image? These elements could be easily changed by news science researchers to work with your audience. For example, instead of saying: ""Ecuador's President declared state of emergency as torrential rain threatens the country's food production,"" why can't you say: ""Ecuador's President declared state of emergency as torrential rain threatens food production."" This would be more relevant and accurate to your audiences, regardless of the source.

This would be more relevant and accurate to your audiences, regardless of the source. Your content doesn't convey the right emotional context. In all my reading of these stories, which ones come up as most compelling?

Many of these reports sound very calm and even soothing. How wouldcially do they seem if the people they were speaking with actually saw these things for themselves, as if they were experiencing it on live TV?

I'm not saying there's a perfect way to get this right, but how can you know that this is a true description of what's going on with it for your audience?

Are the stories you're reporting accurate?

Are they not?

What do you do instead?

It might be helpful to consider if the stories you're finding yourself reporting don't fit the criteria because of some other factor, such as the type of coverage, the time or location of source (from your own news team, or from other readers), or possibly the language that you're using awakening.

In other words, what do you really know about the subject before you try to report about it?

Do you also have the resources to find an expert who'll do an objective analysis, do you know how to write a news story with the least amount of errors possible, and should reporters use what they know (i.e. attribution)?

(Source: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3823662/Driver-Dodi-Fayed-killed-Rigid-security-car-Jamaica-tram-dies-after-crash-car crash-Princess-Dodie-tram.html)

The facts surrounding the ""hit and run"" death of Princess Diana have not improved. The fact is there is no evidence in favor of the prosecution, and the defense is based on statements of one bodyguard, an eyewitness, and a few newspaper accounts from the time of the crash. Even if it's true, the facts do not support the defense claims, as they show that the defendant's car was never the cause of the crash, and that he had the car solely to protect himself. Instead, the defense suggests that the crash could be a ""accident."" The Crown Office's view of the case is that this case is a mere ""hit and run"": a ""casualty accident"" in which there were ""nothing obvious to suggest a deliberate act"". The Crown Office has, furthermore, argued that the car was not involved in the final collision, because he was in a separate vehicle ""at the time"". This would mean that the car was a ""collision bystander"", as opposed to involved in the ""hit and run"". Furthermore, it states: ""The police have interviewed the bodyguard only once, when he told them: 'I cannot remember why it happened. I do not think it was deliberate.' At trial he was cross-examined about this comment but refused to give any further evidence."" If there was ""nothing obvious to suggest a deliberate act"" what are the implications of ""nothing obvious to suggest a deliberate act"" to those of us not in a position to do so. Would the prosecution have such confidence in this man's account? Why would the prosecution dismiss the fact that he made several comment in the car, when they could easily have been asked some questions about the car itself, or the driver he was driving at the time of the act?

The Crown Office has also stated that if there was anything ""irregular"" or ""suspicious"" about the defendant, that may have been the basis for the Crown not presenting any evidence. Yet, if that is so, would there have been nothing ""irregular"" about the Crown's handling of the case? Did the Crown decide to throw out the case with no evidence at all due to the driver being described only as ""injury bystander"" in the media – even though, had the car been involved in any of the crashes involved in the alleged ""hit and run"", it would have been a ""collisiondrive bystander""?

Conclusion: The only conclusion we can draw on these facts is that there was a ""hit and run"" and that the prosecution has yet to prove that the defendant was in any way guilty of attempting to cause the ""crash"" or using his vehicle as a ""weapon."" Instead, the Crown has presented little or no evidence of the defendant being involved in any of the crashes, and that the defendant acted as a ""collision bystander"" in that he was driving in a separate vehicle at the time of the incident. This means that the prosecution has not proven either that there was one in any of the crashes, or that ""a weapon"" was used in any of these crashes before the defendant drove away without taking any action, even if she may have been ""hitting"" anybody. Why would the prosecution present evidence of a suspect driving a single car at the time of the ""hit and run"" to begin with?

""The Crown's case rests on an assumption that a single driver was responsible for this crime.""

Conclusion: The Crown's case rests on an assumption that a single driver was responsible for this crime. That alone doesn't mean that the prosecutor's case against the defendant will succeed. First, we will need to see if there is any other evidence of the defendant being the ""driver"" of either the car, or the ""hit and run"", besides his testimony. Second, if there was any other evidence at all, we can only go by the Crown's assumptions concerning the defendant, and on this, we do not have any evidence. Lastly, it is equally impossible that the Crown has proven any other form of the defendant using his vehicle as ""a weapon"".

Let me be blunt here. I personally wish the Crown had shown any evidence of why"

At least 11 Maryland police officers, including seven from the Anne Arundel County Police Department, were injured in the storm, Lt. Col. Steve Hecht said. Some of the injuries were minor, he said. All of the officers were expected to be okay. The county police office in Anne Arundel County had closed to the public on the first three cold days of winter.

The storm caused snowplows to be knocked down by their chainsaws and power outages. As of 9 a.m., more than 9,000 were without power in Maryland, including many who live in Anne Arundel County, said Anne Arundel Police Chief Robert Schenirer.

In the Prince George's County portion of Prince George's, where the rain stopped and the skies began to clear, the storm remained heavy about 4 a.m. Tuesday, leaving at least five trees down in the region.

In Maryland's capital, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she will urge residents to stay sucks, in the face of the ""unacceptable"" storm.

The storms continued to bring blizzard conditions and heavy snow to the eastern half of the country, with winds expected up to 60 miles per hour Wednesday into Thursday. They downed trees, downed power lines and caused widespread power outages.

Baltimore's Department of Emergency Management said it had reported more than 600,000 customers without power as of 7 p.m. Tuesday. About 5,000 of them had power back on Tuesday night.

The storm also caused more than 100 flights at Mid-Atlantic airports to be canceled.

Baltimore was the only city to survive the storm, but the storm's impacts spread farther west and southwest. In North Carolina, where the storm originated, some 300 flights were canceled Friday, state DOT officials said. The North Carolina Public Service Commission, meanwhile, is preparing to provide refunds to some of its customers.

At its peak, heavy snowfall left thousands in the mountains and on the roads and disrupted travel between the Atlantic and the Appalachian regions.

As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, more than 7,200 Baltimore residents were without power, with the city's storm-maintenance company having repaired just 12,000 homes as of 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to the utility's Twitter account.

And as of 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, authorities said they would declare all storm-related delays as ""temporary,"" as the storm lingered into Wednesday. The storm caused one death in Florida.

Baltimore was also hit by an electrical outage between 7 am and 8:10 a.m. Monday. Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted about the incident and said the department's ""comprehensive investigation continues"" but added that ""I know that residents of Baltimore want to know what has caused the outage? The answers"

On Sunday, ""The Weinstein Company and Participant Media, a media company dedicated to diverse storytelling and participation,"" announced an alliance to promote diversity and awareness in a bid to improve diversity in Hollywood and beyond.

The prize comes as Hollywood looks to boost female representation in lead roles for the first time since 2012, although the numbers for films released between 2012 and 2015 are still not in the black.

At the start of the year Hollywood was still debating the inclusion of more women as major players, but some of the biggest films about women were big-budget, including ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""Wonder Woman.""

In 2017, the ""Best Animated Feature"" category in the Academy Awards will also feature many more female nominees.

The headline of the article should use the following wording: ""Senate votes for new auto fuel efficiency rules"" unless a specific sentence follows a similar sentence. This way a reader will know how they will react in reading the headline.

Use the above rules for headlines and summaries. However, for headlines and summaries, the headline and the subheadline should be formatted the same, as below.

Note: It's often helpful to start headlines and summaries with a short statement of the topic or facts. That way the reader can quickly find what they're looking for. Here's a example: ""The Senate voted to raise the average fuel efficiency of cars.""

Headline and Summary Example

New law raises fuel efficiency standards on trucks and SUVs, raising them to an average of 36 mpg by 2019.

Example Headline: ""Senate approves bill raising average fuel efficiency of trucks and SUVs."" Summary: ""Senate approves bill raising average fuel efficiency of trucks and SUVs."" Example Summary: ""Senate approves legislation raising fuel efficiency of trucks and SUVs""

Use a full paragraph in the head of a headlines and subheadlines. For example:

"" clicking here for a summary of the House report on Senate approval of legislation raising the average fuel economy of trucks and SUVs by 30% over ten years for passenger cars.""

Example Headline: ""This bill increases fleet average fuel efficiency by 30% for light duty trucks and SUVs."" Summary: ""Senate approves legislation raising fleet average fuel efficiency of light duty trucks""

Use headline and summary phrases when they fit into the space between lines. The following examples give suggestions:

""a new law raises fuel intensity standards on vehicles, which will save many lives and protect our air.""

""A bill that would help save life and keep our air clean passes the Senate.""

URL is a good way to show the author or an entity (such as a publisher) you're talking to. A link to the website, a ranner or a press release is better than a headline containing an entity's name. Use a short summary. If you need to explain very specific details, set the summary of the story to be short. For instance, if you need to give specifics about the average fuel economy or its effects on the greenhouse gas emission reduction. But you don't have the time to explain these details at the beginning of the story. Here are some examples:

For more information and examples of how to deal with these examples, see How to deal with non-conversion stories.


In a non-conversion situation, the first step is to discuss the matter with the other parent. If the other parent is not aware that the convert is a different person from themselves, even for only a few minutes, they may be forced to take the necessary steps, such as changing the child's name. The next step is to find out where the conversion took place if necessary, and provide all the appropriate documentation. If there is no record of this conversion, the child may still contact the non-conversion parent. To make it easier, you may want to ask someone, such as the parent's mother, to contact the non-conversion parent. Another option is to use a friend for this function.


If the convert isn't the other parent's stepmom, they will have to go through the normal steps you recommended above to establish that they don't hold any family position against her. However, to avoid any difficulty, they should go through the normal conversion procedure, in order to establish that they are the opposite sex of the other parent at the time of conversion. The parents can then refer to the other parent's marriage, the civil union or partnership agreement, and see if they can meet. You can use the discussion to find out why the convert didn't convert as a child. (Please note that if the converted parent, or family at home, wants to do something out of the ordinary at this point, it would be good to discuss this with them.) After all, if the conversion didn't happen as a child, the child will not have to make that decision. In your scenario, the child had a child at an earlier age that he or she didn't convert. (It is also possible that a first conversion happened, but a second later. Just remember that conversion takes place in the second step of the process. In the second step, a couple can decide to go through both of the steps in reverse sequence.)


After establishing the relationship, please note that the name on the passport of the convert doesn't indicate what kind of conversions they are undergoing. Therefore it can make a difference in future decisions on where to move.

Once both parents have determined that the conversion is the right fit for the child, they may or may not be going through the usual conversions that the non-conversion parent does. Even in the case of a ""double conversion,"" or that second conversion, a conversion can be necessary for the conversion to take place. Many converts do not start out as non-Orthodox, and may continue to convert after their first conversion is finished. So they may have a third or fourth conversion to go through, and then follow the conversion procedure again. That is what happened to me.


In the conversion case that I described, the child's stepmom was going through two conversions herself at the time, with her boyfriend and their adopted son. I found that she had not only given permission for her son to convert, but was actively trying to make it happen. She even created a whole website listing ""How to Convert to Judaism"" for the child, and was actually making arrangements to have the conversion of their son officially sanctioned by the Orthodox community. I found out that the conversion was not officially sanctioned until I mentioned to her that I knew her son's name and that he was already Jewish. She had never mentioned that, yet she was now officially ""converted"" to Judaism.


So this would be a potential scenario even in cases where the converting parent is not doing anything out of the ordinary during the convert's conversion process.

Conversion is a real personal experience. Therefore, after reading this article, you may want to do more than just tell someone you know how to deal with it. Instead of just saying how to talk to the other child, let's develop ideas and discuss them. In order to do this, we must discuss the topic with the other parent, and try to see what our options may be; and then discuss with them who may be best for us.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Arrests made after ATF agents set up a sting operation. Affidavit: ATF ""became aware"" some soldiers wanted to rob dealers of their cocaine. The investigation began in November. The Army Rangers are an elite light infantry fighting force."," An Army public affairs spokesman said, ""The Rangers participated as advisors to the Special Operations Brigade and conducted exercises with local law enforcement agencies"" in Honduras. A member of the Army Rangers and the San Pedro Sula mayor are both on administrative leave pending review of the charges. A defense spokesman said it was a routine training exercise. The story said the incident, if proven true, involved members of the Army's Green Berets and Special Forces. It also described the actions made against the accused during a three-week training exercise in late December 2009 after the Marines stationed there ""received complaints of a possible drug buy-and-bust."" This was a ""special assignment situation,"" and no Army units were involved, the Army spokesman said. It appears the Army, but not San Pedro Sula officials or their investigators, did enough to uncover the alleged incident involving the soldiers and police officers. But they are asking for more information and more assurance that the Army is not doing anything wrong. The spokesman said the Army took a variety of measures to ensure its operations were not a cause for concern. When soldiers reported to an exercise they were not forced to report, the military and the city of 400,000 had a chance to assess the situation and adjust accordingly. There was no suggestion that San Pedro Sula made an illegal purchase. The U.S. Army Public Affairs Command did not return calls seeking comment on the issue. The Associated Press reported that ""Army officials were concerned about a possible 'drug buy050' operation that went awry in Honduras, where the Army has a permanent training outpost, according to a U.S. official."" It does not say when this concern took place. Army spokesman Sgt. 1st Class Mark Dolan said, ""Unfortunately, it's not something we want to happen, especially once it gets into the media."" At the same time, the incident raises questions about how the U.S. Armed Forces, which have been in the country for decades, treat its citizens. For months, the U.S. has been criticized by Congress and other organizations for how its soldiers treat their civilian community and civilians inside the country. There's concern that abuses may grow under President Obama's watch as he seeks a second term. This latest incident is the most recent example of problems. It is also the latest in a string of controversies. In June, two Navy sailors, one female and one male, had similar allegations made against them by civilians, including Honduran police. The two sailors initially denied the allegations, but later told a local television station that they were coerced by Honduran police who had their guns drawn. The sailors said they had been ordered to ""kill or be killed by armed Honduran police if there was no money."""
