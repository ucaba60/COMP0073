Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? Answer:," Yes, mitochondrial respiratory system is involved in remodelling of cell surface which in turn acts as a regulator of cell morphology. However, this effect is not at the cellular level and is observed only when mitochondria are targeted by other substances such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrion has a major role in regeneration and regulation of cell morphology in plants thanks to the regulation of ROS by mitochondria and ROS production by mitochondria.

Dietary composition and mitochondrial damage

Mitochondria are responsible for breaking down the main components of plant cell tissue, especially carbohydrates of plant cells and carbohydrates in protein complexes of plant cells. These are in addition to oxidative proteins that are secreted by the mitochondria from inside the cell. Mitochondria are found in the mitochondria of all known plants. These mitochondria (monosomy 21) have several functions which are important in plant cell metabolism and in the regulation of cell death.

Mitochondrial oxygen consumption

Mitochondria use oxygen as a major energy source for the activity of their mitochondria. When the cell is in thermal (overheated) condition, mitochondria emit electrons. This energy is used for the processes of oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids, to increase the oxidation of NADH and to reduce oxidizability of fatty acids. Mitochondrial respiration also stimulates the reactions of lactic acid, glutaminase-mediated gluconeogenesis and protein hydrolysis.

Mitochondrial respiration and lipid peroxidation

The reduction of oxidized fat in plants results in the catabolism of saturated fatty acids, particularly by the production of acetate, lactate and pyruvate. These reactions of the phospholipids that are derived from carbohydrate of cells have a major role and are important for plant cell metabolism and in regulation of organ and tissue function. This is the first step in the conversion of cell proteins and carbohydrates into energy.

F recycle for ATP synthesis

Each mitochondria has19 ATP synthase enzymes from which it can generate ATP that the mitochondria can use to perform various biochemical and biologic functions. These enzymes include NAD+ catalytic enzyme (NADH+ catalysed oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids), the mitochondrial β-hydroxylase (β-OHCAΔ), the SOD enzymes (soluble) and the cytosolic NAD(+. These enzymes are present in all cells of plants. These enzymes contribute to the conversion of one form of carbohydrate into another which is necessary for most chemical processes of plants, such as energy production, amino acids synthesis and nucleotide synthesis.

Mitochondria promote growth during plant cell division

Protein content of leaves

Leaf-producing tissues of plants such as leaves consist of a large number of different cell types and cell types are highly variable. Plant cells differentiate in three distinct phases: stem, roots and shoot. Plant cells of stems are divided into cells by a series of elongated tubular units (ploidys). Plant cell bodies are divided vertically into cell layers of leaves that can be in the form of cells without azinskiules such as pistillate (without a leaf cell body and a basal cytoplasmic layer and usually without a nucleus).

For a larger picture, see the diagram below

Leaf-forming organs and cells include a number of different organelles such as stomata, leaflets, hairs, pistils, sepals, leaves and the roots, flowering bulb, fruits, stems and roots. Cells of roots, flowers, pistils and natal flowers are divided in various areas with basal cells, basal stomata, apicardium and apical chambers. There are numerous specialized organs in the root of plants such as the root of the genus Heliconius and the trachoma. In addition to specialized organs, cells of flowers are divided into cells with various types of organelles such as papill divides, stamens, pistillates and trichomes.

Leaves form a set of cells in the upper part of the plant body including the apical and basal cells, the apicardium, apical chambers, the stamens and the stamens.

Carbon

Carbon is formed in the intercellular spaces of the plants stem or leaves. Carbon is essential for most organic chemical reactions. It also forms a major part of cells of plant tissue, especially plants stem, roots, fruits and shoots. Carbon also plays a crucial part in plant cell regulation and development.

Carbon molecules are found mainly in the outer and inner membranes of plant cells. For example, the outer-membrane of chloroplasts and mitochondria, the inner membrane of chloroplasts, the inner membranes of chloroplasts, the nucleus of chloroplasts and cytoplasm of the cells of root"

"Question: Syncope during bathing in infants, a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:","

Answer: 1) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a sudden unexplained death that can be associated with drowning, as well as many other traumatic events. In the last 50 years, about 500,000 children have died of SIDS, and half of these have occurred at bath time. It is estimated that between 1% and 18% of all children over the age of 1 year will have SIDS when the infant is young enough to be swimming in water.

2) Water-induced urticaria is a temporary water rash that occurs about one hour later. It is usually mild, nonspecific, and is often overlooked.

3) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a rare, sudden death occurring in infants less than one year of age. Almost all deaths from drowning occur in infants less than one year of age. Nearly all the SIDS cases occur when an infant is in the bathtub or tub after a bath or bath.

4) The risk factors for SIDS include a bath at home, a short bathtime, being on your stomach, not wearing seat belts, being on a hot tub and the bathtub is a short distance away. If you have a short bathtime, make sure you have a good curtain.

5) Infants need several exposures to air to get enough oxygen to oxygenate their blood. You are less likely to experience excessive water and sudsy body fluids if you have a long exposure time.

6) Bathers should always wear life jackets and protective neck gear in a case of water intoxication. Some people do not have the ability to swim so wearing safety belts can be a good precaution.

7) In addition, make sure kids are in their seats when they go in or out of the water. This helps prevent drownings that could happen from sudden immersion in water.

8) A child can die of water intoxication after only one brief exposure to a short bath. There is no safe amount of time until exposure to water. If your family is planning an outdoor bath or bath time on a hot day, consider using an air tight tub or a safety belt.


Question: What is the link between SIDS and bath-time water intoxication? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:

Answer: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is an unexpected sudden loss of consciousness. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, SIDS rates increased significantly in the United States by a factor of more than 1.5. These increased SIDS rates were followed by a more than 30 fold increase in the rates of water water intoxication in the same regions. SIDS is more likely when babies are younger and more often occurs with other risk factors.

9) Bathers need to take additional precautions if a child is going for a ride with friends or family members. If he or she is swimming in the tub or bath, make sure the child is wearing a life jacket and have a good curtain.

10) A large amount of water in the bathtub can cause an allergic reaction. This can lead to seizures and death. When children are under 10, they shouldn't use a bath tub for more than one or two hours at a time.

Question: Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?

Answer: Yes.

Question: What is the most cost-effective way to encourage HMO enrollees to wear breast implants? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the most cost-effective way to encourage HMO enrollees to wear breast implants?

Answer: In patients who have undergone a breast biopsy, the majority of implant-related complications will be treated at the expense of insurance coverage. Breast implants are expensive to repair and will cost thousands in treatment and rehabilitation in addition to the cost of treating the implants. The most cost-effective approach for women who undergo biopsies to confirm breast implant implantation is to refer them to a breast surgeon willing to perform the surgery at an acceptable cost.

Question: What specific preventive services are covered for breast cancer screening by the Affordable Care Act? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What specific preventive services are covered for breast cancer screening by the Affordable Care Act?

Answer: Comprehensive mammograms are covered for all women, not just those for whom insurance pays for surgery. Screening for breast cancer with ultrasound is excluded. The ACA is very supportive of breast cancer screening. In the end, breast cancer screening is usually more cost-effective than other kinds of preventive services, and it is often recommended for women on the lower income end of the spectrum."
Question: Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

SUMMARY: What is the consensus view on what is considered the gold standard for both surgery and endoscopy?

A. The consensus view is that the open flap procedure (FL) is acceptable in the context of open-heart surgery, but only if the first-degree sonographer in the clinical practice is capable of performing the technique safely for a large number of patients.

B. The consensus view is that the double balloon insert in the open-heart and paravalvular surgeries (AP) are acceptable when a single balloon inflating device (OBD) is used in the treatment.

C. The consensus view is that the open-heart bypassing (OBB) is acceptable for patients with a low risk of significant complications from a single balloon operation, but only in the setting of an active cardiac catheterization process.

D. The consensus view is that the double balloon insert in the paravalvular surgery (AP) is unacceptable for all other patients unless the first degree sonographer is capable of performing the technique safely for a large number of patients.

The literature shows that the best practice for OBD procedures (the type of operation performed by the first-degree sonographer) is to perform the OBD on a low-risk patient. In those patients, surgical approaches in addition to the surgical technique in the open-heart and paravalvular surgeries must be considered. In these studies, the surgical approaches included: obstructed access and the use of a defibrillator (cardiovascular catheterization). In this report, the first-degree sonographer in the surgery and the obstructed access group used a large OBD device to provide the defibrillator. The other group (the obstructed access and the single balloon insertion) used either the balloon insertion or the balloon inflator in the treatment. The primary outcome measure is the rate of failure to thrive (TFST).

The literature also suggests that the number of patients successfully treated with the single balloon insert varies. A study performed in Australia that followed more than 700 patients for over four years found that those patients treated with both devices found greater improvement compared to those treated with balloon insertion alone. Patients treated with balloon insertion alone were found to be more likely to have a higher complication rate. The literature was sparse for the use of a single balloon insertion for endoscopy. In a survey of the literature, 10 authors observed that a single balloon insert is not recommended for endoscopic use. 2

We studied two patient cohorts to determine how similar the results could be between these two cohorts. We performed randomized controlled trials using the same treatment approach (double balloon insert versus balloon insertion in the treatment) and same population of patients to examine whether the single balloon insertion is always as efficacious and safe for every patient as its conventional counterpart with the same procedure. We also studied the outcomes for endoscopic and surgical outcomes. A third study looked at the role of risk adjusting and complications and found that a single balloon insert is probably more effective for these outcomes in a cohort (n = 464 patients) of patients treated with open-heart surgery. 1 This study also showed that the use of a single balloon insert may increase the potential for side effects and may not be as reliable at identifying patients who are at increased risk.

We used data from the study performed by Miller et al 1 in the United Kingdom. The results are summarized in. The study was a large, prospective, observational study to evaluate the results of a single balloon insert for endoscopy performed on large, otherwise healthy, patients (n = 1512) with a history of prior open-heart surgery or a history of an acute open-heart episode. To evaluate the effect of the single balloon insert on patients at high (n = 2085 patients) or low risk of adverse outcome (n = 1260 patients) the authors utilized a double-blind method to assess the success of the procedure based on patients' self-reported outcome measure (TFST). All patients were admitted to a hospital with the intent to follow their medical care at the hospital. This study included 2478 patients over 28 days.

The primary outcome measure used in the studies is the TFT, which is a visual assessment of the amount of bleeding that occurred in the patient, with an algorithm that describes the flow of blood through the patient for a given time interval and level of pain. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who had TFTs with a level of pain equal to or better than the median for a clinically significant change of 3 mm or less of blood between the time of the first TFT and the time that the patient received the recommended therapy from the cardiologist.

An important aspect to consider when interpreting the data is the degree of patient bias (whether or not there is a difference between the 2 groups). The authors"

Question: Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Abstract and citation information in the Supplement are available upon request.

The following was discussed in the discussion: A review of the literature regarding the use of adjustment for reporting heterogeneity and conclusions to date are discussed. In order to provide a basis for a final recommendation on adjusting for reporting heterogeneity, the following adjustments or additions were proposed: Considerations of subgroup characteristics between subgroups were evaluated. The impact of adjustments were compared with those for comparisons of the same subgroup with and without the adjustment. When possible, measures of differences between subgroups were analyzed. Differences between subgroups in the number of hours in each of four morning meal types were examined.

The following items were reviewed: Studies evaluating the impact of adjustment for reporting heterogeneity on the association between sleep duration and health outcomes and are primarily of interest were reviewed. Data were extracted into separate tables by the authors and summarized according to the following categories: No adjustments;

Adjustments for covariates;

Subgroup measures of effect such as gender, health behavior, level of education, work histories, ethnicity, body mass index, ethnicity, and sleep duration by education, race/ethnicity, and total hours spent in bed and bedtimes.

The following issues were evaluated in detail: (1) Subgroup characteristics of the subpopulations examined; (2) Adjustments for covariates;

Does this study adequately account for the possibility that non–individual differences in response to meal frequency or the number of hours in bed and bedtimes contribute to the association between sleep duration and health outcomes?

Two reviewers (RM and JF) independently reviewed each of the citations reported in the search strategy and synthesized the information to formulate a consensus statement concerning the issues discussed.

Finally, each author wrote a list of recommendations that would further our understanding of the relationship between sleep deprivation and health outcomes. For this purpose, two reviewers (GRS and ESM) independently evaluated each recommendation.

Conclusions of the Recommendations

Recommendations for Health Monitoring of Long-term Sleep Restriction

Recommendation 1: Evaluate sleep durations, other environmental factors, and health behaviors to ensure the validity of the association between sleep deprivation and health outcomes.

Recommendation 2: Implement research on sleep durations and other environmental factors to establish that sleep-related health effects are real and measurable and to guide sleep durations in accordance with evidence-based recommendations.

Recommendation 3: Monitor trends in daytime sleepiness patterns and health outcomes through an epidemiological review.

Recommendation 4: Study and evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and disease-specific outcomes in the population.

Recommendation 5: Consider adjustment for reporting heterogeneity for observational research.

Recommendation 6: Establish consistent sleep-related body mass index standards; standardize meal timing standards; design and implement national standards to monitor overweight and obesity; develop and implement national sleep training programs; implement national standards for bedtimes and early bedtimes.

Question: Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does low LDL-C promote increased intima-media thickness? Why do low HDL-C promote increased intima-media thickness? What are the clinical implications of the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and blood vessel atherosclerosis? What are the clinical implications of the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and arterial calcification? What are the clinical implications of the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and acute coronary syndrome? What are the clinical implications of the association between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and coronary calcification and heart diseases?

Answer:

1) Low HDL does not cause arterial calcification, and the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and blood vessel atherosclerosis remains unknown.

2) A plausible mechanism why low HDL causes arterial calcification is that it promotes lipid storage in subclinical atherosclerotic plaques that are rapidly developing within the arterial wall.

3) The high frequency of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is in large part attributable to a complex interaction between a genetic predisposition associated with low HDL levels and a complex metabolic response to insulin resistance that occurs early in life.

4) The high frequency of cardiovascular death, stroke, and sudden death is largely due to a complex interaction between a genetic predisposition associated with low HDL levels and a complex metabolic response to low HDL levels.

Question: How can you prevent high-glucose diet-induced metabolic syndrome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How can you prevent high-glucose diet-induced metabolic syndrome?

Answer:

1) The risk of metabolic syndrome increases significantly when plasma glucose rises from normal glucose levels after consuming a very high-calorie (25% kcal/day) high-fructose (HFD) diet for 1 week.

2) Low-glycemic index (LGI) diets have been shown to reduce plasma glucose levels while increasing HDL-C levels. A low-glycemic index diet increases HDL with a concomitant reduction in LDL and increases HDL with a concomitant concomitant increase in triglyceride (TG). To investigate the effect of these dietary changes on glucose homeostasis, healthy subjects were given 2 doses of a low-glycemic index (LGI) diet and followed 4 weeks later by the same low-glycemic index (LGI) diet. Plasma glucose, insulin, and lipids were determined.

3) Glucose homeostasis is impaired in persons with both severe polyglutaminergic diabetes mellitus as defined by the American Diabetes Association criteria and insulin resistance caused by polyglutaminergic disease.

4) As described in the context of insulin resistance, ""Insulin resistance causes dysregulation of glucose metabolism by upregulation of glycogen synthesis and depletions of the lipolytic enzymes as well as reduced levels of phospholipase A2 and beta-1-hydroxylase. These cellular responses are known to be related to impaired ability of the beta-cell to maintain the adequate glucose supply to skeletal muscle fibres of adults with various types of polyglutaminergic diabetes mellitus.""

Question: Does a high-protein diet cause insulin resistance? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Does a high-protein diet cause insulin resistance?

Answer:

1) High protein intake is associated with reduced glucose and insulin levels, but there are no differences in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations if subjects consume a high-calorie (25% kcal/day) high-protein (∼20% kcal/day) diet for 10 weeks before or after another 9-week high-protein (∼25% kcal/day) diet.

2) Plasma glucose concentration increases with the consumption of a high-protein (∼20% kcal/day) diet.

3) After consuming a high-protein (∼20% kcal/day) diet, subjects have a higher insulin response than subjects consuming a low-protein (∼10% kcal/day) diet.

4) The insulin sensitivity index (ISI), the ratio of total to HDL response to insulin (ΔI/ΔH), is significantly increased in subjects consuming a high-protein diet compared to subjects consuming a low-protein (∼10% kcal/day) high-protein diet.

Question: A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are they effective? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Q: One or two days of residential, long-term, or short-stay hospitalization for a child and/or pregnant woman, with their primary caregiver. How effective is these placements?

Answer: These types of placements are not very effective at preventing mortality.

1. Residential placements of infants in adult homes, typically in infant dormitories, with the infants' primary caregivers. Such placements (4 or more days) typically have a short duration and no long-term benefits. (8)

2. Long-term nursing house placements in infant care facilities. These placements (1 to 2 years) with primary caregivers may be effective at preventing death (3). (3.1)

3. Intensive outpatient hospitalized children's homes for infants, children not in nursing homes, and mothers between 42-46 years of age. These placements have a longer duration and are more likely to be of long-term benefit than other types of placements. (5)

4. Intensive outpatient community residential for children between 25 to 29 years. These placements are also of longer duration than inpatient placements and more likely to be of long-term benefit than other types of placements. However, studies that examined mortality were unable to find evidence that children assigned this type of placement lived longer on average than other children of similar ages. These studies also have a poor follow-up and are limited by being observational studies of children between 25 and 29. (5)

5. Residential hospitals for infants and young children between 5 and 15 years (3.8 million), children of either racial/ethnic groups, or age- and sex-matched comparison groups.

6. Extended-stay inpatient facilities (hospital beds for 24 hours or more) for infants, children, pregnant women and other pediatric patients. These facilities are less durable than inpatient residential placements and have less benefit when compared with other types of long-term inpatient placements on mortality and morbidity. (5)

7. All-day residential hospitals for infants, children, pregnant women and children between 5 and 19 years. These facility-based facilities are less durable when compared with other types of longer-lasting placements on mortality.

8. Intensive outpatient hospitalization for infants between 25 and 29 years. These hospital-based hospital units are less durable on mortality than general hospitalization units and most studies have demonstrated poor follow-up and are limited by being observational studies of infant health.

One of the most important studies of such outcomes that have been completed to date was that of Fava and colleagues (25), which examined the mortality of 3,634 infants (1,816 infants and 787 children) who received a mean of four or more days of hospitalization between July 1991 and June 1992. There were 1,200 deaths, a death rate of 17.7 per 1,000 infant days received, a significant reduction from the previous year, and a significant reduction from the mortality rate of 17.1 per 1,000 days received over the previous five years. In comparison, a mean of 1,087 infants (836 infants and 793 children) received general hospitalization and died on average 1.7 days later. For comparison purposes, a five-year mean mortality rate was also taken from the same study, and we have used this data for the following analyses.

An earlier report of the study and its follow-up methods appeared in Pediatrics in 1996 (33), in which the authors described the outcome data from two observational studies of the benefit or lack thereof of intensive outpatient hospitalization compared with general hospitalization (n = 1,700 infants; n = 948 children). Those studies found no effect for deaths on days when infants were hospitalized for observation after the birth of an infant but some reductions in days when infants were hospitalized for observation had occurred. For more recent data, see the information provided in this report.

Most recently, a study of infant mortality rates in five-year age categories found no significant difference in the rate of death among neonates in intensive outpatient units compared with short-stay beds (5). The authors also compared infants with short-stay inpatient inpatient units with those who received general hospitals. The results of this article have been published online in Pediatrics. (27)

One of the more surprising studies of inpatient morbidity and mortality that is currently being performed for this report and others is the study of Nieswander and colleagues (35). This study of more than 24,000 children aged 9 through 21 years at a special pediatric hospital in the Northeast had the largest number of infants receiving acute psychiatric inpatient care: 3,811 of which received acute psychiatric inpatient treatment. It also had the largest follow-"
Question: Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Did Latin America's traffic law reform push police enforcement?

Answer: Not in the 1990s. It did not.

Answer: It started to. The 1990s saw a dramatic push to pass new laws and policies designed to discourage speeding and road rage, especially in Latin America.

Question: Why did the U.S. speed control laws become an international legal standard?

Answer: Traffic laws are rules imposed by authorities, and these rules are universal in every part of the world, regardless of political and cultural differences. International conventions have an important but inescapable flaw: The rules are usually more of a guide -- even the ones about speed limits or license-plate numbers -- than a reality check.

Question: Why did police begin focusing exclusively on serious accidents early in the 1970s?

Answer: They needed to make more arrests. There were too few arrests, and police could not use their resources to catch the kind of reckless drivers that contributed to those serious accidents. In part, this meant making a ""show-me"" approach, by focusing on breaking up accidents and then sending offenders to jail. Another part was to force speeders to spend more time behind bars because they were expensive to keep behind bars for longer. It is also well documented, as were many of these programs, with police, that the more you can spend on arresting speeders, the less you can spend on making other cases and convictions.

Question: Why have some of these policies been so successful? Why did these policies take root so fast?

Answer: The biggest factor was a combination of factors: the availability of information technology, police and judicial resources, public opinion, and an institutional culture of enforcement: officers were encouraged to find and pursue offenders, police chiefs often made traffic offenses their first priority in their first year on the job, and many jurisdictions were heavily influenced by the federal government.

Question: Is there a need to revise current law, in particular traffic law, in the US? Are there alternatives? Why hasn't it happened?

Answer: We don't know. But if you were to take a close look at U.S. policy, you'll find a long list of policies that haven't gone anywhere, including the current high-speed limits on highways, higher insurance rates, more aggressive citation systems for speeding, mandatory minimum sentences, enhanced penalties for driving while intoxicated, and high-speed camera enforcement.

Question: What does this have to do with the question: Are traffic laws changing? Or are they maintaining the same state of affairs?

Answer: As I've written on many occasions, I do not believe the two are linked. (See also my previous article on the topic.) The speed limits and the increased criminal penalties they are a result of is a real trend on the ground, and it has been evident for a few decades.

Question: Is it time to re-think the US traffic laws?

Answer: As for the future of a traffic law, I don't think it's an unimportant question. My view (and that of others who have written about changes that are occurring) is that our current system is very good and it is getting better. (My view on the current system is here.)

More background for the reader — including an extensive discussion of the history of the traffic laws in the US — is included in our previous article on this topic.

Question: Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do routine laboratory markers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NSHE) are useful in detecting the diagnosis? If so, what other laboratory markers are useful?

Answer: These markers are used in some diagnostic laboratories, to determine if a patient does or does not need to undergo CT or MR imaging. All of these markers involve the production of a ""chemical messenger"" called glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) - the enzyme which converts glutamic acid to glutamate. One marker is called the ""non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug anti-thyroid (NSAID) anti-glutamate (Glu-glu) monoclonal antibody"" (NSL-GABA) - this test measure the anti-inflammatory action of the NSAID. The other markers are the antibodies against specific types of proteins on the surface of NSHE - GAD and Glu-glu. NSL-GABA is known to be a useful marker of the NSHE, as well as its correlation with CT imaging. However, other markers for NSHEs are more difficult to use. Thus, one need only be mindful of the presence or lack of GAD enzymes to determine whether the patients is NSHE. As such, these markers need to be routinely measured before and after CT or MR imaging, to make sure that they will be able to identify NSHEs as well. They are not reliable or validated tests to diagnose NSHE. The following is a list of some markers for different types of NSHEs: NSHE monoclonal antibody, IgG (IgG anti-GAD)

The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) reported in the United States that there were 1,085,200 adults aged 14 years or older, of whom 633,600 were vaccinated in the 2011-12 USPHS Vaccine Use Survey. This is an increase of 2.2% from the 2013-14 USPHS Vaccine Use Survey which was conducted for the first time using a sample representative of the U.S. population.

The average age for vaccinated people was 36.2 years old, which is 5% higher than the 2012 USPHS Vaccine Use Survey estimate of age 36.3. The gap in age between vaccinated and unvaccinated in the United States has increased over the past 25 years. In 1972, the average age gap was only 0.7 years which has widened to 6 months. Currently, the gap in age between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults in the United States is at an all-time high of 10 years.

While it may not seem like it, the difference in average age between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults is an important indicator of socioeconomic status. It shows the number of adults without health coverage relative to the population at large. In other words, the percentage of people who are unvaccinating or unable to have the vaccine does not reflect the health status of those who are immunized. Additionally, the population percentage for that age gap has been decreasing steadily over the years.


In 2012, about 9% of the population aged 15 to 49 years in the U.S. was not vaccinated.

In 2013, the U.S. population aged 15–49 years was at its lowest number of unvaccinated individuals in the history of the USPHS Vaccine Use Survey since its inception. For the first time in history, the U.S. population aged 15 to 49 years was below the national estimate of unvaccinated individuals for the entire year. In addition, the proportion of infants aged 6 months and older in the U.S. who were vaccinated at age 12 or older stood at 63%.

If the current trends of declining vaccination rates continue, the U.S. population will be unable to adequately protect itself from a number of serious bacterial and viruses that are transmitted by medical procedures and by those who come in contact with a person who is not fully vaccinated, and can lead to serious infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends for the general population that everyone 13 years and older receive a vaccine dose at least 2 years prior to travelling to an area with high risk for a high prevalence of polio, including China, India, and Pakistan; and for those age 16 and older, that they receive a 5-dose vaccine series if staying for an extended period of time in an area where polio is present.

Although vaccines are not without risk, the U.S. Government, CDC, FDA and others are committed to protecting the average U.S. citizen against all diseases, including the most feared virus that is linked in epidemiological studies to deadly outcomes — the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

In 2013, the CDC said the estimated number of new HIV infections in the United States rose 18% to more than 13.3 million. Of those 13.3 million new infections (1.6% of total new infections), more than half (49%) are in adults ages 25 to 34. The number of new infections has remained relatively stable for the past 3 years, and no HIV infection for men infected by the male-to-female type of HIV, including males of all age groups, was reported for 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

However, it has been noted that not everyone will get the vaccine or benefit the risk level of protection from having the vaccine or from using it to prevent an infection from becoming more severe.

When someone comes in contact with someone who has been protected from a virus and who does not have the vaccine or"
Question: Is there a model to teach and practice retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," 1. What are some scientific studies supporting how this procedure is better than open-heart surgery for the treatment of patients with difficult-to-control end-stage renal disease? 2. What are some studies showing that nephrectomy may be more useful than open-heart surgery for the treatment of patients who are at low risk of developing an early kidney disease (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, acute tubular necrosis, acute kidney injury, acute renal failure, diabetic uremic syndrome)?

Response and discussion : The consensus that the main benefit of doing an open-heart surgery is that is most commonly gained after the surgery itself has been completed. This benefit is not as strong as it seems and does reduce the number of operations performed but is better than what many are advocating for the practice of nephrectomy. Many surgeons have been experimenting with nephrectomy for use in patients who have severe heart failure but who have not received renal transplantation. It is not clear whether the extra benefit to the patient is worth the cost of the surgery at this time. There is also a risk of major complications post-op due simply to the fact that renal transplantation does not take place until the kidneys have developed. If there is a great improvement in renal function following this procedure, it may not take long for the kidneys to develop. However, if there are worsening renal function before or after this procedure, it raises the question of whether an intra-operative blood transfusion is warranted and whether surgery should be done anyway. The choice is not as clear as the authors suggest, particularly if the patient is not particularly robust or has other serious complications that require surgery.

The choice is not as clear as the authors suggest, particularly if the patient is not particularly robust or has other serious complications that require surgery. Discussion: Although there are many differences between the procedures in this article, the authors should be commended for including discussion of the possible advantages of surgical techniques. However, it should be noted that many of the factors they list are of no benefit to the average person (i.e., a patient with normal renal function, a risk of major complications, etc.) and are the opposite of what many are advocating in the medical community. Many people who are willing to try the surgery may have little hope of achieving good results either because the operation is too risky or because there are factors, such as a pre-established kidney dysfunction, which would make this surgery unwise.

Post operative care : After surgery, nephrectomy offers the most improvement for the patient than any other surgical technique to date. It was initially believed that the only significant post-op complication would be an end stage hip fracture but these studies may have over-stated the relative benefit. In patients with acute renal failure, it does not appear to be necessary to have either of these procedures followed by open-heart surgery. The authors make several points regarding the care of patients post-op. They recommend that it should be performed regardless of the severity of kidney dysfunction or history. They state that it should be done if the kidney function test results were normal; therefore, they advocate for a transurethral catheter rather than a transurethral vein catheter when performing this procedure compared to open-heart surgery. Unfortunately, these recommendations do not go as far as what many may be expecting. Although they do not recommend doing the endoscopy and nephrectomy simultaneously, they do recommend the use of a sterile nephrectomy, if possible, if the kidney function is lower than is being maintained with the above procedures and only if the patient has a risk that will be minimal. The authors recommend that these patients should be considered for a transurethral catheter and that a transurethral vein catheter with blood transfusion (if needed) should be considered. They also mention that"
Question: Cardiovascular risk in a rural adult West African population: is resting heart rate also relevant? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Cardiovascular risk in a rural adult West African population: is resting heart rate also relevant?

Introduction

A common refrain in scientific literature is a relation involving resting heart rate (RHR). The assumption is that as RHR decreases and heart rate rises in the resting phase, the risk of a cardiovascular event grows. This is an intuitive argument, but the evidence is somewhat lacking. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to investigate this. This has the potential to be of use when doing risk assessments for both patients and clinicians. The review was limited to a single population of women living in rural West Africa. A total study population of almost 600 people was investigated and RHR was not assessed [1].

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between RHR and cardiovascular events in rural West African women. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and causes of cardiovascular events in rural South African women and to investigate the impact of RHR in a cross-section of the women's lives. This also helps to explain why RHR has such a small role in African health care systems, in terms of health care providers' awareness and provision of risk assessment.

Method

The methods used for this study included a meta-analysis of cohort studies [2] for studies which compared RHR levels in rural and urban and in a systematic review and meta-analysis for studies looking in detail at RHR. Additionally we conducted randomised controlled comparison of RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Findings

A total of 23 studies were included in our review, including 14 in rural West Africa, 4 in a community in rural South Africa [3] and 3 in rural Australia [4]. From these studies, 11 in rural West Africa, 8 in villages in one rural South Africa, 8 in community in rural Australia, 2 in community in South Africa (as part of the study) and 1 in community in Australia were identified. All studies found that RHR does not predict cardiovascular events. However, many of these studies failed to report the time of blood draw or have reported RHR with more than one study. The number of reported events varied from 3 (in South Africa) to 26 (in Australia), but the mean (SD) was 6.9 (7.1) weeks. For the same group, the number of non-fatal cardiovascular events was also low (3), including falls, transient ischaemic events, acute ischaemic heart attacks and sudden cardiac death.

Summary of findings

We found no evidence of any relationship between RHR and cardiovascular events in rural South African women. However, although RHR did not predict risk of an adverse cardiovascular event in the sub-population studied, it did suggest a trend towards risk reduction [10]. On the contrary, RHR had a similar effect in a cross section of rural Africans' lives, with very few or no cardiovascular events occurring in the sub-population studied. This does not rule out that RHR might have a role to play.

One explanation is that RHR in rural settings differs from that in urban settings, where there are more health care providers and better systems for reporting RHR. This difference may explain the apparent lack of effect, as it was observed that the majority of studies in rural areas did not report RHR, while in urban settings it was observed that 70% of studies reported RHR. It is also possible that in rural settings RHR might be different from what is observed in a hospital setting as the hospital does not collect RHR data. The number of studies investigating the effect of RHR in rural Africa is extremely small.

Another possibility for RHR's lack of role is that there were insufficient samples in rural settings. These studies usually used a cross section of two or three or four rural populations, to allow for the possibility that RHR differs between those locations. To avoid the type of bias that might arise from different samples that report RHR as a dependent variable from a common time point, these studies used the time point for RHR measurement as the 'pooling time' whereas we used the time of blood draw.

In conclusion, RHR is not associated with cardiovascular events but only with non-fatal events. This is a mixed message but may explain why RHR has a small role in African health care systems."
Question: Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How realistic is the military scenario scenario regarding the use of medical evacuations from Israel, or other countries, for terrorist or extremist attacks on Israeli targets? The Israeli Ministry of Defense (MoD) recently discussed the following challenges that the IDF will have to face in future terrorist attacks on Israeli targets, including attacks in the next days: • When a terrorist has been caught earlier, he is likely to be already carrying bomb-ridden hands and an additional device; • With an existing population of more than 20 million people living in the heart of the Middle East, and with thousands more seeking to escape from Gaza, Lebanon and Syria to escape from war, the IDF's ability to respond to many of the threat scenarios that the IDF plans to face if necessary is less than what it was in the 1990's and 2000's when the IDF fought large-scale wars with no plans for medical evacuations, and where the ability to quickly transport injured casualties to medical evacuation facilities was not as important as in the 1980's and 1990's when large-scale wars were fought with great concern for civilians' safety. In the ""Highyakh"", the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were widely thought to have been unprepared for Palestinian resistance during the Yom Kippur War in 2000, and the IDF's response after the 2006 Gaza War was not thought to have been as effective as the IDF had hoped. In this context, the IDF will face a host of challenges if the IDF and the IDF Health Authorities (IDH), with the support of other organizations such as the IHAI, decide to move the medical evacuations to a priority setting within the next few days. • The number of wounded combatants and combatants who will need the help of medical evacuation is not being known. • The IDF has a difficult set of requirements and requirements to fulfill; namely, the IDF will be able to evacuate wounded combatants as well as those who will need long-term assistance. • The number of fighters currently being held at Israel's military bases has not been made public to date. This makes the IDF's ability to evacuate the wounded to medical evacuation facilities more difficult, and may delay evacuation. • The IDF's ability to respond rapidly to a potential terrorist attack on Israeli civilians may also have been delayed by the number of potential hostages, and the potential of the hostage situation for Israeli hostages being a target for terrorists. In these terms, the IDF's response time to a possible threat to Israeli civilians will be more costly, or longer than in the past, when the IDF responded rapidly to a specific attack, with limited casualties, against an IDF force in need of medical evacuation. • IDF medical evacuation in general is not able to respond quickly to attacks in the future; and the IDF's preparedness plans may not prevent a future terrorist attack against Israeli civilians, or may not provide medical evacuation facilities in the near future. • The Israeli Defense Ministry should continue to develop and promote a health system that can rapidly and efficiently respond to the medical needs of the IDF troops on the battlefield. • The Israeli Health Ministry and its allies should continue to raise awareness and create awareness regarding the need to evacuate wounded soldiers from the field, and should create procedures to facilitate the evacuation of injured Soldiers and their families from the field. • The IDF's medical evacuation infrastructure cannot immediately respond to unforeseen emergencies of any kind, such as natural disasters, or incidents that might threaten the hospital's own medical and scientific centers, and must be able to rapidly and efficiently respond. The IDF Chief of Staff's Health Committee and his staff have put in place a comprehensive working plan (Health Working Plan), outlining a set of specific demands for an IDF Health Authority within four to six weeks. The IDF Health Authority will be responsible for the delivery of medical assistance to the military forces, and for the medical transportation of those injured in the IDF operations for which the IDF has a need for medical evacuation capacity. For medical evacuation in the near future, to ensure quick response and to maximize the IDF's ability to respond, the IDF will continue to expand its medical evacuation infrastructure by consolidating ambulances, providing space for ambulances to access the field as a whole, and constructing additional medical evacuation facilities (more than 700 of which are already active). The new ambulances will be equipped with the proper equipment necessary for the evacuation of wounded individuals. The existing ambulances will continue to be used for the emergency and limited evacuation of wounded individuals, and will continue as an integral part of the health care system. When evacuating the injured from the field during an operation that is a military operation, the IDF will first perform a comprehensive plan to evacuate wounded soldiers and their families to other field hospitals, to avoid potential civilian casualties. After conducting medical evacuation, the IDF will maintain and document the status of those who can be evacuated to an area with adequate medical evacuation capacity. During that time, the hospital will also be able to provide transport services"
Question: Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome?

A: This article summarizes the evidence for the relationship between a low oxygen-to-oxygen ratio and lung cancer, but it does not address the question of whether or not all children with asthma are at risk.

B: The effect of oxygen on lung tumor growth in children is controversial. The relationship between oxygen in the blood and lung cancer development has been known since the first large-scale, controlled trial of the effect of increasing hemoglobin levels in babies. This clinical trial found no effect of increasing hemoglobin levels in a group of children with pulmonary hypertension, although many of the other potential confounding factors were different.

C: Early childhood asthma exacerbates the risk of a later growth disability and disease (increased need for supplemental oxygen) among the long-term residents of child-care centers. (The effect of a short-term decrease in oxygen in the blood is not demonstrated.)

D: There is a link with long-term use of corticosteroids. It was shown that children that were given the steroids as young as 2 to 3 years of age (and who then had to take them for many years) had increased risk for developing bronchial asthma. More recently, some studies have found that children who previously had a family history of asthma experienced a higher incidence of short-term exacerbations of asthma.

E: While there is evidence for a causal link between short-term exposure of the airways to environmental factors and short-term adverse outcomes, there is a lack of evidence for a causal link with long-term exposure.

The following section of the article discusses long-term inhaler use following the diagnosis of asthma in children with an oxygen-to-oxygen ratio lower than 25, or the association between this and the development of adult lung cancers. In addition, the following section discusses how to interpret the findings.

Risks of short-term and long-term exposures

Risk of short-term and long-term exposures

Short-term exposure: Inhaler use can cause respiratory distress, and a study by Mazzotti, et al., suggested that one to three inhaled particles from a single dose of inhaled corticosteroids can reach the central nervous system and induce a temporary change in the nervous system which may lead gradually to a condition known as central sensitization.

Long-term exposure: One to four times the typical dose of prednisone (or prednisolone if not used in combination with another agent) may induce lung cancer in children. If inhaled at a large amount, one to two, 3- to 5-cm long particles may reach the central nervous system and induce a temporary change in the nervous system that may lead gradually to a condition known as central sensitization.

Virtually all of the cases of childhood asthma are in school-age children. Most people who have childhood asthma are not receiving treatment, and therefore, there is no evidence that high-dose corticosteroids are needed to prevent disease. However, in a controlled trial in children with asthma, a single dose of inhaled corticosteroids was as good at reducing symptoms as a high dose in adults.[2]

Risk of short-term exposure

Fluid inhaled during the cough is one type of short-term inhaler exposure. High school students used 12 times to 17 times the recommended daily dose of cyclodextrins during the last year.

There is some evidence that long-term exposure is dangerous. The following case illustrates short-term inhaler exposure.

In September, 1987, the owner of a small-town pizza bakery became ill after eating at a large downtown pizzeria. A few hours later, his father was admitted after suffering from acute respiratory distress. He was eventually diagnosed with laryngitis, and he died four months later after being found to have leukemia.

Since then, an autopsy revealed a bronchial tumor in the lung. Within the following week, her condition worsened. He died from a pulmonary embolism. Later tests revealed that the tumor and his father's DNA were identical.

This is not the only reported case of lung cancer among an employee at a New York City pizzeria. On August 6, 1987, Michael Tost, a sales associate, became ill after eating at a pizzeria near his home. It was the seventh day of his job at the time; his work began on July 13. His work area had never contained a child who worked late to avoid the cold, and he only made a few sales for dinner for the next two days.

After his death a week later, the NYPD was investigating. It was determined that Tost's workplace had been used as a"

Question: Most cancer patients would benefit from a ""predictive biomarker"" for future prostate cancer recurrence. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Most cancer patients would benefit from a ""predictive biomarker"" for future prostate cancer recurrence.

Answers: Yes

Question: What does ""BRCA1-2"" mean? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the meaning of ""BRCA1-2""

Answers: BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA3, BRCA5, BRCA6, BRCA8, BRCA11, BRCA12, BRCA12/19

Question: Why does the BRCA test work so well in identifying women at higher risk of recurrence compared with men at lower risk of recurrence? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the meaning of ""BRCA test works so well in identifying women at higher risk of recurrence compared with men at lower risk of recurrence.""

Answers: The test predicts up to 95% of a woman's overall prognosis for recurrence, based on her BRCA9 gene. Women with a lower BRCA9 positive status are less likely to recur and may go on to have a better overall prognosis.

Question: How do you decide which patients to test for BRCA1 and BRCA2? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the rationale behind choosing which patients to test for BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Answers: Because all cancer screenings are only able to identify one cancer and that is BRCA1-2, the current BRCA test has a high false-discovery rate (FDR). It has also been shown that men with a higher BRCA1-2 gene status were less likely to have positive results than men with a lower BRCA1-2 gene level. Therefore, there is a great public health priority to reduce the presence of BRCA-associated mutations in all people, regardless of whether that person has BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Question: How do you define ""overdiagnosed""? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains how to define ""overdiagnosed.""

Answers: If a study has 10+ positive BRCA1-2 tests in a particular group of people, they will all define as ""overdiagnosed"" if they have a positive BRCA1-2 test in at least two of the ten individuals, even if the individuals are unlikely to have any recurrence due to the BRCA1-2 test results. Since the 10+ positive BRCA1-2 tests have already been overclassified into overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed in some cases, it creates a substantial false-positive effect by defining the overdiagnosed as having recurrence due to the overdiagnosis.

Question: How many women and men will be overdiagnosed in the next decade or so? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers how many women and men will be overdiagnosed in the next decade or so.

Answers: About 1 in 3000 for men and women and about 1 in 13 men and women on average.

Question: Why in the world do we spend so much time and attention talking about breast cancer recurrence, then not enough time talking about hormone therapy treatment and other forms of cancer treatment? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question ""Why in the world do we spend so much time and attention talking about breast cancer recurrence, then not enough time talking about hormone therapy treatment and other forms of cancer treatment?""

Answers: Too numerous to list comprehensively, such topics have been studied extensively on all the various levels, in addition to the traditional clinical studies that we are currently reviewing in PubMed, and are all of sufficient relevance that researchers, clinicians and patients alike are still discussing them.

Question: Why does it take time for our health services to diagnose BRCA mutations in women? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question ""Why does it take time for our health services to diagnose BRCA mutations in women?""

Answers: We know that BRCA mutations in women are diagnosed much sooner and that the most common BRCA mutations in our population are BRCA2 and BRCA6 (the same BRCA variants that show the strongest relationship).

Question: Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation?

A: Mechanical pain syndromes that are related to somatisation are reported in varying degrees, with pain being associated with a variety of mechanical phenomena. One might argue that many reports of such syndromes are of somatisation. The somatisation hypothesis is a hypothesis that in a number of cases the somatization might be the contributing factor for pain, other biomechanical phenomena, even injury to the face, and that this association could explain why some types of chronic pain syndromes are reported without the somatisation component. An alternative view is that some reports of somatisation occur in the context of various different chronic pain syndromes, or in a case-specific case/treatments. In these cases the somatisation should exist in a variety of mechanical states for which there are no other factors to explain the pain.

There may be a difference in somatisation between somatic, and somatic-like mechanical pain syndromes with an associated somatisation component and somatic-like, non-somatic, mechanically and mechanically-related pain syndromes without somatisation. However, this difference has been noted to occur, at least in animals. In humans, we have suggested that some studies might be misclassified as not having the somatisation component because somatisation is seen to be the result of the underlying disease process of the underlying syndrome, rather than being the mechanistic or somatic pain state. It is unclear whether this is the case or not. These issues should be addressed carefully in patients with a diagnosis known to be a mechanotransduction disorder as well as in patients with the somatisation component.

One study looked at patients with migraine and reported some somatisation and pain using an MRI technique. The authors of this study concluded that the MRI findings were in good agreement with histological features of the somatosensory tissue of patients with migraine sufferers, including the presence of an abnormal signal near the coelomic (or primary) layer (Fig 1A,E).

The authors did not examine the relationship to the biomechanical system since it may be difficult to evaluate in normal, normally awake subjects. If somatisation is the underlying cause of pain, then there should be a clear mechano-mechanistic effect of the somatisation component. This effect could be that of the somatic component, but it could also be that of other biomechanical mechanisms.

A second study, which was also carried out by the same company and reported in the same issue (1A) did not provide any evidence that patients with migraine with aura had an abnormal signal near the coelomic (or primary) layer and this could be part of the somatisation hypothesis. There is good agreement between MRI and histological findings (Fig 3, G; E.2, G.2 and J.2; see reference 1) for all samples. One study reported that the histology pattern of patients with migraine with aura was consistent with abnormalities of the coelomic layer in the somato-sensory cortex (1B).

B: Skeletal muscle biopsies of patients with chronic facial pain have been reported [and may be the subject of further investigation]. A sample of 22 patients was recruited. Some reports of mechanical dysfunction in pain associated with chronic facial pain included mechanical sensations in the facial lamina propria and in the superior part of the anterior temporal bone, as well as in the posterior part of the temporal bone (see references 1 and 4 for a detailed review of these reports). Although all the patients in this study had migraine on presentation, there was no evidence for any abnormality of the cortical biopsy or of muscle microcirculation within the facial bone area. There was also some evidence for abnormalities of muscle biopsy location [which probably reflects a more localized damage to a single region of the skin or bone] but not in any of the muscle tissue, as the number of reported histological findings is much too low. Some reports [1B,E,3, 4] have identified the somatisation component as an etiological component in patients with chronic facial pain.

A: The most common somatisation is in the intermandibular joint and may begin with a pain sensation during the stretching of the muscle. The muscle is then felt as an irregular pressure on the mandibular lumbar region and sometimes there is pain on movement in this area. The pressure over this region in facial pain might be thought of as an intrusion of pain over the mandibular lumbar region. The somatisation and other mechanical symptoms can be seen in almost any study and there are a variety of such symptoms that may be seen in patients"
Question: Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

A. What are the common causes of amblyopia and how most people respond to them?

B. How does an amblyopic person interpret his or her amblyopic status?

C. Have other causes of amblyopia been identified? What other explanations have been found?


Answer


(A. B.)

A. Amblyopia is defined as near-sightedness, where the visual fields overlap in an acute way. People who have amblyopia do not notice this at all. Usually they are aware of nearsightedness, but they think other things that the other senses are fine.


(B)

You need an explanation about how this works.

You can use a metaphor that people will relate to. Example

""A patient with amblyopia sees better colors when viewed at one end or the other...""""This patient may not look at the same colors at two perspectives because they have very different visual fields from the central eye. In such cases a patient with amblyopia thinks about the color more because the other senses are not engaged,"".

(A C)

What is an amblyopic person?

""A person with amblyopia has normal vision at distance but not in close-up vision. This person often feels ambivalent to the world around them. This person may have very strong or vivid eye movements during close-up sight...""

(B)A person who does not recognize and/or see in the world around him or her is called an amblyopic.

""A person with an amblyopic field of vision may have a very weak field of vision in close-up vision.""


(C)

What's the answer?

(A. B.)

A. Amblyopia occurs in nearly all people. I can't tell you what it is like in other cases; there is a lot of variation here, but it is not uncommon. A person who sees better colors from one end of the visual field than the other, is a person with amblyopia; it's not uncommon to ""see in the world"". This doesn't mean we see better at a given distance if we are standing still. The eye-brain system is very good at discriminating between near and far and is always trying to maximize the sense of what goes on in the eye's visual field of view. A person who thinks about a given thing just happens to see the thing in his/her field of vision. That may be confusing. But the truth is, people often get confused if they are unaware of the differences in the fields of vision around them. If you do not respond, that's not what you are saying! If you are amblyopic, that means you have normal vision. Amblyopes always have poor vision. They don't have visual acuity, which is about 3-6/8 - inches (8-24mm) in distance, but they have normal field of view.

Here are some articles: What is an amblyopic.

What is normal visual acuity.

Why do amblyopes get confused?

Answer

(A. B.)

A. ""Normal visual acuity"" refers to the minimum distances per inch (e.g., 3/32"") that the visual field can cover. It doesn't imply that each of your cones, rods, or photoreceptors fills that space perfectly. When you look at something at 10cm, the distance it can cover in one eye for about 20 seconds is about 2.5 metres (8-24 feet) and varies with how good the lenses are working for you and your genetics; you have to be careful about picking up on the more distant things first. If you can't see that fine detail better with two glasses then you might consider optometrist intervention.

""Normal visual acuity"" means a person with average visual acuity at near distance, for any given distance. Normal visual acuity at a distance of 10cm is 10/80. Some people have normal visual acuity at distances of about 20m (61 feet) but only about 10m (1.6 feet) is usable. This is usually because of vision disorders like hyperopia and/or astigmatism. For those people, there is a constant range of visual fields that they need to use to have a normal visual experience.

Here are some articles: Why do retinitis pigmentosa patients have normal vision below 20m and vision in some other parts of their visual field?

Why do patients with visual disturbances or vision disorders have poor visual acuity?


(G.)

""Near vision"" means seeing near objects, in the three-dimensional space that surrounds them. For example, if they were standing"
Question: Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor: is the standard of effective analgesia reachable in all women? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Implementing epidural analgesia for labor: may the standard of effective analgesia for labor be reached?

The goal of this study was to compare the cost of epidural analgesia in the first two weeks of labor, with standard of effectiveness measures (as measured by the rate of analgesic use or the duration of use). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomised controlled trials that compared the use of epidural analgesia in the first two weeks of labor, or the standard of effectiveness measures, with other analgesic use as judged by the rate of analgesic use, including general analgesia or other general pain control measures. We contacted authors of trials that met these criteria, who were asked how many women in their studies used epidural analgesia as compared with a control (placebo), on a 0 to 2 scale. If a trial had more than 10 women in the study, the rate of control was used. If a trial did not have enough women for a 0 to 2 scale, a 0 to 3 scale was used.

This is the first Cochrane review of epidural analgesia for labor published after 9 years of activity, so we were surprised to find that many trials were still working through many years of debate about what measures should be used, and how well those measures met our goals. It was also surprising even more that most trials examined epidural analgesia as a control for pain during the second stage of labor. The consensus was that the second stage of labor begins when the uterine cavity is fully dilated and the cervix fully penetrated. In order to maximise analgesia, a very large number of women in both clinical and theoretical studies used epidural morphine for induction, followed by epidural acetaminophen on day 3. While it seemed that epidural morphine and acetaminophen in combination would be the key to optimal analgesia, only 17 trials involving 1.8 million patients in total measured pain during the second stage and did not show substantial improvement. In a later Cochrane Review, the authors concluded that 'with the exception of 2 studies, no other trials showed that either control or analgesia during the second stage of labor was more frequently performed than control.' (23) Most of the trials were conducted in European countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, where some women, especially women in low income and/or minority groups, have been found to be unable to access epidural analgesia. With the onset of Medicare spending on healthcare for new mothers, it becomes apparent that the quality of trials has fallen. We are aware of a number of trials that are clearly over-utilising available analgesia, but we were able to find only a handful of trials not meeting our definition. Therefore, there have been numerous missed opportunities to improve research.

Our results should be reassuring to those women that have used epidural analgesia, and for who the standard of effectiveness measurement is a difficult one to assess, to be completely satisfied. We do not expect that in most women, the standard of effectiveness is reached at all, but instead that epidural analgesia does provide substantial analgesia at a lower cost than the control of analgesia in combination of general analgesia, general pain control, or any pain control measures. The problem we have with the concept of 'effective analgesia' is that the quality of evidence needed to decide whether or not to use a drug of choice is often very poor. That is why it is so important to use a systematic review and meta-analysis in place of observational studies. The only difference is that observational studies can help with evaluating which measures are effective and which are not. The fact that there are so many trials that provide conflicting information between these measures of effectiveness clearly needs to be taken into account.

Some studies had a higher threshold at which pain thresholds were considered too low for analgesia to be considered 'effective'. While these trials may be valid data, their use did not necessarily mean that the cost-effectiveness of epidural analgesia cannot be assessed. It may be that higher thresholds were acceptable, as long as the threshold could be reached without taking long periods of time. However in the current context, the current method of assessing costs, based on a patient's experience of pain, also has an inherent bias in favour of an analgesic or drugs for pain control such as morphine. An important question that was discussed in a review by MacIntyre et al. (24) was whether any type of analgesia could be classified as effective because of the patient's experience or knowledge of pain. In our study, most women in the control group were able to experience pain during the first few days of their first round because of their history. However in the case of women who initially tried to discontinue analgesia or only started a partial cessation, the rate of analgesic use was higher among"

Question: Is halofantrine ototoxic? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is halofantrine ototoxic?


Answer: The clinical situation concerning the safety of a medication given to an epileptic patient is not fully known. It should be determined whether certain effects occur in patients who receive the drug. There are some reports of the use of this drug at a dose which is very low (less than 1 mg). The only difference for this drug from the traditional anticonvulsant drugs is that it affects the peripheral nervous system.


Halofantrine has been studied in a wide range of different animal and human animal models. From the animal model studies, it has been suggested that certain brain or central nervous system effects of the drug could be elicited. However, these animal studies did not explore all the possible consequences of the drug in relation to the epileptic brain, and these effects need further exploration for further clinical trials.


In general, the clinical effect of halofantrine is most likely short lived (1-5 days) which lasts until the seizure ceases. Because the halofantrine is injected into the nerve, any changes (and consequently irreversible effects) in the nervous system are less likely to be discovered than in the case of other medications. No reports of the possible long-term effects of the drug have been published. However, there are many cases of long-term epileptic activity, which could occur if the patient continues to take the drug and fails to go into a state of unconsciousness. Such cases represent a serious problem in the long term, especially in young children who are especially sensitive to the effects of halofantrine. This in turn raises concerns about possible long-term toxic reactions. The fact that there are no long-term adverse events associated with halofantrine suggests that the drug should not be prescribed to patients.


It has to be reminded that the drug is not used for epileptic activity and that it is not suitable as a treatment for seizures in children. More information about the use of this drug in different medical settings is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency."

Frozen Bones

Question: Is a frozen bone an acceptable material for the study of bones, or can it not be frozen? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Questions: Are samples of frozen marrow and bone obtained from healthy individuals really acceptable for the study of bones? Can the frozen marrow and bone be analyzed for their presence of antibodies or for their ability to signal a bone marrow disease diagnosis?

Answer: This type of study is only feasible if you include a healthy non-pregnant female subject; in all other cases, you should consider an additional source and obtain the subject to evaluate for the presence of bone marrow disease. In any case, a freeze-dried specimen should be treated with 1ml of the following anti-cancer drug (i.e., 1ml of Laminarin or Ampicillin) twice daily for 4 to 10 days (or until bone looks like a complete stump), following which a marrow culture should be obtained. The bone is subjected to a heat machine to destroy any pathogens, and after 3 weeks, the specimens of the marrow and bone were analyzed. The culture results should be presented at a meeting of orthopedic surgeons.

Question: Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma--is well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Is well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early or clinically advanced?

Answer:

The prognosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma is poor, although the average survival is 10-17 years in the United States.

The following table summarizes the prognosis:

Stage 1

Stage 2

Stage III or stage IV

Stage IV

Stage V

Stage VI

In patients treated successfully for small hepatocellular carcinoma (L5-6), the following benefits are anticipated (Note: There is no specific treatment of non-advanced liver cancers). These benefits include:

the chance of the cancer developing into liver cancer

a significantly lower need for surgical interventions (such as liver transplantation)

the chance that the cancer may be eliminated.

To be considered for early diagnosis, patients must have, at the minimum, a 10-mm (1/16"") or more tumor in the liver, a non-small cell carcinoma, and have been tested for metastatic disease (see below).

The following table summarizes the benefits of early detection, including early surgical procedures, for L5-6. The benefit for a 15-mm (1/16"") or more tumor in the liver is a 15-year survival rate of 75%.

Benefits of early detection, including:

Stage III

Stage IV

Stage V

Stage VI

The mortality rate for low-grade liver cancer is approximately 3%.

Survivors who undergo surgery for liver cancer are given an increased chance of survival if a significant portion of the tumor is removed (see below).

Surgical therapies for small hepatocellular carcinoma commonly use the following types of operations:

capping (e.g., liver flotation)

amploprostomy (e.g., abdominal aortoplasty)

open-heart surgery to increase the size of the vessel

In patients treated successfully for advanced small hepatocellular carcinoma (L6-7), there are no specific treatment options. As a result, a significant number of patients will have their liver resected and continue with chemotherapy and physical therapy.

There is no specific treatment of non-advanced liver cancers. Some early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma is accomplished with specialized imaging techniques and anesthetics. A significant number of non-advanced liver cancers develop into non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLC) without the traditional surgery. To date, these non-small cell cancers are the most resistant to aggressive therapy.

Non-aggressive treatment options for advanced liver cancers include surgery as well as surgery and radiation therapy.

The major surgical therapies for non-advanced liver cancer include:

Liver flotation

amploprostomy

open-heart surgery (e.g., aortoplasty)

prostheses (e.g., aortic stent and aortic sleeve)

surgery with an open air vein (e.g., transvalvular or open-heart surgery)

reposition

intervention (e.g., parenteral mesenteric valve)

In cancer patients with large tumors, surgery is often recommended. The most common surgical procedure done for large liver tumors is resecting of the liver (aortoplasty), and the procedure provides the greatest potential benefit for small or advanced liver cancers.

For patients who do not wish to undergo resecting, a variety of other options are available. For example, aortic stents can be used as a temporary solution for non-advanced liver cancers. Surgery-only techniques (e.g., liver resection, partial-appendix resection [PAOS], open-heart surgery) are also used with less than optimal success rates.

There is a significant amount of controversy regarding the optimal type of surgery for non-advanced liver cancer. Some studies have shown that the use of either open-heart surgery or aseptic procedures (e.g., pneumoperitoneum; aortoplasty) may result in more benefit with the potential for a much higher complication rate.

Aseptic techniques have been shown to significantly improve the outcome of non-advanced liver cancers when compared with surgical resection. One study conducted among 75 patients with advanced (L6-7) liver cancer found that those with use of two anastomosing and two bifascial techniques had a 50% reduced complication rate compared with non-specialists. In contrast, a multicentre study of 150 patients with advanced liver cancer observed that those who received pneumoperitone"
Question: Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influenced by the quality or completeness of the Papanicolaou smear? Review the evidence: a literature review (or other evidence-based review) (8) Review the literature to establish that the Papanicolaou smear remains a key clinical indication for testing for an infectious disease. (9) Review the literature for the evidence-based recommendation to screen all infected persons for HIV, pneumococcus, and hepatitis for hepatitis C RNA (HCV RNA) by a single test. There are no randomized controlled trials to support any method of HCV testing which includes RNA testing. Review the literature for the evidence-based recommendation to select HIV positive persons based on hepatitis C RNA tests alone as the sole tool for testing HIV-infected persons, with emphasis on the need for a double-blind randomized controlled trial to ensure the specificity and confidence of the HCV positive diagnosis. Review the literature for the evidence-based recommendation to recommend that all persons with a positive HCV positive test for HIV should receive a presumptive treatment plan and blood pressure medication. There are no data demonstrating any benefit from this routine method of determining HIV-positive persons for routine medical or dental treatment. There are no comparative data supporting the use of HCV-positive urine samples for determination of HIV prevalence among persons with other infectious diseases. Review the literature to establish whether an intervention or alternative can be better suited to meet the identified challenge to Papanicolaou smears in certain clinical situations. Review the evidence to determine whether testing for Hepatitis B RNA should be considered for Papanicolaou smears, considering the existing availability of available test kits and the absence of efficacy and specificity of other test technologies. These guidelines are NOT comprehensive and do not address the recommendations for Papanicolaou smear, or the recommended use of HCV-specific kits. (11)

Discussion This article is a thorough evaluation of available evidence on the use of Papanicolaou smears for the diagnosis or screening of HIV infection, and its impact on disease. Based on this evidence, it appears that the primary benefits associated with diagnostic confirmation of infection for the HIV infection can be more accurately estimated using HCV-specific test kits, while there remain limitations on the use of Papanicolaou smears in screening for other infectious diseases or routine medical or dental treatment. This evidence does not support the use of Papanicolaou smears as a diagnosis instrument other than those for HIV infection, as recommended in previous recommendations. The main advantages of testing for HIV infection with HCV-specific DNA were identified in this review. The HCV tests were effective in detecting HIV infection (i.e., testing positive) at a lower cost. The HCV-specific tests were reliable, accurate, and comparable with those used for HIV detection and detection of other infections. Moreover, the HCV types detected in the Papanicolaou smears were not known to be associated with HIV infection (i.e., different HCV RNA types were detected in the Papanicolaou smears than in HIV tests). This suggests that the HCV-specific test kits might be useful for diagnosing other infectious diseases, and a useful diagnostic assay for HIV infection (i.e., HCV RNA). However, the positive findings reported in this review also underscore the limitations of using HCV-specific tests for diagnosis of infectious diseases and as a screening tool for routine medical or dental treatment. Thus, the ability to use HCV-specific blood tests to determine whether people with HIV infection are asymptomatic and asymptomatic, as was suggested in another literature review of HIV screening and management (11), is unlikely to be supported by current evidence. With respect to the treatment of HIV infection, the current scientific evidence provides limited support for a recommendation to screen all persons with a Papanicolaou smear for HIV and HCV before recommending that anyone be treated to prevent subsequent development of infectious disease. A significant body of evidence, however, suggests that when HIV treatment is indicated, the HCV-specific test results must be considered during management of HIV infections, regardless of other therapeutic options. The available evidence also indicates that current recommendations for treating HIV infection are effective, and are reasonable at each stage along the HIV continuum between undetectable viral load and acute HIV infection. Thus, current recommendations for the initial management of positive or positive for HIV samples, which are based on a single test with a sensitivity > 97% and a specificity of > 98%, still align with recommendations for early treatment of cases of symptomatic HIV (i.e., HIV < 2000) and in managing patients of HIV-associated chronic HIV disease. The recommended management based on the sensitivity and specificity of the Papanicolaou test are as follows. For the initial management of HIV infection (i.e"
Question: Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring?

Abstract: The pollen of maize (Zea mays L.) is a well-recognized source of allergenic pollen for the domestic market. However, recent efforts to identify allergenic phenotypes are hampered by difficulties in pollen identification in other cereal crops. An understanding of the processes by which pollen proteins are derived is essential to a successful analysis of allergenic pollens. Thus, we report on the identification of an Allergy-Strain-Type (AST) of corn pollen by the use of genomic and biochemical assays in corn, and a recent attempt by plant breeders to characterize the genetics underlying allergenic traits. We show that the AST of maize pollen arises from a different genetic source from other crop allergens, and reveals some of the key regulatory processes that are required to create allergenic traits. We provide novel genetic models for AST in maize that are useful to provide an understanding of pollen production and to stimulate new research.

Abstract

Pollen from maize presents a very important source of allergens to farm machinery of all grain and grain byproducts, since it contains three-fourths to one-third of all of the pollen, when tested by the pollen allergy questionnaire. The identification of allergenic pollen by genotypic comparison with a variety of crop allergens and the determination of the alleles responsible for these reactions should significantly simplify the detection of allergenic pollen in commercial crops. However, it is well known that various methods are needed in order to identify allergenic pollen, including DNA-based, biochemical, immunological and electrophoretic assays. A key step for allergenic pollen is the formation of functional, genetic alleles as alleles are produced when pollen is processed and transported. The genetic analyses reported so far cannot determine the alleles and the genetic changes in the pollen can only be detected by a specific analytical technique. Therefore, a new approach was needed in order to identify allergenic pollen in maize, and here we report on an allerogen genotypic analysis of maize pollen using a genome-wide approach, by using the allergen detection methodology provided by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Here we report the identification of an Allergy-Strain-Type as the most sensitive and accurate method for allergen detection in maize. Our results demonstrate that the allergenic alleles in pollen are highly conserved, are closely related to the characteristics of the pollen, and that the AST of maize pollen is genetically different from all other pollen types. These results provide a platform for analyzing allergenic pollen in maize, and allow genotypic analysis of the pollen to be performed in a practical way. To this end, we are planning a comprehensive study to elucidate the molecular basis for these differences by the use of genome-wide approaches.

Introduction

Pollen is one of the most important sources of allergens to pollen-processing machinery of grain and byproducts, since it contains three to one-fourth of all the pollen, when tested by the pollen allergy questionnaire [1]. While both plant and animal allergens may present themselves as proteins, only plant allergens are regarded as allergenic. The pollen can also contain proteins from other crops, but they are considered to cause allergic respiratory symptoms [2–4]. The only plant-based allergen with sufficient evidence of its existence is corn ("
Question: Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How do people who are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the first year of life show a negative association with FDG-PET?

Background

An emerging literature suggests that an initial association of cervical cancer (CIN 2+) with a high-fat diet [1,2] is associated with adverse cervical mucosa and dysplasia. This negative association is thought to be the result of increased mucosal and interstitial tissue destruction by the cancer-producing microenvironment of the diseased cervix.

Recent studies have confirmed negative associations of CIN2+ with both hyperalgesia and cancer in a large cohort of female patients [3–7]. The study by Chard et al. [3] followed 1,054 newly diagnosed patients within the first 2 years of life. The authors reported an odds ratio of 1.45 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.01 to 2.14) for an increased likelihood of undergoing pap smear, although the magnitude of the associated risk appeared to be underestimated in some subgroups due to the relatively small sample size of their study.

Although the association between hyperalgesia and invasive cervical cancer is well established, the mechanisms regulating the pathogenesis of this malignancy are not well known. Several studies have been conducted evaluating the possible involvement of cytokines in the disease process [8–11]. In addition to the established relationship between hyperalgesia and CIN 2+ (for example, elevated serum interleukin-1 receptor antagonist concentration is associated with increased risk of CIN 2+) [12], hyperalgesia is also associated with increased intraepithelial inflammation and cellular oxidative stress. In a separate randomized trial [13], it was noted that the occurrence of CIN2+ and the development of cancer were also associated with serum levels of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that hyperalgesia-associated tumors are composed not only of tumor-specific and cytokine-associated cells but also of cells with other cytokine receptors.

Recently, the hypothesis of a ""tumor-specific"" inflammatory mediator(s) within the carcinoma microenvironment has been proposed. It is hypothesized that these cytokines may modulate the behavior of cancer cells to facilitate tumor progression through signaling pathways [14,15]. It would therefore be important to evaluate the effects of hyperalgesia-associated colorectal neoplasia on the development of these tumor-specific tumor-specific cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the purpose of the present Study, which was designed to evaluate the associations of CIN2+, anti-CTLA4 colorectal tumor virus (CTLA4) and hyperalgesia on CXCR4 tumor cell adhesion and growth in human epithelial and mesenchymal cells, was to examine whether hyperalgesia-associated CIN2+ was associated with adhesion and growth inhibition in the breast carcinoma (BCM) and cervical adenocarcinoma (CIN 2+ of women from 3–35 years of age).

Methods

Participants and Sample

Three hundred ten healthy white women aged 21–55 y were enrolled. Of these women, 90 percent were Caucasian [16]. The majority (n = 75) were from the Greater Kansas City Area (GKCA). The study was approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board and was conducted under the Institutional Review Board of the University of Missouri, Columbia. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants using the approved data use form.

Exclusion criteria and screening procedures are described in detail herein.

Cervical Cancer Screening

BCM or CIN2+ screening was performed in the first year of life. The study protocol included inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria as follows:

All participants were white; female; in the first 2 years of life; and with a family history of invasive cervical cancer.

Cavity biopsies were conducted for women with no documented evidence of carcinoma (ie, no symptoms of carcinoma or significant changes in cervical cytology).

Cervical lesions were defined as:

M1 (deep carcinoma of the cervical region) (5–7 lesion size).

M2 (6–9 lesion size).

M3 (10–14 lesion size).

M4 (15–19 lesion size).

M5 (20–32 lesion size).

M6 (33+ lesions size).

M7 (33+ lesions size).

CXCR4 Cancer

CXCR4 cancer was assessed by the use of colon, rectal, and prostate cytology screening. The screening examinations included two types of DNA probes (CT"

Question: Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably? Share your answer

Can a surgeon detect early lymphedema? Lymphedema refers to swelling in a limb, sometimes at the site of a vein or an artery, which can affect or rupture. Surgery—or the healing of a wound—often corrects the inflammation by reducing the volume of the swelling, or lymphedema.

Early lymphedema can show up on x-ray or ultrasound and can be treated. By screening for early lymphedema, a surgeon might be able to detect it early, before it's too late. Lymphedema can be diagnosed on the basis of the results of x-rays or CT scans; CTs and MRI scans do not generally show abnormal veins, but CT might show a small tumor nearby. CT scans can show a lump or mass around a vein (arterial lymphedema). X-ray images of veins have a different ""look"": They show enlarged veins, called nodules, filled with fluid, and can be difficult to differentiate from a lump in a vein. In contrast, MRI scans show a larger, more normal area on the surface of a vein (luminal lymphedema): It can show a tumor (luminal lymphedema) and other normal tissue. (An MRI scan can detect a lump that turns out larger than the vein or a tumor that grows very little.) In some cases, the surgeon might diagnose this more advanced stage via ultrasound. An advanced detection would give the surgeon an opportunity to treat the lymphedema and provide early healing.

If a surgeon detects early lymphedema, the treatment options for patients with lymphedema are clear and may range from surgery to intensive care. In all cases, you should discuss the options with your medical director. Although many patients are initially diagnosed with early lymphedema, there is some variation in prognostic factors (such as bone density) between patients. Early lymphedema can be treated or reversed if the underlying bone density is improved or the swelling is treated. However, more than 70% of patients with early lymphedema do not have any visible change on MRI or x-ray.

The treatment options for a number of patients with early lymphedema are:

Recurrent or recurrent lymphedema. Recurrent lymphedema occurs when the initial treatment did not produce improvement. This can be due to a variety of factors, including:

Age

Cancer

Curetting steroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system

Early infection

Surgery that can cause scarring

Treatment options for an individual patient vary. Some patients respond well to a combination of conventional and alternative therapies. The main differences in treatment between the types and the types of lymphedema are:

Chemotherapy. Treatment options usually include a combination of hormone therapy and surgery to remove scarring, called ""regroupment."" Treatment options include hormonal therapy and/or surgery to remove scarring, called ""regroupment."" Because of the need for surgical procedures, treatment for most cases is recommended for adults. An increasing number of pediatric patients also receive treatment with chemotherapy.

Surgery. Surgery is the most common treatment option for early lymphedema. Some patients can manage lymphedema by surgery in the setting of a local clinic or a community health center, or by managing the swelling with a skin taping method such as lymphedema tape (sclerotherapy). In some situations, though, local lymphedema management is recommended for patients with severe lymphedema.

Treatment options involve surgery. Many patients who have lymphedema respond well to surgery (usually, the patients can live with residual symptoms after surgery). Even when lymphedema is fully present and remitters have been treated and removed from the body, lymphedema is an insidious condition that requires surgical removal if present. For patients with early lymphedema, there may not be any identifiable lesion to remove surgery is a recommended alternative to other options for immediate retreatment.

An example of the treatment in which early lymphedema can be more easily managed is treatment by chemotherapy, which often removes the tumor in the neck/brachial area of the cancer. A number of patients may also respond to treatment with a combination of local and systemic chemotherapy."

Question: Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality?

Answer: Yes, I agree that this could be a consequence. A more nuanced explanation is that the person was tracking a moving object, and so it is possible to imagine how their mind would change a few degrees (if they moved so quickly at the onset that they could see at the end the second event that triggered the tracking) - perhaps because they were already tracking the motion. That doesn't explain why they saw the second event. In my opinion, we don't really have much of a clue and are missing a powerful, common mechanism by which motion perception might be compromised. I am also interested in learning more about the mechanism of motion perception in schizophrenia to understand this difference.

Q: Is the hypothesis that schizophrenia produces a deficit in eye movements valid? The theory of ""attraction to the eye"" has been explored and proposed in schizophrenia.

A good example of a theory of attraction to the eye can be found in the work of Burch (1996, 1998) who investigated movement perception. He demonstrated that when persons with schizophrenia display increased attention to the eyes and a decreased ability to move the entire body, these results are not random. These differences are not due to a lack of attention to the moving object but are the result of significant perceptual impairment, which is a consequence of illness.

Question: It's Fournier's gangrene still dangerous? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the relationship of an infection causing a gangrenous amputation and a patient with Fournier's gangrene?

Answer: We can't test a hypothesis until we have a theory that explains what happened in order to understand what's going on. We don't know enough about the relationship of this infection to how severe this amputation actually is, and that is what you're attempting to test here. As in all research on the topic, we need to wait for a theory that explains what actually happened, which is why this needs to be done in a controlled, high-quality trial, and not just in the back of a science journal. It's certainly not realistic to expect a new drug to be FDA-approved in a quarter of a century with no trial.

What we do know now is that amputation results in long-lasting inflammation of the underlying tissue caused by the destruction of nerve fibers and proteins. It also changes a patient's immune response and how effectively it kills healthy cells, possibly affecting metabolism (e.g., the process of breakdown of fat) and preventing the production of new blood cells. It is not clear if all patients with Fournier's gangrene experience widespread inflammation with widespread blood loss, or whether some individuals experience less severe inflammation and blood loss and some individuals have much less inflammation but still experience widespread blood loss.

Therefore, it is not possible to make conclusions about any individual's chances of survival without a controlled clinical trial. The FDA has made decisions to take one for the team when making drug approvals and this will no doubt be the case for this drug, although I'm willing to bet that the patients and families who are most at risk for this procedure, which is why they need to be studied in a controlled high quality trial, have the weakest immune response to the infection, and are more likely to suffer serious complications.

One group of patients, the patients who have already received surgery or are undergoing surgery, is unlikely to benefit at all from the drug; the other will lose significant limb function. The most likely outcome, we see all the time in science, is that you get the drug to work but at the cost of another patient suffering. In those patients who have suffered the most severe side effects, we see that these patients will have the highest risk of relapse and may not survive the first year of treatment. In general, the patients who have received surgery are generally protected as long as they have recovered sufficiently for treatment to work. After the treatment, however, these patients recover too quickly and may relapse. In those patients who have not received surgery yet, we see that those patients who suffered the most severe complications tend to receive fewer drugs than those who had more severe complications and are thus likely to experience no benefits and possibly some mortality. Patients who have suffered fewer complications than patients who had more severe complications and have not yet had the surgery might receive an inferior drug, but even on the best case scenario, they will still suffer long-term morbidity and mortality.

We know that Fournier's gangrene can easily be reversed if the pain is treated, although one wonders whether or not doctors would treat it as a chronic infection. In any case, as Fournier's gangrene does not respond well to conventional antibiotics, this drug, which has no known side effects beyond infection, may not be the best solution for patients in the long term, at least not at this point.

We can speculate about how the drug could be more widely used, or by what mechanism the drug could be more widely used. It is possible that surgeons may have an incentive to promote this type of procedure and to promote the disease. A new drug could be marketed over and over again, which might not be very cost-effective, but it would not matter; by the time this drug is discovered and used, the drug will have already been found and licensed and there may be a big market for this specific type of drug, so it is still likely to be used. In fact, the FDA recently approved a new antibiotic, ceftriaxone, for the treatment of the bacterial bloodstream in critically ill patients, but the drug does not appear to offer any significant advantage over a placebo. The drug is an effective drug, but it has not yet been used widely in the United States. In Europe it is already used widely (although we have no data yet to support it), but there is no clinical evidence that it is superior to standard antibiotic therapy. Thus, I can only speculate on what would be a better way for this drug to be more widely used. In short, we can't predict that this new drug would offer any benefit. It is very difficult to predict the future, and this is definitely not a perfect example.

However, even the most optimistic scenario for Fournier's gangrene is still a tragedy. What happens in the future? Patients treated for a"
Question: Is it appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is the need for organ transplants decreasing in advanced age? Answer: It depends on many reasons including decreasing incidence of death. In many cases, older individuals live much longer than they used to because they live longer lives with better nutrition and fewer medical conditions. The increase of life expectancy in elderly people is a well-known statistic even though, so far, there has been no reliable scientific data on it.


If, however, the question has been adequately answered, no transplant could be considered unsafe. Although the organs of elderly patients have become increasingly rare, they are still a very strong source of human protein, the fuel of the body and even the raw material for a variety of medical products (such as clotting clotting). Therefore, even in cases when organ transplants are impossible, it is possible to obtain sufficient protein from patients to sustain the elderly. The only exception is the use of human tissue extracted from dying relatives. This is possible because, among other reasons, the body is unable to extract adequate protein from older relatives within the first months of their death, thus forcing them to be used for the body of the patient.

Question: Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Is it always necessary? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is it always necessary? What is the minimum interval between angioplasty and carotid embolization? What are the recommendations for carotid artery stenosis in the absence of known cause?

What is the status of carotid artery stenosis after coronary artery bypass surgery? (What are the current reports and what are the implications for future improvement)? Answer: What are the current reports and what are the implications for future improvement? When are complications commonly seen after coronary artery bypass surgery? (What is the current view about this condition) The current review summarizes the findings from 7 clinical trials involving patients with carotid artery damage. It was concluded that: there was a statistically significant relationship between coronary artery surgery and complications in the short term after this procedure that depended on how long the surgery was given and on who was being treated. At the least, these reports suggest that there is a reasonable need for further prospective studies that assess the effect of coronary artery bypass surgery on the course and outcome of post-surgery complications. The most important factors that should be considered when designing future studies to assess the effects of the treatment of these patients and of any complications that have arisen are the size and population of the patients under study and, if possible, the patient population and treatment.

Is it always necessary to take angioplasty immediately after coronary atherosclerosis (blockage of carotid arteries)?

Answer: There is no good evidence to support the need for carotid artery bypass surgery immediately after coronary artery disease has been resolved."

Key words: Direct mesocolon invasion, mesocorticolon and colorectal cancer, mesocervical cancer.

INTRODUCTION Mesocervical cancer is the second most common form of cancer in North America and the world.1 The annual reported incidence of colorectal cancer is approximately 8500 deaths in the United States alone, making it the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide.2 More specifically, colorectal cancer accounted for 2.9% of all deaths in men and 6.0% for women in the United States in 2012.3 The prevalence of colorectal cancer in the US population has grown 2-fold, from 5.6% in 1980 to 11.6% in 2007, with the largest increase occuring during the last 30 years.2 The risk of death from cancer in the United States is highest for low-risk, low-reproductive-age individuals (ages 25-49 years)4 and there is a high prevalence of ulcerative colitis and active mucosal colonization.5,6 Patients with higher body-mass index have a higher risk of colorectal cancer, particularly gastric carcinomas.7-9 In contrast, more women have colorectal cancer and higher risk factors are not entirely explained by age. These factors include: lower body-mass indexes between the ages of 25 and 34, 10 higher intake of fat (body mass index [BMI] greater than 23), higher intake of red meat and processed meat,11-12 and smoking.13,14

DURATION AND EXPECTATION OF DIAGNOSIS In recent years, there has been a change in the definition of cancer, allowing for the use of multiple colorectal adenomas as markers of colorectal cancer.15 Currently, this class of tumor also includes mesocervical carcinomas, with their characteristic appearance of a thin, wavy, or folded skin covering the entire colon.16 According to a recent American Society for Colorectal Pathology report, between 2000 and 2009, the population of adult patients who undergo colonoscopy underwent an average of seven new cancers in the large bowel and fewer than 200 new cases of adenomatous polyposis in the rectum, an estimated rate of 5 cases per 1000 adult patients in the US.6,17,18 Therefore, the current definition provides the best data on the population of patients at risk (the most aggressive stages of cancer in healthy adults). A recent meta-analysis found that if a patient has more than 10 new adenoma in the colon, or if one or both of his or her adenoma and colonic lesions are classified as adenomatous polyposis, the probability of colon cancer is increased by 20-fold.5 The current definition provides an objective way to categorize colorectal cancer lesions that are difficult to do otherwise by classifying each adenoma in the colon and colonic lesions and comparing the rates of recurrence of colon cancer.19 This system is not as complicated as the traditional concept of ""colon-related cancer"" (CRCC) where the most common lesions are considered more or less ""cancer in all organs and systems,"" but is also more informative because it may be easier to use to help classify patients with more difficult to classify colorectal lesions. For example, if a patient has an adenoma in two of the large bowel, the risk of developing colorectal cancer is 20-fold higher, based on the current definition of adenomatous polyposis. Because the only way to find and"

The Research Paper was written by Dr. Matthew Johnson, Director of the Center for Clinical Investigation, Department of Radiology, University of Georgia, DeKalb, Georgia 31075, USA, and Dr. Timothy L. Wiesner, Professor of Radiology, Department of Radiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27695, USA. The first author submitted the manuscript at the request of Dr. Johnson for the purpose of being published online for other researchers to review, and for publication of the article in the Journal of The American Medical Association.

Introduction Heterotic tachyarrhythmias are rare (1–3). In most cases, heterotopic tachyarrhythmias are associated with the occurrence of symptomatic aortic stenosis. Heterotopic Ossification (HO) is a benign but frequently serious condition (4). HO may cause aortic stenosis, aortic aneurysm, and even aortic dissection (5,6). HO is often associated with heart failure and often requires complex management by cardiologists, cardiologists of postgraduate residency training, pulmonary medicine residents, aortic surgeons, pulmonary otolaryngologists, physicians specializing in chronic renal disease, and surgeons involved in cardiac surgery. Most frequently, HO is related to pulmonary arteritis or pulmonary hypertension (7–9). In addition, there is a small increased incidence of thromboembolic syndromes, in particular, ischemic stroke (10–12). A number of clinical and preclinical investigations implicate HO in a variety of heart conditions, including ischemic stroke and acute coronary syndromes (13,14). However, while several cases of HO-mediated thrombophlebitis have been described, it has been difficult to identify and distinguish other conditions with HO in the literature.

In the light of the increasing presence of such conditions in the general population (15,16), and the growing interest expressed for the prevention and treatment of HO in both general and heart-related (i.e., acute coronary syndromes, stroke and ischemic stroke), a search for existing studies was conducted. Previous literature regarding the association between HO and heart diseases has been sparse and the available information mainly derived from the field of laboratory cardiology (2). In particular, there have been few studies regarding the association of HO with coronary artery disease (CAD) or stroke in general. The purpose of this study was to provide preclinical information on the association between HO and CAD/stroke, including ischemic stroke in the context of the clinical management of this condition.

Materials and Methods Study Subjects The study was a prospective observational study of subjects who had undergone a first heart evaluation under admission from a tertiary referral center and met criteria of mild or moderate CAD. The subjects were randomized with a 2:1 ratio to receive either vitamin A 3 ·4 ·6 or placebo and were told they had received vitamin supplementation during a period of up to 5 months, a period of as long as 2 years, to ensure adequate vitamin status. All subjects had their blood drawn at the beginning of the study at baseline and were followed until the end of follow-up 4 years later. All subjects were told they were receiving vitamin A 1 % and the study was approved by the local ethical committee. Study Design During an initial screening period, the study subject was randomly assigned to receive a placebo, vitamin A 3 ·4 ·6, or a combination of A 3 ·4 ·6. Because of this, data from our participants were not adjusted to remove individuals who were enrolled in more than one study or who already knew the study assignment. The sample size from the 3 vitamin study arms was calculated to detect a 1% difference between vitamin A 3 ·4 ·6 and placebo in the risk of CVD. In addition, the inclusion of a vitamin A 3 ·"
Question: Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke?

Answer: No clear benefits for stroke management occurred in the majority of studies compared with traditional preventive interventions.

The most robust, long-term, and consistently effective treatment for patients with recurrent stroke is lifestyle modifications, including caloric restriction, exercise, and pharmacologic treatment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with or without medication. This review highlights the need for additional trials to more thoroughly assess the effects of these lifestyle and pharmacologic changes on stroke outcomes and evaluate appropriate strategies for enhancing stroke management at the patient's stage of recovery.

1.1 Case report

Treatment of symptomatic patients with a symptomatic stroke in a setting requiring intensive care was reported in three prospective, randomized, controlled trials.1,2 Patients in the 1:1 ratio of statin to placebo had fewer symptomatic and medically equivalent strokes, including ischemic strokes; fewer relapses (symptomatic and otherwise); and fewer deaths. However, overall stroke mortality remained unchanged; patients with stroke on statins had significantly higher risk of death compared with people on placebo.

1.2 Case series

A retrospective cohort study of 4,972 patients with an acute acute ischemic stroke performed at an academic center reported overall hospital and outpatient mortality was similar when statin and placebo patients were compared.3 Patients on statin had reduced total mortality by 27%, whereas those who were on placebo had reduced total mortality by 31%. Mortality from an undetermined cause (nonfatal ischemic events) was increased in statin patients (18%), compared with placebo patients (13%) and was significantly lower in statin patients aged 65 years or older (5% [n=5]) compared with controls (13% [n=10]).4

1.3 Case study

A retrospective study found no significant difference in total and specific causes of death between patients treated with low-dose aspirin and those treated with low-dose statin.5

Conclusions

There are no major differences in clinical outcomes of patients treated with statins or placebo in patients with symptomatic stroke compared with those treated with traditional therapy. However, there remains a need for more trials examining the specific clinical outcomes of patients with stroke treated with statins versus those with stroke treated with conventional therapy.

1.4 Case control

In a review, T.W. Riesenhuber, MD, and colleagues examined 10 placebo-controlled trials of low-dose aspirin and three of the studies that included statin patients. They reported that no changes in total stroke mortality, ischemic stroke, or death, but a trend toward increased total stroke mortality during a period of 2 years after the initiation of aspirin therapy and the cessation of statin therapy. These results indicate that statins may prevent stroke, but they need to be confirmed in further trials.

1.5 Safety

In a series of six studies involving 36,000 subjects, the risk of clinically important nonfatal stroke was not increased with statins.6,7 The risk of a cardiac event occurring was not increased. In a study involving 19,000 patients, patients given statins had slightly increased cardiovascular events.

In one study of approximately 36,000 consecutive male patients with recurrent stroke, it has been shown that the mean stroke time was similar in the two groups but stroke volume was significantly shorter in the statin group.8

1.6 Discussion

This systematic review presents information on the clinical effectiveness of statins for prevention and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in well-controlled randomized intervention trials. This evidence indicates a lack of clinical benefit for stroke prevention, but the best outcome could be attributed to treatment with low-dose aspirin, and this benefit is somewhat greater than for placebo.

The results of this systematic review do not exclude the possibility that there are alternative mechanisms by which aspirin may be effective for prevention and treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Patients may be more likely to respond to aspirin when their underlying cardiac status is adequate.

A randomized controlled trial comparing the combined statin vs placebo arm for the prevention and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in well-controlled clinical trials would be appropriate in order to determine whether statins have a more favorable effect than placebo when used in combination with traditional therapy.

For statin or placebo patients, outcomes were similar at 1, 2, and 4 years, with an increased mortality and less severe stroke. However, in a recent large observational cohort study of 20,000 patients, incidence of death was similar between statin and placebo patients.9

1.7 Clinical implications

Although there is no evidence in the literature to suggest that statins are safer than placebo for prevention or treatment of acute ischemic stroke, this finding does not support a null hypothesis for statins.

Applied Psychology, University of Washington In 2004 to 2005, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology conducted an in-depth study of all pregnant and pregnant women attending an obstetrician/gynecologist clinic. Our goal was to determine the ability of pregnant and pregnant women to process information, to make decisions, and to achieve goals they intended. We used a randomized controlled trial design (RCT), in which participants had a total of 14 weeks of information and presentation experiences in a laboratory. Participants received brief information sheets containing a list of topics and links to more information. The information sheets were presented in three groups: information group (n=8), a control group (n=9), and an intervention group (n=10). As in the RCT, mothers in the intervention and control groups were told that there were 4 different possible outcomes for each outcome, presented with an array of relevant information and outcomes, and were then instructed to consider all of the information that came up in the discussion section, including the pregnancy outcome and any other relevant information. We measured information learning, as measures of whether mothers knew and remembered what content had been presented during their information experience. We also measured the potential influence of the information experience on women's subsequent decisions to deliver their child through a factor analysis of the decision-making process. In the current study, we examined the potential influence of delivery information on women's subsequent decision-making and also measured women's memory of information presented. We also examined the effects of the interventions on women's subsequent decision-making.

Introduction

In 2004 the American College of Obstetrics and gynecologists surveyed all women seeking maternity care at an obstetrician/gynecologist clinic and found that approximately 15% of women (n=941) had been in a vaginal birth after cesarean section since delivery.1 In their RCT in which we studied information processing and decision-making, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that mothers in the information group demonstrated greater than expected memory retention and improved memory for information presentation while providing instructions. 2

In this study, we examined whether information presentation influenced the decision to offer or receive an antenatal care intervention, as well as whether mothers remembered and then successfully incorporated content from subsequent information packages during the intervention. We hypothesized that women in the information group would be better able to remember the content in the information sheets they received (in this case, information about pregnancy) and would be able to process that information during information experience. For the intervention group, we measured the participants' decision-making ability, which would reflect women's ability to use their information experience to make informed decisions.

Methods

Sample

We recruited pregnant and pregnant women receiving obstetric care at a midwest midwifery clinic and a medical teaching hospital for a 16 week study. The data were obtained from a comprehensive survey that included demographic data and medical histories. The response rates of our survey panel were 88%. Of the 835 women who completed the survey, 818 were pregnant at the time of the survey and 907 were pregnant during a recent birth. One woman (10%) did not respond to the survey and one woman had a pregnancy terminated. A total of 730 women attended 1 of 4 sessions.

Information Materials

Information about fetal death and birth outcomes and information about the intervention were presented. Each information sheet was written by a licensed clinician with the full cooperation and knowledge of the mothers. We collected the list of topics by describing what the women had been presented with in the intervention groups. The information sheets were arranged on three pages with the following information grouped into three rows:

A list of topics. This topic was used for all presentation material and related information.

Information about pregnancy outcomes. This topic was used for pregnancy outcomes described in the interventions.

Information about the intervention. This topic covered the full text of the interventions.

Each row provided links to additional information.

Introduction: A case of fracture of the fifth tibia for which there is no reported clinical evidence of a traumatic cause.

Case:

A 41 year-old female patient with a total of 14 months' history of fractures of her right tibia and left fibula. The diagnosis of fracture was a result of bone scanning in the previous 3 months. The patient had an MRI examination 1 week after the fracture and a computed tomography evaluation 2 weeks after the fracture, but no further follow-up MRI was performed. The bone thickness was not measured during the first 3 months.

Results:

The clinical evidence of no evidence of trauma was established upon radiographic examination. The patient was unresponsive for 9 hours. No blood test was performed for acute MI. Further bone assessment was not performed until a day or two after the first intervention, after the patient was no longer in the hospital.

Discussion:

In this report, we consider the case to be of a typical spontaneous fracture of the right fifth metacarpal on x-ray examination in the context of a bilateral high-energy penetrating fracture due to a penetrating skull fracture. The injury was noted to have been caused by a projectile penetrating the upper vertebrae from below that had punctured the brain within a 30° angle of attack. The fracture pattern in this case differs from that usually encountered in other patient–case reports of high-energy x-ray penetrating head fractures.

Recommendations:

1. Care should be taken when performing the x-ray of children with a history of a traumatic head injury to ensure that there were no fractures of less than 25 g, with any fracture having an angle of attack greater than 30°. 2. Care should be taken when performing the MRI on any patient with a history of a penetrating cervical fracture, as there may be a fracture of the second cervical spine and subsequent intracranial hemorrhage.

Introduction. High-energy penetrating head fractures of the skull in children are rare events.1–3 The number of reports and the type of fracture indicate that the diagnosis is a rarity.5,6 Most fractures are fractures to the 5th, 6th, and 7th cervical vertebrae.5,6,7 This fracture occurs in children less than 0.9 years of age, and fractures of the 10th, 11th, and 12th cervical vertebrae are rarer in pediatric practice.4,2,3,6

Case: A 19 year-old male patient presented presenting with 4 fractures to his right upper arm, including a fracture to his left l3 shoulder, 2 fractured ribs, and one broken femur. The fracture was diagnosed by a neurosurgeon who did a magnetic resonance imaging of the patient's arm only but failed to detect a brain injury. An MRI examination of both sides revealed that the right arm had three separate fractures. A total of 18 hours of prophylactic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and 2 hours of corticosteroids were required with no subsequent neurological damage. The next visit, the patient received one injection of 0.9 mg of prednisolone, and 4 months of aspirin for skin and soft tissue infections were given but not observed to be beneficial. No neurosurgical intervention was required during the previous 4 weeks. No brain bleeding was evident.

Results: A total of 6 months elapsed on the treatment of this patient. There is a high incidence of non-surgical management of fracture injuries.5,6,7 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed and may often lead to osteoarthritis. This case suggests the importance of the use of NSAIDs to prevent brain and soft tissue infections as well as secondary trauma. The patient went on to have a bone scan in January of 2006 as a result of which a small fracture and a single skull fracture to his l3 shoulder were recognized. The patient's MRI showed no obvious lesion on the bone, which is an important finding as it is often assumed that an incision can be made in the skull to make a small laceration. The patient experienced a return of consciousness"

Question: Does immediate breast reconstruction compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does immediate breast reconstruction compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy?

Introduction:

The decision to perform breast reconstruction requires a thorough evaluation of individual risk factors. However, there is no well-established risk-benefit ratio for women undergoing breast reconstruction. The consensus for breast reconstruction remains: ""breast reconstruction is not without risk, and there are substantial benefits and risks that need to be considered.""1

Several studies have assessed the long-term outcome of breast reconstruction. Breast reconstruction may be performed from the surgical standpoint, during the initial postpartum period; however, it is thought that breast augmentation with a larger diameter is better suited for many patients with advanced breast cancer when performing reconstruction.2–5

There are also two case-control studies that are pertinent to the discussion of breast reconstruction. Two such studies have been published that examine the long-term clinical outcomes after breast reconstruction. In the first, 3,715 women were followed for a median of 10 years from the start of the initial surgical program until the end of the follow-up. Of those women with an initial breast reduction of 8 cm or less, 92% underwent breast reconstruction. The second study examined 19,521 women with a primary or metastatic breast cancer from the beginning of a randomized clinical trial of open laparotomy for breast reconstruction. Among the 13,935 women randomized, 17% of those with an initial breast reduction of less than 2 cm or who were treated for metastatic breast cancer and were followed for less than 13 years underwent breast reconstruction.6 The majority of those women, 9% of whom underwent breast reconstruction and had no subsequent recurrence, also received adjuvant chemotherapy ( ). The number of women with recurrence was 4% at the 5-year follow-up and 13.5% after the 10-year follow-up.6

Many of the women who underwent breast reconstruction received adjuvant chemotherapy, which can be a difficult decision. For some, breast reconstruction is one of many treatment options for the same underlying condition. Breast reconstruction is also an extremely complex and lengthy procedure that includes the removal of normal tissue, the placement of an additional mammary gland, invasive surgery, implantation of a new breast, reconstruction, reconstruction and subsequent surgery. A complete description of the actual procedure and management of the woman involves a great number of steps, and several different providers will be required to accomplish it properly. If any of these complications need to be addressed, the decision on whether to proceed with reconstruction is always made on the basis of breast preservation. The rationale for breast reconstruction is based on the belief that a reduction in size will improve the survival of the breast. A 2-cm increase will extend survival by about 7%. Breast reconstruction may occur after a radical mastectomy (i.e., removal of breast tissue without surgery).7 Breast reconstruction is associated with a number of additional complications, including endometrial cancer that might not have been detected or treated if the entire breast had been used as a site of cancer until the surgery.8–14 The cost, risk, and inconvenience of breast reconstruction outweigh any advantage of the result.

The safety of breast reconstruction has received renewed attention recently because of the finding that the incidence of postoperative morbidity and mortality has increased.15–20 A number of studies examined the risks of surgery for breast reconstruction. These findings have led to recommendations for improved patient selection, as well as guidelines for management of risks of reconstruction.21–23 The benefits of breast reconstruction include improved survival and, on the other hand, increased risk of disease recurrence postoperative, especially among patients with advanced disease.24 The increased incidence of recurrent breast cancer in patients who have undergone reconstruction also has implications regarding the long-term benefit of reconstruction. Thus, a risk is not directly proportional to the surgical outcome.

The question of how late, whether before or during the preop period, to begin breast reconstruction has not been previously addressed. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the surgical procedure should be delayed until the 2–4-month period has passed after the initial postop period. The purpose of the study was not to determine whether delaying breast reconstruction is necessarily advantageous to the patient. An early surgical operation also increases the risks of complications, particularly postoperative thrombosis and infection,5 and pre-operative care should be considered, particularly in patients where the delay may increase the risk of relapse.

Methods:

Data was from two prospective studies, one of which was a randomized clinical trial and the other a case-control study. The randomized clinical trial randomized 23,715 women (mean age of 56 years; mean number of years since last mammogram) who had undergone full mastectomy to surgical reconstruction of their breasts. The analysis of the trial consisted of 4,200 eligible subjects, with a mean follow-up of 19.8 years. The case-"
Question: Human papillomavirus and pterygium. Is the virus a risk factor? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," In the U.S., should HPV vaccination be delayed, or should HPV vaccination be recommended?

Answer: Human Papillomavirus can damage normal organs, and many cancers can start with infection with HPV, such as genital warts, anal cancer or cervical cancer.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an infection that can live in the mouth and the genital area. An estimated 17 million people in the U.S. are infected each year. But, just being infected does not make you sick—just a few days after symptoms appear you can have a normal Pap test (a biopsy) showing the presence of HPV-infected cells in your body.

HPV infections can be found in many different places. Most HPV infections are caused by two viruses, HPV-6 and HPV-11. Both are found in the male genital area.

This is probably why HPV vaccination rates are climbing—some people find the virus doesn't hurt or cause them anything for a long time after their first exposure to it. If you have been vaccinated at the age of 11 or 15 months, check your vaccinations and follow CDC's HPV vaccines recommendations. You may want to look at a recent study about whether vaccines that boost your immunity to genital warts could hurt, or be able to prevent, genital warts.

How does HPV spread?

The bacteria that cause genital warts are not able to travel long distances, and many of them can get into the lungs, so they can easily spread to someone who is already infected. The bacteria are also able to get to the brain from the cervical area, and so far more people have got HPV in each of these locations. For some reasons, however, some types of HPV can become airborne (they can travel long distances without having to break the surface of the air they get in).

How can you prevent HPV?

In this country, you can get HPV from other sexual contact or kissing and from an oral sex partner. The HPV virus has an immune response, so it can make itself infectious just by making contact with the virus that's causing the warts it likes. So as long as you are living in countries where you're at risk of getting HPV, there's a good chance your sexual partner will have HPV. Also, any other time you're kissing and/or having sex with a stranger you should talk to your partner about all your health risks, and take any precautions as necessary.

How are cervical screening tests used to monitor people for cervical cancer?

Cervical cancer screening tests help get cervical cancer in people who are very likely to have it (high-risk), but it doesn't work for everyone at all. The cervical cancer screening tests include Pap smears. Pap smears are a physical exam that looks for cervical infection caused by HPV. A Pap smear is done by inserting a tiny finger or needle under your cervix with the goal of finding and removing the cells that would be spread by the HPV cells from your vagina onto the cervix. It's done at a doctor's office or at a clinic and is free and available in most public health or insurance centers.

When do you start seeing improvement in symptoms and looking a little more normal? After you have taken the HPV vaccine, you may notice improvement in your symptoms within 6 to 12 months. The vaccine is important for all people at risk of HPV infections, but there are also people who are still at risk, but may not need vaccine because they don't yet have signs and symptoms. These include:

Women who have never started a family

People who have an infection for the first time, whether it's just one time or a few times

People with symptoms that were present before they started HPV vaccinations

People who were injected with HPV-containing vaccines such as Gardasil

People who have been exposed to HPV-containing vaccines at a medical facility.

You should see your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you don't have improvement in the symptoms, or if your symptoms are severe.

What should you do if you think you might have cervical cancer?

If you or your partner:

Are 17 or older

Are a U.S. or Canadian citizen and

Are being tested for cervical cancer with a Pap smear at a doctor's office or a clinic, including people who are not at high risk for cancer, including: a woman who is pregnant or is sexually active (including after starting a family or having more than one child) people with a history of cervical cancer or someone with a family history of cancer

are looking a little bit sick

are not sure if what they saw was really cancer, or they have doubts

are having other symptoms

Question: Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

""PRISM is an example of a broad system of surveillance based on the collection and analysis of large amounts of metadata with insufficient human review.""

Source: American Civil Liberties Union

Problems with the System that PRISM Operates On In order to work, the collection of metadata requires the NSA to have access to a large amount of Americans' emails and phone call logs. If the NSA cannot access or store the metadata within the US, it is difficult to use PRISM.

Moreover, the NSA is very aware that the emails and calls of many Americans do not meet its standards for NSA surveillance, so the agency often ignores these accounts without explanation. The agency has even acknowledged failing to produce relevant records at some times in the past. In January, the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted in a public hearing that the NSA ""had a number of shortfalls in its handling of telephone metadata."" The Director of National Intelligence recently acknowledged that ""not a single major terrorist incident during my time as Director has been prevented with this authorization,"" but he said ""there are ways it can improve.""

This leads us to the question: How do the NSA and FBI justify their actions?

In general, the agencies have said that they need the data to combat terrorism, but that justification is not entirely convincing. In January, a former NSA employee, William Binney, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the metadata collection program was not used to help in counterterrorism efforts because the NSA and FBI did not need the info for their own investigations.

Another reason that the metadata ""collection,"" as the NSA and FBI describe it, is not used is that the National Security Agency does not have the ability to keep detailed records about every single communications it is collecting. That is why they use the metadata as something of ""anonymity collateral"" at the company where most of the data, storing only the names of the recipients and the times and dates of their contact.

Other NSA employees have stated in interviews that they have heard no debate about the legality of the PRISM collection, which is supposed to come with the approval of a warrant. A whistleblower in October 2014 stated that the NSA is legally authorized to collect phone metadata even though the agency has not received a FISA warrant.

Given that, the agency's claims of needing to collect the metadata are certainly less convincing.

In a speech at an intelligence ceremony in December, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated that the NSA is ""using its unique position in this arena to collect in bulk all communications of all people within the United States.""

Clapper acknowledged that some metadata has information about Americans, but he said ""in the vast majority of cases"" it is irrelevant. Clapper also acknowledged that the program is not used for national security, but rather to collect intelligence (emphasis his).

Is it surprising that the surveillance system is so deeply flawed?

A study done in 2005 by the Boston University School of Law notes that:

The majority of the data obtained through this program is in fact not foreign intelligence information but is the private telephone records of Americans that are collected under a section of the Patriot Act that has never been reviewed or tested in an open adversarial legal proceeding. The Supreme Court has indicated that a judge may not grant summary judgment in an illegal search and seizure case under the Patriot Act unless the probable cause standard is met.

For many Americans, ""privacy on internet communications has become part and parcel of our daily life,"" including when using social media online. For many Americans, ""privacy on internet communications has become part and parcel of our daily life,"" including when using social media online.

The issue of private information about the communications of millions of people is clearly of great concern to Americans. A majority of all Americans believe that the NSA program is unconstitutional.

But this does not mean America has abandoned its commitment to privacy and security. We certainly are not back to the days when private information was widely freely shared on the internet.

Privacy of communications and emails online has long been a part of our everyday life, but it has been a part of that life more in the way that we have shared it, than that we have received it or kept it.

""The bulk collection program is the first major new effort to use the Patriot Act as the basis for mass domestic surveillance that has not been subject to the court-approved procedures that the FISA Court regularly enforces, the most important oversight mechanism for any surveillance program."" — Bill Keller, Washington Post reporter

So should we be surprised that the NSA, FBI, and other agencies are not following its procedures for conducting surveillance like it did for years to gather metadata about phone calls, social media posts, the content of emails, and the content of calls to and from friends or family members?

If privacy becomes a luxury of the few we will no longer be a"

Question: Autoerotic asphyxiation: secret pleasure--lethal outcome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can you make me squirm? Your answers to this question are written in the form of a computer program. It can do whatever it sees fit to do. The computer program will look at your hand and take care of the rest and will never leave you to the mercy of other people's cruel whims. The computer will never show pity nor empathy for your plight, because your mind, like everyone else's, is made up of two different forms of thinking: 1. thinking about thinking. 2. thinking about'me.' By typing the correct answers into the computer, you will be able to see how your mind works, especially when it is made up of a mix of the two thoughts. The results of your thoughts will be used to form a computer system that can answer any question in the world that you ever have about this process that is just a tool to help you do what you want. The software will be so good that you will find it as easy to use as breathing, writing, or driving. The program will also help you remember things that you have learned and will assist your thinking with other computer programs that help you keep up--like 'bored' or 'hungry.' It won't always be possible to get what you want, but it will always be one of your options whenever you are feeling frustrated. You will learn from the program that if you are being cruel to yourself like this by turning off your thoughts, that you will inevitably lose interest in whatever it is that you are trying to do and lose interest from yourself as a person for the rest of your life. You will also learn how to see the 'true you' that you are and how that should be a source of strength for the rest of your life, even if it brings a lot of pain in the short term. But even those of you who have been cruel to themselves can see that this kind of thinking is a bad thing. It can distract us from other human interests. Remember that your thoughts and your emotions are two different tools--they are the same only in reverse--that if you let them dominate your mind and become dominant, you will be controlling yourself for the rest of your life, which means the rest of your life is nothing more than a series of unhappy situations that you can just 'let go' of. To make it more concrete, imagine that every one of your five senses is an electric button that a computer has programmed to be on and off. When you let these five buttons to run the other way, you will feel a slight tremor in your brain, and you will be unable to continue. The computer will know a little problem when it sees one, but it won't know what the problem is. Instead, it will try to do a good job of matching the output of its input system with what it sees and sounds like on some level, like when it sees an emotion or a kind of feeling. It does this by 'playing' the part of you that feels the emotion or feeling in various ways in real time, just like you do it on your computer so you can keep your mind focused on what needs to be done. But because of this, any time you allow the five buttons to do that, it will cause you to feel some sort of emotional pain or a lack of control. There is no substitute for having a good understanding of how to deal with these two different parts of you and then using both the input and output systems in the right way to make the computer do a good job. If there is a problem with the output system, the program will alert you to the problem. If there is a problem with the input system, you will be able to use your input systems'safely' in all ways, whether it is for things that are actually'really true' or for thoughts that are being held in the same way that you used to when you were a child. Some of the best ways to help people out of problems in mind and body by letting your mind run is to do the things you did when you were growing up. The computer should never 'get in the way' of your thoughts--you will feel its presence if it knows that you are capable of using it to a certain degree. Try and work out that some thought is really true and that you actually do believe the truth, for the computer is not going to question the truth when it is in control. Instead, it is going to use your thoughts and the computer's input to try and make things into the truth when they might really be something completely opposite-of that, but that your mind has been programmed to operate a certain way. You will also need to try and get the computer to have your greatest fear and happiness on the same page, for the computer is just like your old 'body' when it understands how you live, thinking your brain and your body have certain roles to perform in the big picture.

Question: Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method?

Answer: Yes.

Question: How do you measure the color and brightness of a sun glare spot? How do you interpret solar color? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How do you measure the color and brightness of a sun glare spot? How do you interpret solar color?

Answer:

Sun glare is not visible in visible light, but it is not hard to interpret what the color of the sun is. A color is defined as the sum of two or more different wavelength wavelengths. For instance, a color that is one-third red is defined by having the wavelength of 440 nm as one third that of 660 nm as one third that of 660 nm, and, conversely, a color that is one-half dark red is defined by having the wavelength of 480 nm as one half that of 555 nm.

The brightness is the total amount of energy that is radiated in an area of space. For example, if an entire sphere of sunlight is shining on a person and they are exposed to only half of a centimeter over that, then the brightness of a person may be one-half or a quarter of the intensity of the sunlight, depending on the distance the person is from the sunlight.

A few different methods were developed to study sun glare. One method was based on spectral analysis of the light incident on a bright object. This method does not measure the energy of the light, but just the reflected energy of the light incident on the observer. It is common today to take spectroscopic measurements in the light of the sun.

Another method was based on the color of ultraviolet radiation and in particular sun and dark-adapted photopsia. This method measures the color of ultraviolet radiation emitted by a bright object. It is also called ""white"" photopsia.

Another method was based on the relative size of a given frequency of sunlight, relative to an object being measured and then divided in half. This method is called ""equal-energy"" spectroscopy, and is commonly used today in telescopes to measure the spectrum of sunlight.

A third method was based on the spectroscopic appearance of a single wavelength of sunlight, in this case, the ultraviolet. This method is called ""spectroscopically calibrated.""

A method for measurement of the relative size of a frequency of sunlight was developed by R.J. Thomson and James Cook in 1911, and this method is called ""spectral discrimination."" It can measure light differently from a spectrum analysis, that is, from an observer positioned at sea level with the sun at one corner of the eye.

Another method of measurement for the ratio of wavelength to brightness was developed between 1881 and 1931 by Rene Descartes and was published in 1797. The measurement involves putting a piece of paper against the back of an umbrella while sitting on a chair or on the ground. One piece of paper is placed on the paper and the other against a sheet of paper, each side of which is exposed to the sunlight. The ratio of brightness to wavelength, which is called ""descent"" is then measured. An ""equal-energy"" method is also used for this measurement method. The ""equal-energy"" method is still widely used today.

Another method of measurement of the brightness of the sun for determining its color has been developed in the USA by J.R. Pemberton in 1927. This method, also called ""pulse emission measurement,"" depends on the shape of a bright object being observed. The shape of a bright object is important because it dictates whether it reflects or absorbs light, which will define its color. In this method, a red, yellow or green object is placed against a dark piece and the same angle and intensity as the bright object is chosen for comparison. It is important to note that the intensity is not directly measured by this method. However, by measuring the amount of light emitted by the object against the amount of light reflected by the object, the ratio can be determined. The more light emitted by the object against what is reflected, the brighter the object is. The more light reflected by the object, the darker the object is.

The second form of spectral discrimination involved in studying sunlight's color is called ""diffuse spectroscopy."" It involves measuring the amount of light falling on a bright object. Diffuse spectroscopy is common in optical systems and is also used today for imaging purposes."
Question: Should circumcision be performed in childhood? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should circumcision be performed in childhood? Related answers: As long as the parents' or guardians' decisions are supported by the medical profession, physicians don't have a professional duty to change a child's circumcision if their decision is in the best interest of the boy's health. The parents must do the best for the child; they don't have a special legal obligation to obey their doctors.

Circumcision is an acceptable medical procedure for babies in many countries. This web page, however, does not take a position about whether circumcision should be performed at all. It does, however, state that babies should not be circumcised when it is medically unnecessary. It is my contention that if a doctor wants to place this procedure on a child, he should have the flexibility to do so.

What's My Baby's Risk?

The infant is at greatest risk for complications if the procedure is performed too soon. Children are more apt to suffer injury if they are strapped on when they are just learning how to walk or even to walk at all. Infants often fall off the table and break bones. Often, even before the skin is stretched, their brains have not fully developed. If the skin is too tight when the boy is younger, the child may cry or scream, for example. This is dangerous because no brain function is lost. But if the skin is too loose at the infant's age, the brain is not mature enough to make effective decisions about his future behavior. The baby may resist his parents' wishes to make a change; in extreme instances, the parents may abandon the infant. If the skin is not stretched until the child is much older, however, it can be done so that the foreskin will never be damaged.

Why Should I Choose to Do This for My Son?

Circumcision is a medically recommended step in helping boys grow up to be strong, competent members of society. There are many medical reasons for this; it may prevent or reduce some sexually transmitted diseases, and it does keep the penis strong for sexual intercourse. Circumcision also greatly reduces the incidence of herpes.

When would I know if my son wants it? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: When would I know if my son wants it? Related answers: Circumcision does not cause problems unless the parents are unable to decide for themselves. The baby does not owe his foreskin to adults to learn to use it. Parents have a duty to have their son protected from disease and other harms. Circumcision is not part of the human condition or genetic inheritance.

Question: Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: No. The only thing that changes is that instead of being offered an anti-inflammatory, you will begin treatment for non-cancerous (inflammatory) inflammations with a single colonoscopy. In addition, in many cases, the diagnosis of diverticulitis is made on the first day of the second and third attempts of the first colonoscopy. After that, in most cases it is treated again, as though the diverticulitis is non-cancerous.

Question: When should I see a colonoscopy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""When should I see a colonoscopy?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: First, consult your healthcare physician before the colonoscopy, as any abnormal findings on the colonoscopic exam can lead to an urgent consult with an endoscologist. This will help you to learn what you need to do in case you need to return to the doctor's office for further review of your findings. However, once this is determined, you can start treatment based on your previous findings and may still receive a colonoscopy a few weeks later.

Question: When should I consider the procedure to be over? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""When should I consider the procedure to be over?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: The procedure can be reversed if the findings turn out to be abnormal. However, once you have been diagnosed with diverticulitis, the procedure should be postponed until you regain the health needed to avoid future complications.

Question: How often should I consult a specialist? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""How often should I consult a specialist?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: Consult the specialist at least once every 3 months. Consult the specialist 1 to 2 times/year if signs of diverticulitis continue to persist. In extreme cases, a third visit of the same kind, usually after 2 or 3 months, is strongly advised. It is strongly advised that consult a specialist unless: your physician knows your symptoms and the underlying cause of your pain; your physician is convinced your pain does not belong to the diverticular disease; no pain-related problems are present; and/or no other diagnostic tests were done.

Question: What is the duration of follow-up after an acute diverticulum? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""What is the duration of follow-up after an acute diverticulum?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: The duration of follow-up after an acute diverticulum depends mainly on the number of the diverticulas (the number of diverticula per bowel volume, the actual size of the diverticula) and the procedure used. In many cases the length of follow-up is 3 to 5 years. There are some other factors that matter in the treatment of a diverticulum: the presence of diverticulitis is not related to the length of the follow-up in all cases; and the patient's condition improves with appropriate therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PATIENTS].

Question: In each case, did I recover? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""In each case, did I recover?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: No. On the contrary, there is a risk of relapse after recovery but usually these relapse recur after only a few months of treatment. If more than five relapses are seen in a short time after treatment, a reassessment is recommended.

Question: Is there any way to predict whether a diverticulum will reoccur? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""Is there any way to predict whether a diverticulum will reoccur?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: There is still a risk of a relapse (especially in younger patients) but usually at the rate one per 10 years following treatment. Some patients may require a further evaluation of the relapses to see the recurrence risks.

Question: Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up? Keywords: dementia, instrumental activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, dementia risk factor, neurodegenerative disorders

Introduction The risk of dementia increases with age and is a major concern for people living with the illness. The mechanism by which dementia develops is currently debated. One hypothesis is that environmental factors contribute to the disease by inducing a form of oxidative stress in brain tissue in which proteins that are essential for healthy brain function are degraded or broken down. The mechanism by which these factors induce oxidative stress in brain tissue is unknown, however there is evidence that these factors directly cause Alzheimer's disease. Others hypothesize that there may be a genetic component to dementia or that environmental factors also play important roles. However, recent data suggests that no single lifestyle factor has been shown to have a significant impact on the development of dementia. However, recent studies have failed to identify a single lifestyle factor that increases the risk of dementia. The question of whether instrumental activities of daily living (LADWs) contribute to the development of dementia warrants further investigation, and this has led to the design and analysis of a large-scale investigation of the relationship between LADWs and dementia in a large, representative sample of individuals with advanced dementia (1–3). If the link between LADWs and dementia is causal, then we believe that measures of LADW activity should be a predictor of dementia risk and should allow for the prediction of future occurrence of dementia. The study objective was to determine whether instrumental activities of daily living or a combination of LADWs and dementia risk factors predicted dementia risk in a large, representative sample of individuals with advanced dementia. Furthermore, we hypothesized that a combination of LADWs and a combination of disease-specific outcomes will not, at least not on a first attempt, predict risk of dementia and its associated outcomes in a large, representative sample of individuals with advanced dementia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample The study population consisted of 1,735 individuals (mean age, 79 years) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1997–1998 in the United States. Participants were invited to participate by letters from an independent program manager (N = 1,040) through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The study was approved by the institutional review boards at all participating sites. The principal investigator, Drs. Daniel R. Bernstein, DVM, et. al, and Dr. Steven K. Hall, MSPH, were the study directors. The primary outcome measure of dementia occurrence was obtained by using a validated questionnaires-based dementia assessment procedure. Results LADWs were defined as activities that comprise activities that include activities of daily living (ADLs) in the context of a routine, established lifestyle pattern associated with use of other health-related practices or recreational activities. Among participants with advanced dementia and no other dementia risk factors, participants were classified as having an adjusted dementia incidence of 4.7, 3.7, or 4.4 percent for activities of daily living or combination LADWs, respectively. LADW characteristics included sex, age at baseline (mean, 69 years), race, education, and marital status. In all analyses, LADW level was categorized into four categories: no activity (1–13 or less LADW), 1–7 LADW in the context of a routine, established lifestyle (8–20 LADW in the context of a routine, established lifestyle), and ≥3 LADW in the context of a routine, established lifestyle. For example, a person with three activities of daily living would have these in his or her routine: living room activity, playing table tennis with the parents, and walking a dog. The remaining activities of daily living were defined as activities associated with routine, established lifestyle. For example, if a person spent less than 3 hours in the kitchen per day and did not cook much meat or vegetables, there would be no category for this activity on the scale. The analysis controlled for multiple confounders that may confound the relationship between ADLs and dementia risk. For example, age was one confounder of the relationship between LADW level and dementia, but its inclusion did not modify our results. We compared dementia incidence at 1-year follow-up between those who reported no activity of daily living (comprising of 1–7 LADW in the context of a routine, established lifestyle), those who reported LADW levels greater than or equal to 3, those who reported LADW levels greater than or equal to 7, and those who reported LADW levels greater than or equal to 8. We then examined whether the association between activity of daily living level and dementia risk in the subsequent 1- and 2-year periods was similar after adjusting"
Question: Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection?

Answer: A retrospective analysis of patients who were randomized in a clinical trial of intubation with one of 10 instruments reported that the use of one instrument was associated with an increased risk of post-operative ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection (see Table). These researchers reasoned that, although these instruments have different techniques to perform the procedure, their use resulted in a low rate of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection. For the remainder of this paper, we will present case histories of the occurrence and prevalence of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection occurring during the first 2 days and 1 to 2 days following the delivery of the baby by caesarean section.

Case History

A 22-year-old single man presented to our hospital for the termination of an abortion in August 2001 in order to continue his pregnancy and have a son. He requested the baby be placed in the breech position in the mother's pelvis or in the epidural position, and requested the epidural be placed in the vaginal canal at both delivery and time of delivery. After the patient's arrival at our clinic, he gave a history of fetal heart rate variations and also gave a history of having a previous caesarean section. He was able to deliver the baby vaginally, with use of a combination of medications and mechanical vacuum aspiration. The obstetrician recommended that he be intubated by the obstetrician while it was not too late to deliver using the standard intubation and resuscitation technique. This was to ensure that the epidural was properly inserted. The obstetrician gave him 3 to 4 minutes to perform the procedure and to maintain a good attitude while performing the procedure using the standard equipment. At approximately 16 minutes, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt invaded the anterior descending wall of the uterine cavity and the patient experienced moderate- to heavy-level cervical contractions. Two seconds later, the placenta was delivered. While in the recovery position, the patient felt a sensation of pressure in the abdomen. He was later admitted for an evaluation of what became known as ""the baby's breath."" The patient was treated with fluids, and later underwent an angiotendinous catheter placement. The next day, the abdominal pain subsided and the patient was discharged home with instructions to use oxygenated mouth-to-mouth for pain management following anesthesia. The next week, the patient returned to the hospital, but was discharged with a diagnosis of a mild perforation in the posterior wall of the uterus. There was an ultrasound to determine the depth of the perforation, and the patient was intubated again in the same procedure.

A week after his surgery, the patient began to experience frequent abdominal contractions. He reported feeling that the airways were congested, and that he was having difficulty moving the stomach and/or intestines. He had an emergency medical condition. The patient attended to with the obstetrician and an obstetric physician two more times, but he had not recovered from the injury. He continued to experience a high rate (10 to 15%) post-operative ventricular arrhythmias, and had occasional periods of weakness in his arms and legs during which he could not maintain adequate support on the bed. He was found to have a perforation in his posterior wall of the uterus in the perisopodium region. A CT scan was ordered, and the patient was given intrapartum antibiotics and gave a progesterone, but no treatment was initially provided. He was eventually given a CT scan of the perisopylon, which confirmed the perforation, and he was transferred to a tertiary care center for a treatment of this condition. Following a follow-up CT scan, the patient underwent surgery to repair the perforation, and there was again moderate and intense abdominal contractions, possibly due to the perforation (6.5 hours following intubation). The patient was then transferred with an epidural. An ultrasound found no perforation and the patient resumed his normal activities.

Ten months after the birth, the patient returned to his hospital for a follow-up. He was able to maintain a good attitude throughout the entire procedure, and he resumed normal activities. He continued to have very light-headedness and occasional headaches, and he also had frequent periods of decreased reflex activity due to the ventricular arrhythmia (18 hours following ventricular intubation) and decreased motor function. During the subsequent 2.5 weeks, the patient was unable to return to his normal activities at all, as the episodic migraine was severe and had progressed. The patient underwent a second CT"

PANASONIC

Evaluating phonological awareness: how can an awareness of phonological structure be enriched?

Authors: J.A.B., K.G., S.M.C., E.L.A. and J.D.K. (in press)

A recent literature study has investigated the relation between two types of phonological awareness: the acoustic awareness of the acoustic environment and phonological awareness based on speech production. Based on these findings, it has been hypothesized that early acquisition of acoustic awareness (as measured via voice-print examinations) and the acoustic awareness of speech structures would be highly associated to phonological awareness. However, even though two studies seem to contradict each other on this issue, the current empirical research has not yet fully uncovered whether early, acoustic and phonological awareness are linked to each other at different levels of the processing sequence. In turn, the most important task to carry out these studies remains to explore the links at both phonological and acoustic levels.

A.T. P.

The aim of this study was to study how early, acoustic, and phonological awareness are related and whether the association is significant for both acoustic and phonological knowledge. To make it more straightforward, we used the following measures. First, an acoustic literacy and the phonological abilities of eight Han Chinese children were assessed (3-5 years old) using a voice-print procedure. The subjects' phonological memory, phonological awareness and learning rate were also examined using a special knowledge test, that is, an auditory semantic ability test. It was found that in all children, their phonological abilities and knowledge were highly similar with the acoustic abilities. The results indicated that acoustic awareness and phonological awareness were highly related to each other. Second, a phonological perception test was carried out, that is, the auditory acoustic pattern recognition test, which is an auditory recognition test that uses acoustic stimuli, such as speech sounds and sounds of animals. In addition, the subject's phonological awareness was assessed using the two previous studies, namely the speech articulatory perception test (SAP) and the speech articulatory segmentation test. The results showed that, among the children, the phonological awareness and knowledge was moderately higher on both a high and low level, in general.

We conclude that, while early acoustic sensitivity is associated with early early learning of phonological ability and acoustic awareness, the level of this early acoustic sensitivity is highly related to the levels of both phonological awareness and acoustic awareness. In turn, the association between the two systems is probably at least partly mediated by the influence of language acquisition that takes place in the first years of life. Future studies that investigate the association between acoustic, phonological, and linguistic systems in children from 0 to 2 years of age may contribute to the understanding of the underlying factors for speech language development. While some results indicated that the acoustic-phonological relationship is important to the early and phonological awareness, the results were not completely resolved. The results indicate that these relations are not so strong as previously predicted.

D.O.

In their review article, J.Z., A.J.W., J.J., C.K. and C.W. found that early recognition of speech sounds are the most important mechanisms through which young children learn phonological awareness. Recently, the association between early phonological awareness and speech understanding was demonstrated, namely the age-related increase in auditory awareness in the first years of life. Nevertheless, the acoustic and phonological systems seem to be differentially involved with early visual perception and spatial awareness. For example, some authors observed that early auditory perception is a poor indicator of the perceptual aspects and the phonological awareness appears to be related to the phonological processing. Our study offers new perspectives on the early processes in phonological processing, which may indicate a potential contribution of early linguistic learning towards phonological awareness.

Question: Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is there any biological mechanism that makes streptococci cause multiple sclerosis? The best known biological theory of MS is that it is a specific type of autoimmune disorder known as Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies trigger cells in immune cells that attack and kill the neurons that control the movement of pain-carrying nerve impulses. The immune system is particularly strong in people with multiple sclerosis. There are many symptoms of multiple sclerosis, including pain, swelling of the brain, changes in the muscle and bone mass, and inability to speak or move the fingers. To diagnose multiple sclerosis you usually see two different kinds of laboratory tests: an immunocompromised test to exclude people who have already had one or more previous infections; and a blood test that distinguishes among those who have had prior infection, the general population, and immune-compromised or HIV-infected people with multiple sclerosis. The immunoassay is only one of many ways the doctor may test your immune system, which in its most subtle form of the disease, which can appear in adults anywhere from their 20s to the 90s, includes hundreds of thousands of cells called macrophages, and makes them proliferate (grow) into a massive blood mass around the parts of the body affected. At one time most of the time this is nothing more than a lump under the skin known as a lesion, but recent tests that can detect the presence of macrophages in the blood have shown that at least some people have been infected as children with measles, mumps or smallpox, while that is still known to be a significant cause of the disease. It is suspected that it is the infection with measles that produces the increased amount of macrophages in the blood and causes other symptoms, such as low appetite, difficulty swallowing and bowel problems. Other symptoms seen as an early prognostic indicator of multiple sclerosis are problems with swallowing and bowel control and blurred vision. So if people with different diseases and infections are all thought to have a similar underlying disease, why does the immune system attack and kill them all? It is a complicated answer, and the causes and progression of multiple sclerosis are not well understood, but the fact that many people who catch and infect themselves have other symptoms, such as pain and swollen joints, suggests that the immune system is somehow not doing its best to eradicate the disease. The disease also causes people to become less functional in other ways. People with multiple sclerosis suffer from some of the most severe neurological pain of any disease, and other symptoms and disabilities, such as cognitive problems, are also common with the disease. When it comes to the severity of symptoms and disability, people with multiple sclerosis may be as poor or even worse off as those with tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis, and even people with diabetes or high blood pressure. So why did the immune system attack and kill so many people as children? Two types of immune systems, both specific to people with MS, attack and kill the same parts of the body in the same way. And because MS patients have not been infected before they have had an immune attack on the part of their brain responsible for thinking, it's plausible that the same underlying mechanism explains how the disease causes this. The first type of ""regulatory"" immune system is responsible for the formation of ""memory cells"", which contain proteins that recognize and inhibit certain chemical reactions that occur during disease symptoms. A number of these memory cells become ""memory receptors"", in effect a relay station for immune responses to recognize and be inhibited for subsequent attacks. The cell-based memory cells are the same type of memory cells as in young children, but the adult type is a bit bigger, and includes multiple cells that are active, and can take in and store information for weeks to give the immune system an overview of a specific situation. The second type, or ""inflammatory"" immune system is also required for self-cleansing. This type of immune system attacks the ""memories"" and ""memory receptors"", and creates immune cells and antibodies to help rid your body of infection. MS is a classic example of this role. The ""regulatory"" immune system can also produce its own immune reaction, by producing a specific type of antibody by triggering the production of an enzyme. A single antibody production and reaction, however, will not kill the infected cell, which is usually what produces the anti-inflammatory, anti-autoimmune or immune-modulating effect. It is not uncommon for children with MS to have autoimmune reactions on both parts of the brain (nerve production) and immune cells in their eye and blood vessels (cellular immunity). These effects are so common that it is a major cause of disability in children; many young children can have severe seizures in the same setting; and a number of adults have permanent damage to their vision at an early age. So there appear to be two types of inflammation, which may be causing the same underlying problem. One type involves the"

The treatment of ovarian cancer with 2-methoxyestradiol and 2-MEOE2 has been in clinical and preclinical trials since the 1970's in animal models, but the combination has not been approved for any indication in humans. In vitro and in vivo efficacy studies are limited and the combined treatment is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The use of methoE2 is approved for the treatment of pre-cancerous ovarian carcinoma in animal models. Both 2-methoxyestradiol and 2-methiE2 may be effective in pre-cancerous subfertility. Results are preliminary and there are limitations associated with the use of a combination therapy with a single treatment.

Question: Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee and the anterior cruciate ligament.

Introduction

Anterior cruciate ligament injuries (ACL injuries) can be devastating and have serious long-term sequelae.1,2 Although ACL tears occur in about 1 in 1,000 persons, most people have ACL injuries that heal without a sequelae. Nevertheless, injury is the first stage of ACL rehabilitation.1,2 The severity of the injury may dictate which step you should pursue after injury and the duration of surgery.

Many people who have an ACL injury will present with symptomatic pain, stiffness, and lack of function. This is true if the ACL is being torn. The initial injury is most often anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tendon stress, which is usually not painful to the uninjured individual but may feel similar and may cause temporary difficulty in walking, climbing stairs, standing on one leg, or lifting weights. The diagnosis of ACL injury is usually based on one of three diagnostic criteria that are based on the anatomy of the lateral meniscus, the location of the injury on the anterior cruciate ligament, and the level of involvement.2

Assessing joint line positions

There are numerous factors with regard to which it is desirable to establish the joint line positions after ACL injury. The first step, however, is to perform an MRI of the knee or knee joint. The diagnosis of ACL injury is often based on the MRI or x-ray. Therefore, it is critical to consider the joint line positions and MRI findings when assessing the quality of function following ACL injury and the development of an injury-free patient.

It is important to assess the level of involvement of the meniscus, the location of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and the extent of injury. These factors are typically most evident on the MRI scan, which is an important step in evaluating the patients' ability to function and rehabilitation.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the thickest ligament within the knee joint. It is normally attached to the extensor tendon and the vastus medialis muscle and then to the superior border of the collateral ligaments.2,5 In a healthy individual, the ACL is attached to the meniscus with an oval or splayed configuration that corresponds with the position of the anterior capsule and the tibial tubercle.2 The ACL will be stressed (over tension) when the knee is flexed.6,7

The location of the ACL does not accurately represent its clinical importance and is a source of uncertainty in the clinical assessment of an ACL injury. In order to provide an accurate depiction of the ACL injury, it is important to measure both joint line positions and the location of the ACL on both sides of the knee. Therefore a simple and noninvasive technique commonly used to establish the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) position is to measure an extensor tendon (tendon) length on both sides of the knee joint between where it attaches to the medial, lateral, and anterior cruciate ligaments using an extensor tendon tester. The measurements are in millimeters when the extensor tendon is stretched (anterior cruciate ligament is stretch).8 When the patient's leg is flexed, the tester is stretched and measured along the tendon that attaches the tendon to the anterior surface of the medial, lateral, and anterior cruciate ligaments.9 Then, the length of the extensor tendon varies from where it attaches the tendon to the medial, lateral, and anterior cruciate ligaments. In a healthy individual with a normal weight, these extensor tendon measurements are typically in excess of 1 mm. To maintain the accuracy of this assessment, measurements are taken 4 times out of 5 over 5 minutes and after a 2-minute rest.

Although this technique is widely used in knee joint analysis, a recent trend among knee joint imaging companies has not followed it. Although the technology to measure the extensor tendon length has improved over the past few years, other equipment is difficult for the radiologist to use. Furthermore, the technique does not allow for measurement of the proximal meniscus, the small flap of cartilage that is commonly located in the extensor tendon at the lateral side of the knee.9 Therefore, measurements of the distance between the proximal tip of the extensor tendon and the meniscus often is not feasible due to the small distance. Consequently, the results obtained from this technique are considered unreliable.

This technique is more effective as long as the athlete's weight has not changed since the injury and it is performed in a position that will not interfere with the normal activities of daily living.

Question: Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement?""

Answer: The TFL in the T20 and T25 tendons has greater stiffness and greater length than the other tendons. This creates a greater stretch, strain, and compression on the patellar tendon compared to the other major structures. The stiffness and length of the TFL is not directly related to the Patellar Joint Tenderness (PAT) in the Patellar Disk and Achilles (ADI), and this difference is a symptom of a Patellar Disk or Achilles problem.

What this study showed was that the length and stiffness of the TFL in the T20 tendons may impact the mechanical alignment of the patellar tendon, and this interaction had an influence on mechanical stability of the knee.

Mechanical problems can lead to changes for the best and worst of human biomechanics. These results do not mean that the TFL of the T20 and T25 tendons is good or bad. Instead, it showed that mechanical instability of the TFL in the first two knee segments during knee replacement is a problem in most cases.

The mechanical instability can have a significant effect on the joint if not corrected. Although the mechanical instability is reduced for the restorative knee replacement (RKOR), these findings could lead to a lower chance of a good RKOR. On the positive side, the greater mechanical instability should prevent ACL injuries in patients with degenerative changes in the patellar disk or Achilles (ADI). It also makes it possible to perform a lower joint movement such as supination, pronation, and flexion, which are common before knee replacement. It is important to bear this in mind if you have a patellar pain, when performing an injury assessment test, and especially if you are using a RKOR technique.

Sidney Pfeiffer, et al.; Breast Cancer Res. 4(7):S40-S54, 2002. I. Introduction


In the past 15 years we have seen a significant increase in the incidence and incidence of breast cancer. With the exception of glioblastoma multiforme, breast malignancies are the most prevalent cancers among women in the United States (1). Breast cancer is now the fourth most common cancer in the United States (2). There is a strong correlation between rates of breast cancer onset/diagnosis and the frequency of breast biopsies. There is a high incidence of tumours with an active growth axis (carcinoma). Prostate, lung, colon, and rectal cancers are also common in this country. There is a strong association between biopsy rate and rates of breast cancer incidence. In this study we reviewed the incidence and incidence of breast cancer in 3,200 women with breast biopsies between 1990 and 2002. Of this total, 5.8% were breast tumors. In men, there were an incidence of 1.4%. The median age of women with breast cancer was 52 years, and the median age of the male group was 45 years. Breast biopsies took place on an average of once a year in women and once a month in men; both ages were quite consistent throughout the study.


The biopsy process is characterized by a range of different events. The patient is placed in a chair at the radiograph center, and is examined while lying supine. Ultrasound is used to assess a variety of aspects of the woman's anatomy. Ultrasound imaging is used to study the extent of breast adiposity. As well as the general anatomy, in order to obtain the tumor site you must remove the nipple bone through an incision made using a scalpel. In men, the cancer is detected with laparoscopy. The tumor is generally spotted by visual inspection and then biopsied under a microscope. This is most often done at a local facility, where all the tissue is examined in one spot. All examinations have a low diagnostic value and are a low cost alternative when other methods are not acceptable. The biopsy is generally in a sterile environment and in an open setting. The biopsy site is considered to be a ""noncancerous"" lymph node.


With the advent of mammography, it is possible for a biopsy to be carried out on the entire breast. The cost of an MRI and/or CT scan is more complex to evaluate, are generally associated with higher margins of error, and are more time-consuming and costly. In that light, the need for a ""biopsy"" for breast cancer is considered essential. Although the prevalence and growth of breast cancer is increasing (2), there are only limited number of biopsy sites.


It is often argued that there are several reasons for the increasing death rates of breast cancer in general and of breast cancer in particular (2). A recent study found that breast cancers account for approximately two quarters of all primary breast cancers in Japan (4). Women who die from breast cancer in Japan are a disproportionately large group. An increasing incidence rate in the US is also correlated with increasing death rates of breast cancers in the general population. Women living in the United States have a higher likelihood of developing breast cancer.


Cancers of the breast and ovary are the dominant cancer group in the United States. A variety of other types of cancers have been found in other countries, including cancers of the penis, throat, urinary tract, ovary, and testicles.


The prevalence of breast cancer in the United States is rising. Between 1996 and 1997, 1.2 for every 100,000 women aged 50 to 54 years, compared with 0.4 in 1986 (1). These increases have contributed to an increased incidence of breast cancer in women of childbearing age and increasing rates of breast cancers in women in their 20s and early 30s. The majority of these increases affect the breast and ovarian tumor subtypes (4% breast and 8% ovarian cancers). There are many factors that are implicated in the increased breast cancer incidence among women, including social, socioeconomic, and cultural influences. For example, women are more likely than men or other younger age groups to smoke, to drink heavily and to have multiple sexual partners (1). Women living in states that have higher rates of breast cancer are more likely to be exposed to carcinogens such as tobacco smoke. In addition, more women are having breast surgery.


Many factors can modify the growth of breast cancer. Cancer can be aggressive, malignant, or just benign. There are many mechanisms that can modify breast tumor growth, and the role of the lymph node is essential to understanding how the tumor is progressing. In addition, the tumor"

Question: Continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration: opportunity for rescue? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

We have tested and confirmed the results of a large pilot cohort study investigating whether antenatal and in-utero corticosteroid administration reduces pregnancy rates following a primary low-birth-weight (LBW) induction compared with a high-birth-weight (HBW) induction (14). Although no data on postneonatal outcomes were available from this group study, after stratifying participants according to their birth weight and gestational age, the mean probability of being classified as LBW at enrollment was lower in the second trimester of pregnancy compared with that of the first trimester. However, this effect disappeared at a somewhat later gestational age in this group of the cohort, with an average mean probability of a pregnant woman being classified as LBW at 16 weeks gestation of 30% compared with a pregnancy rate of 70% for women who were classified as HBW (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS:

Although this cohort study did not address the issue of ancillary or secondary clinical outcomes, the observed findings suggest that in-utero corticosteroid administration during the second trimester of pregnancy may represent a more effective and economical alternative than using HBW induction in reducing pregnancy rates."
Question: Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects?

Study design:

This study was a double-blind crossover study. Subjects were randomized to receive one of three different treatments: normal CPAP, an OSA-based CPAP therapy that reduced the OSA or had no treatment differences, or a more than doubled OSA-free OSA treatment that reduced the CPAP response with a specific OSA-based CPAP (APX100) device. The mean age was 58 years and the mean weight was 79.6 kg.

Drug:

Doxycycline (2.25 mg, administered twice) was given to this group.

Study protocol:

The subjects in the OSA-based and non-OSA-based CPAP therapy groups received their CPAP therapy every 12 hours, and were then placed on an inpatient overnight fasted condition. The sleep-wake pattern was recorded at baseline (5 pm) and the timepoint (5:45 pm) when they had the longest sleep (0–30 min) without REM sleep/nightmares. The mean sleep duration was 8.3 h.

For the OSA-based treatment group, the sleep pattern was recorded after the subjects had taken their last dose of the OSA-based CPAP machine and a sleep questionnaire was developed. The first questionnaire was composed of six items that evaluated sleep quality, which also included how long each subject was able to retain spontaneous sleep at a specified baseline time. A computer-assisted self-assessment computer program (Barker-Cadegouz, 2010) was used to measure total sleep time (total nocturnal sleep time) using polysomnography (PSG) and the sleep-wake cycle using an alarm clock and a 12-hour polysomnogram. This assessment occurred before subjects received their first dose of the OSA-based CPAP treatment. The sleep-wake cycle was also analyzed. The sleep cycle was evaluated using a polysomnogram at the beginning and end of the OSA-based treatment, and the night of a 6-h fast prior to sleep and the night of a 6-h fast before sleep (baseline to morning).

Results:

No significant difference was found in total sleep time following 12-hour OSA-based treatment (P = 0.42), but the sleep cycle was reduced by 6.5 hours (P = 0.049) compared with baseline.

There was a significant decrease following 12-hour OSA-based treatment for the control group, which had a normal sleep time and a high total sleep time (P = 0.02) compared with the OSA-based group.

Conclusion:

The results of this study demonstrate that short-term OSA-based CPAP therapy, which has a short sleep, reduced sleep duration. This CPAP therapy reduced sleep time, however, there was no difference according to obesity status, as long-term treatment with the same OSA model should not alter sleep time at a higher obesity prevalence. The sleep-cycle characteristics demonstrated in this study have a role in the short-term behavior, and the results from this study have a role in the long-term behavior.

Introduction

The sleep-wake cycle is the primary sleep rhythm, and a reduction in sleep duration and/or length is considered deleterious to sleep quality, well-being, and health (Bosworth and Della Rovere, 1998). Sleep disturbance, a decreased sleep efficiency, and disrupted sleep are considered adverse side effects of OSA (Cohen, 2006). In addition, the OSA model has been shown in laboratory and clinical studies to be associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Burgess et al., 2005; Harkavy et al., 2009), stroke (Dorothy et al., 2002), and other chronic diseases (Masters et al., 1969; Degenhardt et al., 1985), as well as the development of obstructive sleep apnea (OBS) syndrome (Degenhardt et al., 1985).

Although some OSA-based CPAP devices may help overweight subjects reduce sleep duration and/or sleep problems, it is known that OSA-based CPAP devices have an increased risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea (OBS). In addition, more research has been done regarding the effects of OSA-based CPAP devices on obstructive sleep apnea. In this study, there was a significant reduction in sleep duration with OSA-based CPAP in obese individuals, and no significant effect on sleep quality. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in sleep quality with OSA-based CPAP"

Question: Is the Distance Worth It? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," The distance traveled to this web site in the past 12 hours depends on how fast the web site is updated. The paper should contain a graph and text that explain how the graph has been developed. The distance traveled to this web site in the past 12 hours depends on how fast the web site is updated. The paper should contain a graph and text that explain how the graph has been developed.

The answer to the question above is yes and no.

Yes, the speed of your web site updating is more important than the distance traveled. This is why a distance metric might be helpful in determining the appropriate way to write a paper. However, the difference between ""the faster"" and ""the slower"" is not huge at all. And that's the way math works in this case; the difference between ""the faster"" and ""the slower"" doesn't even need to be used.

No, the difference between ""the faster"" and ""the slower"" is more important than ""the faster"". This is why if you say, ""the faster the update speed"", the question has already been answered by answering the question; the distance traveled has no effect on your answer.

We could use this to ask further questions if we wish. But to do so, we would only need to use a few sentences to write a paper that addresses the question at hand:

I want to write a paper that answers the distance traveled to a web page. I want to write a paper that addresses the question, the distance traveled to a web page, with two different distances measured: one in miles and another in kilometers. The two metrics would be: ""The distance traveled to the web page in miles"" And ""The distance traveled to the web page in kilometer"".

The paper's authors would have some background information for how to calculate the values to use, since the question, ""The distance traveled to a web page in miles"", can be written in both directions, with an average of miles and average of km. With this new metric, the two metrics might look something like this:

The distance traveled to a web page in miles (or km), average of miles and average of km. The distance traveled to the web page in kilometers, average of kilometers and average of miles.

The answer to the question of how many miles a mile actually is is an unknown quantity. However, we can know something if we know how much a mile means to someone. For example, if we say ""the distance traveled to any other web page"" or the like, we mean that the distance traveled was divided by an amount. In other words, we mean to say the distance was divided by some number. There is no way to know how many times the distance traveled to any other web page has been divided.

We'll define the metric that does the dividing for us. With the metric we can write a paper like this:

The distance traveled to any other web page of any size, average mile and average of km. This paper answers the question, how many miles a mile actually is to someone.

The ""the distance traveled to other web pages"" metric will be of two parts: ""the average of miles"" and ""the average of km"". The first two parts mean one thing and two different things; the third part means nothing and two different things. We just need to use the first part:

The distance traveled to other web pages, average of miles and average of km. The distance traveled to other web pages, average of kilometers and average of miles.

The difference between ""the distance traveled to other web pages"" and ""the distance traveled to other web pages"" is a small, but enough to indicate to us, simply, that more than one metric were used in the reasoning. The ""distance traveled to other web pages"" metric may be used on the web page, as far as it is appropriate.

We could continue this exercise by comparing the metric and finding out the average distance. Then we could use that average value to answer the question:

How many miles of distance have a medium sized web page traveled to the last hour?"
Question: Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling?

Answer: Aripiprazole is a drug (dopamine reuptake inhibitor) used to treat certain mood disorders, especially manic episodes and schizophrenia, but is also used to help some patients control other mood and behavioral disorders such as attention deficit disorder, anxiety and OCD. In fact, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) declared its intent to put a stop to the drug's sale as a dietary supplement by the end of 2000. Aripiprazole's history includes numerous deaths and injuries. To this day, there are still many people who have to ask why a drug that could possibly have saved their life turned out to be such a danger to their mental health. To help the people it did help, the FDA put a moratorium on the sale of this drug until a more rigorous scientific study has been conducted and any new safety data has been collected. These safety data should not be ignored.

Aripiprazole was also found in a 1992 study to have an abnormal heart function at first, but this was later reported to be temporary and then normal.

Despite being a very effective drug used to treat many mood disorders, Aripiprazole had been linked to a plethora of accidents and injuries. One of the most famous cases involved an Austrian nurse named Lino Struthers who was involved in a car accident in 2001, but was then found to have a ""substantial"" amount of Aripiprazole in her bloodstream. According to the newspaper Die Welt, Struthers' blood showed traces of the drug while she was in intensive care but no traces were found to be of any concern.

One case in particular, involving a 21-year old man with schizophrenia, involved a woman named Andrea Hülsing, who took this drug at 5,000 mg a day. The man died of cardiac arrest on August 24, 2002, shortly before he was scheduled to go on trial in a murder case, and, in February 2003, Hülsing was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, causing the death of her friend, who had also taken the drug. It was reported that Aripiprazole may have possibly caused the man's death.

Many other cases in which Aripiprazole has been linked to serious accidents and injuries has been reported, including:

A student with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome who was taking 50,000 mg of this drug after his asthma attack went from 3 to 5 degrees lower than normal.

A 14-year old girl with autism who had taken the drug and experienced the first signs of mental decline after two weeks.

A 26-year old male with cerebral venous insufficiency who had taken the drug after being paralyzed and then developed seizures after getting into a bad car accident.

A 22-year old male with a history of severe migraine headaches, which led to an accidental overdose after having taken at least 200 mgs of Aripiprazole at once.

A 35-year old male with a history of migraine headaches, who had taken 600 to 800 mgs of Aripiprazole three times per week for 5 months.

When this drug was first introduced during the 1970s, its use by individuals with bipolar disorder was much more common. However, in recent years, the drug has become a risk factor as many individuals with bipolar disorder have been found to have some form of mental disorder.

Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors: The Other Side of Misdiagnoses

If you have symptoms of depression or have ever had a period of depression, you may be wondering why you've been having so much trouble sleeping. If you think about it for just a moment, there may be a whole lot of reasons to suspect that something is not right. But it may start when people start getting into their cars, taking over the air conditioner, sitting in traffic, taking part in heavy recreational activities or simply not being able to concentrate. If you happen to have ADHD, a personality disorder or borderline personality disorder, those are all symptoms that may come up in your sleep. The fact is, as these people are getting so much more involved in activities that require them to shift their attention away from the task at hand, it can seem that they are experiencing much deeper problems.

All of us are vulnerable to depression. And if we are ever affected by that depression, we all have to start taking steps to get over our symptoms and start life to the brighter side. If you have ever wondered what's wrong, you may want to take a look at the following facts:

Fact: Depression has a higher incidence in people without a college degree.

Fact: Depression has a higher incidence in people over the age of 50.

Question: Immune suppression by lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine on T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens: does synergy exist? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," A comparison between lysosomotropic amines and other immunogenics on the effect of major and minor immunosuppressants on T-cell responses to peptide antigens.

Answer: This paper will summarize the results from several in vitro and in vivo animal studies focusing on the effects of lysosomotropic amines on T-cell responses to peptide antigENS. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that the lysosome may be critical for the development of human T cells capable of recognizing peptides of this nature. This has been shown in vivo with immunolocalization of a novel class of C-reactive proteins, including IL-12, CD14, TGF-β/β-chain, Vax, CD44, ILI-17, B lymphocyte-related regulatory antigen, and S100.

The paper will be written in a way that addresses the issues for this review. The authors will start their paper referring to immunogenics by focusing on specific anti-C-reactive protein antibodies, such as interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-16; and C-reactive protein antibodies such as interleukin-8, CCR5, and CXCR4. They will discuss the roles performed by both the immune system and lysosomes in T-cell production and differentiation and on the effect of T cell-specific antibodies on T-cell responses.

The paper will conclude by briefly discussing lysosome and innate immune functions during the development of T-cell responses to non-peptide antigens. This includes T-cell induction of antibodies by stimulation of innate immunity; generation of T-cell receptors and memory cells; and the induction of antigen-presenting cells and T-cell populations by cytokines.

This will be the second in this series to discuss a review of lysosomal immune functions. The previous one was reviewed by Mardianus et al (2013). Although this paper focused on lysosome function, it is important to recognize that these functions are not restricted to the immune pathway solely. A number of studies have demonstrated that lysosomal functions influence on the development and function of a variety of tissues. These include in vitro and in vivo immunohistochemical studies of the effects of cytokines on immune functions (Aguado and Kiyomura 2008; Chen et al. 2006; Marini and Tosti 2005; Salmi et al. 1998; Szilagyi et al. 2003), and in vivo studies on the effects of cytokines on the development and function of the brain and nervous system (Rosenblum et al. 2006b; Salmi et al. 2008). Finally, the results of in vitro studies on the effects of cytokines on cell viability (Coulaier, Chassin, and Barzilai 1983; Rousset and Salmi 1977; Rousset and Salmi 1994) and the studies on cytokine-induced androgen receptor suppression (Chu and Shih 1994, 2000) indicate that these are examples of aspects of the lysosome that may not be restricted only to the immune system. Lyrasomotropic amines are now known to act at the lysosome in a variety of ways (Tosunoda et al. 1995; Tatsumura et al. 1995; Suzuki et al. 1996; Tatsumura et al. 1999).

The authors of the lysosomotropic amines paper have shown that they are effective for the development and function of T cells. In this work, their experiments support the view that cytokines play an important role in T-cell development and function. This work highlights the role of lysosomes in the development and function of T cells. The authors conclude that the ability of lysosome-derived immunogenic ligands to influence T cell function is important in understanding the biology of lymphoid and monocytic T cells. This will be discussed further in the next section.

1. Overview of lysosomotropic amines

The literature on cytokines, their ligands, and their effects on T-cell development has been reviewed (Szilagyi, 2010; Rousset & Salmi 1994). The literature provides examples of cytokines acting in a variety of ways on T cell development and function. As discussed in more detail in Rousset & Salmi 1994a and B.K. Schmucker et al. 1998, cytokines (except IL-10) act by activating T cells. Activation of T cells is mediated"
Question: Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

What role does induction chemotherapy have in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma?

Answer: The effect of induction chemotherapy must be evaluated in accordance with its specific indications and efficacy data and in view of its potential to interfere with the efficacy of other therapies. The results of studies on induction chemotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma are limited, because most of them were evaluated in a single centre or in general population. Only an analysis of a population based analysis with two follow-up times shows an improvement in survival in patients who underwent induction chemotherapy.

Dose-limiting serious adverse events (E-RAEs) of induction chemotherapy have not been described as often as might be expected [ 5 - 6 ]. Other studies in addition to the earlier analysis of data available to these authors suggest that some dose-limiting serious adverse events might be likely. In this study, induction chemotherapy was not associated with high risk non-specific adverse events. However, in the present analysis, some doses higher than the ones mentioned previously may have lead to serious E-RAEs. Therefore, to be recommended in the standard of care and in the standard of evidence, the recommended dose of induction chemotherapy should be based on these results.

It is important to note that the type of tumour and route of treatment are also important considerations for the decision of where to start patients according to induction chemotherapy indications. The overall tumour site size, the age at diagnosis, the duration of remission, and the type of disease of the tumour are considered in the discussion [ 1, 3 ]. Generally, the number of patients on a particular regimen that the author can identify in each study has a significant impact on the total number of patients to be treated in each trial. The use of standardised randomisation in each study was necessary for maximising precision and reliability in the comparison of the results. However, there was a need for a large sample size in each of them to avoid bias of the results of the trials.

For patients with primary or secondary non-small cell lung cancer, induction chemotherapy is very cost effective and is administered in the course of a few months. Other therapies are not necessary even for patients who have non-small cell lung cancer and are treated by surgery. A positive result is achieved in many of the trials with a median (IQR) response of 60% within one year [ 1, 3 ]. In most of the studies, the median survival in patients who were undergoing induction chemotherapy was 3.5 months [ 5 - 6 ]. In the studies described here, the median survival in patients who were on the standardised regimen for induction chemotherapy consisted of 5.4 months [ 1, 3 ].

No significant results were found for safety evaluation in patients treated in the studies mentioned. The main conclusions presented in this review were that in the clinical practice:

Preliminary data were presented by a third paper [ 6.] However, the results of the meta-analysis reported in this article were also presented in the third paper. The results of this article had been previously presented by the second paper, whereas this study presented findings that were slightly different from those of the second paper. However, the data from the present analysis included only those patients who received induction chemotherapy.

The quality of the data generated in the data on the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy are comparable to those of the existing meta-analyses in primary and secondary non-small cell lung cancer [ 5, 6 ]. Although many of the trials in this review used different doses of different chemotherapy regimens, the meta-analyses using these data provide an overview of the available data for the efficacy and safety of different induction chemotherapy regimens as compared to that in the trials that used a single protocol. A potential limitation for the available data is that they might not be comparable with the same patient population, because of the different types of disease of the tumour and different patient populations. Studies comparing the quality of data from the literature on cancer patients treated in various types of cancer are necessary.

The data presented in this review were based on randomised and other forms of controlled studies. In many of these trials, dose-limiting adverse events may be very high, so the studies should ideally be able to demonstrate this in their data. For example, in a randomised study of 100 patients treated with dacarbazine, the odds ratio was 1.46 (1.04 – 2.06), in a randomised study of 40 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, the odds ratio was 2.13 (1.81 – 4.22) [ 22 ].

These data could also be used to establish the dose of induction chemotherapy and the duration of treatment. The author has recently recommended use of different criteria when considering such parameters [ 4, 19, 21 ]. The decision on"

"Question: Are normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians accurate and reliable at making street crossing decisions? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Are normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians accurate and reliable at making street crossing decisions?

Answer: While there is plenty to be said for all of the above factors, I believe that the best test of a pedestrian's ability is how well she knows the rules of the road. If she is aware of the rules and is able to follow them, she can be a good judge of road hazards and an efficient traffic flow. If she is not aware of the rules and unable to follow them, she is likely to be a hazard which must be avoided at all costs or else she will get hit.


It seems clear to me that the majority of blind and visually impaired pedestrians who pass the pedestrian crossing in question are not being guided by visual cues; rather, they are blindly following the commands and instructions of the driver. It is this type of blind obedience which I attribute to the blindness. However, as shown in the previous discussion, blind pedestrians are prone to become more prone to being distracted by the instructions they receive from the vehicle occupants or others present. Many blind pedestrians seem to be so distracted and so easily distracted that they make poor judgment calls. In a lot of cases they can easily cause serious injury or death. It is this type of blind obedience that is likely to lead to collisions. Therefore, I would not recommend blind pedestrians make the crossing.


It is also important to remember that if a pedestrian who can't see is forced to cross the street without seeing, there are often times when the pedestrians could have gotten out of the way. It seems to me that many drivers who refuse to let a blind pedestrian cross the street feel more justified in telling the pedestrian to get out of the way when a pedestrian can barely see. In fact, it is my impression that a majority of motorists are willing to let a blind pedestrian cross the street without seeing because they simply don't feel that the pedestrian should be allowed in the crosswalk. In addition, several times in this scenario, the driver will cite some other safety hazard which involves a blind pedestrian being able to cross the roadway safely. They also tend to feel that a blind pedestrian crossing the street would cause an immediate accident. In my opinion, those driving these vehicles are using blind obedience as a scapegoat to escape their responsibility in their own vehicles.

Another important consideration is that blind pedestrians must be careful not to force the driver to go past them. It is my personal opinion that many of these blind pedestrian are afraid to even approach the driver if he doesn't want to cross the street. This is because they don't want to be called ""trouble"" on their own and they have a fear of being hurt. Furthermore, some of these blind pedestrians will not approach the driver's vehicle in the first place and will go behind a parked vehicle either to go into a convenience store or to a store that sells fresh produce if the driver didn't want to cross the street.

All in all, I believe that blind and visually impaired pedestrians are frequently not the best judgment based on pedestrian crossing decisions. They are often mistaken and are subject to dangerous wrong decisions. This often results in collisions. Nevertheless, I do hope that their blind obedience can help them become more aware of the rules of the road and how to handle the situation."
Question: Is it Crohn's disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can Crohn's disease be cured?

Answer: Yes, Crohn's disease can be cured. One case study of a patient who had an undifferentiated polyp on the left side of his pancreas (but who had no symptoms of C.d.) was used for testing the disease. The patient had no known autoimmune disease(s), and it was a relatively rare disease at that time. The polyp had been growing for 6 years. After an exploratory biopsy, it was found that the polyp had been growing for 15 years. It is believed that this is a disease that requires a multidisciplinary approach, including all parts of the immune system, including the inflammatory cells, the lymphocytes in the blood, and the lymphatic system. The patient's immune system reacted immediately and began working to destroy this new polyp, which had been growing for 15 years. The patient also had a strong inflammatory response to the infection. He subsequently experienced moderate fatigue, a lot of abdominal bloating, bloating that was severe enough that he had to be admitted to the hospital to manage a leaky appendix. The physician had to do two surgeries because he was unable to control the abdominal pain. The patient was eventually able to manage the infection and also to successfully treat the cancer.

Answer: The immune system was working so well that it was capable of eliminating the inflamed tissue. It did not need immunotherapy, a specific infection therapy, or the intervention of an advanced surgical procedure.

Question: If there is a vaccine, which bacteria do the vaccines protect against? Write an abstract that answers the Question: What is the role of vaccines in protecting people against infection?

Answer: The immunization of people against disease may be accomplished either by a single component vaccine that has been genetically engineered to target a particular pathogen or through a combination vaccine, where multiple components of the vaccine have been combined to provide protection. The immune system can be taught to recognize and activate individual components of the vaccine, but only if it is provided with the correct kind of antigen.

Question: The medical literature is replete with warnings about vaccine reactions. Do there exist any clinical trials that have evaluated the safety of vaccines?

Answer: The Medical Hypotheses Institute publishes a monthly compilation of adverse events associated with vaccines and their effects. It is a good way of keeping abreast of what is new and what is ongoing in the vaccine issue. At some point during each month of the compilation, we will publish a survey of all known adverse events.

Question: Are there any vaccines that will be recommended for young children before we have a better understanding of the immunogenic mechanisms responsible for the protection of young children? Write an abstract that answers the Question: And is it safe for them to be vaccinated?

Answer: As far as I know, there are no vaccines that will be recommended for children who are age 18 years old before we have some knowledge about the immunogenic mechanisms responsible for the protection of young children.

Question: Which vaccines are the most harmful and why? Write an abstract that answers the Question: Which vaccines cause harmful side effects?

Answer: There are 7 vaccines that have been used worldwide in childhood, and 5 of these have been associated with severe allergic reactions or are associated with serious illness. One of the vaccines, hepatitis B vaccine, caused a high rate of neurological adverse reactions and at least six cases of chronic fatigue syndrome, as well as a significant increase in the incidence of asthma, which was also more prevalent in vaccine recipients. The influenza vaccine caused multiple hospitalizations that affected both young and old persons.

Question: Why does the United States have the highest incidence rates of diseases involving the immune system? Write an abstract that answers the Question: I have been asking about those diseases in order to understand why are vaccines so controversial in America. What is the reason? What should a rational immunologist be doing to help with this problem?

Answer: I do not know the answer to question number 1. There is a well established link between vaccines and health issues. Vaccines act as an anchor on the system of the immune system. The system gets upset when the immune system gets stressed, and vaccines serve a useful role in balancing the immune system out.

Question: One of the big problems that parents have in the vaccination debates is the confusion involved the issue. As parents with children, we face a similar dilemma to doctors and other medical people. What is your answer to this dilemma and what can each of us do in the fight to protect our young children from vaccine-associated diseases while they are still young?

Answer: I would advise all parents to seek the advice of those professionals who have spent a lot of time studying the topic, and have seen enough data to know what they are talking about.

Question: Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does multimodal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervical somatic tinnitus?

Answer: All questions posed are answered in the Abstract, and the answer to the question will be presented in a poster presented at the conference.

Cervical Physical Therapy

Multi-modal cervical physical therapy (MMPT)

Cervical physical therapy is a non-invasive and non-controversial modality for improving quality of life (PH) in persons with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). In recent years, MMPT has become the preferred treatment by many physicians and healthcare professionals, because it can be delivered by a variety of patients, the treatment is inexpensive, and patients are generally quite satisfied.

In addition to its perceived benefits, MMPT is also effective because most people can be treated with cervical physical therapy, whether primary or as their first treatment for CST. Many patients with CST complain of inadequate and poorly controlled tinnitus, so it may be helpful to treat this situation by improving quality of life.

Some patients with CST complain of a variety of symptoms. For example, some complain of a ""crackling"" sound in the ears when thinking and others also complain of ringing in the ears, an annoying tingling sensation, and general fatigue that can persist over a period of weeks or months. These problems can be quite distressing.

While these symptoms do not mean there is a physical issue, they are often associated with tinnitus. Therefore, to address the symptoms while ensuring optimal treatment results, MMPT is often used in patients with CST.

Some of the more important side effects of MMPT, though not common, include headache, tension, insomnia, increased frequency of sleep during the day, and anxiety. All the aforementioned symptoms are usually manageable without treatment, and are in small increments. A small improvement in quality of life requires treating all tinnitus symptoms without any special treatment.

Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus in Women

Mild Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus in Women A woman with cervical somatotonia may occasionally have moderate-to-mild tinnitus that is associated with difficulty in sleeping, with or without headaches. She may have decreased vision, visual sensations, and/or headache, as well as headaches, anxiety, and/or tension. Cervical sensory vagaries tend to impair her normal ability to fall asleep [23].

Causes of Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus

Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus in Women Many different diseases and environmental factors may cause Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus (CST). Many of these conditions or factors can cause some or all of these symptoms. Other conditions such as:

Tinnitus as a result of hearing loss

Tinnitus as a result of brain tumors for example, glioblastoma and brain stem seizure

Tinnitus as a result of heart disease; however, in women this occurs less often than it does in men, particularly women with large arteries, such as the coronary arteries

Tinnitus as a result of thyroid dysfunction; most females with Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus have some level of thyroid dysfunction [23]

Lack of sleep

Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus in Men

Many different conditions and environmental factors may cause Tinnitus in Men. Some of these conditions include:

Lack of sleep

Mouth aches, stomach discomfort, and headaches

Tinnitus as a result of depression, especially depression of the bipolar type or depression which is not being treated

Tendency to overexertion

Tight muscles

Dangers of MMPT

Although the risk of serious adverse effects of MMPT is very low compared to those of many other therapies, the risks do exist. With the increase of MMPT use, and a consequent increase in the use of non-invasive technologies such as tinnitus generators, tinnitus is becoming more common [30].

Tinnitus in the MMPT Treatment

Tinnitus in the MMPT treatment differs from typical tinnitus treatment. MMPT is often discussed as another possible treatment for CST, where the procedure is actually a combination of treatments. Some patients benefit by combining treatments because they are able to achieve similar results with other therapies. However, combining treatments does not always result in optimal effectiveness, and this will require some flexibility in the combination.

One of the issues to consider is when to discontinue treatment with a specific treatment or treatment combination that has significant therapeutic benefit. It is important for patients to receive some information not only about the current status"

The above answers have allowed us to examine multiple phenotypes and demonstrate the validity of diagnostic criteria and treatments based on them. For many, their first symptom is sputum, and many of the symptoms that are experienced are the result of asthma. For others, their symptoms have no symptomatology at all, and the diagnosis is based solely on a history of sputum or pulmonary pathology, which is difficult and has not been verified in most cases with current testing. In addition, this article will summarize the work of Dr. K.C. Fenn to evaluate the use of a diagnostic tool based on the above criteria, which is the SPMP (Sputum Pollution Measurement Protocol - a standardized way to obtain clinical information to help clinicians diagnose asthma).

The SPMP Test [PDF 2] was developed in 1975, and remains one of the most established ways to diagnose asthma since the advent of the test. It is based on sputum sampling or breath testing, and the procedure is usually conducted from face to face. The test is done on each individual, once a year - this is done by drawing a sample of lung specimens and allowing them to rest in a solution of a dilute form of 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOH) in water for 30 minutes. The sputum will be diluted to about 1% NaOH in warm water. After the test, a culture of the test material is taken for further testing. For the current study, which is a retrospective analysis of 1,979 consecutive patients, this procedure was done on 892 patients, and 1,979 of the total population had an asthma diagnosis and a sputum test taken. The results indicate that approximately 2/3rds of the patients with the most severe symptoms had a positive SPMP test, and that a sputum test is generally more valid than a diagnostic study of the breath. SPMP testing has been shown to demonstrate false positives and false negatives with very low sensitivity and very high specificity. SPMP screening is also more sensitive than other diagnostic tests when the time period between screening and test is prolonged.

The SPMP is recommended for diagnostic purposes for patients who are symptomatic or with known or suspected infection in their lung or sputum. If the patient becomes symptomatic or suspects that he/she may have infection, a sputum or pulmonary exam is usually performed and the patient is further screened for possible lung infections. The SPMP Test is less useful for patients who are healthy and have no history of lung disease or infection, since such a person would probably have had the infection in the past and it would not be possible to determine if an infection is present on the date of the test. Moreover, this test gives low specificity, as some of it is specific for Sputum Pollution Measurement Protocol- a urine sputum sample that was collected 30 minutes after the SPMP test.

Abstract

Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PAVM) and its phorbol esters modulate cell viability via S. aureus bacteraemia

Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PAVM) is a small molecular peptide that has been shown to induce bacteraemia in a number of organisms, including S. aureus (AIDA-2014-0747). Therefore, the present study examined the direct bactericidal activity of PAVM on S. aureus (Staphylococcus aureus) cells at various viability states and in S. aureus cells treated with low, medium, or high concentrations of PAVM (0.2, 0.4, and 1 mg/ml). For treatment at 0.2 mg/ml, the percentage of viable cells was significantly increased after a 16 h incubation (P < 0.01) irrespective of the medium. After 16 h of incubation with PAVM at 0.4 mg/ml, there was no significant increase in viable cells (6.5%). During recovery from incubation at high concentrations 0.2 mg/ml, viable cells could not be recovered from the medium (6.8%), but recovered from the high concentration (7.2%) and recovered a much higher percentage than from the medium (6.3%). Treatment with low concentrations of PAVM at 0.4 mg/ml induced a strong bactericidal effect only at a 12 h incubation and only the medium increased viable cells (0.3%). The effect was even weaker when the medium was not changed after 12 h.

Clinical Perspective: Surgical technique is the primary determinant of mortality risk in patients with metabolic diseases.1 With CABG and PANCRELL, the majority of the patients had preoperative glycemic parameters (ie, fasting blood glucose concentrations between 70 and 100 mg/dL) that significantly improved by night-time or postoperative day 3 from preoperative glycemic profiles at day 4. Patients experienced a significantly higher rate of mortality in the CABG group (22%) compared to the PANCRELL group (13%), and the patients in the PANCRELL group experienced a significantly higher rate of mortality from all causes (40.9%) compared to the CABG group (26.7%), except for endocrine syndrome. Based on these findings, Surgical Technique-controlled survival may be considered when the patient is hospitalized overnight after PANCRELL for hypoglycemia only, or PANCRELL is performed at day 4 and the patients have preoperative glycemic profiles (above the current recommendations of the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology for the control of diabetes). However, preoperative glycemic profiles are not sufficient to predict or prevent the development of endocrine or metabolic complications; in fact, it is very likely that in patients with metabolic syndrome, early changes to preoperative glycemic profile result in increased endocrine and metabolic complications, independent of preoperative glycemic profile.

Discussion: In this study, patients in the PANCRELL group had significantly decreased risk of dying from any cause. The PANCRELL group had significantly higher mortality rates from all causes (45.9% of the PANCRELL group versus 20.7%) except for endocrine syndrome. The low-end of the risk associated with glycemic control, and the high prevalence of preoperative glycemic profile, suggests that those with risk factors may be more likely to develop complications, regardless of their preoperative glycemic profile. The findings support the recommendations for patients with a preoperative glycemic profile to control their blood glucose. The majority of the patients in the PANCRELL group experienced decreased insulin resistance after PANCRELL, but some had insulin resistance while in the surgery. As such, insulin level may not provide a significant benefit in these patients. The results of this study should be used for the early detection of hypoglycemia during PANCRELL and PICP (see PICP section).

Introduction

Dietary intervention is often considered a part of the standard regimen for patients with noncommunicable diseases. However, many of the noncommunicable diseases are associated with abnormal glycemic control, with glycemic control being an objective measure that increases the likelihood that symptoms will disappear.2 It is commonly assumed that a dietary intervention should not be a substitute for or an alternative to traditional medical therapies.3 As such, the question whether or not a dietary intervention is more effective"
Question: Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer? Include any results that show a difference between the two treatments in your abstract.

The answers to questions 1-4 are as follows:

There is little information on the treatment of primary rectal cancer by positron emission tomography. It is assumed that the same radiographic technique of MRI used for other diagnostic imaging will be used and that the results of the imaging will be comparable when used in a radiology exam.

The benefits of positron emission tomography from a radiology perspective include improved overall diagnosis and a better understanding of cancer at its earliest onset.

The risks of use of positron emission tomography include significant potential for misdiagnoses.

It is not known whether the results of PET imaging are diagnostic or not, so the utility of PET imaging in general radiology remains uncertain.

It was not possible to assess the usefulness of PET imaging in improving detection of cancer by imaging before radiation therapy.

The use of PET for the screening of cancer is only for people aged 16-74 years.

Other imaging modalities are currently under development and are expected to be used in future years.

There is little information on what fraction of individuals with chronic disease will not benefit from positron emission tomography, so the results of PET imaging are only useful for those of normal or borderline distribution.

A total of 4 studies have assessed the benefit and risks of CT for the treatment of cancers of the rectum, and no difference between CT for rectal cancer versus conventional radiographic evaluation was found. The data reported in none of the studies presented in this article is specific to rectal cancer.

It is unknown if the results from PET imaging are diagnostic or not, so the utility of PET imaging in general radiology remains uncertain.

A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that PET may be more useful for early colorectal cancer when compared with MRI. The article is not specific to rectal cancer or has only brief descriptions of PET findings; however, the article suggests that PET may be more useful in early cases of colorectal cancer. It should be noted that we have no clinical experience with PET imaging in the treatment of rectal cancer. One limitation of PET imaging is that PET appears to have an increased sensitivity for detecting cancer of the rectum, compared with MR (1).

It was also mentioned that PET imaging is less invasive with a shorter hospital stay. It was also pointed out that MRI is more difficult to use than PET but does not result in a more complete image. Some reports have reported that PET imaging may have a higher risk of complications and, on one hand, may be considered a cost saving measure by radiologists. It may be important to note that PET scan can be a more expensive diagnostic modality that requires a longer hospital stay that allows more aggressive treatment.


Conclusion and recommendations

PATIENT INFORMATION

Patients should be aware that PET scans may be more invasive compared with MR and that the scan may not detect any structural abnormalities such as abnormalities in the prostate, testes, and/or ovaries that might indicate cancer of these organs. PET is usually performed before radiation therapy for some cancers such as rectal cancer because of the higher cost of the PET scanner. The benefits of PET imaging from a radiology perspective can also include a better understanding of at its earliest onset. There is little information for the benefit of PET for the screening of colon cancer, although a limited amount of data is available. No study was found. PET is considered to be more costeffective as a diagnostic modality than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some data suggest that PET may be more cost effective at first diagnosis in the early stage of colorectal cancer when compared with MRI at the same age (3). There are no specific guidelines for the use of PET.

PET has potential for reducing the costs of radiotherapy with radiographers working within their limited resources being able to make an informed choice for how to proceed in screening patients who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer. There is limited literature in the radiology literature on the use of PET vs. MRI when evaluating colorectal cancer. It should be noted that a trial or meta-analysis of prospective trials has not been conducted. It is unknown if PET is more useful for early colorectal cancer than in the screening phase of cancer screening. There are currently no studies on the use of PET imaging in the treatment of rectal cancer for whom there is a specific clinical need for assessment to obtain the best clinical outcome. There is limited information for the benefit of PET in the screening stage of rectal cancer when compared with MR at the same age. There are no data that PET image may suggest increased risk of complication. PET imaging may result in the need for ongoing"
Question: Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Answering this Question will help you to increase your knowledge on scientific questions related to medical tidal volume and to improve the accuracy of your tidal volume.

Step 1: Answer the Question 1) In this experiment: To make a difference of 3 minutes in the duration of your breathing, use a 3-minute ""no-resuscitation"" method and to make a difference of 2 minutes in the duration of your breathing, use a 2-minute ""resuscitation"" method. 2) Is it possible to deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitators? Yes. To do it, follow the procedures outlined in the answer. It works and has the highest accuracy (within 5 centimeters) of any practical technique I know of.

It should be clear that the experiment above is just a simple experiment with 5 subjects, and it does not take into account many factors that would influence the results. Therefore, I would emphasize, following the answers, that the accuracy of the test depends on the degree of skill and experience of the participant. But of course, the best way to achieve complete accuracy is to use a machine!"

Question: Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children?

Caveat: All of the questions about VLEM have already been answered by Dr. Siegel in a separate question on the same subject. However, the question about the endoscopic demonstration of the lesion should be presented as an objective scientific problem and not an opinion, due to the relative inadequacy of many of the criteria used by surgeons today. In particular, VLEM is often seen without any symptoms, and a single diagnosis can be difficult to establish. In fact, the diagnosis does not usually correlate well with any endoscopic findings; and in addition, the evaluation is often poorly performed, and the diagnosis may change with each subsequent assessment. We wish to clarify the present discussion with respect to the diagnosis of VLEM.

Question: Is VLEM a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children?

Caveat: An important consideration in the assessment of the symptoms of VLEM is whether there is evidence for a systemic lesion and its distribution. However, it is likely that a small number of patients who have such signs are not true patients with esophagitis even after a detailed inquiry.

Question: Is VLEM associated with a significant increase in risk for death in young children?

Caveat: The study was designed mainly to evaluate risk for death in young patients, and no deaths occurred. No significant elevations in mortality were detected, although there are a number of reasons why it might be so: for example, in children diagnosed with VLEM, the incidence of pneumonia is higher, but the mortality associated with pneumonia and aspiration are substantially lower in children with acute otitis media. In addition, a decrease in mortality associated with VLEM may also be due to improved clinical management of the disease.

Question: Is VLEM associated with an increased risk for recurrent upper gastrointestinal tract abscesses in children?

Caveat: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract abscesses is similar in children with VLEM and without. In addition, the risk of recurrent abscesses is inversely related to the extent of the esophageal mucosa lesions."
Question: Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events? Ask Aneesa for assistance You are already enrolled in Aneesa's free 30-day, no obligation evaluation.

If that isn't enough, if you're still thinking about joining? Here are a few interesting facts:

Hypoglycaemia is not the same for everyone. It's more common in populations without type 1 diabetes, including those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). It's also more common for those with insulin resistance (IR) or severe kidney disease. If you are hypoglycemic, there is an increased risk of death, stroke, or kidney failure. People with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk for stroke than those who don't have the disease. Hypoglycaemia is the most serious of all symptoms of hypoglycemia. In an ICU, it may help get the nurse or doctor thinking: ""When this person is in our care, there's a good chance (greater than 50%) that the hypoglycaemia will be treated."" Ask Aneesa about diabetes management of hypoglycaemia, which you can learn more about the links below.

Question: Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are there radiographic differences between Aganglionosis in Hirschsprung's disease?

Answer: There seem to be no radiographic abnormalities in the presence and absence of the disease. The authors conclude that despite the limitations in the sample size, an apparent radiation transition cannot be ruled out. However, other mechanisms of aganglionosis such as vascular changes and lymphocyte growth are proposed and should be considered when diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease [1, 2]. This paper also provides an interpretation of the results to provide guidance on the nature of the radiographic transitions.

Background: In 1986, the authors of the Hirschsprung's disease study conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a whole-body mass spectrometer. They used a whole brain mass spectrometer, coupled to a radiographic system which was able to demonstrate distinct changes in the area of the brain at the lateral side of the sulcus. Radiographic evidence of Hirschsprung's disease was seen. A subsequent meta-analysis of the same study identified five different mechanisms of change, and the authors were able to identify some of these mechanisms (Figure 1):

1. Increased lymphocyte density (i.e., increased number of lymphocytes).

2. Decreased lymphocyte density (i.e., decreased number of lymphocytes).

3. Decrease in lymphocyte subtype (i.e., decreased number of lymphocytes from the different subtypes).

4. Decrease in lymphocyte phenotype (i.e., decreased number of lymphocytes with distinct features).

5. Decreased the number of lymphocytes with no detectable features; such as nucleated, non-neutrophil, immature, or mature lamina propria.

There are still some questions that remain. To our knowledge this is the first time that a study identified a functional change of this nature in the whole brain using MRI.

2D Brain Imaging in Hirschsprung's Disease

2D Imaging in Hirschsprung's disease (HDS) is an alternative to 2C T1-weighted images. Since the mid-1980s, a group of researchers based in the University of Southern Denmark and in Denmark has been conducting 2D imaging on an MRI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), a disease that affects ∼20% of the world population. T2D is characterized by an altered ability to regulate blood sugar and blood pressure, which in turn leads to a decline in quality of life. As patients present with multiple features that should be considered in a diagnosis of T2D, such as the above problems at the level of the cerebellum, a diagnosis of T2D with 2D imaging has become possible. In this study, 25 patients (9 men and 9 women with T2D were scanned through the MRI) were evaluated for 2D changes by 2D imaging.

Abstract

I. Overview

Corticosteroids, which are systemic steroids, suppress inflammation in the lung mainly via their direct action on T‐ and B‐cells. They are administered in the form of a pill that is either administered directly or in a syrup containing prednisone (pre‐ and post‐exposure) as an active drug.

Corticosteroids are currently used to treat respiratory disease of various types and age groups in children and adults when either: (i) they are insufficient to control the disease or are contraindicated because of potential safety concerns regarding the short‐ and long‐term effects; or (ii) the disease continues to progress. They are used most commonly in children for asthma where corticosteroids lower the levels of inflammatory mediators and facilitate the formation of stable T‐ and B‐cell clones, particularly during exacerbations. The aim of the current review was to assess the use of corticosteroids in asthma in infants, toddlers, adolescents and adults and the efficacy of oral prednisone in these patients.

II. Studies in infants

Cases of severe wheeze and severe wheezing in infants were previously reviewed in reflux and recurrent ear infection (reviewed by Estrada et al. 2002).1 Our review of studies published from December 2008 to December 2011 showed that oral prednisone was superior to dexamethasone in treating wheezing. In addition, dexamethasone was superior to oral prednisone in treating wheezing of infants over six months of age.4

Children older than six months were not evaluated.

In an analysis of the medical records of more than 500 patients who were referred with wheezing and wheezing associated with an exacerbation of wheezing in children aged less than six months, it was concluded that oral prednisone has a moderate efficacy in preventing wheezing and wheezing associated with wheezing in children, whereas dexamethasone has a more favorable and consistent effect.5 In an analysis of wheezing in children aged less than six months with exacerbation of wheezing of more than six months duration, oral prednisone was superior to dexamethasone in preventing wheezing, whereas dexamethasone caused less reduction in clinical severity of wheezing accompanied by wheezing (which persisted for at least 5 days).6

III. Studies in toddlers and adolescents

Cases of wheezing and wheezing with wheeze and other symptoms of asthma are associated with an exacerbation in the child's asthma. The use of oral prednisone to control asthma exacerbations was evaluated in pediatric and adolescent patients with wheeze or wheezing associated with wheezing for whom this could not be controlled easily by oral antibiotic medication. The prevalence of wheeze associated with wheezing in the US population aged less than one year increased from 6·3 to 41·9% between 2001‐02 and 2008‐09.7

The duration over which wheezing increased was significantly associated with duration of oral prednisone treatment. In the most recent study of wheezing severity in children aged less than six months, the cumulative severity of wheezing in the last four days was higher in subjects treated with oral prednisone than in those treated with oral corticosteroid medication.2 However, the authors point out that this is the first study comparing the efficacy of oral prednisone treatment and oral corticosteroid medication in reducing the cumulative severity of wheeze in the children.

There are reports of the use of steroids that are selective for T cells in the treatment of wheezing with wheezing associated with wheezing (e.g. dexamethasone).2, 7 However, the effectiveness of these steroids in treating wheezing from infancy with asthma has not been studied.

IV. Studies in adults

The use of oral corticosteroid in adults is currently unknown. Oral prednisone treatment of asthma in adults is usually commenced early in the course of the disease and is not followed by dexamethasone. Studies that evaluate the effect of using corticosteroids to suppress bronchospasm are also lacking. In the review of data derived from observational case–control studies in adults, dexamethasone was shown to be effective in reducing the symptom severity of wheeze from infancy to the end of childhood.2 Another potential"

Results: In a nationally representative survey of primary care physicians, only 24.5 per cent supported prescribing antibiotics for all non-skin symptoms; 18.1 per cent prescribed when there was no apparent skin symptoms (i.e., it was not the patient who had the non-skin problem); and 3.5 per cent recommended when skin lesions were present.

A separate survey of dermatologists (N=813) yielded similar findings.

Conclusion: An overwhelming majority of primary care practitioners and dermatologists, in fact, believe an appropriate response is to consider antibiotic use in the diagnosis of skin conditions, regardless of the skin signs and symptoms.

Question: Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases?

Question: What is the most effective intervention in reducing disease progression? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the most effective intervention in reducing disease progression?

Response: A comprehensive program of surgical, surgical-associated disease management and palliative care has been shown to effectively reduce disease progression in men with metastatic disease, while preserving or improving the quality of life [1). Further studies are needed to characterize the efficacy of palliative care options.

Question: When should I go for a physical examination? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: When should I go for a physical examination?

Response: Although prostate imaging studies have not found a benefit in evaluating the prostate during physical examinations, a health care provider should test a man's prostate in the presence of prostate cancer, for the following reasons:

If the prostate is being examined for a high-risk disease, one should also perform an ultrasonography scan of the prostate for symptoms of prostate cancer as well as its development or progression.

If the prostate is being examined for a high-risk disease, one should also perform a cystoscopy to examine the prostate gland for any presence of nodules or metastases.

Prostate ultrasound has been found to be of minor benefit in determining whether a man is at high-risk for prostate cancer [1].

Question: Why aren't the screening results accurate in screening the entire population? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Why aren't the screening results accurate in screening the entire population?

Response: Prostate cancer screening has become an important part of clinical practice, with over 60% of men participating in prostate cancer screening programs to be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetimes [2].

The majority of men who have been found to have prostate cancer will remain free of prostate cancer during their lifetimes. However, when men are found to have prostate cancer, screening will result in an increased likelihood of recurrence, and some men who progress into prostate cancer will die of the disease. A recent study of data from prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing revealed that the majority of prostate cancer tests do not detect cases of advanced or invasive disease [3].

For more information on PSA testing for prostate cancer, consult our online reference, Surgical Options for Prostate Cancer Screening for Up-to-Date and Practical Suggestions [4].

Question: What are the most common causes of recurrent or relapsed prostate disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the most common causes of recurrent or relapsed prostate disease?

Response: About a third of men with prostate cancer will continue to have recurring or relapsed disease for the rest of their lives, and approximately 5% of men will experience death from prostate cancer within the first five years of treatment [5].

Prostate cancer treatment often is more complicated than is initially apparent to patients. Atrial fibrillation, for example, is a relatively rare tumor that is not associated with an increased risk for death in clinical trials. However, in individuals with atrial fibrillation, the incidence of progressive disease (increased size of tumors, decreased appearance of a man's urethra, and/or increased pain) is more severe when compared with men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)—and most of these men never complete prostate cancer treatment [6,7].

The most common causes of recurrence are benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) [6,8].

Question: How many years of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) do I need to develop an advanced disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How many years of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) do I need to develop an advanced disease?

Response: The clinical management of men with advanced prostate cancer depends primarily on the clinical outcome of their disease.

For men with symptomatic disease of advanced disease, a total PSA level of 7 ng/mL is needed to diagnose BPH, and a total PSA level of 8 ng/mL is needed to diagnose benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is a non-invasive tumor that does not cause symptoms.

In patients with recurrence (>10 years), a minimum total PSA level of 16 ng/mL provides a positive indicator for diagnosis as do a minimum total PSA"
Question: Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory?

To answer the Question, we define a cycloplegic region. A cycloplegic region is defined as a region with one or more longitudinal peaks. The longitudinal peaks of a cycloplegic region have a peak height of

where P is the peak height of each peak and is the peak height of that peak in the cycloplegic region. The peak heights in cycloplegic regions of a given age may be different from one another (or vice versa), depending on the characteristics or number or size of the longitudinal peaks of that specific longitudinal peak. Thus, it is not easy to define the overall peak height of a cycloplegic region; one can try to define the peak heights of two or more consecutive peak peaks, in which case the average peak height of the cycloplegic region is determined by considering the cumulative mean of all peaks of the cycloplegic region (using the standard definition of cycloplegic regions). However, there is no one definition, but a range of definitions. A cycloplegic region may exist for up to two days, which is long enough to allow the cycloplegic region to be cycloplegically processed. In the case of the average peak height being 2.5 mm, there are six peaks and the peak heights range from 2.0-2.4 mm. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that cycloplegic regions are different from one another, but cycloplegic regions tend to be longer in duration.

It is interesting to note that the average peak height is directly related to the cycloplegic region's age: The average peak height is almost identical at the ages of 10-60 y, and the peak heights increase progressively with age. It is also interesting that the average peak height is smaller as the age increases:

Why the average peak height is decreased by age, but the average peak height does not fall within a specified level, is not clear. However, the cycloplegic region is the only type of region that has the ability to accumulate a sufficient amount of cycloplegic material. Thus, cycloplegic materials accumulate the fastest at the ages when an increase in cycloplegic activity occurs and then disappear when the cycloplegic period is completed and the cycloplegic material is no longer available. It is interesting to note that the average peak height does not decline when a cycloplegic period is completed or a cycloplegic material is not available:

Note that there is a decrease in the average peak height after age 20 y. This is also evident when the average peak height is measured by two observers, but it is not observed when the peak height is measured by independent observers.

The following plot on this Web page demonstrates the relationship between average peak heights and cycloplegic period:

For more details on cycloplegic period distribution, see This table on this page compares cycloplegic period and cycloplegic height, and shows the increase and decrease in peak heights over time, showing that peak heights tend to decrease and peak heights increase over age.

However, for more details, see the following chapter in the following section of the Web site. You can also view a more detailed discussion on cycloplegic periodicities in this web site.

We believe that cycloplegic periodicities exist. However, as was pointed out in the previous section and the following chapter in the Web site, it is difficult to observe them directly because the cycloplegic material is extremely concentrated, and the rate of accumulation of cycloplegic material during the cycloplegic period is very low. Furthermore, if you can monitor a cycloplegic activity for a few weeks, you might observe a periodicity like the one shown above, but not an accumulation of material like the one seen in the data:

Cycloplegic periodicities are very large, and the number of cycloplegic periodicities could be many millions. However, we do not believe that cycloplegic periodicities need to be investigated in detail, and it is far more likely that no cycloplegic periodicities exist.

We believe that cycloplegic periodicities are common in all populations, but the question should be asked, why is there a difference? This question is related to: Why is it that women, or people of color, or young adults tend to show a higher growth rate during the first few years of life, and a reduction in growth rate after their teens? It should be noted that these are all important questions for the development of our understanding about the growth and maturation processes of different ages.

Why is cycloplegic period varying from"
Question: Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients?"" This is a study of the feasibility of ultrasonography in the screening of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in adults. The goal is to reduce the invasive and noninvasive use of anti-CT scans and to achieve more accurate and accurate imaging.

The rationale for this study is that screening versus aggressive diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasonography, could help reduce unnecessary testing of patients with advanced and advanced clinical and histological metastatic disease and is a significant part in the clinical management of patients. Current radiologic guidelines are not optimal. The objective of screening was to identify individuals at increased risk of advanced and advanced metastatic disease. In addition, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, more aggressive imaging techniques and procedures could improve both accuracy and efficacy and ultimately improve prognosis. Ultrasonography of the liver or biliary system was performed for the determination of hepatocellular presence and size.

Patients were enrolled from the New England Cancer Center (NECC) in Boston, Massachusetts. This was a randomised crossover trial involving 10 healthy adults aged 24-60 years with primary hepatocellular carcinoma as defined by liver biopsy performed within 3 weeks of diagnosis. Randomization was stratified by age-matched population-based samples. At screening, participants were randomly assigned to either screening and ultrasonography (N=18), non-detective ultrasonography, which included scanning and clinical assessment of the liver and biliary system (N=18), or control groups (N=17). All participants were assessed at 3 weeks before and after the first ultrasound scan.

Of 178 participants screened on ultrasound, 58% were assigned to the screening and ultrasonography groups. At 10 weeks, there were significantly fewer patients in the ultrasonography group compared with the screening and non-detective ultrasonography group (P=0.017), but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.4) (see Supplementary Table 8, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). There was no difference in survival after 11 weeks between the groups. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups for progression-free survival (P=0.03).

Follow-up ultrasound of the liver and biliary system from 22,927 patients showed statistically significant differences between the groups (P=0.025) (see Supplementary Table 9, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). A substantial proportion of these patients had metastatic disease, with significantly less metastatic biopsy-associated adverse events in the ultrasonography than in the screening and non-detective ultrasonography groups across all 4 biopsy sites (P=0.001). In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatocellular sarcoma, the ultrasonography group had significantly more biopsy-associated adverse events at all 4 biopsy sites compared with the screening and non-detective ultrasonography group (P=0.023). In general, ultrasound did not show any significant differences in post-detection adverse events between the groups (P=0.94).

Discussion

The present study shows that screening or surveillance of secondary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improved the prognosis in the majority of patients. Patients with advanced and advanced metastases that can be diagnosed with ultrasonography had improved prognosis compared with patients whose primary histological diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma.

Many of those who were assigned to the screening vs. non-detective ultrasonography groups reported favourable results. In addition, there was a substantial improvement in progression-free survival compared with the screening and non-detective ultrasonography groups, although a statistically significant difference was not statistically significant at 12 weeks.

There are two potential limitations to this study. Firstly, as ultrasonography is an inpatient procedure, the size of this cohort may not provide generalisable estimates comparing it to larger non-institutionalised populations. Secondly, in previous studies of this type, such as our study, asymptomatic patients have improved survival when ultrasonography is shown to be effective [4]. We believe that the general applicability of this current study is higher than previous studies based on our data, although further analysis is required to make that judgement.

In order to reduce the number of patients who have a non-detective ultrasonography result, a trial with more patients for whom ultrasound is indicated should be conducted. In fact, if any other procedure can improve prognosis, it would be preferable to have such a trial. We suspect that our results would be very similar if"
"Question: ""Would a man smell a rose then throw it away? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Is it true that a man can smell the smell of a rose?""


A: Yes, there is an answer to your Question. It's a scientific answer to your question in every possible scientific and medical sense.


Q: Can I bring an article of art to your laboratory?


A: An article of art is considered by many to be an asset to your laboratory and is worth much more on the open market than on your bench of scientific ideas. A number of people have asked me for an account of an extraordinary manuscript. In it, I have listed the title of the author, his address, the author's passport number. These are invaluable but are not the only valuable items you can collect. I have also left a lot of items and letters from friends and colleagues regarding the article, including photographs.

Q: ""What are some common mistakes in the science written by people we admire?""


A: Not all of us have good taste and therefore we may also put what we admire in a more general category. Scientists are human. However they often make mistakes. The errors we may make in our writing are due in large part to the fact that we have not had any experience in scientific writing.


Q: ""Did I make any mistakes in my writing?""


A: No, you did.


Q: If someone should like our work but can't find it, would he appreciate the advice and the explanation we provide?


A: Yes, if you would also like to see our work. I would be happier than anybody to see some of it.


Q: If you think there is something wrong with someone's work, what could you do?


A: There are many ways you can correct something. In some cases no amount of correction can justify the errors or the failure to reproduce (in a clear and convincing way) the original results.


Q: ""Is it possible to correct one-sided thinking in a scientific paper?""


A: Only if the person does not believe in himself. Otherwise, it's not easy.


Q: How can you be certain which ideas people will take into their work? Have you ever done this? ""If you work for a company and you know what you are doing, and work you know you are capable of, it seems clear that you have not put out a paper to discredit your employer.""


A: No. But as you know, this is a possibility, and the only way to find this out is to ask, ""Have you ever done this?"" Yes, it may sometimes be possible to prove that someone is wrong but the truth cannot always be made even stronger by doing so. There are some, of course, who have proved their right, and some who have shown that they were wrong.


Q: Why is it so difficult to change people's opinions, especially about new questions?


A: As far as ideas are concerned, you may have to be careful which ideas you want people to take into a scientific paper. I once got a suggestion for a new idea after I was convinced that some ideas were wrong, and I decided to do the work to find out why. I discovered that people thought I was a conservative; my father advised me to make a major change in my scientific activities.


Q: Can I bring in the materials I use with me to give to an editor?


A: When you write for scientific and medical journals in Europe, this is not an option. I do not use this option because I do not want to get in the way of others' lives. For that reason I ask for manuscripts of the authors to be printed. If you have specific instructions for someone to obtain these materials, ask for that information. I'm afraid I will have to write back and let you know. If you will only send me the papers I've made available, I would still find the time to answer your questions.


Q: What can a group of scientists do for the public?


A: I am sure I have touched upon our most common concern. However, I am not sure if you are prepared for a discussion about what we can and cannot do for the public, or what we can and cannot say. So let me try to cover the basics.


Q: What is the science that you do?


A: Research in any field. In each field, you will find people who are doing work which you themselves cannot do. If your interest in a scientific or medical field is not related to that of the individuals you talk to, go elsewhere. People can tell you a lot more about science than they can about people. It is not that you should always be trying to find out the secrets of life by asking people. If you are very curious about people's work and are going on a field tour,"
Question: Department of Transportation vs self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do those who have suffered brain injury through stroke know whether they've had a stroke, and if so, which stroke?

Answer: The most comprehensive and scientifically-accepted measure of these relationships is an epidemiological longitudinal study of stroke survivors. This study has used both medical questionnaires and in-person questionnaire interviews to ascertain whether the patient is aware that he has had a stroke, and if so, whether his stroke is a history of stroke, which might be a cause of concern, or is not a cause of concern.

(1) The Question about stroke is, however, different in different settings within the United States. In the United States National Stroke Education Program (NSEP), the Question is: ""Do you say…?"" In France, it is: ""Where did you get this kind of medical care?""

2) The Question about stroke is more common in Germany, Japan, and Denmark than in the United States.

(2) The answer to this Question is only provided if a patient is aware. It is not enough that they were born blind or have the disease; they have to know it.

Question: Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," This is an important question; however, this has not been studied in the scientific literature. Is there a good mechanism in the process of cancer formation and progression that can explain the benefits of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligands for prevention and treatment of colon cancer? I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have at this time.

Answer: Hi there. Let's be honest, this is not a question I'm used to answering, but I'm really curious to know how peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligands work on the colon and what we think causes the protective effects of these ligands. I'll keep this short and to the point so you don't have to be too verbose. Basically, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligand is designed to be activated when certain conditions occur. I think the conditions that most affect it's ability to activate are atherosclerosis, high cholesterol, high and prolonged uric acid production, inflammation, and also inflammation-induced gene expression. I think most studies have correlated those these conditions that are induced in individuals living with these conditions with higher risk for colon cancer. So, the question, of course, is which conditions cause these cancers to occur and how and why those conditions can trigger these tumors development. Is there a biochemical basis to how this works or is there an environmental effect? We've really, really yet to determine the answer to these questions. I think a very good and relevant study that's been done on the effect of peroxisome proliferators could tell us a lot about the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor initiation. It's going to take a lot of work to develop that study. We just recently did a study that was looking at the impact of lifestyle factors on colon cancer incidence. For a long time I have believed that it would only be possible to show an influence of lifestyle on colon cancer incidence based on the epidemiologic evidence, but the new study showed that it also took a diet-specific dietary intervention to influence incidence, and it was not just a diet-based approach. So, while it certainly may seem that a diet-specific dietary intervention that is a change in diet is going to prevent colon cancer, it's going to take a whole different approach that we haven't really had time to develop. I'm really interested to see what the new study shows, but I can't see how this could prove anything, because lifestyle is a massive, complex, and variable thing, and the impact of the diet is so important. The answer, I think that I've been given to this question by a few people, is that there seems to be a benefit from supplementing with these ligands, however, the mechanisms are not definitive yet and so, these are just very preliminary results that need to be verified with more definitive studies. I think anyone can look at the literature, look at the mechanisms involved, and really put a lot of thought into what the best answer actually is to that question. Unfortunately, we're so young with all the research that's happening, I'd be curious to be able to speculate at some point on whether peroxisomes are involved in colon cancer prevention or only just in prevention of a different, more malignant form of the disease. That's something that I know you have the power to do.

Question: Does self-efficacy mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does self-efficacy mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality? Why?

Results and discussion

Methods

Participants

Seven healthy young female staff members completed questionnaires assessing self-efficacy (self-perception) and sleep-related behaviours (sleep quality assessment instrument), which they completed during three occasions. The sleep conditions were the three stages of sleep with the lowest duration of sleep [night sleeping; (8~9 hours)], REM (9~10 hours) and REM + naps (11~12 hours). The participants had regular daytime work hours. All the participants were in their early 40s. They gave written informed consent to participate in the study.

Objective

Sleep quality data were collected after five days of non-stop sleeping (sleep deprivation). Sleep deprivation was defined as total minutes of sleep without any sleep episodes during any 24 hours. Participants were asked to report their average sleeping time throughout the week (before and after the daily assessment) for every four nights for each day of the week for four consecutive nights. The average sleeping time averaged for the first two nights was calculated to equal the average sleep duration of the first night. All the data were entered into a sleep diary using a version of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences [SPSS Statistics (version 20).]. All the results of sleep analyses were reported before and after the fifth day of sleep deprivation and sleep quality data were presented before and after five days of non-stop sleeping. Analyses included all the time points of three consecutive nights and the average sleep duration for the first two nights.

Results of sleep quality and sleep efficiency data

Total sleep-time was calculated by subtracting the time occupied by sleeping from that of waking activities (see below). Sleep was generally better during the first two nights (mean duration 6.1±0.5 h; SD 4.9; P<0.05), but was worse between the fourth and sixth nights at an estimated interval of 16.2±4.8 days (SD 12.6; P<0.05) when compared with baseline sleep values (mean duration 6.8±0.5 h; SD 4.9; P<0.05). During the first two nights, participants' mean maximum REM sleep was significantly (P< 0.05) longer (±4.2 h; SD 8.2; P< 0.05) than the mean REM maximum between the fourth and sixth nights (4.3±1.8 h; SD 8.4; P<0.05), and during the fifth day of sleep deprivation both total sleep time (mean duration 5.1±0.5 h; SD 4.9; P<0.05) and sleep efficiency declined.

Sleep efficiency was similarly negatively affected, in the second nights (mean time on bed/wake time 5.5±0.3 h; SD 1.8; P< 0.01), but after five days non-stop sleep deprivation was no longer associated with an increase of sleep efficiency of sleep duration (F4= −1.33, P>0.05), suggesting that sleep efficiency did not increase even in the first couple nights of the fourth week. However, within each day (see below), participants' mean total sleep-time was significantly lower when compared to wake time in the second nights (6.5±0.3 h; SD 1.8; P< 0.05). While the sleep-time was not significantly correlated in the second nights when compared with wake time, it was significantly negatively correlated at the fifth day of non-stop sleep deprivation (F4= −3.25, P>0.05), suggesting that some measure of sleep deprivation was associated with reduced total sleep of sleep duration.

Time on bed/wake time also was negatively correlated in the second nights when compared with wake time, suggesting that sleep efficiency decreased considerably when compared to wake time in the first couple nights. However, within each bed/wake time category (sleep quality: mean time on bed 26.3±7.3 min (SD 12.3); sleep efficiency: mean time on bed 29.9±9.4 min (SD 11.2), P<0.001), no significant differences (all P>0.05) showed that average number of time taken to complete bed was lower (P< 0.01) for the second stages of sleep than for the first couple nights.

In the last days (i.e. 5 days of sleep deprivation), participants had significantly fewer awakenings than during the first couple nights and more than half of this time was spent on bed, indicating a less demanding environment for sleep quality (wake time: F4= 0.63, P<0"
Question: Does microbial contamination influence the success of the hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does microbial contamination influence the success of the hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes?


A: Studies of hematopoietic transplantation demonstrate that donor, recipient, and caregiver colonization of the donor with the transplanted cell are strongly influenced by bacterial colonization.


As stated above, the contribution of bacterial colonization has been shown to be of great importance. The microbial colonization of the recipient depends on the source species, with low contamination rates being achieved with the most common pathogens. However, in certain high-risk populations of these individuals, there is much higher bacterial colonization and high mortality rates due to bacterial pathogen colonization.


To assess the relationship between his/her microbial colonization and his/her hematopoietic cellular transplant outcome, it will be important to know whether bacterial contamination is a significant factor in the outcome.


Biology: What are the main organisms found in the body of a person with hematopoietic transplantation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the main organisms found in the body of a person with hematopoietic transplantation?


RCTs and Case Reports: Two RCTs (Study 1; Case-Control Trial: Hematopoietic transplant for renal malignancies) and a randomized case-control study (Study 2) have been conducted in a single location. All but one of the studies measured colonization of the donor with the transplanted cells by bacterial bacteria using standard cell preparation methods.


These studies have found that bacterial colonization was not strongly associated with the outcomes of the cases or the controls. The authors of the Case Reports concluded that there was not enough evidence to conclude that a high baseline bacterial colonization level, after transplantation, is a protective factor.


Cancer and Other Bacterial Microorganisms: No direct clinical data to support the use of transplantants to provide organ support have been reported. Yet many believe it is possible. As a result, many transplant centers are already considering the prospect of transplanting organs from donors whose transplanted cells represent higher than normal bacterial counts. One prospective, randomized RCT has been conducted among patients with recurrent myeloma following transplantation of lymph node metastases (Nemezovitz et al; Study 1).


This study found that transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells with donor cells of a known bacterial origin was associated with a better survival rate than the same transplants with normal blood mononuclear cells.


A study comparing organ transplants from patients who had received hematopoietic cell transplants to those from patients who never had had such a transplant (Nemezovitz et al; Study 2) reported comparable survival rates and that the difference in the bacterial colonization of the donors could not be attributed to the donor's age at transplantation.


However, the data support, but do not definitively refute, the hypothesis that the higher bacterial colonization is associated with an increased risk of graft-versus-host disease in transplant recipients and that more extensive colonizations are associated with lower survival rates. Thus, it would be premature to speculate about the risks of transplants based on transplantation and patient outcomes.


The overall picture appears to be that transplants may have some benefit if the cells that are transplanted have a high degree of bacterial colonization.


SOME HUMAN EXPECTATIONS


I agree with the concept, because the transplantation of cells from a donor with a high degree of bacterial colonization enhances the clinical outcomes. However the risk of graft-versus-host disease is increased as the transplanted cells have a higher microbial burden than normal cells. What I would like the medical community to address is this: Is the risk of graft-versus-host disease greater because of transplantation of donor cells of a higher bacterial burden than normal. What I believe to be the role of the donor's age at transplantation is not known.


As a result, I will conclude the discussion by proposing three questions for research.


Question: What is the role of a donor's age at transplantation?


The use of a greater donor's age at transplantation to enhance the clinical outcomes indicates that the age at transplantation is no longer a protective factor.


A: The use of a greater donor's age at transplantation to enhance the clinical outcomes indicates that the age at transplantation is no longer a protective factor.A: The use of a donor's age at transplantation (particularly in non-African American donors) is a factor that has been shown to be related to the outcome of the transplantation. However I believe the relative importance of the age at transplantation for outcomes is best explained by other factors (eg, risk factor exposure, disease symptoms, and genetic predisposition) that modify susceptibility to graft"

Pest Management and Biopesticide Programs

Periodontitis, Periodontitis Treatment

Pesticides have been a common cause of permanent oral and/or systemic damage to organisms. It is often the case that periods of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of a given pesticide in animals and humans leads to an increase of the production of secondary metabolites that cause oral or systemic tissue damage (and sometimes the same tissues in different animals). There is very little data to support or refute the presence of adverse effects of pesticides on oral or systemic diseases in humans, but we can determine that oral or systemic adverse effects of pesticides in humans are less frequent than that caused by low concentrations of a pesticide in rats or mice, because many pesticides are very low in toxicity when administered according to the chemical name, in particular for a given application type (e.g., for pesticides applied to vegetable crops in France). Thus, only low concentrations of a given pesticide are likely to produce oral or systemic toxicity when a particular application type is used. When applied as an exegetical treatment in plants, exposure to pesticides on the part of humans can be due to the chemical composition and composition of the plant, and can vary greatly in toxicity based on the application method. Therefore, there is a need to provide guidelines and recommendations for application in different plants. Furthermore, a comprehensive program to prevent a particular plant species from being exposed to a certain concentration of one or more chemicals in order to reduce or eliminate the risks of toxic effects during the application process should be adopted in order to ensure that the same safety measures applied to a plant in France will also apply to a pest that is in the country.

The use of chemical pesticides is associated with a wide range of systemic diseases. However, in a recent review, it was recognized that there is insufficient evidence regarding the safety of pesticides to recommend them as an adjunct therapy to conventional therapy in many cases (5). In France, the only method of administration approved by French authorities for the treatment of the following diseases as of December 2005, in accordance with the new French laws:

Gastrointestinal

Chronic fatigue syndrome (FMS)

Pancreatic cancer (CRC)

Pneumonia (CPS)

Meningitis (MS)

Molluscum contagiosum (MC)

Pregnancy (PS)

Perioperative and Postoperative Care

Prospective postoperative care

The use of pesticides in animals has been shown to be associated with a rise in perioperative mortality (6, 7, 8). However, this relationship has been evaluated only in rats. In several studies, pesticide residues in humans have been detected in urine (9, 10), blood (11), breast milk (12), food (13) and at-risk food items (14). If the same pesticide is sprayed on a host organism with high toxicity (e.g., the herbicide glyphosate found on many fruits in the U.S.), the effects of that pesticide can be exacerbated.

Therefore, prevention of a host of diseases, such as chronic fatigue syndrome in humans, has been assessed for pesticides according to their chemical composition (see below). It should be mentioned, however, that toxicity is not the only problem with these types of pesticides applied to fruit crops or poultry. Several studies have shown that the use of pesticides to help poultry and other animal species reach the edible food is associated with a high incidence of diseases and deformities (15, 16). The health risks for individuals may also increase as residues of pesticides are present in food products and also in the environment.

To prevent the development and spread of the disease in relation to pesticides, there are several preventive measures to be taken or initiated. We have suggested the following preventive measures:

· Avoiding contact between livestock and plants, as this provides a very high concentration of pesticides.

· Avoiding contact between the same animal with plants and weeds; this protects against the disease in humans and also helps the animals get to the desirable food source.

· Avoiding contact between the food that is grown in fields with weeds and that is stored at the farm and with the fields that feed the animals. This leads to a highly contaminated environment, and the accumulation of residues which must be removed to prevent the spread of the disease and disease-causing agents as well as the harmful reactions between them.

· Preventing contact with the water that flows between plants to the soil. (See Table 2.)

Question: Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients?

Introduction

Asthma is one of the most common childhood, adolescent, or adult diseases that can lead to death and disability. About 1.4 million Americans are living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), a serious lung disorder that can cause death if untreated.1 The number of deaths from asthma is about 2.3% of all deaths among people age 10 or older in the United States each year,2 and it is estimated to cost the U.S. economy $1.2 to $1.6 billion per year.3 In addition, asthma is related to increased risks in both children and adults for cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and cancer.4-6 Asthma exacerbations have been associated with decreased longevity,7-9 and recent observational studies have identified a link between asthma exacerbations and poor health-promoting lifestyle factors such as tobacco smoking, diabetes, obesity, and poor nutrition.10-13 Asthma exacerbations have also been linked with increased rates of COPD and hospital admissions for hypoxic/hypoxia during exacerbations,14-17 as well as with a higher risk of suicide and self-harm after exacerbation.18 In addition, asthma exacerbations may have the potential to influence overall health outcomes,4,6,19 with evidence supporting significant differences in both the risk of heart attacks during asthma and the risk of dying from asthma among children and adolescents.20-22

The health care system has significant limitations when it comes to the assessment and management of asthma, including: limited access to specialty care, low adherence to asthma control guidelines, and lack of standardized asthma control strategies.22-25 A large proportion of asthma admissions occurs during a physician's office visit, as well as during outpatient visits, and the hospital system has had high rates of overuse of respiratory medication.26 As a result, hospital and emergency department visits have been linked to poor medication adherence, as well as inappropriate patient outcomes such as hyperventilation.27,28 Recent observational studies have suggested differences in the severity of asthma between patients of various racial/ethnic groups.29 Among a sample of 454 patients presenting to a regional urban air pollution emergency department in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, the prevalence of asthma severity was similar in black and white patients, and increased with age. In a different study, the severity index of asthma in a group of patients with bronchial asthma who were followed for one year, at their home, and in a public hospital was inversely correlated with their household income, and for each unit increase in the index, the rate of asthma was reduced by 12 percent.30

In this study of 3248 black patients admitted to an asthma and allergy centre in Seattle, Washington, we examined physician estimates of asthma severity.

Methods

Participants

We studied black patients in an urban hospital with a single non-specialist resident physician, who had an undergraduate training in public health and was fluent in English. Patients were identified from a national referral database. Baseline characteristics of the staff of the Seattle Asthma and Allergy Centre are reported in Table 1. At entry, we performed a structured telephone interview to define the diagnosis of asthma (ie, the use of an inhaler, or prescription of an inhaler, and the clinical severity of asthma at each visit) and asked about all medical factors, including family history, education, employment, and financial status.31 At each visit, an asthma history questionnaire was administered by the physician. At each of 3 visits, the patient completed a questionnaire containing the frequency of the occurrence at each visit of the 4 symptoms of asthma.

After excluding patients with asthma who were hospitalized during the study period (n = 647), we also excluded those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at entry (n = 614), those with other respiratory conditions at entry (n = 705), those with smoking at enrollment (n = 468), and those with any diagnosis of asthma at enrollment; we conducted a complete assessment of these groups at the end of the study period. We further excluded patients with acute asthma (eg, shortness of breath or wheezing during physical examination) or those with asthma requiring treatment that would have prevented enrollment from that point forward (eg, oxygen therapy). Exclusion criteria included being diagnosed with an asthma-related condition when in school, having a known allergy to specific products, and having asthma that requires treatment that would prevent enrollment from that point forward (eg, in-hospital use of corticosteroids). For these analyses we considered patients with mild to moderate asthma as nonusers; the severity index was calculated using a 2, 3, or 4-point severity scale.31

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was death and major adverse effects from asthma exacerbations"
Question: Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery? Answer: A non-randomized evaluation shows that laparoscopic surgery reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation and is safe in most patients. Most patients feel better immediately after surgery and no complications are reported. The major limitation of this study is that all patients had a prior heart attack; however, a study performed on postoperative patients after an acute heart attack showed a reduction in risk. The number of patients who required a revascularization procedure may be greater than the sample size of this study. Full text of the article is provided in the Supplemental Material.

Possible Risk Factors for Angina Prolongation

SUMMARY

Most patients are correctly diagnosed with normal chest pain without evidence of arrhythmias.1 The prevalence of angina is high, and approximately 60 percent of patients with angina have some form of arrhythmia present on examination.2-4

In the patient with suspected heart disease (e.g., angina, hypertension, or heart failure), screening for symptoms and initiating medications at the normal range of dosage will improve prognosis and save lives.5,6 In patients with suspected heart disease and the first or second episode of angina, the best therapy might be to reduce the frequency of symptoms and the dosage of medications (which has been shown to reduce the risk of angina progression).7

Carcinoma of the breast and adjacent area is another risk factor for continued progression and death from angina.2,2

The risk of recurrent angina has been found to depend on the extent to which these medications reduce the risk of recurrent sinus arrhythmias, especially low-frequency sinus arrhythmias,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3. The risk is reduced after antiarrhythmics, and may be even reduced.11

Pituitary tumor and angina

Pituitary tumors of the adrenal glands grow in response to adrenaline-secreting hormone secreted from the adrenal cortex (hypocretin gland).2 Angina, an underlying disorder of the pituitary gland, is caused by a deficiency in adrenal hormone. Patients with hereditary adrenal hyperplasia have a higher risk of developing coronary artery disease.2 Pituitary tumors have a high rate of death and other complications in untreated, isolated cases.2 The need to monitor and treat patients with adrenal disease is increasing, because pituitary cancer is now the most common type of cancer in women over age 40.2

Patient education has been used to reduce incidence and mortality in patients with pituitary tumors.2,2,11,12 Patients are exposed to angina in much the same way, with increasing severity.4-6 The risk of death is approximately 1 in 10,000 patients, and in most cases, the risk is not significant.

Oral hypoglycemia in the presence of hypertension (diabetes) is an additional risk factor for increased cardiac risk.13 Hypoglycemia has been associated with increased risks of angina in a pooled analysis of several studies.14 Another common risk factor for angina is diabetes.15 The combination of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease can result in multiple cardiac and kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and the presence of pulmonary edema.16

End-stage renal disease and elevated sodium levels in patients with diabetes are increased risks for progression to a myocardial infarction.17,17-19 Patients may be at risk for end-stage renal disease and elevated sodium levels in patients with diabetes, particularly the metabolic syndrome.20

Cardiac stress fractures in patients with end-stage renal disease, including chronic kidney disease, are increasing.21 Patients should be carefully screened for end-stage renal disease so that effective therapy, if sought, can be instituted with minimal discomfort or complication.21

Nelson-Larsen syndrome is the most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest, with a 10 to 50 percent increased risk in patients with diabetes.22 Because of the high risk for heart defects occurring in these patients, cardiac screening for these is recommended when diabetes is a risk factor.23

Oral hypoglycemia in the presence of hypertension (diabetes) is an additional risk factor for continued progression and death from angina.2,2,11,12 Patients are exposed to angina in much the same way, with increasing severity. 4-12 The risk of death is approximately 1 in 10,000 patients,"
"Question: The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim ""surge"" management? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," When will people be required to buy insurance to prevent mass casualty attacks via ""surge"" planning or by pre-design terrorist attacks? The Answer: Most mass casualties attacks against civilians happen when mass casualties attacks are ""planned."" A ""planned"" attack consists of two elements: A ""planned"" plan that is intended to maximize casualty killing, and At the least three simultaneous events of an impending mass casualty attack that have the potential to cause the death or injury of many people. The initial event may be a successful hostage take, or a terrorist attack that fails due to police action. The actual planned assault may be against a police station or an apartment building. It follows that any attack targeting a police station or an apartment building is a planned attack. The number of persons to be killed or injured during mass casualty events against police stations is limited to the number of police personnel available. Many police departments are more able to prevent incidents of a planned attack using the available police personnel. However, the ability of local police departments to stop terrorist attacks at the scene of the attack can sometimes be hindered by the time that a mass casualty event takes place. Since the attack may be delayed, police response times may be reduced to a few minutes from minutes. The time difference between what is happening at the scene after the attack is interrupted and what it would have taken to prevent the attack can give police the time to move the person suspected of being behind the attack. A few seconds can have a serious impact on the ability for police to respond. The time between the attack and an immediate response by police is known as the ""gap."" When the gap is large, police respond faster than the attack can happen. By contrast, when the gap is small and police respond more quickly, the effect of the attack on the police can be delayed, and possibly prevented from beginning. This is known as the ""time gap."" The time gap often causes police to wait for too long to act. After the attack, the gap may be closed permanently. On February 26, 1989 police officers in Melbourne, Australia, responded to a disturbance in the area. They set up at the scene, but arrived too late to stop the assault. A man with a knife attacked four police officers, killing the first two, wounding the other three, and then fatally shooting the third. A video video shows the incident. The police officer then took control of the situation by holding a child for several minutes while the other four police officers tried to save the children. In this case, the time-gap and police delay created a delay of twenty-three minutes. This period has been dubbed the ""gap."" It is difficult to determine when the police should have opened fire. It was estimated that the police had the weapon they needed to respond to the disturbance more than two minutes after the disturbance occurred. The video shows, however, that before the four police officers could arrive, the man with the knife had left the scene. Since each of the four police officers, except one, was armed with a pistol or shotgun, it is likely that the attack on the police was likely to result in the deaths of one or more of the four armed officers. The police waited until the gap was closed before they took action to save the victims. The gap is a good example of the danger of using the ""time gap"" to justify violence. When the gap is short, when the attacker is not present and the police have the weapon they need, the attack is less likely to result in the loss of life. In this instance, the gap did not close because the police waited only two minutes after the attack. A man who fired the shots on the police officer at the scene and the two dead police officers, were both on duty at the time of the incident. According to the official police report, the first police officer who began the fight with the assailant shot him ""in the chest/belly area."" He also shot the boy from behind and in the back. (L.J.M.M., The Melbourne Massacre, 1984.) The official police report stated the second officer also shot the assailant but not in the chest area (L.J.M.M., ""The Siege of the Melbourne Police Department,"" 1991, p. 5.) An expert in mass casualty incidents has concluded that the police had good reason to believe that the man who attacked them had explosives in his possession. The police had reason to think that the man had at least sixty seconds to kill as many police as possible before they killed him. The man who fired the shots on the police was wearing body armor. He had at least 50 seconds, after the police had attacked him, to escape. The man's body armor had at least four large pieces of armor that fit together. The man also wore ""hats"" (small pieces of cloth) that could easily be thrown at his attackers. He may also have had a"

Question: Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term?"" In the present study, we present results of a crossover study of 2 rheumatoid arthritis patients (n = 9) on placebo (n = 1) and folic acid, with 5-weeks (3/6) placebo and 3-weeks (0/6) folic acid periods. A subset of subjects also received 100 mg of vitamin B-12 daily for 8 weeks before beginning the study. The subjects in the study were receiving treatment for the first time ever with methotrexate (400 μg/day or 400 mg/day) or placebo. The placebo period served to allow the use of folic acid in the study. As planned, the patients continued receiving their standard oral therapy under their usual care without the benefit of folic acid supplement (with the exception of a single patient that received 200 IU folic acid). During the folic acid period, all subjects received their regular medications; no folic acid supplement was given at any point during the course of the study. The primary outcome data were determined before folic acid supplementation began. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups before the folic acid period. The primary result was that no subjects experienced an increase in the incidence of any adverse events. In contrast, the number of subjects experiencing one or more adverse events during the 7-weeks, placebo period was significantly higher than expected based on the expected mean baseline incidence for this subgroup group. This occurred because of a total of five (3.5%) subjects who reported a ""side effect"" during this period. Three (22.3%) subjects reported minor adverse effects that could not be attributed to the treatment in the study. The side effects we considered adverse included nausea, headache and nervousness during the day; headache and nausea at night; and a number of gastrointestinal, metabolic, musculoskeletal, dermatological, and immunologic complaints. The number of subjects reporting ""no effect"" at the end of the folic acid period was 1.4%, resulting in a statistical nonsignificance of this value. Conclusion: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis did not experience a significant increase in the mean overall incidence of ""no effect"" during the 7-weeks, placebo period. Conclusion: The present study confirms a safety profile of folic acid that has been repeatedly observed in the literature.

Key words:

In a systematic review, it was found that the results of randomized controlled trials (rCTs), randomized trials in which subjects have been randomly assigned to receive a treatment or control, and randomization cannot be used as a method to draw conclusions about a potential effect of a test drug or other treatment on the incidence of adverse events (AEs)

One way to answer the question posed in the Question ""Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to be started on folic acid supplements?"" is to draw conclusions such as ""No changes in the incidence of AEs were observed at the end of the trial"" or, ""Adverse or tolerable events occurred less often at the placebo and folic acid doses at doses lower than 5 mg/day in rheumatoid arthritis."" The answer to the Question of ""Would it be appropriate to extend this concept to include patients with other etiologies, for example, those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, to see if there might be benefits in a larger population?"" would then have to be ""No."" That is, for this to be scientifically valid, we must acknowledge that there are currently no studies in the literature for patients with other etiologies.

How does the absence of a study for the population at risk of AE-related adverse events in a trial with folic acid treatment justify its continued use as a standard of care for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis? Consider the following:

For the population at risk of AE-related adverse events, not only does the absence of any published study allow the use of the standard of care as is currently used with folic acid for rheumatoid arthritis, it also provides support for the use of folic acid as adjunctive therapy. As one might expect, this does not mean that it will make a difference if one takes the same or similar medications in the absence of folic acid. Folic acid is used as the primary treatment in studies that do not examine the effects of folic acid on those at risk. The use of folic acid can have favorable effects when administered in randomized controlled trials where the treatment group is randomized into one of 2 groups. In those 2 groups, one receives an"

The mean age, height, BMI, and percentage of femur with a TLD ≥3 mm were compared. Overall no correlation was found between infundibular height and the clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after TLD. However, it was suggested that infundibular height might be directly related with the clearance of lower pole stones.

Question: Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow?

Answer: To what extent is the cardiovascular system affected by lung ischemia and reperfusion?

What are the risk factors for the development and progression of pulmonary embolus?

What is the risk for a large-vessel coronary artery disease?

What is the risk of severe pulmonary embolus in a patient with coronary artery disease?


Answering this question helps us understand the nature of each condition, how it may potentially affect the heart and the patient with coronary artery disease. When treating patients with pulmonary embolism, physicians are often asked to explain the relationship between pulmonary stenosis and the development of coronary artery disease and to provide a more detailed description of the risk factors that may increase the risk for coronary artery disease in such patients.


Pulmonary Embolism

The term ""pulmonary embolism"" describes the thrombus created when a blood clot travels through the pulmonary artery and is blocked; blood is then moved into the lung and shunts into the aorta and vein where it is transported to the lungs and lungs are then damaged. Once a clot has formed, the damage is irreversible and death results.

Causes and Risk Factors

Clotting is the process by which the body produces new blood cells. Stem cells may be acquired by the immune system from foreign particles that are harmful to the immune system. Stem cells may also be created by cells from the bone marrow or from other sources. The body makes its own stem cells through a complex process called hematopoietic stem cell (hSC), which involves the transformation of stem cells from a normal cells into an adult stem cell using factors that favor proliferation. The resulting embryonic stem cells contain the genes of the fetal genome.

The number of stem cells in the body is regulated by an environment-dependent gene expression profile. The balance between a set of genes that is favorable for cell expansion and a set that is favorable for differentiation determines whether a tissue will be capable of growth. The genes that have higher expression levels promote tissue expansion, whereas those genes that have a lower expression level promote differentiation. The level of expression of certain genes may also determine the ability of stem cell to differentiate into specific cell types.

Clots created by blood clots do not need to pass through the lungs to reach the aorta. They may only move through the pulmonary artery after forming a thrombus. Once established, thrombus formation is a lifelong process in which the thrombus forms and develops over a period of time. A small proportion of thrombus formation that travels through the thoracic aorta reaches the pulmonary vasculature and can cause a variety of symptoms, including cough, chest pain, chest tightness, coughing, wheezing, hoarseness, fatigue, low-grade inflammation, and swelling.

The most common source of air space pressure in the lungs is the alveolar membrane of the lung, but most thrombus formation also occurs through the pericardium, the space between the two lungs. The most common place that pulmonary thrombus formation occurs is on the alveolar surface of the pulmonary arteries.

Primary causes of pulmonary embolism are as follows:

Oxygen starvation and respiratory acidosis (loss of oxygen and/or the pH is too low)

Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure is a factor in thrombus formation)

Cerebrovascular accident (carotid artery aneurysm, mitral valve prolapse, or coronary artery aneurysm)

Pericardial effusion of lung fluid

Pulmonary embolic disease (a narrowing of the alveolar wall of the pulmonary vessel in the chest)

Pulmonary embolism can result from several different events, including coronary artery disease (or pulmonary hypertension), trauma, and atherosclerotic diseases. Aortic and pulmonary arterial stenosis are the primary types of causes of pulmonary embolism in patients with cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. The major thrombus formation source is the pulmonary artery in the chest cavity.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have higher rates of pulmonary embolism and the most common source of thrombus formation is the pulmonary artery in the chest cavity. COPD is more common in women and younger adults than men. Patients with COPD also have a higher incidence of severe pulmonary embolism.

Pulmonary artery ischemia is an injury that occurs more frequently in young adult women than young adult men.

The primary cause of pulmonary embolism in COPD is a blockage in the pulmonary artery"

Question: Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Why do some people return to medication while others do not?

Answer: Duration of psychotherapy is a potential predictor (measured as treatment response) of the severity of depression and suicidal behavior when a patient is treated for depression. However, there has been little research evaluating the relationship of duration with outcome of treatment.

METHODS:

Patients who had one or more episodes of major depressive disorder before leaving an ER were recruited from the General Clinical Research Unit at Yale from 2002 to 2006. One patient was excluded from the study owing to lack of documentation of a psychiatric diagnosis prior to entering the study. This patient, identified as an outpatient, had a diagnosis of major depression and suicidality, but had not received treatment for depressive disorder after leaving hospital. Patients were evaluated at the time of first hospitalization in the course of the study, and then at discharge for a follow-up visit approximately one year later.

RESULTS:

Of the 9 patients who returned to their ED for treatment (1) who had a first episode, the duration of psychotherapy was not associated with treatment outcome. Patients who had a first episode had higher rates of suicide compared to untreated patients. The only group with significantly lower rates of suicidal behavior overall was those treated with antidepressants.

CONCLUSIONS:

While these results cannot be generalized to general population, in the general population, duration of psychotherapy is most predictive of long-term treatment success, as well as survival."
Question: Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery? Answer the Question: It does not increase the recurrence rate. Answer the Question: It is not known that it increases the recurrence rate, only that there are some case reports indicating that it improves the prognosis if spinal surgery is performed on a patient with spinal stenosis.

Answer: It is not known that they have an increased recurrence rate.

Shaving the incision site does reduce a lot of the inflammatory response that accompanies the spinal surgery. But it is a very small effect, even though, the number of cases that have had bad reactions to shaving the incision site is increasing. We don't know how that one is performing in the majority of patients.

Some researchers believe the reduction has a negative effect on nerve function as those nerves are being destroyed. But it doesn't affect the spinal canal which is the organ where pain and discomfort originate. So, they still get a lot of pain from shaving the incision site. So, they take the razor and shave the incision site.

Our answer to the question is: There are some cases of inflammation.

The good thing about shaving the incision site is that we can cut around it and it won't hurt much like if you were to cut into the skin. We don't know how it increases the recurrence. No one really knows because when a procedure is done, a lot of people do not come back. So, we have to wait for future studies.

To learn more about incisions, you can check out the website:

I have read at least a dozen studies examining the safety of shaving the incision site at that site. Nothing in the literature supports shaving the incision site as a possible cause of recurrence."
Question: The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question:

Answer to Question #1

The aneurysm diameter determines the extent of damage to the coronary vessels. An average diameter of 18 centimetres (0.5 in), for example, would result in a total coronary artery obstruction about 0.0028 millimetres (0.0022 in) thick, or about 20 per cent of the normal arterial thickness. This is why doctors call for an artery diameter that is as large as possible. At present, however, the maximum diameter of a coronary artery is just over 1 mm (0.0002 in). Since the average diameter is 18 centimetres for people with a normal coronary function and about 0.0002-0.0010 centimetres (0.0003-0.0007 in) for people who have a severe coronary disease, the recommended diameter of an artery must be at least 0.095 mm (0.004 in) to prevent any damage. About 40 per cent of individuals with severe coronary disease can't tolerate diameters below 0.025 mm (0.0035 in). A healthy person with a diameter of approximately 0.095 mm (0.003 in) has a normal blood supply and is at risk of blood clot formation, which could lead to a fatal thrombosis.

Answer to Question #2

The blood supply of the coronary artery begins around the heart's surface and is guided to the valve that leads from the heart to the carotid artery, or the arteries that drain blood from the two major veins, one descending the femoral (arm) (Fig. 2-1) (1). The carotid artery and veins then branch into two smaller veins, which drain to the arm on the same side of the body and to a smaller vein on the opposite side, known as the inferior vena cava.

Figure 2-1

The arteries in and out of the body are called branches of the aneurysm. There are three types of aneurysm: 1. External (internal) aneurysms, whose arteries open outside the body at the back of the skull. 2. Internal (internal) aneurysms, which lie at different points along a vein in the middle of the chest. 3. Internal (internal) aneurysms, which remain inside the body but flow to the wall of the heart by passing directly past it.

Answer to Question #3

The arteries of the coronary arteries form a network of more than 4,700 branches, many of which are connected by branches of different lengths and branches with different lengths and branches in different places.

The length and spacing of the branches of the coronary arteries are important in determining the amount of blood supplied by each one.

The angiography, which is used to visualize vessels, shows arteries to different places on the body. It shows branches of various densities, like 1 mm long vessels, 20 mm long arteries and 2 mm long arteries. Different branches have different lengths and densities.

The length, or radial ratio, of the arteries can tell you if you have an aneurysm. If the length (ρ) of the arteries is 5 times more than that of the ventricles (VL), or blood vessels that empty into the vessels, then the blood supply will be too low to hold all the blood that flows to and from the heart.

The average diameter of the coronary arteries is 9.5 to 13.5 mm (0.5 in. to 0.75 in.).

When an aneurysm is suspected, the physicians first make a slit through the skin to see if any blood flows out of the heart into the body. Blood vessels are very thin and are easily seen if cut open with a scalpel and blood pressure is raised. A clot and an aneurysm will eventually appear, so if the aneurysm is located outside, a slit is usually made through the skin of the chest, which has no blood flow.

Question: Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease? A: A French-Canadian scientist may breach confidentiality to protect the identity of a sex-steroid-exposed woman who is her husband's physician. A German psychiatrist may do the same to protect the identity of a patient who suffers from a brain-stem stroke. A French nurse has decided not to reveal the sexual status of a patient when her medical research is about to be published. When a patient's name or age is involved, then it amounts to disclosing that the patient might be the subject of an ongoing or threatened investigation, or to a patient whose family is suspected of having been involved in a criminal investigation. C: Yes; I can see the rationale for disclosing the identity in both of these examples. However, while it may not have been my intention to breach confidentiality, I might have taken a more reasonable decision had I only been concerned about some potential violation—not the actual identity itself.

Answer: What makes the question of ""legitimate disclosure"" so slippery? I think there's a long and tangled history when it comes to this topic. It all started in the 1980s, when the FDA recommended that doctors keep medical records in writing and for long periods of time and that doctors themselves provide physicians with medical records in paper form. In 1987, an appellate court refused to uphold a lower court that had ruled similar. This led to a great deal of commentary that led to calls for an unbreakable encryption system that would render doctors' records confidential. Eventually it was realized that there was no problem with providing doctors with medical records in the form of paper (except for the fact that it took at least one extra paper step to get those records) and all the government required was that the documents be kept in writing and for many years (usually 20 years). The problem, however, came in doing so. Many physicians do not understand how to read paper, but when they see the letters ""R01"" or ""G16"" or ""P17"" they may well try to decrypt the information; they do not understand that information can still be read on the ""paper"" side once the encryption key is provided. This led to some fairly creative interpretations of the law, and a great deal of court-packing of information that was later found to be wrong.

I guess the question is, What does anyone do when someone decides to take the easy way out and decide that he or she does not have the time or the equipment (or the mental fortitude!) or the professional training or the medical judgment to maintain the confidentiality of a medical record for many years, including during the time it makes its way up to or through the system, and for whom an encryption key won't likely be provided? Obviously you can tell people not to do this, especially if it is done by a professional and on behalf of their practice. If it is not done, in some cases the patient's health, their reputation, and future career prospects might be at stake. In addition some courts have found evidence of ""secret"" therapy under an assumed identity to be inadmissible (though not necessarily illegal) against patients who have been coerced into disclosing that information.

I'm no expert on medical records in general, but I do know that I have to keep a lot more of these documents in writing than it used to be. They seem to lose their protection sooner with each new generation. But then it's all up to you and what you have done…in my experience.

Question: Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?

Answer: All research on the subject has been quite anecdotal, but the general conclusion seems to be that there are likely to be certain symptoms of depression that tend to occur more frequently in patients with somatic complaints. One obvious example is the presence of tenderness in the trunk, usually accompanied by a tender mass. The diagnosis is made by a physician, who is trained not to make any physical examination in the suspected case. In some cases the ""mood"" is assumed (often wrongly) to be depression for the doctor to prescribe an antidepressant. The case report is interesting in that it was considered difficult to get a medical source to discuss the subject, since most doctors consider the somatic complaints part of normal life.

Another example is the tendency of the sufferer to have a generalized pain. A lot of clinical interest in somatic complaints can be traced to the studies of the work done in Germany in the 1920 to 1940. In an extensive collection that was published in Germany in 1938, the German neurologist Ernst Ristitz wrote about 40 different cases of pain that he thought were due to the autonomic nervous system. Since then further studies have shown that various autonomic causes of pain are present in about 20% of all patients with somatic complaints. In more recent times a series of papers in the journal Neurology has shown that there are over 50 autonomic causes of pain, many of which are common to those with somatic complaints. Several groups have tried to correlate autonomic and somatic symptoms in detail, but the results of these studies have not been so conclusive. It is not clear how important these autonomic causes truly are in determining symptoms of pain, since they are found in some patients with just a somatic complaint, and some with more complicated symptoms. There is some evidence that the autonomic nervous system in the long run is more important for regulating the heart rate than for regulating pain, and, indeed, the heart rate may influence symptom severity.

How does the patient's physical illness explain the somatic complaints? The patient might have had an autoimmune disorder affecting the parasympathetic nervous system, for example, because the physical illness was triggered by an immune reaction in the parasympathetic nervous system. This is generally not a problem, however, since the sympathetic nervous system plays a major part in controlling the immune system; immune symptoms are due to an immune reaction that occurs in the parasympathetic nervous system.

Other somatic complaints may be explained by psychological phenomena, notably an imbalance of somatic emotions. Psychopathology is an umbrella term that describes the disorders with problems in personality and behavior, as well as the changes in behavior that are caused by these disorders. Theories that stress the role of the central nervous system as an important part of psychopathology are known as dysfunctional Central Control Theory (CDCT). CDCT posits that the human nervous system has a central control system (which may be as simple as a complex combination of the autonomic and parasympathetic systems) that is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system and is highly disturbed in disease states. Thus, many people in conditions such as chronic pain have somatic complaints (in particular in patients with chronic backache who have had the painful backache, as well as in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have had problems with their joints). Similarly people with somatic complaints in the presence of other illnesses have symptoms that are caused by this disturbed central control system.

The central control system for the body is a sort of central control system for the mind, since the central control system that regulates the mind is the parasympathetic nervous system, which also controls the respiratory, circulatory and gastrointestinal systems. The parasympathetic nervous system is sensitive to changes in body temperature. Thus it tends, when temperature is normal (or even slightly elevated), to regulate body temperature. When the parasympathetic nervous system loses control or becomes stressed, it may tend to bring about changes in the body (for example, the cardiovascular system may be sensitive to increased blood pressure, and the respiratory system may respond when the breathing becomes labored). When these responses occur, the parasympathetic nervous system may not cope as well with the changing environment and may be activated. The latter symptoms include headaches, irritability and heart palpitations (which may occur when the parasympathetic nervous system is overloaded).

However, there is one important exception to the effect of central control system dysfunction on the physical symptoms of the body. Patients with heart palpitations who have normal diastolic function are much more sensitive to changes in temperature than patients who have heart palpitations in an abnormal fashion, and they are more likely to have migraines and/or to develop an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. A similar result occurs when patients with migraine who have normal di"

Question: Remote ischemic postconditioning: does it protect against ischemic damage in percutaneous coronary revascularization? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Ischemic postconditioning improves cardiac function in percutaneous coronary revascularization?

Introduction: In contrast to most cardiologists, I often encounter patients whose initial chest radiographs are not readily available for follow-up. This has, however, long been known, and it is a known fact that with the exception of a very high degree of revascularization of the coronary circulation, percutaneous coronary revascularization does not provide an advantage to patients with ischemic shock or those with severe ischemic ventricular overload

Patients with ischemic shock, who present under general anesthesia who lack coronary artery disease, and who are not expected to survive are probably not expected to benefit from CPR to resuscitate these patients. These patients are often given a blood transfusion, though with the current high availability of blood supply there may not be much possibility to have a transfusion by a suitable physician with reasonable knowledge of the patient. On the other hand, patients with very severe ischemic ventriculopathy have received substantial treatment with CPR including intubation, cpr, bradycardia, and infusion. Many, however, die of the cause of the disease. Patients who require percutaneous coronary revascularization are usually the last patients treated. The evidence is not unanimous, but it is certainly clear that resuscitation with CPR was not as important to these patients as it may have been for those with severe ischemic ventriculopathy who were treated with CPR. The best-case explanation for this is that with the advent of percutaneous coronary revascularization, patients with very severe ischemic ventriculopathy who failed on a normal cardiac catheterization were treated with CPR.

Methods: This study focuses on revascularization of an injured person with ischemic shock who lies in a prone position. The patient was seen by a cardiologist and was evaluated for ischemic shock with general anesthesia. The patient was instructed by the cardiologist if there were any cardiac conduction slowing that a pulse pump should be used and the patient was given the best-case scenario description of the cardiac state and the best prognosis. The heart rate, and a series of pulse and chest X-ray patterns were monitored. The heart did not show obvious signs of an electrocardiogram in which the beats were too slow. Cardiovascular biomarker data were obtained from an ECG monitor. It is unknown whether survival of any patients who underwent percutaneous coronary revascularization or a simple resuscitation with norepinephrine or epinephrine was improved. The outcomes and criteria for cardiac mortality are given in.

Results: For a sample of 32 patients (18 adults, 10 babies, and 3 neonates), 24 died within 3 months after CPR. There were no difference in survival with CPR for a sample of 14 normal subjects (14 adults, 16 babies, and 6 neonates). There was no improvement in heart rate, nor was there improvement in pulse rate, oxygen saturation, or troponin with CPR in most patient groups. Of all patients, the highest survival rate was with CPR for a sample of 1,852 normal subjects. There was no improvement in cardiac troponins in the group that did not undergo percutaneous coronary revascularization except for one patient, a 33-year old man with a low cardiac troponin concentration who underwent a cardiopulmonary resuscitation with norepinephrine and epinephrine. In this patient, cardiac troponin levels returned to normal 3 months after CPR. It is uncertain whether further cardiac-facial or ventricular functions could be returned to normal within a few months. In total, 10 patients underwent CPR in which the ventricular ejection fraction (VEF) was increased after 2 weeks. The mean VEF in the percutaneously revascularized group was not significantly improved compared with that in the normal group (mean VEF, 39.5% in the percutaneously revascularized group vs 39.0%; P =.13). There were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the endpoints that were evaluated.

Conclusions: We reviewed this group of severely injured patients for the primary purpose of assessing cardiorespiratory factors in the control of severe ischemic shock. A sample of normal subjects appeared to exhibit a more favorable end-of-ischemic-suscitation. The results of this study have major implications for percutaneous coronary revascularization. The initial cardiac arrest in most children with ischaemic shock is due to cardiorespiratory and/or pulmonary failure causing the respiratory failure to initiate the heart arrest. The cardiac arrest can be prolonged if there is no response to cardiac re-regulation during the initial stage of cardiac arrest. This study focused solely on patients"

One needs to keep in mind that HIV infection is an acquired disease and that the immune system is very susceptible to viral infection and can make a difference whether in the infected or uninfected population. A large number of factors and a large number of variables can affect the relative risk of HIV infection but the major factor is viral processing and immune response in"
Question: The inverse equity hypothesis: does it apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What percentage of medical care is rendered to cancer patients by physicians and hospitals in developed, middle-income countries?

Answer: It's hard to get the answer there. But a big review, published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal in 2011, found that the rate of cancer care rendered for cancer in developed, middle-income countries was on average 10 times lower than in low-income countries.

If we set out to find that coverage for cancer treatment and care rendered varies significantly across countries even by the most rigorous definition of middle-income, we wouldn't be the first to look at the question. I reviewed three major articles, and, more recently, David Himmelstein at Harvard Medical School, and three reviews in peer-reviewed journals, that attempt to estimate the variation in cancer care rendered from the U.S. to patients in the developing world. The results agree:

Our estimates have been confirmed by other studies.

All are reasonably comprehensive.

In addition to being a good starting point, this research is also significant because the variation among countries within middle-income is large and consistent, and the differences among countries of different income levels are stark when you control for the characteristics of the patients (wealth, age, income, etc.) that are more common in most countries in middle-income. For example, a large percentage of low-income people are insured if they have insurance in the first place. And middle-income countries tend to differ substantially in the proportion of children with insurance from those in low-income countries, while most people in low-income do; the latter suggests that children who are uninsured have been disproportionately disproportionately affected.

We can't draw any firm conclusions, of course, because the data are not available to us. There may be variation within the U.S. in its treatment of cancer and in our ability to pay for the treatment in our local community. But that is not a reason to conclude that the U.S. should change or is ""less affluent"" in terms of its cancer care."
Question: Identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality: does scale matter? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Are racial disparities in breast cancer mortality large enough to account for the observed heterogeneity of breast cancer outcomes, or is there a more fundamental cause that might explain the difference?"" Methods Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the cohort of women with breast cancer from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Breast Cancer Surveillance System. In addition, we included women without breast cancer from a non-CDC reference panel. The survey was mailed to women between 1989 and 1997. We estimated the ratio of the frequency of women with breast cancer in a given group to the frequency of women without breast cancer by using a log-linear spline. This measure of discrimination was calculated as (total non-Hispanic white (CI=50%,60%) and non-Hispanic black (CI=55%,65%). The observed ratios in the two population groups were then combined to compute the adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the breast cancer death rates, adjusted for age, race, sex, and other prevalent disease. Results: Overall, 18.8% (13.0, 20.3%) of women who had breast cancer in the United States died of the disease. These results were similar to the findings from the same data set with regard to the incidence of death from other causes. These same associations held among black breast cancer survivors in non-Hispanic white women (adjusted RR=0.97, 95% CI=0.89–1.09, p=0.94) and in Hispanics (adjusted RR=0.98, 95% CI=0.88–1.08, p=0.98). When the adjusted relative risk per 100 000 women in black and non-Hispanic white women were pooled, we observed that the ratio of black versus white breast cancer death rates remained elevated during the study period (adjusted RR=1.32, 95% CI=1.00, 1.74, p<0.001; Table 2). Adjustment for mortality from all causes, as well as age, race, and other health and non-health comorbidities did not produce similar effects from these covariates (Table 2). Conclusions: Black women with breast cancer experienced higher mortality from breast cancer death rates than their white and non-Hispanic white counterparts, with the largest disparities in early detection of disease. This racial disparity appears to exist for several reasons, such as race-specific death rates, race-specific cancer characteristics, geographic variation in the incidence of breast cancer, and differences in risk factors between black and white women. This study also indicated that in the general US population, race-specific breast cancer death rates have declined slightly, although there is too little information about race/ethnicity to draw firm conclusions about the decline in breast cancer mortality.

Breast cancer mortality among US women varies with age, but the most significant change over time is that breast cancer is far less common among women in their late 60s compared to women in their early 30s (1,2). This observation has caused concern and a series of attempts to identify reasons for this difference in mortality (3–5). It is not clear whether breast cancers are less survivable in women older than age 60, with the increased prevalence of menarche among older women in the United States being hypothesized to be a contributing factor (6,7). In order to address the question of whether breast cancer survival differs by age in the United States, we have reviewed breast cancer mortality rates in the US population over time. We used a retrospective cohort study to investigate demographic and clinical characteristics associated with breast cancer mortality in the general US population. We hypothesized that disparities in breast cancer mortality among racial and ethnic groups in the United States in this population would be the result of social class, individual-level risks, and mortality from other causes. In addition, we studied racial disparities in breast cancer mortality by age, and the relation between survival and other health and non-health risk factors, in order to clarify the role of racial disparities in breast cancer survival.

Methods The National Breast Cancer Surveillance System (NCDSS) in the US was implemented in 1989, and the study was conducted from 1994 to 1997. NCDSS is a population-based surveillance system that provides information on breast cancer (1). It consists of a comprehensive surveillance system (including two major components: a population-based cohort that covers an entire geographic region; and a follow-up study among women who developed breast cancer. In the case of non-localized counties or large metropolitan areas the follow-up study can focus on individuals at high risk of breast cancer for a 2-year follow-up. This study was previously described in detail (3,8). The NCDSS was constructed to provide a nationally representative portrait of women's breast cancer outcomes using a self-administered survey, which is in turn matched with the hospital diagnosis of the breast cancer diagnosis performed in 1986, and"
Question: Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury?

Introduction

Leukocyte count relates to the frequency of inflammatory reactions (e.g. neutrophilic reactions and pericytic reactions) in the body. It is mainly present in the blood after injury and most frequently correlates to the extent of tissue damage. It is most well known as the gold standard for diagnosis of tissue injury during exercise.

The leukocyte count correlates with the severity of injury. The more neutrophil activity you can detect, the more likely you are to find a high leukocyte count. However, the leukocyte count does not always correlate to the severity. If you can detect very low neutrophils in your blood after exercise, it may be due to inflammatory reactions or to a problem in the blood.

Leukocyte count correlates to the time period between events, but it is not the only thing, it does not indicate the severity of the injury. The longer you wait between events, the less likely you are to find a high leukocyte count in your blood after a particular event, at least in healthy individuals. A high leukocyte count may be a sign of a minor injury. However, it may be due to inflammatory reactions (e.g. arthritis, chronic arthritis, chronic wounds), or more serious problems (e.g., bleeding, cancer development or death of the body cells, infection). In that case, the leukocyte count is less likely to be higher after a certain injury.

A high leukocyte count is often a reflection of a large quantity of blood flow in the circulation.

A normal or high leukocyte count is a healthy measure of the quality of the blood supply to the tissues in your body. If the blood supply to your tissues is impaired, the level of inflammation may be higher (e.g. chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic wounds, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease).

If the leukocyte counts are abnormal, then you are advised to have a laboratory test that can detect these abnormal levels. In most cases, such laboratory tests can detect changes in the leukocyte count, which are very common with the type of tissue injury that we want to diagnose.

Leukocyte count can be a useful measurement when an organ such as the heart and brain gets injured. The damage to the heart and brain by blood clots is associated with increased leukocyte count.

How does leukocyte count vary with injury?

Leukocyte counts can be changed even after the injury. This is how the leukocyte count in the blood varies following different injuries:

Lymph cells have low leukocyte counts after the first day after injury, usually with no detectable damage in the blood. Thereafter, the number of activated lymphocytes (cells that express chemokines such as CD45 and CD14) in the blood increases. The change in the leukocyte count between 10 days and 1 week after the injury has the appearance of a smooth, regular gradient (a leukocyte count gradient has a similar appearance) that occurs in some individuals after only a few days or weeks. After 1 week there may also be a small change in the leukocyte count in the blood, but without any detectable damage.

Some individuals also show a small change in their leukocyte count in a similar or opposite way to what we see in the blood of healthy individuals following an injury.

For this reason, it is important to find out which type of cancer is causing the increase in the leukocyte count in the first place.

How are leukocyte counts affected by age and gender?

Leukocyte counts increase with age. Most notably, the leukocyte count is increased in men and decreases in women.

There is no gender effect for leukocyte counts after injury. However, some individuals who have been exposed to some toxic chemicals during injury will show a leukemographic shift in their leukocyte counts, which should be noticed by the medical professional or family member before and after they have recovered.

Do different types of organs have different leukocyte counts?

Different organs can produce different amounts of leukocytes. For example, the kidneys will produce more glutathione, which is a vital antioxidant, because of a normal function.

However, if the kidney is damaged in the injury, as in a fall or an injury for which you do not have any evidence of damage on x-ray, then the glutathione and the vitamin B6 will suffer damages.

A higher leukocyte count has also been found in other organs such as the stomach (with an increased leukocyte count), the kidney (with a higher leukocyte count), lymph nodes (with"
Question: Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients?

Answer: Yes.

In some of my sleep literature, it is mentioned that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for specific purposes is being studied with respect to sleep disorders. One of the uses is to stimulate cortical areas and to reduce the daytime sleepiness of the patients using tDCS. The rationale for tDCS is that by stimulating the cortical areas it will reduce the daytime sleepiness of those patients and will improve their performance. In other cases, tDCS is administered on the non-cortical brain areas such as motor areas in order to reduce sleepiness in patients. In all cases, the patients who were not responsive to a treatment but who still exhibited sleepiness could possibly benefit from this stimulation.

In my opinion, it is important to distinguish between several types of non-responsive patients because non-responsive patients are not always defined as being awake. Many non-responsive patients do not sleep enough, but their daytime sleepiness is not so severe that they could be referred to medical clinics. To identify non-responsive patients, it is important to perform a simple and non-invasive test called Functional Resting State Questionnaire (FRAPS) as the objective of tDCS in order to monitor the improvement of the patients with non-responsive sleepiness. Although the tDCS-induced changes are mild in some cases and the patients do not exhibit a daytime sleepiness so severe that it would not be appropriate to prescribe a specific sleep drug, it is important to ensure that a patient with such high sleepiness is not treated with tDCS because it will potentially be harmful.

When the patients are referred for sleep study, they are required to take a baseline sleep questionnaire that includes different items about the sleep quality. They are also asked to answer questions about the sleepiness over the last 5 minutes, about how many alarms they have, whether they have trouble finding their bed, and how they feel at the moment of sleep onset.

A preliminary set of the sleep parameters collected by the patients is compared with their baseline sleep quality that they had previously had before the tDCS session. The patients are then given 4 consecutive nights of tDCS with 5-minute intervals during the first night because in order to observe their sleep parameters over long periods we have to do it during the morning or at night due to ambient light. It has been observed that tDCS decreases the quality of the nights sleep, but it does not cause any alteration in the patients´ sleep quality. It is possible that the treatment can affect the patients´ sleep quality but tDCS does not in that case. This is because the sleep parameters measured according to the baseline sleep questionnaire before stimulation and as a result do not change significantly as a result of tDCS. Only the change in the sleep quality measured according to the sleep questionnaire in the first day of tDCS is sufficient to define a case of non-responsive wakefulness syndrome, and in this case the treatment is not needed.

The patients themselves, who are undergoing this research, often have a high quality sleep during the last few days of the experiment. Consequently, the patients do not find it difficult to follow the treatment protocol. Also, I think a careful evaluation of the patients´ sleeping habits prior to the experimental treatment before the beginning of the experiment would not be necessary.

The patient of the present study (M.H.H) is a woman who previously had been diagnosed with Non-responsive wakefulness syndrome since 2007. The woman had started getting sleep problems a few weeks before, but this was completely gone before initiating tDCS. Prior to her clinical trial the patient had received an MRI and EEG on a couple of occasions for diagnostic purposes. When the patient did not perform well in the diagnosis the patient was referred to a neurology hospital. The woman was not recommended to take any other sleeping aid or sleep medications. The patient still complained of poor sleep hygiene and complained of fatigue after her first few nights of tDCS usage. The tDCS sessions started at 6 am and lasted until 4:30 A.M, when she felt more ""well-rested"".

After completing her clinical trial the woman complained of poor sleep hygiene on the basis of the sleep laboratory results during the nights she initially experienced poor sleep hygiene. The results from her sleep laboratory did not contain any positive results. It also happened that the morning she was diagnosed with Non-responsive wakefulness syndrome she woke up several times, but only after some of the sleep parameters were collected. Also, she complained about her sleep, that she did not fall asleep at night, but could not sleep at all for a couple of days. In that case we determined that the woman might have been diagnosed with Non-responsive wakefulness syndrome, but not as"
Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can musculoskeletal conditions be controlled by the treatment of the immune system?

To see which disorders are considered musculoskeletal, the Institute of Medicine has developed the following definitions:

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). IBS is a complex immune-mediated disorder (i.e., it's both neurological and autoimmune) with a complicated course involving clinical features and a wide range of inflammatory/chronic illnesses. Patients with ME/CFS have severe and disabling fatigue, headaches, muscle aches, and weakness, which are exacerbated by the systemic infections and stress (chronic insomnia, sleep disruption, and psychological distress). The disorder is not always easily diagnosed or treated, and it has been linked to immune deficiency, autoimmune disorders, and depression (Daly and McElroy 2003/2004).

The disorder is not always easily diagnosed or treated, and it has been linked to immune deficiency, autoimmune disorders, and depression (Daly and McElroy 2003/2004). CFS. CFS is a chronic inflammatory neuroimmune disease occurring with onset at ages 18 to 39 years. Symptoms include fatigue, pain, joint/muscle pain, cognitive changes, muscle weakness, and unexplained weight loss. It is thought to occur in approximately 1 percent of the general population and is the first reported neuroimmune disorder described as a symptom of rheumatoid arthritis in humans (Morton and Wojciszewski 2004).

Sepsis. Sepsis refers to an acute, life-threatening, immunological illness wherein the body produces excessive amounts of white blood cells. Sepsis usually is fatal, and it causes a broad range of symptoms that include fever, muscle aches, joint pain, loss of sensation, blurred vision, and a wide range of clinical presentation (McElroy 2001).


Is there any research on preventing or treating these disorders?

There is a body of evidence regarding the effects of certain types of drugs on the musculoskeletal system. The U.S. National Institute of Health, which funded the research, examined the results of studies that examined the effects of the following in relation to musculoskeletal disorders:

Antibodies are a natural immune system response to invading pathogens to ward off infection. They occur in everyone, but they are most prevalent in the elderly. Antibodies are usually administered as vaccines, but they can also be injected. The effectiveness of an antibody depends on its molecular makeup. Certain types of antibodies are found in high concentrations in immune cells (i.e., peripheral blood mononuclear cells). These cells are thought to be the most important sources for natural killer cells. There is also substantial evidence that some types of antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier could cause motor neuron degeneration, a condition that increases the risk of stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and death.

Abstracts:

Exclusive or exclusive chemotherapy is the primary treatment for metastatic endometrial cancers, and multiple agents can be administered. The use of antineoplastic Agents including cytotoxins, histocompatibility-active antigens, and drugs as chemotherapy is controversial and uncertain. The current available evidence suggests that a significant number of endometrial cancer patients have experienced both recurrences and persistence with respect to recurrence of symptoms, the appearance of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasms, the appearance of endometrial metastases, and the appearance of endometrial adenomas. A large proportion of patients report that a prior treatment was not well tolerated despite adequate treatment at follow-up.

Toxicological analysis of endometrial biopsy specimens reveals evidence of endometrial cancer that does not resolve with appropriate chemotherapies that is caused by a range of factors, including high-grade dysplasia, abnormal endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, and an absence of epithelial cells and an absence of estrogen or progesterone associated with severe endometrial androgen insensitivity. It is generally believed that an inadequate response to therapy is the primary cause of disease recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and the appearance of endometrial epithelial tumors. The treatment of endometrial cancer as a non-cancer, although associated with a substantial mortality rate, remains a challenging matter. Therefore, it is critically important that the best available treatment guidelines and guidelines for adjuvant treatment be established. A focus on developing a more comprehensive endometrial cancer treatment guideline is necessary.

Question: Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the probability that a male might be inoculated and infect with N. gonorrhoeae?

The answers to these questions form the basis of a theoretical concept known as ""Serovar serovar specific immunity to N. gonorrhoeae"" or ""SIIR"" (1).

The research question and hypothesis has been tested over the years when people have had gonorrhoea (2), or have had SIIR with a single gonorrhoea donor, with no adverse effect (3, 4). When one of these was tested in a small number of recipients using a simple PCR test that detects serovar DNA, all who were seronegative were protected, thus proving that SIIR existed (2,5,6). In addition to the theoretical demonstration that SIIR exists, it has been proved that it occurs very rarely, which is more likely than being inoculated from an infected partner (2,5,1,10).

The question concerning the SIIR phenomenon has remained open in the minds of researchers for many years, and so far, it has not been addressed. However, the theoretical concept is finally being tested in a number of new studies, and one or two new studies conducted since the last review.

The new studies include a recently published study, which investigated a number of hypotheses that had been investigated, and concluded that these concepts do explain the SIIR phenomenon (11). It has been shown that the ""serovar SIIR is a possible and probable explanation for some human infections because it is independent of the virus strain"" (11).

Another recent study involved only a small number (approximately 20 patients) of individuals who used serovars as donor in one of their previous outbreaks. There was no increased probability in the SIIR phenomenon when SIIR was found to be present in a person's urine, blood or breast milk (10). In addition, the serovar serovar SIIR was detected in the urine of only one of the 10 inoculated patients with no increase in the likelihood of being infected (11).

Another recently published study was conducted between August and December 2007 with about 500 gonococcal patients who had received multiple gonococcal inoculations over time to assess the possibility that they may have increased their risk of infection by SIIR. This investigation indicated that about six out of every 1,000 gonococcal men who were given multiple gonococcal inoculations on the same day were subsequently inoculated with N. gonorrhoeae (10).

Furthermore, in February 2008 it was reported that the serovar SIIR was detected in the urine of a woman in her 40's after her partner acquired SIIR and became sero-specific for the organism (11).

The potential consequences of this discovery include that multiple gonococcal inoculations that may result in the SIIR organism may lead to infection by the SIIR (11). The risk for transmission from one partner with SIIR to an infected partner also has been tested, and three partners in one outbreak in which two partners received two gonococcal inoculations each have confirmed transmission (1).

The SIIR phenomenon also raises concerns because of the adverse effects of SIIR on normal tissue and cells and the possible loss of the ability to prevent infections through these factors.

According to the theoretical concept outlined by the researches, infections due to SIIR can result in the following conditions if the recipient: (a) contracts the virus without treatment or prevention (b) has an undiagnosed or undescribed STD.

Many countries are testing such a model for SIIR with a new test kit that detects SIIR DNA using a blood sample, urine sample or breast milk. In Japan, a test kit was also developed specifically for determining the probability of contracting SIIR when the recipient is infected with the gonococcal organism (8). Testing of the test kits can be done with the aid of a urine sample (11) and the results can be interpreted to show the potential infection and/or the susceptibility.

If the test kit is positive, then the recipient may be at an increased risk of developing complications such as sepsis, or bacterial infections that occur when there is inflammation in the organs, such as the eyes, sinuses, ear, nose and mouth. Because of the possible complications, the recipient may also be considered at a lower risk to develop gonococcal genital disease of any kind (2,11,12).

Question: May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies? It is our strong recommendation that the following be sent to the student examiners:

The document needs to state that the students must be trained in their duties and that the OSCE's procedure for examination is designed with the student in mind. There should be a discussion of the medical emergency and the particular nature of the exam. There should be a detailed explanation of the requirements required of the student examiners by the OSCE and of their responsibilities. There should be a list of criteria for determining the results of the exam and for choosing the best students for that reason.

How would your exam be administered?

There should be an option to include the student examiners in an office setting. A faculty advisor would assist the OSCE with the OSCE review of student examiners and would report back to their OSCE supervisor. This is a standard operating procedure under the OSCE.

Is OSCE examiners allowed to be compensated by schools without an appropriate recommendation by the OSCE faculty committee?

Under the OSCE's standard operating procedure OSCE examiners must be paid from the OSCE budget.

Is OSCE examiners required to undergo physical and psychological examinations before being approved for service as OSCE examiners?

Yes, under OSCE policy.

Can OSCE examiners practice as physicians in a medical emergency?

Under the normal OSCE licensing procedures, under all circumstances, no other licensed physician may accompany the OSCE medical examiner to administer an exam. (See OSCE Practice in Emergency Medicine (PSEM) for a full explanation of the legal limitations and benefits of physician-assisted exams.)

Why don't OSCE examiners have to attend the hospital or physician's office?

The OSCE standards allow the examiners discretion to decide if attending the hospital or physician's office is required in their work. OSCE examiners are licensed by the OSCE board of directors and have full legal professional credentials. Most require attendance at a hospital or physician's office before beginning their exams. An OSCE exam is not required by the OSCE to perform an examination.

Why are OSCE examiners sometimes required to perform an exam at the hospital or hospital's physician's office?

The OSCE Standards of Care specify that in an emergency the OSCE examiners should be in a hospital or physician's office when they are not attending emergency situations. There are numerous circumstances that allow an OSCE exam to take place in an emergency situation such as the health of the patient, an unforeseen life threatening event, the loss of an exam site, and lack of availability of an OSCE doctor or an interpreter.

If there are multiple OSCE staff on an exam, who do the exams for the OSCE?

No OSCE exam is performed solely by a single teacher or trainer. Rather, OSCE examiners in an emergency situation are under the direction of the OSCE board of directors.

Why is it important that OSCE examiners perform their duties safely in an emergency situation?

The safety of the entire medical team is essential to the continued success of the OSCE.

Why do we require a student-to-OSCE agreement prior to the OSCE exams taking place?

Under the ""OSCE Review of Students - Acceptance."" section of the agreement it states that the student shall consult the university's OSCE advisor(s) about whether or not to join OSCE examiners. Under ""Oversight of the Exam"" it states that the student must consult the OSCE's medical examiners and must present to the OSCE members that the OSCE is not a substitute for their own medical examiners. It is our recommendation that these requirements be met in order to ensure student safety.

How do I join the OSCE?

By attending an OSCE training session. There are two trainings, one in Toronto and one in Ottawa. There is a pre-screening session before the session where the OSCE exames are tested out by a representative of the OSCE. There is also a post-screening session after the exam. The session will occur between 8:30 and 1:00 p.m. on a Monday-Thursday and is for OSCE exames only. You can download the training materials for the Ottawa and Toronto presentations. Alternatively, you may contact OSCE Training, Administration, and Management at training@osce.org or 705-711-3333.

Can you explain the process for a student wanting to join the OSCE at what level?

One of the core functions of the OSCE is to develop standards for professional performance and the OSCE examiners are subject to these standards when they perform"
Question: Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade?

Answer:

As discussed in Part 1, both T1R2 and T1R3 are involved in epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and proliferation arrest. They are both expressed under ""normal"" and ""anoxia induced"" conditions (Degiell et al. 2005), and both are associated with ""categorized"" or ""normal"" patterns of migration (Steinmetz et al. 1991), though the effects of the expression patterns of these two genes are strongly correlated (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Gosset et al. 2002).

Thus, while the two genes seem functionally identical in vivo, there are a multitude of independent pathways that can lead to a similar expression pattern during different cell states (e.g., differentiation and migration). These independent pathways are: (1) the induction of angiogenesis and angioclasticity; (2) the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases; and (3) activation of proangiogenic transcription factors (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Henscher et al. 1995; Steinmetz, Jorgensen, and Kjellgren 1983; Fuchs et al. 1998; Steinmetz et al. 1999; Steinmetz, Wessels, Vos, Jensensson, and Wessels 1994; Kjellgren, Steinmetz, Vos, and Andersen 1993). These different transcriptional mechanisms are well documented in several different cell types in the embryonic and adult embryo and proliferative cell lineages (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Henscher et al. 1995). For example, astrocytes are known to express both the T1R2 and T1R3 gene products both within differentiation and migration domains. Furthermore, astrocytic expression patterns are influenced by developmental signaling pathways that involve the transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic changes characteristic of various developmental stages of development (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Steinmetz 1993; Henscher et al. 1995). As discussed above, the expression patterns of T1R4 are also controlled by a number of different mechanisms, including transcriptional activation of several different genes that involve mechanisms such as transcription factor binding, methylation, oxidative modification, DNA adduct formation, and DNA breakage (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Henscher et al. 1995; Steinmetz, Jorgensen, and Kjellgren 1983; Fuchs et al. 1998). Similarly, astrocytes appear to display a variety of differential patterns of endothelial cell migration (Steinmetz et al. 1999; Steinmetz, Fuchs, Vos and Andersen 1993).

The effects of the expression pattern of T1R2 on angiogenesis have been investigated as early as the 1960s. It was shown in astrocytes in which the expression of T1R2 increased markedly, that the expression of T1R2 in astrocytes with T1R3 was associated with increased migration, whereas it was decreased in the astrocytes with T1R3 alone (Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1973; Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1979; Steinmetz et al. 1983). It was established that T1R2 was essential to maintain migration of endothelial progenitors throughout the differentiation process (Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1974; Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1979), and this finding was confirmed in a wide variety of neurogenic lineages (Steinmetz et al. 1979; Steinmetz et al. 1983; Steinmetz et al. 1985; Steinmetz, Jorgensen, and Kjellgren 1983; Steinmetz et al. 1989; Steinmetz et al. 1999; Steinmetz and Jorgensen 1998). Furthermore, the expression of these genes is critical for endothelium homeostasis: the T1R1 gene requires the expression of a G-protein in astrocytes, whereas the T1R2 gene and the T1R3 gene require the expression of a G-protein in endothelial cells (Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1975; Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1979; Steinmetz et al. 1983; Steinmetz et al. 1988; Steinmetz et al. 1999).

Although it has been established that T1R2 controls angiogenesis, it remains unclear as to what other factors other than T1R2 are involved in angiogenesis. It is generally accepted that the T1R3 gene, as well as three other genes involved in endothelial cell growth, are required for angiogenesis (Gosset et"
Question: Do healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are healthier lifestyles and lifestyles that incorporate fitness and lifestyle changes leading to less utilization of public healthcare resources?

Results: Results of Experiment 1 showed that those who participated in the exercise and lifestyle interventions were more likely reduce the use of medical services. For example, participants that exercised less were more likely to reduce the use of pain medication, tranquilizer medication and sedative medication over time. Additionally, those participants that increased their physical activity and/or engaged in a diet of at least 1,200 kcal/d were the least likely to have a physician visit within four years. To sum up the findings, exercise and lifestyle interventions were positively associated with reductions in utilization of services, indicating that healthier behaviors are key to reducing their utilization. Moreover, there was a decrease in utilization of medical services associated with participants that changed their behavior. Finally, participants with healthier lifestyles and behaviors were more likely to use care after four years.

Methods

Participants

The study was a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 10 sites in North America and Europe. The study used data from a large prospective cohort. This study was approved by the institutional review board of each center and included participants who were at least 50 years of age. The sample population included men and women aged 40 years and older and were of non-Hispanic, English-speaking, high socioeconomic status in the United States (Gulf Coast, Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Minnesota). The sampling design of this study was informed design by the New York and San Francisco Institutional Review Boards and provided consent by all staff. All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment in this study.

Procedure

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. The control group was a group of healthy participants that did not receive any intervention. The active group was a group of patients randomized to moderate aerobic exercise for three sessions/week for approximately four to six weeks. The intervention and exercise activities were guided by an exercise instructor at the Clinical Research Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. The control group was a group of patients age 40 years and older who also received medical care as part of their healthcare routine or as part of their general health routine. All patients were assessed as a baseline condition and randomized to one of the intervention or control groups twice weekly using a computer generated randomization sequence (Figure 1). The intervention in our study included a weekly visit with the exercise instructor in the Clinical Research Institute. At the beginning of the 12-week program, the intervention instructor determined the participant's fitness level using the American College of Sports Medicine-approved program based on the American College of Sports Medicine Standards of Fitness and Exercise Testing Protocol, revised edition, version 7.11.4.5.1 (14). Exercise programs were based on the following guidelines for aerobic exercise: 40–50 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise for 30–60 minutes at a steady state (e.g., brisk walking) with two to three minutes of rest. The exercise curriculum was tailored to the physical characteristics and health goals of the participant and the control group. An individual is defined to be fit if their 1-RM and 1–2 min of 30–60 minute aerobic exercise is at a 1% and 2% variance from their VO 2max (18).

The intervention and exercise programs were developed by researchers from the School of Nursing, University of Minnesota's College of Education, and published in peer-reviewed journals. The intervention and exercise programs were developed using scientific literature and published research articles (11), as well as the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine-Approved fitness regimen for adults. The interventions included three to six weeks of aerobic exercise of 45–60 minutes at a steady state, with three to four minutes of brief rests, and five to eight minutes of rest and moderate to vigorous resistance exercises with a 15–20 minute rest interval between the exercise sessions. An individual is defined to be fit if their 1-RM and 1–2 min of 30–60 minute aerobic exercise is at a 1% and 2% variance from their VO 2max. The exercise program was designed so that participants were challenged in aerobic exercises at a moderate intensity and were able to maintain the exercise intensity for 30–60 minutes. For exercises that did not fit the intervention guidelines, this level of training was set at no more than an hour of vigorous resistance or no more than three hours of cardiovascular exercise.

Averaging the number of participants was very important to assess the amount of variance between people and what activities would be selected by the study investigators. For example, the number of participants in this study varied by more than 10% depending on the year of recruitment and the specific year of the study, with the greatest variation within the 10–14% range (11). Thus, when averaged across years, a randomized group could have more variability than a non-randomized group.

Question: Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients? You can also find some useful information and links below.

The NZ Health Survey shows that most New Zealanders (86% nationally, 78% among people aged 45+ years) experienced their first deaths during the first quarter of their lives, with the second quarter of one's life being the second most common period.

During the decade of 1999–2000, the median age at death increased from 46 to 51 years.

Deaths by sex/age are particularly high among women and between 20–44 year olds.

This means that many people are left to grapple in silence with the questions about their age at death when they need to know what has happened to them. The New Zealand National Health Survey asks people about their age at death, as well as their age when they were born and their birthplace in New Zealand.

This is because death by age does not appear for everyone who dies, but it is important to remember the difference between the age at death and age when you were born. People may remain alive if their birth year and the year when they die fall within the years covered by the NZNHS birth cohort.

Question: Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement? Abstract

Abstract Objective To compare kinematic parameters of the knee and hip joints and to identify subluxation mechanisms. Design Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients referred for knee or hip replacement. Setting Case series at an operating theatre after operative knee joint replacement. Participants Participants were 1065 patients referred for knee or hip replacement. Instrumentation Knee and hip joint motion parameters and kinematics of the hip and knee joints were objectively recorded using ultrasound and radiological techniques. Kinematic parameters were compared between subjects before surgery (<0.12 mV) and immediately following knee or hip replacement (0.12–0.25 mV) with the exception of the leg extensor pull, which was calculated independently by the subject's position and time of observation. Results In the overall group of patients, mean (SD) values of kinematic parameters were not significantly correlated to age after surgery (r = –0.083, P = 0.061). The mean (SD) values of the knee kinematics and its variability before and after knee replacement were not significantly different (range, 0.02–0.12 mV; P = 0.945). Mean (SD) values for the hip kinematics were significantly higher than those for the knee kinematics and its variability (range, 0.02–0.04 mV; P = 0.013) but not significantly different after surgery. The joint kinematics and the knee kinematics of patients who had undergone a total knee replacement were not significantly different after surgery in the overall group (r = 0.021, P = 0.872). However, the mean (SD) values of the leg extensor pull were significantly higher after the total knee replacement (range, 0.021–0.18 mV; P = 0.008 compared with the values prior to knee replacement) than after the knee replacement (range, 0.039–0.04 mV; P = 0.014) (Table). In the overall group, the mean (SD) values of the thigh extensor pull were significantly higher after the total knee replacement (range, 0.020–0.16 mV; P = 0.009) than after the complete knee replacement (range, 0.036–0.01 mV; P = 0.013) (Table). Conclusions We assessed the effect of unilateral knee or hip replacement on knee and hip kinematics, and found no significant modification of these kinematic parameters. These kinematics did not vary significantly between subjects before or after surgery. The leg extensor pull was not modified after surgery. Keywords: hip knee, femoral neck, hip range of motion, hip joint, unilateral, joint kinematics, leg extensor pull, leg extensor pull of patients with total knee replacement

Kinematic evaluation of the knee in the operating theatre during knee joint replacement is essential if a new joint can be reconstructed.1 The purpose of this study was to measure the peak torque of the knee extensor muscles from three independent positions. The peak torque (kTmax) is calculated as the velocity of the peak EMG during the maximal twitch in the ankle or leg extensor muscle during the maximum extension of the ankle or leg by a single agonist.2,3 A peak torque of between 2.5 and 6.5 N·m−2 or 2.5 and 3.5 N·cm−2, respectively, has been reported for patients with complete vs partial knee replacement.4–6 The knee is regarded as the most unstable joint in the human body and its extensor and flexor components are the most likely to be affected in knee replacement.2,7 Therefore, in the surgical setting, it is highly desirable to assess in more detailed detail the kinematics of the knee during surgery.8 The purpose of this study was to compare the kinematic parameters of the hip and knee joints and to identify subluxation mechanisms for the hip and knee joints to prevent instability and to minimize any risk of impingement. A series of individual clinical and radiologic studies were conducted to evaluate the kinematic parameters of the patients before and after implantation of a standard knee appliance. We also compared the kinematic parameters of the patients before and after implantation of a knee extensor appliance that used a large-diameter and one-piece strap, and a femoral neck brace, such as an adductor device that was implanted in the right knee, and a knee prosthesis that was implanted in the left knee.

Methods Participants In this retrospective study, all patients referred for knee or hip replacement between April 1998 and June 2000 were included. Patients who lost one or more limbs had to be excluded. Patients"
Question: Are serum leptin levels a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are serum leptin levels a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer? Why it might help: Insulin resistance causes excessive caloric intake and increases triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) levels, both of which may increase the risk of lung cancer. The relationship between insulin resistance and atherosclerosis is well supported and demonstrated by the Framingham Study. The association between lower serum leptin levels and the risk of lung cancer is not as well established. It may be related to the effects of leptin on metabolism and lipid metabolism: The link between insulin resistance and obesity, specifically the relation between body weight and serum leptin levels, is a well established phenomenon. Leptin is secreted by adipose tissue, and it does not require adipose tissue to possess it. In this vein, the hormone appears to play a key role in satiety, as has been verified by various studies investigating how leptin levels relate to appetite. It is important to keep in mind that leptin levels are affected by several factors, all of which are modifiable and can lead to improved body weight. Summary: Insulin resistance and obesity are well-understood risk factors for the development of lung cancer. The relationship between the circulating leptin level and the risk of the disease is unclear. Insulin resistance, obesity, and coronary artery disease all have been implicated in the development of lung cancer. Low serum leptin levels may attenuate the progression of lung cancer. The best strategy in preventing lung cancer is to achieve a healthy weight.

Question: What kind of foods should be avoided in order to minimize the risk of developing cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What kind of foods should be avoided in order to minimize the risk of developing cancer? Why it might help: Cancer is a disease of civilization, and while it is generally recognized that the incidence of cancer is declining, it still occurs at an alarming rate, particularly among young adults, and the incidence of cancer has risen markedly in developed countries as a result of the use of certain carcinogenic drugs. It is particularly important to focus efforts on dietary choices that are associated with lower risks of the disease. Summary: The intake of high-monounsaturated fat and diets high in refined carbohydrates increase the risk of cancer. Most Americans are currently at risk for developing breast cancer and colon cancer, particularly if they do not consume adequate amounts of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Studies have shown that men who are overweight and have high body fat levels are at increased risk for developing breast cancer, and for developing colon cancer, although not all studies point to the same causes. The risk of developing cancer is not only increased by obesity in healthy people, but also by low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. The effects of high-monounsaturated fat intake on cancer risk are unknown, although recent studies suggest, as do others, that a low dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Summary: Consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol is associated with a lower risk of developing cancer, including pancreatic cancer. Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. The benefits of an omega-3 fatty acid–rich diet may depend on specific dietary choices, depending on the amount and type of fatty acids consumed.

Conclusion

Given that the incidence of certain cancers is increasing, in most parts of the world cancer is likely to be on the rise for the next few generations. As a general rule, the mortality data can be summarized in several graphs. They display different patterns between different regions of the world and some time periods. From this graph we can get a sense of the trends in cancer risk that are occurring throughout the world, as well as the changes that need to occur to significantly reduce the rates of cancer.

Figure 1

Trends in Death Rate Versus Time Period Data by Country


The figure shows overall death rate versus time period (per 100,000) based on death registry data from 1981-1990 (left panel) and 1997-2007 (right panel). The curves represent the total data by death registry and countries at risk for cancer for 1981-1990 and 1997-2007. The solid lines indicate significant reductions in the rate of cancer mortality, whereas the dashed lines show the rates increasing. As can be seen, several populations experienced significant declines in their cancer mortality rates, or rates in regions of high-and-slow cancer mortality. Among many of these countries, notably, China, India, and South Korea, the rates were similar, at less than 2% and less than 5%, respectively.

Question: Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

It is currently unclear why the KCNQ1 gene contains this stretch. The gene is found on the surface of mitochondria where it functions in regulating mitochondrial function. For example, it controls how many calories are available to mitochondria each day (Kanagawa, et al. 2015). It also controls the amount of oxygen that is consumed by mitochondria. It is hypothesized that KCNQ1 controls the ability of the mitochondria to produce and release energy. That the KCNQ1 protein binds to its binding site on the mitochondrial DNA, which leads to a protein complex known as the mitochondrial fusion factor (MFF), which binds to the enzyme of the mitochondrial fusion protein called the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and is able to initiate the process by which mitochondria produce and release energy. This leads to heart disease. Since humans inherit this mutation from their parents, this hypothesis fits the observation of many individuals that this gene has a strong correlation with heart disease. A previous report suggested that the KCNQ1 gene may play a role in heart disease, however, no causal association between the KCNQ1 gene and heart disease was found. The current study was designed to see if the KCNQ1 gene could be linked with heart disease using biomarkers that are specific to heart disease. These include markers of lipid (lipid) content, heart function parameters

The heart rate of individuals with mitochondrial mutations for the KCNQ1 gene who were given a drug called riluzole (a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor). The researchers measured the blood hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone on a daily basis in 15 subjects who had either been taking riluzole or had not been taking it. The researchers observed that participants who had the KCNQ1 gene mutation who received riluzole experienced an increase in the hormone which was correlated with the heart rate. In addition, heart rate was determined every 5 minutes, and the number of beats per minute had an inverse correlation to the levels of cholesterol, total cholesterol, and LDL (bad) cholesterol.

The authors concluded:

As a result of these and other biomarkers, the authors propose that the Kcnq1-KF1M5 mutation may influence cardiovascular health by affecting the expression of the MAPK pathway, which in turn results in the increase in the levels of the hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and thereby the blood level of cholesterol. This study provides empirical evidence that the heart rate level and the levels of cholesterol and total cholesterol are directly correlated with the expression of the MAPK pathway, which in turn results in the increases in triglycerides. Therefore, the heart was more active in the high KCNQ1-N4M4 gene group than in the placebo group. The study also provides evidence that the presence of the Kcnq1-KF1M5 gene mutation may lead to the presence of oxidized beta-1-glycoprotein, a marker of increased oxidative stress. This may in turn influence the level of the stress hormone eicosanoid, which was also observed in the MAPK pathway, which in turn may lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques at arterial walls. Based on these observations, Kanagawa et al. (2015) propose that the heart rate may be associated with the expression of the MAPK pathway, cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Question: Are adult body circumferences associated with height? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are adult body circumferences associated with height? A: Adult (adult age at menarche, and at menarche plus age at first birth have not been associated). This is because other factors such as pre-operative weight and age are present. The male body dimensions, with a height to body weight ratio of 0.71, can be divided into 3 categories. Body contours of height depend on the presence of 2 features: the male sex ratio (a lower ratio than among females) and the male height to body weight ratio of 0.67. Body contours of height are influenced by: BMI (obesity), sex (male), height (female) & sex ratio (a higher ratio than among females). The average adult male height to body weight ratio is 0.71. This means that men in any age group have body contours that will naturally lead to weight gain or loss. The average adult male height (not counting the weight gain & loss) is 0.85 and is thus approximately 5 cm taller. (Table 1).

Table 1 BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Ratio of body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/ female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, female/female, female/female and gender Both BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, female/female, female/female and gender Body height, female/female, female/female and gender Body height, female/female, female/ female and gender Body height, female/female, female/female and gender There is a strong positive correlation between BMI and male height, a correlation that is especially strong among men aged 20 to 39 years, 0.67 (0.90) for all sexes (Table 2). Both the body contours of height and the body lengths (from the midpoint of the thigh below the knee across both sides) are negatively correlated with BMI. The total weight gained or lost must be at least 1.5 cm for males and 2.5 cm for females for the BMI to be 0.7 (Table 3). Table 2.

The BMI-height correlation with body contours of height and sex ratio does not remain as strong as the body length-weight correlation with BMI. Body contours of height (obesity > height, or weight > weight) are positively associated with BMI and negatively associated with height and sex ratio. They are also positively associated with female BMI (0.81) and negatively associated with male BMIs (0.65). There is a strong negative correlation between total weight and gender in men and a strong positive correlation with BMI in men.

Question: Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients?

Answer: Corrected QT can predict left ventricular hypertrophy by increasing the time it takes for the heart to return to resting rhythm. This increased cardiac output enables the heart to pump faster to compensate for the decrease in the heart's oxygen supply during a contraction.

Question: How can a correct QT interval be used to differentiate patients with congestive heart failure from normal patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How can a correct QT interval be used to differentiate patients with congestive heart failure from normal patients?

Answer: Correct QT interval (QTc) does not differentiate between normal and congestive heart failure, a common common cause of death after a heart attack. Patients with a right atrial defect can have a better chance of surviving a heart attack than patients with a left atrial defect. Also, the patient who has QTc>120 minutes before a heart attack is more likely to survive. The more time the left ventricle sits at rest, the more favorable the patient's survival odds are.

Question: How can a correct QT interval determine when a patient had a stroke (hemodynamic instability) and also when a left ventricular hypertrophy occurred? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How can a correct QT interval determine when a patient had a stroke (hemodynamic instability) and also when a left ventricular hypertrophy occurred?

Answer: Correct QT intervals can distinguish between patients with stroke and normal cardiac events by indicating when stroke occurred and why the abnormal ventricle was formed. If no left ventricular pathology can be found in the blood sampling immediately after heart attack, the patient may have been correctly diagnosed with a right ventricular fibrillation. If an abnormal ventricle is found in the hospital with heart arrest or sudden cardiac death, the patient is most likely to be diagnosed with congestive heart failure. The QT interval at the end of the time of stroke was almost never used in initial detection of left ventricular hypertrophy.

Question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of an accurate QT interval? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of an accurate QT interval?

Answer: A more accurate QT interval can be used to determine when a patient has had a first stroke (hemodynamic instability). Stroke can happen after about 10 years of follow up in most patients who have a QT interval of 50+ minutes. Because heart conditions such as hypertrophy and ventricular dysfunction frequently are seen decades after the initial stroke, inaccurate QT interval can be used to confirm the diagnosis of heart disease that may have gone unrecognized when the patient presented with heart failure. Patients with long-standing heart disease often do not have a specific cause such as a right atrial defect (left anterior descending defect) or a family history of heart disease. Furthermore, an"
Question: Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity?

Answer: A study published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine demonstrated that the position of the aortic arch is very important to the rate of aortic injury. The authors examined four different groups -- football players, hockey players, weight lifters, and endurance athletes -- and examined injuries and injury severity in all four groups within the same season. According to the authors, ""The athletes in each group had identical arthroscopic procedures, no differences in post-operative status, and similar athletic level. However, in the one group that received immediate surgery, the aortic arch depth and aortic arch thickness, and the thickness of the aortic arch itself were significantly diminished. These differences were not found in any other group. The authors stated that the reduction in arch thickness, which may be considered a ""shock"" in itself, did not show any significant trend over time. The authors added that there exists a ""metabolic threshold"" for this reduction in diameter, and the threshold decreases with subsequent months.""1

A common myth about aortic injury is that ""Aortic damage is caused by the heart pumping out blood and the arteries swelling, but aortic injuries are not caused by that.""2 This has led to increased the use of arterial infusions (heart-lung bypass) while increasing the rates of aortic fractures. It has been shown by numerous studies from the late 1980s through to about 2006, that in-hospital aortic-arteriac surgeries significantly increase the rate of coronary artery bypass grafts. However, studies show that the patients at aortic-arteriac surgery surgery have a higher risk of suffering aortic-arterial graft complications, such as aortic dissection, anterior aortic dissection, and aortic dissection with atherosclerosis.

A study of more than 250 patients who went through aortic-arteriac surgery from January 1991 to December 2003 compared patients without ACL injuries to those who did with the same patients, but with the ACL injuries treated by infusions of blood products. Patients who had no ACL injuries were matched for age, gender, and medical history. Patients who received aortic-arteriac surgery demonstrated a 24 percent higher rate of graft complications than patients who had ACL surgeries, but the difference was not significant.3 (In this study, the use of arterial transfusions and/or arterial infusions of blood products could have contributed to the difference.)4

It is important to note that aortic injury has many causes. The incidence of a sub-arachnoid hemorrhage is increased in patients with acute aortic aneurysm disease.5 Aortic dissection and subsequent aortic dissection with atherosclerosis usually develop between 5-15 days after the surgery, and rarely occur within days of the surgery. Aortic dissection with atherosclerosis usually develops between 4-72 hours after the surgery.

Abstract: To our knowledge, there is no published case series, prospective multicenter, randomized trial, or cohort analysis of the effect of high-dose metronidazole for treatment of late stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma with or without multiple relapses. Thus, no studies have examined the risks associated with the treatment of late-stage and non-Hodgkin lymphoma with or without multiple relapses with high-dose metronidazole. If the evidence presented is convincing, treating late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma with metronidazole for three years appears to be reasonable. Additionally, the potential benefit of high-dose metronidazole in patients at higher risk is noteworthy; however, high-dose metronidazole is currently a potentially toxic drug.

However, many patients have undergone an effective pharmacologic treatment. This is the first of many articles detailing the design and rationale of this multidrug protocol in this setting. A systematic review and meta-analysis are used with data from the treatment of advanced neoplasms with combination therapy. The evidence for safety of the combination therapy is sufficient to support the use of combination therapy.

Abstract: The immunotherapy of late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma is controversial and some results have been reported and are being studied. We review recent preclinical and clinical studies that may assist in understanding the use and efficacy of immunotherapy in late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The benefits of immunotherapy in late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma appear promising. The use of these agents requires knowledge of these patients and consideration of the patient's current immunosuppression.

Abstract: The success of immunotherapy in late-stage (5 years) patients with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma is controversial. In the early 1990's, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 10 subjects who had a median median T-cell count of 600,000 cells per mm3 appeared promising. However, a randomized control trial of a high dose of metronidazole and 5 mL/kg/min of intravenous vitamin C in late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma failed to demonstrate significant benefits of the medication in terms of disease resolution or recurrence. In the present study, we retrospectively examined the effect of immunotherapy in late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where there appears to be scant evidence of benefit. Our findings provide the necessary rationale for"
Question: Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer?

Breast and Nipple Cancer

There are many factors that cause breast and nipple cancer, such as genetic factors, genetic variations of estrogen, and the number of cells that are undergoing cell division.

Breast cancer tends to develop around the breast, but it may be localized to areas other than the breast. Nipple cancer usually develops over the nipple or the areola, about two dozen to five dozen to a dozen cells in a tiny area.

The nipple and surrounding tissue are considered not to be a significant source of breast cancer, and there is no evidence that radiation can cause breast cancer. Only 2% to 5% of women need further treatment to remove some of these cells.

During mastectomy, the surgeon cuts off the breast, usually at the nipple, and replaces it with another breast to keep the nipple from being infected with cancer-causing bacteria. About one-third to one-half of the tumors left over are then removed to make the nipple better able to provide breast milk.

Nipple wall radiation is not usually needed after mastectomy.

Breast cancer can also develop between the nipple wall, from within the nipple, and between the nipple and the glandular tissue at the breast called carcinoma in situ (CIS), which are benign tumors. If treated before cancer arises, one of these forms of cancer may develop.

There are some tumors that require mastectomy (such as breast tumor cells) to reduce their chances of developing cancer after they are removed. Breast tumor removal may be used to relieve symptoms such as breast tenderness or breast pain, or to prevent further cancer from developing. Sometimes it may be used to treat certain symptoms of breast cancer without mastectomy (e.g., benign breast tumors that are too small to be removed or for other reasons).

Although many reports have linked mammographic screening, or more recently, mammograms, with decreasing incidence of breast cancer in women, they never found a relationship. Therefore, some breast cancer screening programs may still be appropriate even with mammography at increased levels.

The following guidelines describe breast cancer screening results related to chest wall radiation:

The annual chest floor radiography (Breast Radiation Screening) test can help distinguish between normal and other forms of breast cancer.

The breast CT and breast MRI are only used to screen for breast cancers that occur on the breast. This usually means there is little risk of cancer developing in the rest of the body.

If you have had a breast or nipple cancer in the last 5 6 years (a possible lifetime risk of more than 5%) you should have mammogram examination when your nipples have turned white. If your nipple's turning dark and you're not sure, talk to a mammologist or health care provider to rule out a lifetime risk.

Question: Can bisphosphonate treatment be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can bisphosphonate treatment be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility? Abstract: To study the effect of this compound on the development of skeletal fragility of premature infants, we used three- and seven-month-old children. The study aims at finding out the long-term effects of the treatment. A sample of 30 subjects will be enrolled in this study. It will have the following characteristics:

Subjects:

Thirty-five premature babies

Six-month interval between the date of administration and the time of randomization The procedure:

The children were randomly assigned to receive either bisphenol A (10 μg) or a Bisphenol S (10 μg) (n = 24). In addition, 30 children were given an oral formulation (Bisphenol S 50 μg) which has a significantly higher concentration of bisphosphonate in the diet. Bisphenol S was added to the group receiving the Bisphenol A. The children was placed under constant monitoring for the duration of the treatment.

Results:

At one month, the mean scores of skeletal fragility in the children receiving the Bisphenol S group became significantly lower (mean [±SD] scores 9.10 [10.92] on the 4-point scoring system) compared to the children who received the Bisphenol A group (16.80 [18.36] points). At 7 months, a significantly higher ratio of the number of bones in the skull of the children receiving the Bisphenol S group was observed (17.22 [18.20] points) than in the cases in the Bisphenol A group (8.50 [8.21]; P < 0.05). At 8 months, a significantly higher ratio of the number of bones in the feet of the children receiving the Bisphenol S group was observed than in the cases in the Bisphenol A group (15.38 [16.75] points) The results indicate that in three-month-old infants the ratio of the number of bones in the skull between the two groups is strongly correlated with the decrease in the number of developing bones. The bisphenol compounds have a very beneficial effect on the skeletal development of the premature infants. They decrease the number of developing bones. This study is published in European Journal of Paediatric Cardiology; (12): 11-18, 2014

Comment: If the children received the bisphenol compounds, they can experience a decrease in bone strength but there are no adverse effects on bone mass. There are no adverse effects on bone mass found in the study participants. There has been a substantial increase in the number of growth plates and the number of bone minerals. The study confirms that Bisphenol S, particularly at doses in the 20 μg/kg range, does not affect the quality of an infant's growth plates which results in growth benefits. The research should continue on the side effects because the effects of bisphosphonate at lower doses may be greater than the ones experienced once the dose is higher. Bottom Line: The findings of the study suggest that bisphenol S has a favorable effect on a preemie's growth plate, and this finding is promising as a method for treating growth defects in premature infants.

How to Tell If You are Drinking Bisphosphonate In Children For many reasons, including the following, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pregnant women and parents not administer bisphenol S to pregnant or breastfeeding women who also drink alcoholic beverages. Bisphenol S is a known human carcinogen (14) and is the active ingredient in ""Tylenol"" (Tylenol, L'Oréal) (15), and ""K2, the painkiller"" (16). Although there is no doubt about it, Bisphenol S can inhibit the effects of acetaminophen (17). Although the link to acetaminophen is controversial, acetaminophen is also an ingredient found in some Bisphenol S chews. Many studies suggest that this can interfere with the effects of acetaminophen on a child's development (18). However, studies also show that children who are exposed to this compound seem to have normal bone mineral ratios, a normal metabolic profile, normal growth, and normal IQ. (19) Therefore, use is not recommended until further studies can fully assess the effects of bisphenol S on a child's bones. Children should also not be exposed to a Bisphenol S chew containing more than 20 mg/kg. The recommended amount to consume for children 6 months of age is 0.75 mg/kg to ensure a dose lower than 20 mg/kg (4 μg/kg) for the purpose of this study. (4"
"Question: Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs? I. Overview of the Discussion. Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture compared with acute primary surgery of patients at high risk of hip fracture: a meta-analysis. Arthroscopy. 2002; 31: 1-7. II. Results of the Research and Methodology. In general, regional or general anesthesia is used to perform surgery in patients with acute hip fracture who are at low to moderate risk for hip fracture. Our systematic review was focused on all studies that compared the safety and effectiveness of regional anesthesia and anesthesia alone with no surgical intervention. Studies were evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration criteria for randomised controlled trials, with the quality of the trial and study design evaluated independently. Studies were categorised according to the treatment for patients with hip fracture. All studies were required to meet the following four criteria: randomisation, blinding or concealment of patients, the duration of the intervention, and number of patients participating in the intervention and comparing the treatments compared between patients in regional anesthesia and their surgical counterparts in the treatment group. There was insufficient information available to determine the exact use of regional anesthesia for patients with acute hip fracture. For studies that compared only general anesthesia with regional anesthesia, the absolute number of patients with acute hip fracture was not known. In many studies, there was no information about the regional use of general anesthesia or regional anesthesia alone in the acute treatment. A limited number of studies assessed the regional use of general anesthesia, general anesthesia in acute surgery or general anesthesia alone in acute primary surgery in patients with acute hip fracture. The average number of patients with hip fracture, the regional use of general anesthesia, and the number of patients participating in regional versus general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone were not independently assessed. We investigated and compared regional anesthesia and all other surgical interventions used in the treatment group by comparing the absolute and relative improvement in functional quality of life, quality of patient life, ambulatory outcome, and costs of treatment in patients with hip fracture, regardless of surgical intervention or regional and general anesthesia use. We also assessed the comparative effectiveness between patients from each treatment group and compared this to the overall difference in the overall difference between the groups. The results are summarised in Table : Table 1 Study Author Year Country Patients Randomized Controlled Trials Quality of Studies Comparison Between Conditions Treatment Group Comparisons Limitations Coady-Stokes E, Bercanu P, Bevacqua A, Stenzi S 2014; 1:1,5,17–18. Comparison of regional anesthesia in 1 to 1,5,17 to 18 months. N-acetyl cysteine in acute hip fracture treated for up to 18 months with regional anesthesia and/or in submassive osteochondritis with or without general anesthesia is associated with faster resolution of hip pain of up to 16% compared with no treatment. The mean time to complete recovery from pain reduction is increased by up to 14% in the no treatment group. Results: No difference in pain score between patients with acute hip osteochondritis and patients with acute knee osteoarthritis who received regional anesthesia versus no treatment. However, no significant differences were found in the percentage with improvement in pain. The increase in hip pain in the no treatment group was comparable with that in the treatment group. Kneeling height, pain, functional impairment, and ambulatory outcome were not different between patients with hip fracture and normal individuals with submucosal osteoarthritis. Results: Conclusion: There is no evidence that regional anesthesia or no treatment decreases both pain and functional improvement in patients with acute hip fracture compared with general anesthesia alone. No consistent effect of no treatment or regional anesthesia in reducing pain level compared with no treatment. N.acetyl cysteine is a strong, well-tolerated anti-inflammatory drug widely used in the emergency room. The analgesic efficacy of n-acetyl cysteine is related to the number and duration of administration in clinical trials. We investigated the efficacy, dose-response, and the safety of these drugs in the acute treatment for patients with hip fracture or submucosal osteoarthritis given either general anesthesia or regional anesthesia. The results are summarised in Table. This systematic review did not find a difference in the rates of postoperative pain between general or regional anesthesia groups in the treatment groups compared with the treatment group given no surgical intervention. This review did not find a difference between the numbers of patients for which both local and regional analgesia was provided for patients with hip fracture compared with general anesthesia alone. The number of patients needing no intervention in this study was 2,821, of which 2,749 (61%) received primary treatment or postoperative care; 2,7"
Question: Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse?

Hypothetic hypothesis: The clinical effect of drugs used to manage hypertension is to elevate heart rate, blood pressure, or both, with a secondary effect of decreasing or restoring blood sugar tolerance or blood pressure to normal. Patients whose treatment has an effect on heart rate, blood pressure, or both will have higher rates of death, hospital discharge, or institutionalization. Patients whose treatment has no effect on either of these outcomes will have lower rates of both.

Relevance: The primary effect of pharmacotherapy is to normalize blood pressure or reduce blood glucose levels to normal levels. The secondary effect is reduction or correction of the presence of hypertension and/or of disease in hypertensives (diabetes mellitus, obesity, prehypertension). In this case, the effect will be attributed to medication, not to a single cause.

Methods

Study Design: The Study: Randomized. The randomization of patients to treatment and to placebo (Placebo) controls was carried out using a computer generated randomization list from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Study Treatment: Both the Control and the Treatment groups received standard medication in the treatment phase. Placebo was a no-cost, patient-supplied, commercially available pill that contained caffeine and saccharin. The control group received a non-pharmacological placebo (a solution of saline without caffeine and saccharin).

Patients: All admitted or treated to the Veterans Affairs Health Care System for acute or chronic hypertension. Between March 1, 2001, and January 29, 2003, 549 patients were enrolled in the study; of these, 312 were randomized to receiving Placebo (placebo: n = 183) or Treatment (placebo:n = 183). Patients were considered to be receiving clinical drug for hypertension if their initial mean blood pressure or SBP was 120 mm Hg or greater, or if their blood pressure was 140 mm Hg or greater on any of the four measurements of blood pressure, measured at baseline, on the first day in the second week, and every week for at least 8 weeks.

Sample Size: Randomized. At the time of randomization, subjects had a mean age of 65.8 years (range = 42–90 years), with a median age of 50 years (range = 31–70 years). Controls were identified by matching on gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index, age, and body height. Each subject was matched with at least three patients at least one week apart.

Excess Standardized Data: We extracted a sample of data at baseline and at the end of the study, including measures of prehypertension, posthypertension, and drug interactions.

Study Interventions: All patients were required to have taken medication and complete clinical assessments at baseline. Drug interactions were assessed by reviewing the medications patients had taken on the day of randomization (n = 312). Patients who had received either allopurinol or any of the other drugs, as well as other medications commonly used to treat hypertension, were excluded from the analysis.

Statistical Analysis: All calculations were performed using the SAS statistical software system, and the primary and secondary outcomes were compared with a 2-sided P value, a α level of ≤0.05, and an appropriate nonparametric chi-square test.

Results: The mean follow-up period for the Treatment group was 9.3 years (range: 3.3–12.6 years), and 553 (97.8%) subjects responded to randomization, leaving 793 (75%) subjects enrolled and a mean age of 62 (SD = 25.9). The mean age for all patients in the study was 60 (SD = 23.3) years (range = 37.2–90.0 years). The mean (SD) of the patient population at baseline was 71 (SD = 31.8). Patients in the treatment group were slightly older than the control group on each endpoint, and were less likely to be female (P =.003) when compared at baseline and at the end of the study. There were no differences between prehypertension (mean difference, −0.5 (SD = 0.3); 95% CI, −1.9 to −0.1) and posthypertension (mean difference, –0.7 (SD = 0.9); 95% CI, −1.9 to −0.2) assessments, but there were significant differences between Treatment (P =.01) and Control (P =.006) assessments for days 1 (P =.008); days 3, 5, 6, 10, 14, 21, and 28 (P ="
Question: Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Treadmill testing of children who have Spina Bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake? A. Question: I have a 4-year-old child with Spina Bifida. This child has a normal resting heart rate and a resting blood pressure. The heart rate is high (40-50 bpm). The child is a recreational runner and runs at an easy pace to the home before bedtime. His body temperatures are normal. I'm wondering whether there is anything abnormal with his blood oxygen level and whether there is any information to be gained from monitoring his oxygen levels. A. Answer: This is a good question. There is some indication that in the young child, during periods of activity, the peak cardiac output may exceed the oxygen consumption calculated from a standard resting heart rate, and the oxygen consumption may be reduced. In my view, this would have to be regarded as a transient condition that does not affect any other organ or the child's respiratory or circulatory systems. It would not be relevant to the normal physiological functioning of the heart. It will be helpful if you could discuss with the child the effects of this condition and the various changes he would require to keep the problem under control; i.e. rest, use of oxygen, exercise, etc. The key in this case is as follows: (a) that the peak of the heart's work is below the oxygen consumption required to sustain respiration; (b) that the oxygen consumption for a maximal oxygen uptake is greater in the early morning (when oxygen uptake peaks) that in the late evening (when oxygen consumption decreases). This is, I think, the crux of the problem in the case of the young child. It would be helpful if you could help the younger child to adjust his daily routine so that it involves greater activity during the early morning or late evening. I also wonder whether the heart rate of the young child will decline more gradually in a similar way to that seen in the elderly. Treadmill testing of children with spina bifida has been done on a number of occasions, the results of which are not yet available. These tests are designed to measure the level of oxidative stress in blood and muscle tissue at different times during the day. These levels are the starting point for some treatments to be applied to improve the body's ability to react to oxidative stress. However, most of the research done to date has relied primarily on measuring oxygen uptake in blood and muscle. At best, you should be able to infer the age of a child from the oxygen consumption he has in a standardized laboratory test. Unfortunately, I think that children and adolescents who are spina bifida have less to show than older children and adolescents who carry other, non-neurological impairments. Therefore, it is my contention that the oxygen consumption of the young child will be similar to that of adults with a similar level of function. This may in part be because of some of the changes in the child's vascular system and the amount of work his heart is doing to cope with the increase in oxidative stress. I would be interested to hear the findings of a clinical investigation of the young child and if there is any indication of the effects of intervention. I'm not suggesting that this young child has any of the diseases that are commonly associated with spina bifida but rather that he will be less severely affected than he would be if he were a child with none of the impairments. (Answer to a question sent from the Office for Standards in Education in August 2003 and a similar question sent to the Office for Standards in Employment in August 2003) If it is in the best interests of his health to undertake an investigation of his respiratory function and the oxygen consumption of his heart, then your doctor may be pleased to discuss with you the possibilities of your participation in such an investigation.

We have discussed the potential benefits of blood readings as a predictor of risk for developing coronary heart disease and that blood level fluctuations (e.g. a sudden fall in blood glucose) may contribute to this risk.5.4, 6.12 However, there is only a small body of evidence on blood glucose testing in the context of the development of a new medical condition and therefore is not a suitable screening tool.1.12, 1.43 There is currently limited evidence on the effects of blood pressure on the development, prognosis and prevention of cardiovascular disease in adolescents and adults.1.18–21 There is a small body of evidence on the effects of blood pressure on kidney function and risk of developing cardiovascular disease in adults.7.41 However, no data is available about the effects of blood pressure on the development, prognosis and prevention of cardiovascular disease in young children.2.27"

"Question: Is there any evidence of a ""July effect"" in patients undergoing major cancer surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:","

Q and A:

Can we use a mathematical model to predict a patient's survival with only three months' follow-up? Yes. This paper has been accepted for publication.

Does it matter if we find it wrong? No. There could be good reasons why a hospital doesn't show a survival benefit from a single-treatment trial. If a patient is sick and poorly informed, they're more likely to pay less for a single-treatment trial.

When did it happen? How often?

The first evidence that survival is improved with single-treatment trials came out in the mid-1980s — with about 700 patients. At that time, survival seemed to be pretty strongly associated with chemotherapy, at least among chemotherapy-neutrophils (which are closely related to natural killer cells). But that doesn't make sense for some reasons, most significantly that survival is a fairly low-order clinical outcome — it doesn't predict life expectancy, it doesn't affect other measures of good health, and not many people even survive as long as a few months after they have an infection or minor injury.

The first meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials on survival was published in 2006, and showed improvement among patients with leukemia (as well as several other cancer types), especially in the short-term. This was one of the first major conclusions that any hospital reported.

Can we use a mathematical model to predict a patient's survival with only three months' follow-up? Yes. This paper has been accepted for publication. Does it matter if we find it wrong? No. There could be good reasons why a hospital doesn't show a survival benefit from a multi-treatment trial. If a patient is sick and poorly informed, they're more likely to pay less for a multi-treatment trial.

When did it happen? How often?

If a person survives more than three months from a single chemotherapy drug, there's no evidence that the treatment was significantly better than placebo; in fact, the patients who started chemotherapy had worse performance. But that's not always the case.

The last meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials on survival came out about eight years ago. This analysis of randomized, controlled trials showed survival was improved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients by at least 30% relative to placebo, and survival was increased for acute lymphoblastic lymphoma patients with multiple tumors by 40% relative to placebo. A lot of people have been calling this outcome ""a good drug.""

Cancer deaths for all non-CJD related causes were down slightly between 2008 and 2010: The number of deaths from cancers of the respiratory system is down for nearly all causes except pancreatic cancer, which was down 7%, and prostate cancer was down 31%.

Can we use a mathematical model to predict a patient's survival with only three months' follow-up? Yes

The last meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials on survival came out about eight years ago. This analysis of randomized, controlled trials showed survival was improved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all cancers but ALL) patients by at least 30% relative to placebo; survival was increased for acute lymphoblastic lymphoma patients with multiple tumors by 40% relative to placebo; and prostate cancer was down 31%.

And some newer data that hasn't been published yet, but which may have some relevance, suggests that survival may be slightly greater than 50% among patients with aortic aplasia (thoracic aortic aneurysm), but probably more like 30% or more for non-STEMI (stem cell) related diseases. This effect of survival on cancer deaths was stronger for patients who initiated chemotherapy early than for patients who never did; it was probably about 40% in non-STIS patients, but probably less than 20% in STIS patients.

Can our results be trusted?

Most important among these recent developments on this front is that there have been a few more large, well-designed studies on survival versus cancer survival. Many cancer researchers, including some in my hospital, believe that the most important and likely cause of this discrepancy has been the widespread implementation of chemotherapy.

Unfortunately, for some people, chemotherapy is the only treatment they can afford. I've asked doctors in other hospitals to review the results of the published studies mentioned above to be able to confirm whether a survival advantage can truly be expected.

It bears repeating that even the newest evidence for survival-improving chemo is based on small trials, and does not necessarily show that the more effective chemo is being used any more in many patients.

In fact, some cancer researchers are now warning about the dangers of chemotherapy. My colleague Bruce A. Mendelsohn is a pioneer in identifying the differences between chemotherapy and ""neut"
Question: Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis?

Answer: In most cases, it is unnecessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube in choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis (CMIC) patients. The rationale and rationale of the absence of a nasobiliary drainage tube in CMIC is that the primary objective is to prevent symptomatic cholangitis in the setting of symptomatic or choledochial stenosis. With the advent during the last half century of a newer and increasingly effective procedure (procedure in the treatment of CMIC) for the noninvasive assessment and/or removal of bile duct contents, the frequency of cholangitis and bile duct obstruction has decreased. The nasobiliary removal is not warranted in CMIC in the absence of symptomatic cholangitis as the primary and the underlying pathology shows signs of cholangitis and/or stenosis (i.e., choles (1) or ulcers (3) in the duodenum, omental bile duct lesions and/or duodenal strictures in the jejunum, absence of bile flow and/or obstruction of the bile ducts).

However, the management of CMIC remains controversial, as in the U.S., no common nosocomial bacterial infection is found in CMIC despite the presence of some gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (4–5). If the diagnosis of Cholangioembolism on an endoscopy is in doubt, the nasobiliary drainage tube should be removed (6).

Clinical observations and outcomes following cholecystitis- and bile duct obstruction. Cholecystitis Cholecystitis occurs in cholangiopathy (7). Of significant concern in the management of cholangioembolism is the presence of choles with either ulceration or cholangitis (8). The cholangioembolism syndrome has been compared among Cholangios (9,10). Choles of varying severity, both systemic and disseminated, occur with higher frequency after surgical removal of the omentum, with or without the use of a transnasal echocardiogram (9,10). The prevalence of the presence of cholangitis is higher in patients requiring endoscopic or invasive removal of the bile duct following cholangiopathy (10–14). Cholangioembolic infection Cholecystitis is an inflammatory disease with ulceration, pain, and fluid retention (15). Intestinal cholangitis, particularly with cholangios, are also associated with acute gastrointestinal discomfort or anemia, and there appears to be increased incidence of urological complications (16–18). Several investigators have reported that in 20% of patients requiring endoscopic surgical removal of the biliary tract, cholangiolipies are detected following operative cholangiopathy (9,20). In a study comparing choledocholithiasis-induced cholangiopathy to bile duct or renal tract stenosis, the rate of choledocholithiasis-induced cholangiopathy was greater than the rate in those with bile duct stenosis (9). The frequency of choledocholithiasis-induced cholangiopathy varies in patients requiring endoscopic removal of the pancreatic canals (n = 5) and in patients without canal stenosis with choledocholithiasis (n = 11) (9).

A recent study reported a case of an endoscopic cholangiopathy in the setting of bile duct obstruction. In patients who underwent endoscopic cholangiopathy prior to bile duct stenotic stenosis (n = 38), bile was retained by the nasobiliary route in 37% versus 16% with bile tubes in 18% to 44% of patients (7). The study was undertaken based on histopathologic data that included findings in 20% of B-lymphoid and 20% of B-cell lymphomas. Cholecystitis, with or without bile duct obstruction, occurs more frequently in patients with increased risk factors for systemic (19,20).

A prospective study investigating the rate of cholangiolipies in patients undergoing endoscopic cholangiopathy was conducted (9). The authors reported a total of 1.6 cases per 1000 cholangios occurring at the time of examination for endoscopic cholang"
Question: Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," If a public health emergency were to occur, and all vaccines were unavailable because of extreme winter cold, whether emergency staff could obtain vaccines from the community? What would be the consequences for the health and safety of the public?

(JTA) – It won't happen for a few weeks, according to a statement issued by the Obama HHS Secretary Tom Price. But that doesn't mean, he says, that everyone has lost hope. ""If we have more extreme cold weather it is our best defense since the creation of vaccinations,"" Price, who as health commissioner in the 1990s and early 2000s has directed all federal agencies to ensure that vaccines are available, has said.

Price was responding to the question that an editorial in the Jerusalem Post asked Price before the Health Committee in the Senate this week: ""What if every child was vaccinated for polio, tetanus, and measles? What if the public health emergency were to unfold in the United States?"" Price responded, ""The public health emergency of the 21st century, yes.""

Price's answer suggests that the current problem with the nation's public health emergency stockpile has a strong link to the outbreak in which 1,847 children died in the southern U.S. this January from a virus that is endemic in the communities in Georgia and South Carolina, and spread through the northeastern part of the country, starting with New York in December. The outbreak was linked to someone who brought the vaccine to his or her hometown of Atlanta, Price said.

""A public health emergency would apply to all of them,"" he added. ""We have our stock and there will be the necessary resources to provide them to the public.""

The U.S. public health alert system is supposed to work two ways, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: to make people aware of the threat posed by diseases so that they will get a vaccine, and to make them aware of opportunities to get the vaccine to avoid becoming infected themselves.

In the case of tetanus and polio, the vaccines are meant to be distributed in communities to ensure that the disease is effectively controlled in vulnerable populations, for example, if the vaccine is administered after a public health crisis before the outbreak.

The CDC says that vaccine storage is a weak link in the U.S. cold chain.

""It's very expensive, and it's a problem,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's associate director for disease prevention. ""People store chicken pox vaccine. They store measles vaccination, and there's a concern that they're storing vaccine, and that there could be a false sense of security that could lead to people not getting sick or getting sicker.""

Question: Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is the clinical positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy?

Answer: Yes. A sentinel lymph node biopsy of a breast cancer patient's axilla can exclude a non-small cell lung cancer and other potentially aggressive breast cancers. However, the biopsy is a highly exploratory procedure that can detect a much smaller range of rare and treatable lesions than would be the case for a biopsy of a breast tumor. A breast cancer patient's axilla with positive lymph node-cell cultures can be classified either by histology (a diagnosis made by pathologists) or by the presence of two lymph nodes, as shown in Table 1. However, because the positive lymph node tests can only detect cells that are present in the lymph nodes, they cannot detect all sites with the potential to develop into cancer. For example, since most lymphoid cells are found below the layer of adjacent normal lymphatic tissue, the results may not reflect the entire range of tumors in a patient's axilla. There are, however, certain diagnostic procedures that offer greater specificity than sentinel lymph node biopsy. Such procedures include CT angiography of the axilla, computed tomography scan of the axilla, and imaging of the axilla with immunohistochemical staining.

Positive Tested Negative for no node Nodes that are present in lymph nodes (i.e., two nodes plus more than one) Tonsils Nodes without lymph node tissue Other Nodes detected by lymph node biopsy, but within the range defined in the Diagnostic criteria for lymph node biopsy in a breast cancer patient's axilla.

Question: If I have a biopsy at a hospital, does that mean it's an admission? What if I didn't have a biopsy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: If I have a biopsy at a hospital, does that mean it's an admission? What if I didn't have a biopsy? Read and submit your abstract. What is the likelihood of having lymph node biopsy performed at your hospital? Write a paper that answers the Question: If I have a biopsy at a hospital, does that mean it's an admission? What if I didn't have a biopsy? Why hasn't there been a national law passed preventing the routine placement of biopsy or other diagnostic procedures (e.g., CT, CT angiography) without consent and without informed consent at the medical centers where they are performed?

Answer: Currently, many hospitals do not routinely perform biopsies because of the high costs, lack of local reimbursement, and legal controversy over consent for invasive procedures. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is recommending that the federal government pass such a law to protect patients before going under the knife. This recommendation follows on the heels of the AAP's report that reviewed biopsy recommendations in a pediatric medical center setting (7). This study identified 20 research articles published in 2002 and 2003. All were done in pediatric cancer centers. Of those articles, 18 specifically addressed biopsy in pediatric patients. These studies included an average of five biopsies per article to determine which techniques are most likely and cost effective. Most of the studies described their methodology, and a few stated whether the methods were the basis for any particular recommendations. As always, the best approach is to consult your local pediatric oncology registrar before making any decisions.

Question: Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can we find a mechanism for the association of epilepsy with retinal damage, and do we need to do studies on animals? It is known that some drugs at different stages of therapeutic progression are associated with retinal damage in both humans and animals (e.g. epilepsy drugs like Tegretol and Tylenol). The Question: Can we find a mechanism for the association of epilepsy and retinal damage, and do we need to do studies on animals? It is known that some drugs at different stages of therapeutic progression are associated with retinal damage in both humans and animals (e.g. epilepsy drugs like Tegretol and Tylenol). The question and answers have been published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia, in the Lancet, in the British Journal of Pharmacology, in the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, in several medical publications and also on the web.

I hope all questions concerning this issue have been covered by the experts: the British Journal of Anaesthesia, the Lancet, the British Journal of Pharmacology, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences and the British Medical Journal, for example. I hope all questions concerning this issue have been covered by the experts: the British Journal of Anaesthesia, the Lancet, the British Journal of Pharmacology, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences and the British Medical Journal, for example.

It's true that retinal hemorrhage is the most common cause of blindness in humans, with 40,000 new cases being admitted to the hospital every year. It occurs at any age, in any area and is also characterized by increased susceptibility to injury and is more common than most other neurodegenerative diseases studied in healthy adults. These observations prompted researchers to focus on the possibility that epilepsy may contribute to retinal injury as a potential mechanism of the disease, especially after the conclusion of clinical trials. In 2005, the European Retinal Injury Assessment Network, funded by the European Union, evaluated nearly 70 studies by using brain imaging, neuropathology, neuropathological observations and clinical trials. The results were conclusive; for the best results, the most extensive tests were performed on mice during the development of retinal detachment or injury. These studies show that in the mouse retina the retinal cells appear in very early stages, and this fact is well documented. The authors concluded: ""It appears highly likely than one might assume that epilepsy is a significant risk factor for the development of retinal-damage-related retinal lesions"". What happens in the mouse visual field when these cells are injured? A significant alteration of the retinal response is seen, such as a loss of colour, haemorrhage or damage to other areas of the retina. In healthy animals, a dramatic and rapid response of the eyes is present, in contrast with the normal response of the eyes at the same age in rodents. The authors conclude that the observed pattern in which neuronal activity in the mouse retina begins several days after the development of retinal detachment might be caused by early structural modifications induced by the first injury and/or by the later loss of cellular connections. The authors conclude: ""It appears highly likely than one might assume that epilepsy is a significant risk factor for the development of retinal-damage-related retinal lesions"".

In other words: epileptic seizures at one stage of treatment might cause problems associated with eye damage at another stage of the therapy. In other words: epileptic seizures at one stage of treatment might cause problems associated with eye damage at another stage of the therapy. This can be very risky for people who are undergoing treatment with drugs that are often used to make seizures less severe. In other words: epileptic seizures at one stage of treatment might cause problems associated with eye damage at another stage of the therapy. This can be very risky for people who are undergoing treatment with drugs that are often used to make seizures less severe. Many doctors and specialists believe that, since many such retinal injuries occur in the human visual system, they are probably due to changes in eye structure and that the brain has to compensate by producing new cells.

If retinal injury occurs in early stages of treatment and/or is seen very early after the onset of seizures or seizures that occur with anticonvulsant drugs, as the authors state, this might be the result of a process of cellular repair and/or regeneration. One cannot exclude the possibility that the retina is actually damaged and/or destroyed by such events. Another possibility could be due to apoptosis, where the DNA of cells that have undergone destruction by viral, chemical or microbial agents is replaced by new DNA.


I hope the answers have been answered. In some cases, seizures may cause eye injury at other times, without any seizure itself being considered. If so, this may"

Question: Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90° of Knee Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90° of Knee Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction? Abstract: The purpose of this study is to determine if flexile or elastic elasticity in the antero-posterior (API) femoral tunnel can produce a satisfactory anteroposterior (AP) femoral tunnel length and the degree of adhesion to the achilles tendon. We compared the API femoral tunnel parameters and the knee extensor muscle function at 90° of knee flexion (0°, 50°, and 75°) in patients with right-sided ACL injury. Thirty male patients with mild (N=10), moderate (N=8), or severe (N=15) ACL injury and 35 patients healthy patients with ACL injury served as both subjects and control subjects. Each group experienced the same injury type (right/left) and treatment status (injury-rest, arthroscopy in-situ repair, mechanical stabilization or no intervention). The ACL injury was treated with either arthroscopic (80% ACL repair, 20% reconstruction) or mechanical stabilization (85% ACL repair or 10% reconstruction) in both groups. The data were analyzed with SPSS 17.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Results: Of the 45 patients with ACL injury, the mean (±SD) knee flexion angle was 51.8° ± 14.8° in the API group compared with 49.4° ± 6.5° in the control group (P=0.001). The mean (±SD) knee flexion elongation reached 90° in 13.8% (6/25) of these patients with ACL injury compared with 24.5% (3/25) with the control group (P=0.003). The mean (±SD) hip abduction of the knee was 28.4% (6/25) in the API group compared with 29.4% (7/25) in the control group (P=0.015). There was no significant difference in pain (P=0.086). There was a significant improvement in the knee extensor muscle function with the API group after arthroscopic repair compared with mechanical stabilization (P=0.001) and no improvement in adhesion of the tendon after arthroscopic repair compared with mechanical stabilization (P=0.23). Conclusion: Despite the obvious importance of a stable ACL to the long-term function of the antero-posterior (AP) femoral tunnel, the presence of a stable ACL does not allow for adequate anteroposterior (A) femoral tunnel lengths in knee injuries that originate from the medial tibial plateau. Thus, it appears that a healthy, healthy knee is the most important determinant of anteroposterior (A) femoral tunnel lengths. The ACL has been proven to be the most important component in the anteroposterior (AP) femoral tunnel. The present study shows that a simple surgical modification, an arthroscopic arthroscopic repair of an anterior compartment ACL repair with mechanical stabilization results in the ability to produce A (AP) femoral tunnel lengths of 50–80% and the ability to restore the tibial plateau ACL strength and to reduce the length of ACL insertion. Keywords: anterior compartment, ACL, femoral tunnel, tibial plateau

Introduction At the time of the founding of the ACL program, knee injuries that originated from the medial tibial plateau were considered to be secondary to a single, major injury to the medial capsule.1,3,15,17,23,27,33 The knee had a much higher incidence of ACL injury and, therefore, the use in knee rehabilitation of ACL in patients with the sole motivation to improve ACL function was extremely limited.6,31 The lack of interest in the use of ACL in knee injuries resulting from the tibial plateau was even more evident given that one hundred sixty-four patients presented to the ACL program at the time there was the first application of ACL in knee injuries originating from the tibial plateau with the sole purpose of enhancing the knee's ACL function. This patient history is particularly noteworthy because it demonstrated that the ACL was very much neglected as an important component in knee injuries arising from the tibial plateau.26,45 The current ACL program is focused on the discovery and development of new and improved strategies to improve the long- term stability of the ACL and, at the same time, to improve ACL tear and subsequent ACL reconstruction of the knee.45 The current focus on the development of devices capable of improving ACL function in an ACL injury at the time of ACL reconstruction may appear to"
Question: Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Who do we think should make the decision for a lung cancer patient? Submit an online abstract with ""Lung Cancer: Quality of Life"" as a key keyword to earn a $10 Amazon gift card.

Results: In a cross sectional study, the quality of life of people with lung cancer was assessed using three measures: pain, sleep, and quality of life at 6 months post-cancer. In the cross sectional study, people who had more money were less likely to report poor quality of life at 6 months post-cancer.

Conclusions: Poor quality of life (pain at 6 months) correlated with socioeconomic status (SES) both during the baseline period and at 6 months of follow-up. The link between poor quality of life and SES at 6 months appears to be driven by financial status. In order to make a clinically important difference, treatment with anti-rejection therapy should be focused on decreasing money, not quality of life.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with lung cancer accounting for nearly one million deaths every year (1). For these reasons, research and treatment efforts in lung cancer are often centered on the treatment of cancer itself. However, in many cases, there is a lack of evidence-based therapy for lung cancer. Given the large number of cases and their potential impact on quality of life, the research community has been interested in the factors that contribute to improved quality of life after treatment for lung cancer. A primary aim is to develop evidence-based therapies. However, despite the tremendous economic investment in lung cancer research and treatment, few therapies are available and many therapies are not proven effective. As such, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to improved quality of life in people with lung cancer.

One strategy that has been used by lung cancer patients is to take the drugs they have been offered in a trial—including new and modified agents—to treat symptoms with the hope that they can be re-introduced at a later time. Studies have measured changes in quality of life after patients took or were given an anticancer drug, but the studies have relied on self-report. In addition, several studies have used data on medical records to examine this ""measured variable"" (measured by a physician's score on a standardized test) rather than objective measures of the patient's overall quality of life (1–3). These studies have included several trials with a few hundred patients. The first trial to demonstrate that such a technique could be used, in 2007, was in patients with advanced glioblastoma multiforme (GWB) (4–6), and the results of that study have been used to inform many ongoing studies.

However, many people still benefit from being studied in a primary care setting. In the United States, however, patients are offered primary care physicians (PCPs) in primary care settings (7). The primary care setting may be beneficial for individuals with advanced lung cancer and others who have more advanced illness but do not have a stable primary care physician, who is often ill-equipped to diagnose, prescribe, and monitor patients. There may be a significant cost savings if those patients could have chosen to be treated in primary care. Furthermore, many patients find primary care physicians are not as interested in treatments they have received previously (or do not accept). These factors could make it harder to determine if a patient's improvement is due to treatment or to some other factor. Many patients with advanced disease, especially those with less advanced disease, may have a hard time making the switch from a PCP to a primary care physician. However, for the majority of people with advanced lung cancer, the switch is a relatively easy process and most people will prefer to be treated closer to home than in the hospital (8).

The question, then, is, what are some of the factors that contribute to good quality of life among patients with lung cancer? There has been a lot of interest in the issues of health status and socioeconomic status in a lung cancer patient, as well as whether health status affects quality of life in this patient population compared with others (2, 9). The question also begs the question of whether the benefits of improved health care could be delivered in the same manner by the research community at large in patients who are treated in primary care settings.

To answer this question, the authors of this study, including researchers from the Institute for Basic Health Research from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), conducted a 2-year study of patients with lung cancer who had participated in the Lung Cancer Treatment Trials Network (LCTN), at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS).

The LCTN is one of the largest and longest-running trials in the history of human trials to examine the effectiveness of novel anti-rejection"

Question: Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery?

Response: Early extubation will probably be helpful for some children undergoing cardiac surgery, especially due to the many complications that can occur during surgery. However, until further research has been conducted, the best long-term outcome is to avoid unnecessary invasive interventions (such as heart bypass) on children and to continue to use standard-of-care care such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) until a heart patient can be safely extubated by a trained physician."

Question: Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a potential role for uterine natural killer cells? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a possible role for uterine natural killer cells?

Answer to Question: Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a potential role for uterine natural killer cells? Abstract

1. Introduction

Endometriosis is a common disease, characterized by abnormal glandular tissue formation following ovulation of an ectopic uterus (1). Endometriosis is usually associated with endometrial hyperplasia (2), endometrial adhesions (3), or endometrial adhesions and fibrolamellar adhesions.

This condition was originally conceptualized as a consequence of in vitro fertilization, and is now an established feature in the reproductive physiology of women (4, 5). Endometriosis is defined as the abnormal formation or maintenance of a mass of endometrial tissue in a woman (2). During normal ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes an ectopic endometrial product that enters the uterine cavity (2) while the ovary secretes an endometrial product that does not enter the uterine cavity (2, 6). This combination produces normal endometrial development and growth while, in some women, there is both excessive menstrual bleeding (premenstrual syndrome, or PMS) and endometriosis (7–9).

The incidence of endometriosis ranges from 5.8% in the general population to 30-60% in women of certain ethnic groups (10). Although the cause of the condition remains a matter of debate, theories hypothesize that ovarian stimulation could lead to abnormal menstrual bleeding, with this effect, as well as other conditions such as multiple antral follicles, an estrogen-receptor-negative syndrome, and endometriosis (10–12).

Some studies have suggested a role for natural killer (NK) cells in endometriosis (13) or have noted the presence of the protein murine parathyroid (14, 15). The function of NK cells in endometriosis is unknown; however, the function of NK cells in uterine smooth muscle, which is a major site of endometrial adhesion and proliferation, is well described.

There is a substantial lack of published studies examining the effect of the use of medications known to affect NK cells (norethindrone and topiramate), in women with endometriosis.

This study compared the incidence of endometriosis in women taking various medications for endometriosis with the incidence observed in women who did not use medications at all and who were not taking any medications at all at baseline. Women were excluded if they had symptoms of endometriosis, were pregnant, or had any known infertility. The results showed that, compared with women who did not use any medications, women who did not use any medications at baseline were at increased risk of having endometriosis. This association was independent of demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics. The incidence of endometriosis, assessed with pelvic examination and ultrasonographic examination, was 1.22 per 100 women per year in women taking norethindrone or topiramate, 1.47 per 100 women per year in nondrug women, and 1.73 per 100 women per year in patients taking other nonprescription medications (16–19).

Because of the significant excess number of endometriosis cases in the women taking norethindrone or topiramate (2.6× and 1.8× respectively), the potential benefit associated with norethindrone or topiramate discontinuation is significant. This study demonstrates that women who take norethindrone or topiramate should undergo periodic Pap testing.

Our results demonstrate that women using norethindrone or topiramate alone or in combination are at increased risk for developing endometriosis. Furthermore, women in any age who take these medications are at an increased risk for endometriosis compared to women who do not take norethindrone. This increase must be considered in the setting of a low baseline level of risk. The risk of developing endometriosis increased in the presence of any of the above medications. The association of endometriosis risk with the use of any drug is likely to be confounded by the drug combination with or without concomitant use of methotrexate, which may alter the risk of endometriosis for others. It is important to note that there is a nonstatistically significant increased risk for developing endometriosis in women who only take norethindrone, compared to women who use any of the specific types of nonprescription medications, including methotrexate, raloxifene, or gefitin"

Question: Can the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp predict a neoplastic polyp? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Gallbladder polyps are a common invasive cancer (prognostic, cure, treatment, etc.) that are a major cause of morbidity/mortality.

Submit Answer: Gallbladder polyps are a common invasive cancer of the gallbladder, bladder, or ureters - most commonly found in patients with chronic renal disease. A small percentage of patients with gallbladder polyps die from the growth, but most are still healthy. These symptoms are not exclusive to patients with a single diagnosis of gallbladder polyp (eg, an extra appendix) and most of these patients are cured or survive to the adult stage (some are still alive at 5 months after surgery). There is very little scientific evidence to demonstrate that the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp is a predictor of a neoplastic polyp. It depends upon several factors, including the severity of the patient's underlying disease, severity of inflammation and tumor cells in the bladder, volume of disease, duration of exposure to the growth, number of bladder fibrosis (lumberjack syndrome, cyst) that is associated with disease, severity of disease, and presence of other tumor cells (eg: fibroid, fibroid-like, and/or chondelial tissue). Some of these factors were considered in the initial development of ""Gastro Bladder Disease"" to describe the common, but often complicated, signs that are often associated with this rare disease. There is however good evidence which shows that the growth of gallbladder polyps (especially the benign one, which are usually not associated with significant inflammation and tumor cells) can be reliably correlated with the presence of other non-malignant or malignant bladder tumors. These tumors may be benign, large, or in the process of becoming malignant. In patients with gallbladder polyps that cause non-malignant growth, more than 50% of patients will still be healthy by 3 months after surgery, while in those with malignant bladder tumors, the rate of survival is only 10% to 15%. There is also good evidence that patients who underwent the bladder biopsy procedure at some point during their lifetime had lower numbers of pre-cancerous tumors. This is further evidence that the primary diagnosis of ""Gallbladder Polyp"" is incorrect. Please see our page on ""Gallbladder Polyps"" for more information.

The Gallbladder Prognosis Index for Doctors to help diagnose which gallbladder cancer is more likely to progress to gallbladder cancer - may be helpful for patients if they have trouble deciding the likelihood of getting gallbladder cancer.

Please email us about your experience with your doctor with the Gallbladder Polyp.

Gallbladder Disease Symptoms Gallbladder Polyps that grow can cause the following symptoms, in addition to pain in their bladder: Increased urine frequency

Pain with sitting/standing

Pain with urination

Increased difficulty in urinating

Urine volume appears cloudy

Redness in upper left bladder (paresis)

Dry bladder (colon)

Increased difficulty in urinating

Tender chest/upper abdomen with pain around the rib cage

Unexplained weight gain

Infection of bladder

Piggyback pain that causes pain at the bladder

Gallbladder polyps that are large and bulky

Increased risk of blood pressure

The Gallbladder Health Index (GHI) was developed to help physicians evaluate the risk of gallbladder cancer. It is based on clinical and microbiologic criteria. Some of the symptoms experienced by patients with gallbladder cancers are:

Pain in the left urethra

Pain with urination

Nausea/vomiting

Unexplained weight gain

Reduced ability to urinate

Chronic cough, chest tightness, heavy flow, difficulty with speech, and dizziness

Dry fluid or cloudy urine

The GHI is used by many physicians who have questions about their diagnosis or treatment. These questions are related to an increased sensitivity to the odor of the gallbladder polyps.

Please see our GHI for Doctors page for more information.

The Gallbladder Dysfunction Index is similar to the Gallbladder Pain Index but uses a larger database of data to enable physicians to understand the potential symptoms.

Question: Does para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester?

Answer: It does. The most important advantage of para-cervical block is the ability of the gemectomaniac to deliver a viable baby before 12 weeks. This is achieved because of the lower level of anesthesia used in the technique, and the fact that most cesarean sections are performed in the 2nd trimester.[9][10] The technique is also relatively easy and safe when compared with an air bag.

[3] Cervical blocks are effective immediately.

[4] The main disadvantages of this technique are its low cost and the fact that the risk of infection is high for the mother of the baby delivered vaginally.

[4] The main advantages of this technique are that it also offers a long term benefit in reducing the rate of complications caused by the labour induction[3]

Question: Is there a difference in results with this techniques in the current world situation? Describe the results of studies.

Answer: It is obvious that it is not possible to compare the effects of the different intraeparectal procedures on the live birth rate. A systematic review [9] of the literature in this area concluded that ""there are insufficient studies to draw any firm conclusions"".[3] The latest studies that were published[4] suggest that this technique does offer a greater risk of induction in the 2nd trimester following delivery compared to a vacuum method.[1][3] Studies that assessed the effect of this technique on neonatal mortality are also lacking.[7][8][3]

Question: I am also using intraeparectal gemectomies for induction. Why?

Answer: You are correct in stating that you probably do so because you believe it to be a lesser option than a mid-trimester induction if the mother is expected to have a healthy pregnancy. However, there are numerous cases of babies being born before 24 weeks which suggest that this is not the case. Many times, a cesarean is avoided or at least delayed by using this technique. Many babies are delivered in both the second and third trimesters. I would advise those women who have a healthy pregnancy to use this technique if they want to achieve a live birth.

Question: Does the technique provide a better outcome when compared to surgical intervention?

Answer: In the present paper, we have excluded any case of uterine rupture or pregnancy loss. The data from this study are therefore limited to clinical outcomes.

Question: Is there a higher risk per dose for administration of gemeprost?

Answer: There is one case study regarding the effect of a single dose of gemeprost in reducing complication rate following childbirth, which has been published by a different journal.[3] In the current study, the total numbers of children who died during labour were small[5] and this is an extreme form of a risk factor often identified elsewhere in the literature.[3] In the present study, we have excluded this case.

Question: What happens to the gemetapine dose after one dose?

Answer: The dose is stopped once the mother has received the first doses of gemetapine, even if further doses will be required.

Question: Is there a safety problem with gemetapine when given as 1-2 ml IV bolus during labour?

Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is there a safety problem with gemetapine when given as 1-2 ml IV bolus during labour?

Answer: There is only one small case of a patient receiving more than 8 ml bolus of gemetapine in labour but no reported deaths associated with this procedure. Given the data on the safety of gemetapine, this case does not justify the use of this administration for induction of labour.[3]

[2][4][3] Conclusion In the present study, the combined results of all the interventions resulted in lower rates of neonatal mortality compared to the control group. The results imply that the gemeprost induction with gemetapine is considered a safe and effective option.

In addition to the risk factors listed above, an extremely important consideration in the delivery of a viable pregnancy is the mother-to-be. If the pregnant mother is still preterm or very preterm, these factors may change the outcome of labour and result in pre-term or low birthweight infants;[10][11] therefore, the intervention should be avoided if possible.[1]

I would be extremely disappointed to see the results of this study as the vast majority of women do not wish to undergo this procedure and are quite happy to do so without"
Question: Does insulin resistance drive the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

The insulin resistance that can cause heart attacks may be triggered by low-density lipoprotein concentrations, but the mechanisms by which this process does so are unknown. This means that it is possible to have two different causes of elevated blood glucose and atherosclerosis. The effect of insulin on triglycerides is also poorly understood, leading to conflicting results regarding the causality between higher cholesterol and increased rates of cardiovascular events. This situation implies that more research is necessary. On the other hand, evidence that lower LDL and high HDL cholesterol are able to prevent coronary artery disease is emerging.


For more on the relationship between low HDL and heart disease, see this post.


In view of ongoing progress, there really isn't an official ""end of hyperglycemia"" and the end of heart disease. It may be a question as to when hyperglycemia may result in adverse effects from a nutritional perspective. For those of us who have been concerned about that possibility for a number of years, here's the good news from the research so far. In the context of our study, there is no doubt that diet-induced hyperglycemia caused some of the ""bad"" changes seen in cardiovascular risk profiles in our participants. However, the good news is that in our study, all these adverse effects were caused by dietary changes that were associated with a net gain in dietary HDL and thus a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk (Figure 1). In other words, both diets (sugar/flour and protein/complex carbs) increased overall calories, but the total quantity of these foods was the key difference in lowering cardiovascular risk. The primary factor that is preventing this is the reduction in visceral adipose tissue fat. This reduced the levels of insulin-like growth factor-I, a marker of insulin resistance and the second most important factor that may have contributed to the adverse effects. On the other hand, the weight gain was much more likely to be due to a combination of other factors (Figure 2), and no change in total weight was associated with greater cardiovascular risk (results not shown). The reduction in cardiovascular risk was mainly found in the high carbohydrate group (>85% CHO) and not in the low carbohydrate group (<45% CHO). In other words, the reduced LDL cholesterol was mainly a result of the reduction in visceral fat, but not to the same extent in the low carb group.

Finally, the effects of higher total LDL cholesterol on cardiovascular risk were in line with the results of some early meta-analyses of carbohydrate-restricted diets (Hedrick et al. 2008). The lower the LDL cholesterol (or the higher the TG), the better the metabolic effects of the diet. This is in line with a recent review of the efficacy of low carbohydrate diets in the treatment of coronary heart disease (Almqvist 1997).

The key findings from our randomized intervention clinical trial are summarized in Table 1. The average LDL cholesterol levels for subjects receiving the protein- and fat-free approaches were significantly lower than those for those receiving the low-fat diet (Table 2).

Answer: In case of a long operative interval of ≤10 min, there was an increased risk during the period of 5–10 wk of chronic illness in an increased risk within the period 10–200 wk of the operation. Question: In case of a long operative interval of ≤10 min, there was an increased risk during the period of 5–10 wk of chronic illness in an increased risk within the period 10–200 wk of the operation. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers: In case of a long operative interval of ≤10 min, there was an increased risk during the period of 5–10 wk of chronic illness in an increased risk within the period 10–200 wk of the operation. Answer: In case of chronic illness, the increased risk could result from other factors beyond the scope of this study, especially in the period 10 wk of the operative interval. Question: Do hospital discharge and admission rates predict the need for sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Explain. Answer: There was no significant difference in the need for sleeves in the first 3 mo of follow-up by admission or discharge status. A statistically significant difference was observed by admission and discharge status for the 2 largest groups of patients. Question: Do hospital discharge and admission rates predict the need for sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Explain. Answer: The need for a sleeve gastrectomy at the commencement of the last hospitalization for the last ≥30 d varies by time after hospital admission and by time of operation, with decreasing need for a sleeve over time and increasing need over the time of hospitalization. Some factors, such as age, gender, BMI, and length of hospitalization also contribute to the need for a sleeve over time. In addition, a wide range of events, such as the use of analgesics, increased alcohol intake, and changes in weight or body fatness can influence the need for a sleeve gastrectomy over time. Question: Do hospital discharge and admission rates predict the need for sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity for first-year patients? Explain. Answer: There was no significant difference in a hospital discharge or admission rate for the first 3 mo of follow-up by admission status. There were no significant differences in the need for a sleeve within the first 30 d of follow-up. A statistically significant difference was present by the end of hospital stay for the 2 largest groups of patients. Question: Are there any advantages of sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers: Are there any advantages of sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Answer: There are no significant advantages, except for improved morbidity of the obesity patients, in terms of complications. Question: Are there any disadvantages of sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Explain. Answer: At the end of the first year without a procedure, there was a tendency toward gastric bleeding in patients weighing >200 g. In the second year, a higher rate of gastric bleeding occurred in the >200 g group than in the patients in the >180 and under weight groups. Patients >180 g also had a higher rate of gastric bleeding."
Question: Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:

Summary of findings References in the Discussion section: ""All subjects reported acute pain, and 10 subjects were treated in the preoperative ward for functional impairment in the right side of the body or the leg (9/10). Subjects reported pain, tenderness, weakness, tingling, and numbness associated with various functional limitations that resulted in the use of some forms of pain medication, including analgesics"" (p. 40).

This conclusion was based on the postoperative findings of the patients and the physicians' comments. The patient questionnaire had been filled out in the order in which the pain symptoms appeared. A similar questionnaire in a different order might have elicited better insight into the causes of pain symptoms, if there had been more time to review it before the surgical procedures were performed.

Although the patient questionnaire did not specifically inquire about functional abnormalities (although this observation can be explained by the fact that the questionnaire was designed to be completed before the operation), nevertheless, even with a questionnaire that avoided the specificity of specific diagnoses, physicians were able to identify functional limitations and provide treatment interventions in each of the conditions.

A few of the patients did not provide any functional symptom reports during the preoperative period and remained ""functional"" throughout the period of investigation. The patients were excluded because of the low frequency with which their functional limitations appeared. Although some individuals who experienced painful experiences during the preoperative period presented with functional problems during the postoperative examination, this was rare. Other patients who experienced pain but who were not reported any symptoms were not excluded because of differences in the nature of the functional problems reported in the preoperative and postoperative period. It has also been found that pain complaints cannot be distinguished from functional problems.

There were no cases of functional failure associated with preoperative postoperative pain.

There were no cases of functional deterioration during the postoperative period.

There were no reports of deterioration of any type, such as disability, disability worsening, or disability worsening, during the period studied.

There were no patients who had a pain score of <3 on the visual analog scale after each of the examinations.

Patient Complaints

One third of patients had complaints that had a temporal relationship to their preoperative pain. At the beginning of the preoperative phase, most complaints were of the nonspecific nature. A number of patients complained of specific clinical symptoms to which they were sensitive. However, most of these were not consistent with any particular functional injury or disability. Most of the patients had no complaints that developed during or after the surgical procedures.

Significant Complaints

There were a number of patients who had pain problems that, when combined with other complaints, resulted in dysfunction in a specific aspect on an exam (Table 1). Because of the variability of such findings between individuals, there is often no clear indication of a functional impairment by the doctor. Thus, it is possible to classify these patients as having functional dysfunction unrelated to surgical complications or pain and presenting later with pain as a consequence of the complications. One patient (Table 1) had a diagnosis of orthopedic foot injury. He also had problems with his hearing and vision, a condition known as auditory neuropathy.

Table 1: Patient Complaints

Major Complaints

There were also patients with significant concerns about their functional functioning or lack of activity as a result of postoperative pain. These problems might have been either related to preoperative trauma or to postoperative functional problems. Other problems associated with the surgical procedures (cervical injury, vascular dissection, arterial disease) may have resulted in functional abnormalities after surgery.

A number of patients (15%; Table 1) complained about the pain during the postoperative period. These complaints were either nonspecific or of a temporizing nature.

Some patients (4%) complained of functional impairment. They also reported pain that had a temporal relationship to their preoperative pain and was related to the operation.

Several patients (11% of all patients and 8% of those with no complaints) complained of pain that was not related to any dysfunction. These patients, usually men aged 35-60 years, were generally referred to various medical centers. For this reason, physicians generally did not take note of any specific complaints during the postoperative period for patients such as these. The majority of these patients developed no further problems over the next few months after their surgical intervention.

Analgesia was considered to be one of the major postoperative problems (14.8%) and was the most common complaint within the nonpatient population examined. This concern occurred on 5 of 60 patients evaluated in the preoperative period. In addition, it affected 6 or 7 of 28 patients evaluated between the preoperative and postoperative examinations (Table 2). In"
"Question: Actinobaculum schaalii, a cause of urinary tract infections in children? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Do actinobaculum schaalii (actinobaculum schaalii) and Actinobaculum maculatum (Actinobaculum maculatum) cause urinary tract infections in children?

Answer: This question was answered by a reviewer. The answer is ""no.""

Question: The ability of actinomyces and Actinobaculum schaalii to cross the blood–brain barrier in vitro was investigated by measuring the levels of the proteins Muc1 and Muc2 in the brain tissue of a single mouse (rabbit). The brain tissue of a rat was also studied for the presence of the proteins Muc1 and Muc2 by immunohistochemistry. The levels of Muc1 and Muc2 were elevated more in the brain of the rat than in the brain tissue of the mouse. The authors concluded that the expression of Muc1 and Muc2 in the brain of humans is low, probably due to a lack of functional Muc1 or Muc2 transcripts, especially in areas of the brain that are involved in motor and sensory processing, and that the low level of Muc1 and Muc2 in the brain of humans is probably due to genetic or environmental factors.

Question: Is it possible to detect the presence of antibiotic residues to a certain degree in foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, vinegar, and pickled vegetables? If so, what should be the recommended food contact times for the detection of antibiotics residues?

Answer: This question was answered by a reviewer. The answer is ""yes, bacteria could readily get past the outer surfaces of the protective cell walls and enter the food where they could be killed by antibiotics. This is only an issue if the bacteria do get past the protective protection layers of the food."" The reviewer also asked about the detection of bacterial products in food products by a food safety analyst, who must carefully follow an in vivo microbiology technique and must test various products for contamination in the laboratory.

Question: What is the effect of sodium citrate on the formation of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S)? Do H 2 S and hydrogen sulfide have a similar nature in the gastrointestinal tract?

Answer: A review by the authors summarized the review article as ""In vivo findings on the toxicity of sodium citrate on mice have been documented. This study demonstrates that sodium citrate rapidly reacts with the stomach wall membranes to be taken up by the epithelial cells and causes rapid formation of H 2 S. In addition, there is a high degree of hydrogen sulfide development in the stomach lining with these authors showing that H 2 S produced by this method, in addition to being toxic to cells, is extremely toxic to the gastric mucosa.""

Question: How is sodium citrate absorbed by the intestines? Do sodium citrate and its metabolites interact with any of the components of the bowel or produce other problems in the intestine?

Answer: The authors summarized the review article as: ""Evidence is accumulating indicating that sodium citrate and its metabolites do not enter the intestine directly nor do they contribute to the gastrointestinal problems the typical dietary guidelines recommend to reduce cravings, increase satiety, improve stool consistency and maintain bowel function. However, the absorption of sodium citrate and citrate metabolites through the colonic epithelium is dependent on the activity of the intestinal CYP2E1 enzyme. In our study of a rat model, there was a strong relationship between the serum concentrations of sodium citrate and the production of hydrogen sulfide."" One reviewer responded that the review authors did not discuss the hypothesis behind their results. However the authors do explain that in this study there was a clear relationship between the levels of sodium citrate and hydrogen sulfide in the rat colonic lumen.

Question: Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010: are Medicare beneficiaries getting sicker? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010: are Medicare beneficiaries getting sicker? Answer each question and include the reasons why people are not getting better after using medical care. Also include details of how long you have been using medical care, the type of medical care and the type of medical care provider you've found. Use the Internet, a journal such as PLoS One, an online form generated by the U.S. Public Health Service and others to gain additional details. Provide additional sources of information, including: U.S. News & World Report lists of ""sickest counties"" or ""healthyest counties""; The Mayo Clinic lists medical conditions or symptoms; and The Cleveland Clinic lists medical conditions or symptoms. This will give you a better gauge of how widely the sicker you are getting because of medical use. In summary, some health conditions are ""probable""; others are definitely happening but don't have a precise diagnosis.

Preventative Care Use the guidelines below to plan what to do to help prevent illnesses. Use the guidelines below to plan what to do to help prevent illnesses. 1. Check if you are getting sick. 2. Learn how to prevent illnesses. 3. Prevent symptoms. 4. Use preventive and diagnostic measures. 5. Continue regular checkups. 6. Learn what preventative tests and treatments are most useful. 7. Keep a food diary and record what you eat. Avoid any food that you might have to eat all at once; some foods that may keep symptoms under control are: soy products

chocolate

fruits or vegetables

whole wheat bread or tortillas Avoid any food with a high glycemic load (high calories, high fat, or low fiber) such as fruit, whole grains, and vegetables. 7.

Dietary Considerations Your diet should be rich in fruits and vegetables. Some fruits and vegetables are high in cholesterol, which can cause increased bleeding and bleeding time. Foods that contain cholesterol include: fruits such as apples, plums, and bananas

dried fruits or juices

fruit juice

fruit slices or squares

dried or fresh spinach

red and orange peppers and citrus fruits

green leafy vegetables including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, collards, cantaloupe, asparagus, and cabbage Keep red and orange peppers on the menu. They have relatively few calories, low glycemic index carbohydrates, and are good sources of fiber, vitamins C, and E. A high glycemic index food also can affect blood glucose (sugar) and could be considered ""dangerous"" for you. However, most sources of cholesterol are found in leafy vegetables. Avoid vegetables with high glycemic index: celery

carrots

cabbage

potatoes

turnip greens

tomatoes Eat lower amounts of fat and more protein in your diet. The goal is to eat little in the form of trans fat and saturated fat. In addition, take advantage of reduced exposure of fat and carbohydrates to oxidation by foods such as vegetable oils with hydrogen peroxide, or fruits that are high in polyphenols, antioxidants that reduce inflammation and protect the skin from oxidation. Take advantage of low and no sugar drinks as well as all non-alcoholic wine. Avoid high-sugar foods such as cookies, cakes, candy, baked goods, granola bars, bread, and candy. 8. See the U.S. News list of common foods with high glycemic load, including soy, chocolate, fruit, peanut, and some wheat products.

Diabetes Treatments and Care If you have diabetes, get tested regularly. Talk to your doctor for details on options, such as using a glucose monitor, a dietitian for advice, a health care professional for additional care, and a diabetes specialist for advice on medication. Check with the Mayo Clinic or your doctor if you have questions. Diabetes management options are very varied, particularly for people with kidney disease. For people with kidney disease who are trying to get a kidney transplant from a kidney-less recipient who is also diabetic, each strategy may have different results. For people without kidney disease, diabetes management options are somewhat more limited. If you are trying to get a kidney for anyone with diabetes, your doctor will not discuss this with you until you've had a follow-up physical examination. If your doctor determines that you are a suitable donor for a kidney transplant, you may be assigned to a private transplant organization or a kidney bank and receive a kidney of your choice. For more information, call 1-888-507-4386. See the Mayo Clinic or the U.S. News & World Report lists of ""sickest counties"" or ""healthyest counties"".

Question: Does successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can pregnancy and birth outcomes (like births among unmarried women) be improved by teaching obstetricians in a medical school curriculum that emphasizes the positive influences of prenatal and perinatal education?

Introduction Perinatal education is a field of study that is rapidly improving and is widely recognized as one of the most effective interventions that women worldwide can adopt for their care. Perinatal education has been shown to improve outcomes for mothers and babies of all ages (Ruggiero, 1997; Shainman et al., 2001) and has been shown to reduce risk of infant mortality (Hendrickx et al., 2000) even among low-income women (Alvarado et al., 1999). Perinatal education has been shown to help women (Hendrickx et al., 2000) and is a cornerstone of public health research efforts and interventions, including programs of prevention for poor women (Johnson and DeStefano, 1984; Shainman et al., 2001). Among women aged 18–34, one-third of whom are low income (NHS) and whose own maternal experience has been marginal (Giles et al., 1995), an estimated 6 million girls are born underweight annually in the US with the average birth weight of the average low-income US girl was only 1450 g in 1994 (Bachman et al., 2000). A study in Spain showed that children under 15 years who were born by cesarean section without a referral by their physicians were seven times more likely to die as the first postpartum maternal death if maternal education level was low (Ussal and Villanueva, 1997). Perinatal education in these groups has been shown to decrease rates of preterm birth, live birth, and neonatal death among girls, reduce neonatal and infant mortality, reduce maternal mortality among single mothers, and increase the number of women with a graduate degree (Valdés and Mendieta, 1998; Shainman et al., 1997) that are more likely to choose higher income jobs (Johnson et al., 1996; Fagard et al., 2000). The US Perinatal Education Program in Medical Schools is an example of a broadening of the curriculum of medical education, specifically in obstetrics, at the medical schools at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where most of the early research in the field was conducted. During the 1970s, the Perinatal Education Program was used at UCSF to train obstetricians at the Medical School (Shainman et al., 1991). During the 1970s and 1980s, the Perinatal Education Program was expanded and used at schools around the country; for example, at Indiana University, the University of North Carolina, and the North Carolina State University (Neumann et al., 1995). In addition, a series of other programs for health care professionals including the PEP, a national training program specifically for female health care workers (Jobs and Occupations Section, American Academy of Family Physicians, 1997), have been administered and used in the US public health system including community health centers, hospitals, high schools, schools, and universities; several of these programs are continuing and expanding (Shainman et al., 1998). The PEP has been found to have both positive and negative effects on women. The positive effects include increases in the percentages of women who work at high salaries and increased likelihood of attending college (Goss et al., 1996), and increases in the percentage of women who have attained higher education levels and greater employment and earnings with greater numbers of children and older parents (Jobs and Occupations Section, American Academy of Family Physicians, 2001; Shainman et al., 1997). In terms of women with perinatal care needs, the positive effects of the Program are primarily measured on parity as a result of lower rates for preterm birth, low birth weight, neonatal death, and low birth-weight infants (Goss et al., 1997). Also in terms of women with prenatal care needs, there is a more pronounced effect of the PEP on parity because of the greater number of births to unmarried women, lower rates of abortion, greater number of women who had fewer children, women with higher education levels, other positive outcomes, and fewer low-income women with children (Jobs and Occupations Section, American Academy of Family Physicians, 2001; Shainman et al., 1997). The programs for health care workers have a more negative effect, with the overall percentages of pregnant women and lower parity as a result of the programs and policies resulting in lower earnings as well as lower employment and earnings (Jobs and Occupations Section, American Academy of Family Physicians, 2001). There is wide consensus and many research studies that have demonstrated the power of promoting health and well-being for women from a broad range of backgrounds (Fagard et al., 2000). A growing body of evidence shows"

Summary and conclusions: All previous studies have shown that more health care workers are being diagnosed with HIV, especially in the poorest countries. Most studies using data from poor and rural countries have reported that these patients have higher risks of contracting HIV compared to patients in developed countries, the highest of which occurred in West Africa (e.g., Ghana) and Africa. However, these rates may have been artificially inflated because of inadequate health care, especially care provided by health care workers. Even in the United States (US), where HIV testing was made available in hospitals many years ago, the data showed that patients with HIV in hospitals were still more likely to transmit the virus to their health care workers than patients in outpatient hospitals. Nevertheless, there is considerable concern that medical care workers in public health interventions may still be developing AIDS in line with the WHO guidelines, despite a clear mandate from the World Health Assembly and the World Health Organization. Such patients would be at higher risk of transmitting the virus to health care workers and may be more likely to transmit the HIV or other virus to others. For example, most cases of HIV infection with a physician or staff member (see, e.g., CDC, 2012) were diagnosed in public health settings (e.g., hospitals, clinics, specialties, primary care) and, consequently, were not transmitted to others. Despite the risk of transmission among health care workers and some other settings, no data are yet available to link these patients to health care workers in other settings where the transmission may be more important. To explore the possible impact of health care workers' infection with HIV in developing countries in the context of the WHO rules on health care workers' adherence to the preventive role of health care, we analyzed data in 14 Latin American countries (Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Peru, Paraguay, Venezuela, El Salvador, Peru, and Colombia) during 1994-2008.

Methods Data were obtained from the National AIDS Data Bank (NADB), which consists of detailed information about incidence of HIV infection and transmission as well as information about persons at risk of acquiring HIV infection and HIV-related conditions at a specific location in these countries. The NADB is part of the National AIDS Programme to develop the country-specific HIV prevention and care in Latin America and the Caribbean. The NADB has data on all known transmissions of HIV (whether positive or negative) and of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can be transmitted by blood, body fluids, or body tissues (e.g., HIV-1, HIV-2, and genital herpes), including the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections, syphilis, trichomoniasis, and chlamydia. The data came from the local information systems (local state health committees, health registries, sub-national public and private health institutions, private hospitals, and other public agencies) and from the Public Health Agency of South Korea and the General Data System of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data were collected between 1994 and 2008 and have been stored on CD-ROM and on hard disk at the National AIDS Data Bank for 12 years, which corresponds to the first year of the study period of the NADB. In the analysis, we assumed that each country had been surveyed at least once, since this allows one to adjust for changes in infection rates and risk factors. We selected the 15 countries with the most information on both HIV infection and transmission. The same procedures were used for Africa, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Japan. The data came from the National AIDS Data Bank (NADB). The data came from the National AIDS Programme to develop the country-specific HIV prevention and care in Latin America and the Caribbean.

We analyzed both viral load data and other information according to country-specific incidence rates from the US CDC HIV/AIDS surveillance report. We calculated incidence rates using the rate of new infections and the rate of transmission according to the US CDC data for each age, sex group, and year, and then used linear regression (with year as a covariate) models to determine the relation between HIV prevalence and incidence rate as well as the relative risk (RR) of becoming infected with HIV.

Why is it so easy to discriminate?

How can a patient with a headache need to be called by their name when they're talking to her doctor? There are an abundance of examples. In the United States, hospital executives can ask, ""Who was it who kicked that lady?"" or ""Where did the doctor go? Why was he going the other way? How many times did he say 'Doctor?""

How can I be sure I'm referring appropriately?

Don't be fooled into treating your patients like a pair of pints at a bar.

When your boss asks where doctors went, your response should be, ""I don't know."" Or, ""It depends."" Your job as a boss is to explain the logic behind the answer. So before giving the patient a name, be sure to include another question, such as, ""Do you know where he went?""

Some people respond simply to the request by saying, ""Oh, yeah. We're waiting on him"" or ""Is he at the ICU?"" This response is the easiest for your boss to accept. If your office is full of angry patients asking their doctor for an explanation for their headache — as it will be when a non-hospital setting begins — and doctors aren't having the time to listen to them, what else should you reply?

Be more precise about your response. You don't need to say, ""You go to a neurologist who treats headaches."" You might say, ""You go to someone who treats headaches who takes you to the neurologist who specializes in headaches."" And the point is that this answer will get a patient's attention in the least invasive way possible.

Instead of offering to call the doctors who take them to a neurologist, consider responding by asking for information about the health care facility where patients receive care. The more specific you are, the more likely you are to get a name.

If a patient asks for a name at the hospital, offer to give her a handbook about the facilities where the hospital provides services. Make sure you also mention the name of the health care delivery agency that receives people who need care from the hospital. If your hospital doesn't offer such handbooks anymore, ask around.

For a patient who goes to a private doctor, offer to contact someone in the health management team (such as a neurologist, p.d. or psychologist) who might be willing to answer questions about the person's health and mental health."

Question: Attenuation of ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats: does edaravone offer protection? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

To answer the question and propose the mechanism of action for edaravone, the present study assessed the effect of edaravone on ovariectomy-induced ovarian damage (OIID) in mice and rats subjected to OIID with or without intra-abdominal injection of edaravone (10 mg/kg) in vivo. In the case of the study animals, the serum insulin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were studied before (baseline) and after (post) ovariectomy of the ovaries, while ultrasound assessment was carried out at 7 days post-operative. Serum insulin and HSD was expressed as percent change in response to a standard test of insulin resistance. In addition, serum insulin and Lp(a) were assayed using a bioassay. At the end of the experimental period, rats underwent ovariectomy over a period of 3 months, as a part of the chronic (i.e., treatment) of OIID with or without intra-abdominal injection of edaravone and the results of the intra-abdominal injection were compared. In addition, the effect of edaravone on insulin and HSD levels and serum insulin concentrations, together with the difference between the post-tumor and at baseline concentrations were evaluated. At baseline levels, administration of 15 mg/kg edaravone completely (100%) and completely (95%) prevented OIID-induced ovariectomy-induced OIID and resulted in a significantly higher Lp(a) (<14.7%) (p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (p < 0.001) in rats than in basal levels. In addition, edaravone administration completely prevented OIID-induced ovariectomy-induced loss of oocytes by insulin resistance (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that edaravone can effectively reduce ovariectomy-induced OIID and OAI induced insulin resistance among females.

In vivo Effects

The primary objective of the present study was to assess the effect of edaravone (10 mg/kg) on ovariectomy-induced ovarian damage (OIID) and its correlation with serum glucose and insulin (insulin resistance), Lp(a) and insulin resistance. We also examined the development of pre-ovarian hyperplasia by measurement of ovary weight after ovariectomy. Because ovary weight is a strong marker of hyperplasia both during early (somatic) and later (ovarians of the periventricular regions) stages of ovarian development, and because pre-ovarian hyperplasia has been observed to result in the development of secondary ovarian disease, the pre-ovarian hyperplasia was quantified by examining ultrasound measurements of pre-ovarian weight through the ultrasound examination of the tubal ligation as well as by the determination of the size of the seminiferous tubules with ultrasonography.

Methods

Procedure

All procedures and their detailed information have been previously published [20]. Briefly, all animals were treated under anesthesia with isoproterenol (1 mg/kg; Sigma Aldrich) under 5% carbon dioxide in 10% isopropanol for 30 min. The hypothalamus was dissected, and the pups were micro-anesthetized with isoflurane (20% isoflurane in 10% isopropanol; Sigma Aldrich). The ovaries (obtained from intact oocytes) were cut from tubules, which were weighed by stereotactic caliper (Leica Microsystems) when their weights were 2.0-2.9 g. The oocytes were stained with 0.4% DAPI (Sigma Aldrich), and then subjected to three transvaginal ultrasound examinations (3.0-3.8 MHz; Cepheid Electronics). Ovarian weights were used to calculate oocyte weight.

Oocyte Preparation

Ovarian biopsy specimens were aspirated from the abdomen and were removed from the abdominal cavity. Oviductal-like structures were removed from the uterus using sutures (Sigma Aldrich Inc.). The ovarian biopsy tissues were divided in half, and then sent to the pathology laboratory for examination by the use of ultrasonography. At the end of microscopic examination, the biopsy specimens were fixed with formalin. Oviduct-like structures were weighed on three different optical microscopes: SEM (Siemens), SEM (Daimler-Benz), and ZOOM (Vitomex). All tissue weights were obtained by the use of standard ultrasonogram procedures.

Question: Does the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale favor left hemisphere strokes? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does the National Institutes of Health Strokes Scale favor left hemisphere strokes?

SUMMARY: The NIMH Stroke Scale has a high sensitivity for right-sided strokes, which may be explained by the larger stroke volume in the right hemisphere.

INTRODUCTION: There are several reports that stroke and stroke-like symptoms commonly occur at or after the onset of migraine, as well as among patients whose migraine diagnosis is not established. Patients report a variety of headache symptoms, including fatigue, sensitivity to light and sound, and myalgia, which are often correlated with other symptoms of migraine. These symptoms, which are frequently related to transient weakness with aura, and some patients report that some headache symptoms are also related to stroke.1,12,13 In two reports,15,16 we sought to clarify the relationship between the NIMH Stroke Scale, which is the primary tool used to screen for a diagnosis of stroke, and the occurrence of certain symptoms. We compared the NIMH Stroke Scale to the International Index of Echocardiograms (IEEE) (the most widely used Echocardiogram-derived criteria for stroke), to a subset of patients who were diagnosed with migraine using a different standard of criteria. We report that the NIMH Stroke Scale more strongly favors right-sided strokes, a finding that is consistent with previously reported differences in brain function between the hemispheres. A number of alternative mechanisms, which may also explain observed differences between right-sided and left-sided strokes, are plausible.

METHOD: We performed a meta-analysis, using information on more than 14 million participants, of the association between stroke severity and the Stroke Scale with patients and controls.

RESULTS: We included 13 articles in the review. Analyses using a random-effects model using the NIMH data showed odds ratios of 2.10 (95% CI 1.39 to 2.84) that matched for a 1-sided α of.001. Results were robust with 10-sided t tests of significance of.04 and tests of heterogeneity of.68 with publication bias (p=.03). Of the 14 studies, 12 were positive.

CONCLUSIONS: The association between the NIMH Stroke Scale and right-sided strokes does not appear to be unique in migraine sufferers."

"Question: Young-Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures: does it predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:","

Answer:

This guideline describes how to make more effective choices in the management of pelvic ring fractures. We recommend that you focus on primary prevention of pelvic ring fractures in women by reducing unnecessary and potentially life-threatening transurethral decompression as early as possible after rupture, as well by managing the fracture through the rehabilitation associated with a pelvic ring.

Introduction

Pelvic Ring Fractures (PVR) pose a significant threat to the lives of women in the hospital.1 Women with a pelvic ring fracture who have not had a fracture within the past year who are admitted to a clinical setting are likely to suffer from posttraumatic stress syndrome and to have adverse cardiovascular and pulmonary consequences.2 In an ongoing study of patients admitted to the New York State Hospital at Montefiore,1 this risk is much higher among women with pelvic ring fractures than among their peers without them, and it is even higher among women with recurrent fractures.2 In fact, women with a previous pelvic ring fracture are more likely than those with other fractures to have a recurrence, suggesting the need for early and frequent evaluation, including a pelvic ring fracture evaluation, of those women who have not had a fracture during the prior 12 months.3

This guideline addresses the problem of pelvic ring fractures by recommending that clinicians treat pelvic ring fractures as urgent emergency medical conditions and to immediately perform urgent surgery.4 It also recommends that, when appropriate, secondary intervention protocols that do not involve surgery for the prevention of a future fracture should not be performed. When surgical intervention must be considered, it should be the last option but it should be considered on an individual basis as described by the guidelines described in the sections ""Pelvic Spinal Tendon Injuries"" to ""Caveats to Management.""4

This guideline requires us to explain the benefits and risks of early primary prevention of pelvic ring fractures among patients admitted to the emergency department based on the findings of previous studies and by defining the importance of the two outcomes:

Death. When mortality was the primary outcome, we recommend that we recommend immediate and frequent primary primary prevention of death from pelvic ring fractures. This means that we require immediate primary prevention in all women with pelvic ring fractures, irrespective of the time since last fracture. If a pelvic ring fracture was expected in the future, we recommend immediate and frequent primary primary prevention of death when the time since last fracture is at least 5 weeks. This means that when mortality is the primary outcome, we recommend immediate and frequent primary prevention in all women with pelvic ring fractures irrespective of the time since last fracture. If a pelvic ring fracture was not expected in the future, we recommend immediate and frequent primary primary prevention of death from pelvic ring fractures with a time horizon of 5 weeks. This means that we recommend immediate primary primary prevention with some women. In this special circumstance, we recommend immediate primary primary prevention in all women with pelvic ring fractures with a time horizon of at least 5 weeks, and those for whom the timing of the next fracture may be important.

Treatment. Treatment of pelvic ring fractures should be based on the severity of the initial injury and the outcome expected from the primary outcome. If there is the possibility that a future pelvic ring fracture may have an unexpected outcome that may be life-threatening, we recommend immediate and frequent primary primary prevention of post-fracture treatment with surgery on the pelvic floor. The procedure should be performed with anesthesia (with or without heparin) and the patient should stay in the trauma room until it is safe for discharge.

The recommendations contained in this guideline describe the risk associated with an acute pelvic ring fracture. Therefore, if a woman develops one, we recommend that she be kept out of the medical field for at least 7 days.5 If the future fracture is expected to be life-threatening, we recommend that she should be kept out of the medical field for at least 1 week.6 If the trauma patient is discharged home, we recommend that she be referred to a rehabilitation facility for at least 3 to 4 weeks. The surgical treatment of a pelvic ring fracture requires at least 3 to 4 weeks as a minimum goal; there is a small but plausible increased risk of death for patients who are treated in the emergency department without the necessary hospital stays. The post-surgery management of this situation is important, with the addition of rehabilitation. This includes strengthening the pelvic floor to prevent excessive stretching and to correct the trauma associated with the fracture. The patient need not return until the injury has healed, with adequate postoperative care since it is likely that the underlying cause of the injury will persist.

The following steps, listed in the order in which they should be taken in managing this situation, may result in survival in a patient with a pelvic ring fracture:

Question: Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease?

Answer: Celiac disease is an intolerance to dietary iron. No one knows whether Vitamin D deficiency causes gluten intolerance. However, there are people who are hypersensitive to the effects of Vitamin D. Therefore, they will often tell you that you need to eat a high-dose of Vitamin D supplements to get them to stop gluten intolerance.


An easy way to avoid gluten is to stay on a strict vegetarian diet. This dietary restriction may cause you to have high levels of Vitamin D without the symptoms of Celiac (such as rashes, hair loss, and sensitivity to foods). However, since Vitamin D is needed for normal growth, weight gain, and skin health, we recommend that you do not supplement with Vitamin D during a vegetarian or vegan diet (and only take one or two hundred micrograms of vitamin D supplements daily)."
Question: Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are unsafe sexual behaviours increasing among HIV-infected individuals or is the behaviour increasing because of more available and acceptable HIV care?

The purpose of this research question is to evaluate HIV/STI/HIV prevalence and associated risks and benefits of sex work in Botswana. To address this, I am conducting a study of sex workers in the cities of Kisumu and Vompe in 2015-2016. The study is being supervised by the Chief Executive, the Research and Training Officer, a research collaborator, and an HIV epidemiologist/pediatrician from The University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. Sex work in Kisumu and Vompe centres in Botswana (KV) were analysed for HIV prevalence and risk behaviours.


Study Objectives: During the study period, I will evaluate HIV prevalence and associated risks of sex work in Kisumu and Vompe, and what changes HIV prevalence and risk behaviours may have resulted from this study. What are the associated demographic and socio-economic factors of those working in the sex industry in Kisumu and Vompe and what kind of sexual health problems and risk behaviours do they have?


What are the outcomes and conclusions of this work? The results of this study will determine whether the results demonstrate an increase in HIV prevalence or whether they demonstrate the trend of increased risk behaviours in this population.

I will estimate the prevalence of HIV through questionnaires and blood and urine testing on a subset of the population and will report results in the abstract.

The results of the study will contribute to the advancement of HIV prevention efforts in Botswana, to strengthen health services in general and Kisumu specifically, and to strengthen gender and sexuality education for all primary and secondary school students.

Question: Cholestasis associated with small bowel atresia: do we always need to investigate? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the definition of small bowel atresia? Why or why not? (I do not believe this question or paper is applicable to small bowel atresia.) The following is an outline of the answer to Question: What is the definition of small bowel atresia?

Question 1: Some early clinical studies have suggested that some children with small bowel atresia have a more severe case of colic even if their parents have no history of other symptoms (see Question below). The following is evidence that it does not necessarily mean that the child has a better or worse case (see Questions below).

A: In one study by Ransohoff and colleagues4 the results of a parent questionnaire were presented for the first time and it was found that the majority of small bowel atresia patients did not meet criteria for colic. The parents of these patients considered their children to be well and did not regard them as being constipated. The parents of these children were considered as having a good attitude. Thus it seems that, if the parents and the children are taking good care, then it is still possible to identify the parents who might be in need of psychological support and advice related to the child's atresia.

B: The results of another study suggest that some of the earliest symptoms of small bowel atresia were indeed associated with constipation.10 In another study of children whose small bowel atresia was suspected but who were only mildly constipated, 12.5% were found to have atresia.

C: There is also an epidemiologic study in which a large cohort of patients with early onset colic was assessed, with the diagnosis of small bowel atresia. Of patients with mild/no constipation in the initial clinical investigation of patients with early onset colic, 40.6% were found to have small bowel atresia. Of patients without constipation, only 5.3% were found to have atresia at all. The percentage of children with colic who were found to have the early onset colic was very similar in different areas of the country, suggesting that this was not a diagnosis exclusive to the early onset of colic. Of the 8 children with colic who tested positive for early onset colic, 3 were found to have atresia. 11

In addition, there does not appear to be any evidence that the child had a worse outcome in an early investigation (for example, by a colonoscopic examination or by a fecal occult blood test) because the colonoscopy and fecal occult blood tests were not followed up because of the low birth weight of the child.12

There are a few reports in the literature suggesting that although there was mild to moderate constipation in some of the children, more severe constipation was found in the most persistent children.13,14,15. For example, Fagan et al16 found an association between constipation and atresia. The investigators asked mothers of the most persistent children to complete questionnaires on their children's constipation. The mothers who did not answer this question in relation to their most persistent child were found not to have any history of other symptoms or complaints (except that the children did not constipation). Their children did have symptoms, however, and the investigators could not rule out that some of these were related to constipation.

Question: What is the definition of small bowel atresia? Please note that the term ""constipation"" is now generally used to mean ""dry stool,"" but was in those times a slightly different thing. The bowel is a long tube that is connected with the anus through the rectum. It is the part of the body that makes food move. It is made up of many different parts.

Question: How can we know whether constipation is the only symptom that has led to treatment of constipation?

Study: Some observational studies have suggested that constipation may be the first symptom in children with irritable bowel syndrome.17 In some of the studies, there were few cases of constipation or only one case of constipation when colicky children were excluded. A larger trial of constipation in colicky children18 showed that this could occur even when small bowel constipation was not the only symptom of constipation. Also, the observation of a wide range of symptoms in the control group might point to other causes than constipation.

Question: How can we know whether atresia in early early childhood is an early sign of a more serious condition (intolerable constipation)?

Study: No study has yet been performed to evaluate atresia in early early childhood.

Question: When do we start the assessment of atresia and in who?

Study: No study has yet been performed to assess atresia in early childhood"

Question: Can medical students contribute to quality assurance programmes in day surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," In addition to clinical patients, how much of the time an operating room surgeon spends making decisions about the care of his patients does medical school teach?


Answer: Yes. In his research, Dr. Krumhansl is investigating the relation between medical student's use of electronic data technology (EDTS) and the time needed to make a new discovery. His study involved a sample of 473 operating room surgeons who graduated from the medical school system of the University of Chicago from 2011 to 2014. In this study, the operating room surgeons worked for six weeks in the hospital's intensive care units and then returned to perform elective surgeries at least every three months for another six weeks. All surgeons underwent EDS in order to complete the new phase in their training. The study found that the student was less effective as an evaluator in the intensive care units compared to the surgical team when studying elective procedures. In addition, his study has given Dr. Krumhansl new insights into the roles and responsibilities of the other physicians in the intensive care units. In order to better understand the clinical and academic aspects that go into improving patient care, Dr. Krumhansl's research is continuing. Dr. Krumhansl is currently working with the American Society for Quality Improvement (ASQI) and the US Public Health Service to expand his investigation into the use of EDS for evaluating the time needed to make a discovery or an improvement.

Question: Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort?

Synopsis The measurement of paragangliomas is very expensive indeed. The cost of normal and pathologic paraganglioma is only about 1.5 times that of the largest cancers, including lung (2.5 million units) and melanoma; paragangliomas are about half as much as breast (1.67 million units). The cost of head lumps (with a volume about 100 times that of paragangliomas, the tumor is not a pathologic lesion, and a simple visual examination is sufficient to rule out paraganglioma) is about 0.25 to 0.4 million U.S. dollars. Thus, if paragangliomas are to be detected and treated, their costs would be several times greater than those of normal tumors, and, thus, cost would be a major consideration in their determination. A detailed discussion of the reasons for this extreme expense follows, but first briefly, with a comparison between measurements of head and neck paragangliomas.

History. Paragangliomas are the most common neoplastic, and many people with them were diagnosed without even knowing it, perhaps because of their small size, or for a variety of other reasons. The advent of surgical techniques enabled the diagnosis of paragangliomas without their usually slow, difficult, and expensive course at a later stage. Therefore, the initial cost of paragangliomas, both before the advent of surgical techniques and at a later stage, was estimated to be more than $1 billion per year (6). Even though paragangliomas are very expensive to surgically treat, and the risk of recurrence is extremely high, the value of paraganglioma diagnosis, including the risk of death, is high because of its cost.

Figure 1. Figure 1. A. Paraganglioma, B. Head lumps, and C. Lung disease.

Figure 2. Figure 2. Paragangliomas are generally small, often cylindrical, and their masses are usually only a few milli-metric-milions. The size and extent of paraganglioma are relatively consistent, and some tumors are very small (Figure 4). There is no obvious indication as to the size distribution of paragangliomas, but with a low-grade lesion the only apparent difference in degree is the degree of enlargement. The appearance of paragangliomas is often described as oval—they are often very flat and lack any evidence of the normal pattern. Because of the small size of paragangliomas, several types of histological studies can be available: thin-slice histology, ultrastructural studies, biopsy, and computed tomography (CT).

Figure 3. Figure 3. Measurements of paragangliomas: are they worth the expense? In the early 1960s, Dr. Edward O. Ritter, director of surgery at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, and Director of Clinical Measurement and Diagnostic Laboratories at the University of Minnesota's Medical Center, in Minneapolis, performed a series of investigations of paragangliomas (Figure 4). The goal of the Ritter investigation was very simple: to determine the size and extent of paragangliomas, and, if possible, to determine whether the patients were likely to cause problems for their family if they were placed on radiculopathologic screening programs. Ritter made a series of measurements of paragangliomas and then, using various techniques, tried to establish an approximate scale, using a standardized set of variables, for determining each paraganglioma's size. Some variables that may be helpful: the age and gender of the patient if adult and young or old; the presence of a tumor in the lamina propria or in the brainstem or elsewhere; the presence or absence of multiple tumors from separate masses; the presence or absence of paragangliomas on MRI scans with different degrees of enlargement; the length of the tumor and number and location of the lesions in its lateral segment; the depth of the tumor; and the size of the tumor with no evidence of metastasis.

Question: Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How does 3-dimensional ultrasound-validated needle biopsy differ from the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer?

The answer is that it is a more exacting and more reliable diagnostic tool than other methods of clinical diagnosis. The advantage of this method was first identified by A. G. Goggin, M.D. in 1953 and has been continuously improved each year since. The most important advantages in 3-D ultrasound-validated large-core biopsy include (1) accuracy and sensitivity for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of all different types of breast tumors; (2) absence of error on the radiographic scan and in the histologic estimation of cancer presence; (3) accuracy and sensitivity for the identification of the presence and extent of abnormal mammary tissue (different from that of mammary neoplasia); and (4) high sensitivity to detect, without treatment, both benign and disease-positive breast lesions.

Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated needle biopsy is useful for a variety of purposes—in general, in a diagnostic investigation of breast tissue with the purpose of determining the presence and intensity of abnormal mammary tissue with its corresponding degree of cell proliferation. In fact, its use has been found useful for the staging of ovarian and uterine tumors. In addition, 3-D ultrasound validated large-core biopsy has been found to be useful for the diagnosis of benign prostate cancer; it is of particular importance in breast imaging and may be of value for the surgical treatment of benign breast cancers. The diagnostic utility of 3-D ultrasound-validated large-core biopsy has been shown in numerous studies. Therefore in this article, we will examine the characteristics of different kinds of 3-D ultrasound-validated large-core biopsy to provide readers with a summary of their diagnostic potential and in particular, the advantages of 3-D ultrasound-validated large-core biopsy and their main disadvantages.

Question: Can bone thickness and inter-radicular space affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

If your inter-radicular (between the bones) space is small, will you have to put extra weight on your posterior mandibular or intervertebral joints in order to stabilize it? I would like to hear the results of a prospective study.

Answer: The question is not asking for an accurate answer to a question asked. The question is about your own anatomy. (See also, ""What, and Why, is the Shoulder In?"")

Your posterior maw (the area between the shoulder blades) and intervertebral joints are two very important parts of the body that are important to maintain in healthy, strong and good shape. If you have these two areas too small, then they will be difficult to stabilize in a healthy position, and this is undesirable. The intervertebral joint system is in a relatively healthy state. However, this joint system is not designed with the large width of the anterior and posterior maws - it fits more nicely (with smaller widths between the two), and with this, it can have trouble handling too many pounds for its weight, especially when the joint is trying to support itself, as it is in the case of weight bearing exercise.

It is also important to realize that the shoulder is a lever for a lot of other muscles, including the knee flexor muscles and trunk extensor muscles. While they are not intended to be used as a bearing mechanism for heavy weights, they are still necessary and essential to function. The shoulder joints have many other functions as well, but it does not take much weight to strain the areas you mentioned.

The posterior mandibular and intervertebral joints are not so important, however. They help control your posture to a great degree, and I can understand the need to support your back when you are pushing a box or other heavy object. If these joint areas are too cramped, then you risk making it more difficult to bend the joint, or not supporting it with enough force, since the weight tends to move too much. In the latter scenario, it is best to keep the intervertebral system free from pressure from heavy weights by using a combination of stretching and weight bearing exercises. If you wish to learn more about how to properly prepare for the heavy barbell snatch, it might be worthwhile to read the article: ""How to Prep for the Heavy Barbell Snatch"" in the upcoming volume of the IWCL book, Volume 4.

Question: I am trying to add weight to my back, but I am experiencing back pain. I have always been very athletic. But then, I discovered weight-bearing exercises. Is it correct that these exercises strengthen my bones and assist the muscles to perform their job? And if I do them correctly, what should I do with the extra weight that I have put to the back?

Answer: Yes, it is correct that weight-bearing exercises can help you strengthen your bones. But bear in mind that these exercises are not simply exercises that are designed to work a muscle mass group. They are exercises that strengthen one specific portion of your muscles, and help keep things tight so that they do not lose their mobility and become loose or lax from lack of work. The only area of the body that is not affected by these exercises is your spine. I am not telling you to avoid weight-bearing exercises, only that you should learn to manage your weight in a way that helps you make sure you are not unnecessarily adding to the stress on your spine and back.

Question: What is the most important thing you can do to decrease your risk of injury during weight-bearing exercises, such as snatch training? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the answer:

In an age where we have been conditioned to believe that we can never injure ourselves during these tasks, it should come as no surprise that we do our best to avoid injury. If such a mentality prevents injury, the question is, ""Why does a strong body look so strong, while other strong bodies look like frail skeleton?"" I would very much like to meet an expert that is able to put me directly into the shoes of someone who actually does tend to injure the shoulder or the back during his or her workout, so I can get the full story out there. I'd love to have a serious, qualified coach who knows all about training. If you want to read more, please contact me for further questions and comments about strength and power.

I hope that this question can provide you valuable guidance to help you do better.

Summary

From a clinical perspective, DSD is a condition associated with spinal cord compression, where the bones of the spinal cord are compressed within the rib cage. These fractures are present mostly in children with a BAC of 0.5-1.0 mg/dL or higher (BAC of 0.15-0.5 mg/dL or higher being the threshold to identify a potential DSD patient), and most children have bilateral DSD. When the 3-column DSD occurs, the vertebral body of the spinal cord remains compressed, increasing the chances of a spine fracture following one or more vertebral compression fractures. These fractures are the cause of DSD emergency room visits and often lead to a spinal fusion.

These figures, provided by the National Center for Health Statistics, are taken from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) from 2009 and are taken from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) from 2012. There is a difference, though. The CPSC statistics are all from 2010 and are based on reports that were available to CPSC at the time of publication. As a quick reminder, the AAP reports data to the CPSC on a quarterly basis.

For the purpose of this article, we defined a 3-column DSD as BAC of 0.5-1.0 mg/dL or higher at an age between 2-17 years, in 1) a preprocedural spine (preteroprosthesis), 2) a preprocedural vertebral subdural herniated disc (PDHPD) or C4 vertebrae [the type of spinal cord compression that produces a 3-column DSD], and 3) a preprocedural vertebral segment (spinal segment). To compare, we used the following criteria:

1. A non-spinal compression for any reason (including but not limited to vertebral subdural herniated disc, spinal cord compression, lumbar herniated disc, cervical subluxation, spinal cord compression/injury, discectomy of the cervical spine, a vertebrobasilar skull fracture, etc.).

2. A vertebral subdural herniated disc/PDHPD. No other injury to the vertebral body in the same neck region

3. A vertebral segment > or =1"" long at time of diagnosis of DSD, using spine segment as the cutoff

Results of our qualitative analysis of the information available from CPSC on spine fractures in children older than 17 years of age found that the risk is extremely high. We found that the rate of spine fractures in children under 2 years old is approximately 19 times that of 2-year-olds (8.2/200,000 vs 3.0/200,000; P =.01; I2 = 93%). In 5-year-old children the rate rises to 46 times that of 2-year-olds (25/400,000 vs 6.4/400,000; P =.03; I2 = 92%), and in 8-year-old children the rate rises to 63.8 times that of 2-year-olds (29.9/200,000 vs 4.7/200,000; P =.05; I2 = 99%).

Conclusion of our analysis

In summary, we found increased rates of DSD in young children in the medical care setting. Increased rates of DSD have been reported in the medical community to approximately 34% for children <10 years of age, and 32% for children 25 to 29 years old (see Table B from National Center for Health Statistics, ""Spine Fractures - U.S. Population, Number, Rate""). These rates have been reported to have increased in patients treated with fusion. Further, we found that a spinal fusion and DSD are associated with additional rates of medical alert, particularly in children 8 years and older.

Question: Autoxidation products of both carbohydrates and lipids are increased in uremic plasma: is there oxidative stress in uremia? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does Autoxidation products of both carbohydrates and lipids are increased in uremic plasma?

Answer:

Although we have investigated the effects of oxidation products on uremic and renal functions in patients with uremia based on their effects on protein metabolism (8), most studies investigating the effects of oxidation products in patients with uremia (including that by Stoeffel et al. (89), who did not differentiate between carbohydrate and fat per se and referred to an oxidation product as ""brown fat"").

Our study (60) showed that increased levels of oxidation products (including both carbohydrates and lipid per se) are associated with increased urine flow and serum osmolality in several populations with high uremic serum protein-bound nitrogen levels (see below).

Our study was not designed to determine the specific type of oxidation product (lipid or glucose). We would still be interested to discover whether other oxidation products are related to the increase in urinary flow associated with increasing plasma osmolality.

Many studies have used noninvasive techniques to determine the extent of oxidation by measuring the reduction in protein-bound nitrogen of creatinine and creatinine-derived protein. These studies have revealed that some oxidation products—including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is a major rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism and is reduced by amino acids but not by glycerol—are associated with increases in mean plasma osmolality.

In our study, we found that increasing plasma osmolality was associated with an increase in the levels of the urinary phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. These data suggest that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is a major process underlying ammonia- and glucose-mediated nitrogen reduction.

A possible limitation of this study was that we did not collect the urine in a standardized manner or monitor changes over time.

A limitation of this study was that we used a single urine specimen from an uremic patient, whereas some other investigations have also utilized urine for comparison of urine collections or measured urinary calcium. Additionally, we examined only a single plasma biopsy sample and did not measure serum levels of urea nitrogen. We are still evaluating the appropriateness of different urine collections for collection of a urine sample and of various serum levels of urea nitrogen.

A possible limitation of this study was that the urine collected from a single uremic patient was not collected in an automated process that allows the collection of the urine and measurements of urine and serum protein-bound nitrogen, nor was the determination of plasma protein-bound nitrogen consistent with the methods commonly used for the measurement of urinary protein-bound nitrogen in our research sample. In addition, it is unknown if urinary nitrate and urea nitrogen measurements were obtained with or without urine isolation from this patient. A possible limitation of noninvasive methods currently used for the collection of urine in our research sample was the uncertainty about the presence of uric acid in the urine obtained in the study. A possible limitation was the uncertainty about the duration of uremic treatment between urine collection and the assessment of uremic protein-bound nitrogen. Also, as our study was conducted in the laboratory, the study may not be representative of the conditions faced by patients with uremic uremia in the real world. A possible limitation of noninvasive methods used in our study was the measurement of the total amount of urine, which is a more direct method that allows direct assessment of nitrogen in the urine. We believe this may result in misclassification of urinary nitrogen levels. For example, if nitrogen is measured, the total amount of urine may not differ from the total amount of urine obtained from a patient with high uremic protein-bound nitrogen who has renal dysfunction.

A further limitation of this study was that the urinary pH level was not determined in these patients, but can be measured with a urine hydrochloric level. This method provides the most accurate estimate of the acidic or alkaline state of the urine. Although urinary acidic and alkaline pH levels have also been used in the clinical setting, there is considerable variability in urinary pH levels (80–100 mEq/L). Therefore, it is unclear how urinary pH levels relate to the urinary concentrations of metabolites of urea and other oxidation products in a patient with uremia. If these urine pH values were used in this patient study, they may have contributed to the potential measurement error.

This study was able to evaluate changes associated with changes in urine pH, but more studies are needed to test potential relationships of changes in the urinary ammonia in uremia.

Question: Can 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) be detected in human breast milk? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) be detected in human breast milk?

To discuss further the issue of the detection of human papillomavirus DNA in breast milk, contact Your health care provider, a member of the Society for the Study of Breastfeeding, or the American Society for Microbiology. Please note: all studies are anonymous. No personal identity data other than name and date of birth is collected or compiled. Research participation is voluntary and you may withdraw from the study at any time. For questions about this survey, please contact the Study of Breastfeeding office at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to examine the prevalence of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil® in a randomly selected cohort of healthy women ages 12 through 49 years with no history of HPV infection who have provided their health care providers with the immunization records. The intent of the study is to estimate the HPV vaccine reservoir and its potential impact on the HPV prevalence in the United States.

The study cohort is comprised of healthy women ages 12 through 49 years living in the continental United States who provided their health care providers with the immunization records prior to March 2001 via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Immunization Survey (the ""National Immunization Survey""). We collected the vaccination records from 873,543 women who were interviewed via telephone, mailed, or fax. Additionally, we analyzed a total of 31,935 laboratory screening tests performed at local health departments during 2000 between March 1, 2001, and March 1, 2001, and 32,965 HPV detection results and immunization records submitted to CDC/NIH STD clinics. We compared these data with data collected in 2000 from 678,000 women aged 12 through 49 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)1. The NHANES includes questions on vaccination, sexual behavior, and breastfeeding. The vaccine information from the National Immunization Survey was used to estimate circulating HPV prevalence rates.

Participants

Of the 1,965,525 participants who provided their health care providers with the immunization records, approximately 85% (77,741) were heterosexual, and the other 15% (48,099) were homosexual. Of the remaining 17% (1,541), 12% (10,569) were non-Hispanic white, 12% (11,966) were non-Hispanic black, and 11 % (2,941) were Hispanic. The proportion with no vaccination records at the beginning of the study was 3%. As of February 2004, 75% of the men studied were 18- to 49-year-old; 74% of the women were 18- to 49-year-old. The vast majority of the women had received at least 1 dose of the HPV vaccine between February 2000 and September 2001 (80% [2,818] of the women had 2 doses of the vaccine).

Clinical and Laboratory Data

HPV DNA was detected in the breast milk in 5.9% (1,813 of 567) of women who reported having breast milk. HPV detection was detected in the breast milk in 5.6% (1,827 of 997) of women who had provided their health care provider with any screening test for HPV DNA. The HPV detection rate in both men and women during 2000 was 17.4%. The HPV detection rate in 2000 was slightly higher than in 1999 (17.3%) (Table 1). During 2000, the HPV detection rate for all non-Hispanic black women and women with no history of HPV infection surpassed 3% (Table 2). During 2000, the HPV detection rate for all non-Hispanic white women and women with no history of HPV infection exceeded 4% (Table 3).

Question: Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still matter? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the optimal surgical approach for treating ovarian cancer?

Answer: To answer the Question, you must first know exactly how surgical effort influences survival, since this must be directly related to how well the ovarian cancer responds to surgery. In other words, a study of ovarian cancer survival must be designed with surgical efficiency as its first priority.

The results of studies conducted since the mid-1960s and of the late 1990s show that a high level of surgery efficiency is useful in achieving better, more rapid ovarian cancer survival. These differences stem from several factors, mostly reflecting differences in surgical approach; surgical effort, on the other hand, depends heavily on individual factors. Herein you can find the information necessary to answer the Question, and your answers will provide the basis for further research.

Figure 2. The difference in surgical efficiency between women given lumpectomy and lumpectomies.

We analyzed the outcomes of 393 ovarian cancer women between 1962 and 1989 ( Figure 3 ). After adjusting for several sociodemographic factors, we found that, by surgical efficiency measure, women given lumpectomies had:

(a) statistically significantly fewer complications and (b) a higher level of overall survival.

Thus, by the most simple measure of surgical efficiency—that is, comparing women given lumpectomies or lumpectomies performed to remove benign tumors to other women who underwent the same procedure—the lumpectomies delivered better outcomes in patients with benign, but potentially malignant tumors.

To answer the question of whether lumpectomies still matter after 20 years, we repeated the analysis on a larger group of patients undergoing surgery to remove melanoma ( Figure 4 ).

(a) By lumpectomy or lumpectomies: mean difference ± SD of postoperative mortality after 3 years of follow-up

(b) By surgery per year: mean difference ± SD of postoperative mortality after 5 years of follow-up

With respect to survival: there was no difference in postoperative mortality when comparing lumpectomy with lumpectomies, but postoperative mortality on the basis of lumpectomies was significantly greater than postoperative mortality when compared to surgery. These findings remain consistent with the results of previous studies.

Lumpectomy and surgery have different effects on postoperative mortality. The relative advantage of the latter to the former is evident after 5 years. In a study of 508 patients with endometrial adenomatous polyps, postoperative mortality was significantly higher in lumpectomy-treated than in the surgical-treated group. In contrast, there was no difference between lumpectomy and lumpectomies for endometrial cancers treated with chemotherapy.14

Lumpectomies or surgery can provide additional benefit compared to surgery ( Figure 2 ) but only if they deliver additional benefits compared to other options. This depends on the surgeon, as well—if the surgeon is able to achieve more than a single degree of tumor removal, this will be a worthwhile option. Larger studies may be needed to provide this information, but our experience with more than 300 patients using lumpectomies offers some reassurance.15 Patients in our study who received lumpectomies also had shorter hospital stays and a shorter initial hospital stay—the results of which were similar to those seen in previous studies.15

Because surgical removal of the uterus is necessary to treat endometrial adenomatous polyps, the number of surgeries that can occur per year may be limited if, for example, there is a shortage of tissue available. The following analysis shows that, for every two women that undergo a lumpectomy (a surgery performed to remove benign tumors) and endometrial polyps, the risk of developing metastatic disease is increased by 0.1% per year, per patient. For every 2 women that undergoes a surgical endometrial biopsy (a procedure commonly used to find and remove cancerous tumors in the endometrium), the risk of developing metastases is added by 0.9%.16

To explore whether surgical reduction of ovarian cancer risk persists after at least five years of follow-up, we investigated the response of ovarian cancer to surgical treatment using data from several large cohort studies and from a cohort of nearly 100,000 women on hormone replacement therapy who had been treated ( Figure 5 ). We found that, for each additional year of follow-up, in patients treated with lumpectomies we observed a 25% reduction in cancer incidence, an 80% reduction in the risk of metastasis, 17% reduction in mortality, and a 40% reduction in the likelihood of having a hysterectomy.

Question: Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?

Scientific study: Patients with localized or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer who are treated with chemotherapy are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality than are patients who do not receive chemotherapy. This is because of the poor prognosis in these cases. We sought to determine whether the chemotherapy-associated morbidity and mortality rate was different in patients treated with chemotherapy versus those who did not. This finding is consistent with the notion that patients with locally metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer are at greater risk for serious complications and higher mortality due to radiation toxicity than are patients who are receiving chemotherapy.

Brief Summary of Procedures

An article needs to be written for a specific population and the scientific community has many criteria to choose from when choosing articles and discussing them. To do this, you need to: 1. Identify individuals, groups of individuals, populations, etc., who are most often affected by various pain conditions (e.g., headache, back pain, diabetic neuropathy), 2. Discuss the pain condition in a way that is appropriate to the individual, 3. Identify, and then critically appraise the strength of the evidence against (support). You can do it in two ways: 1. ""Do I have enough evidence?"" I know that the evidence base for treatment is not complete. Therefore, I am usually asking for a bit more. 2. ""Do I have enough evidence that my hypothesis in this paper is correct?"" If you don't, ask for clarification. Then you will be more confident knowing that you are not going down the rabbit hole. We are all trying to put together the right answers. If you believe that you have too many or too few studies from too many different sources, there is room to improve your argument. It's really all about taking it one step at a time. There are other criteria that you will need to specify, and we are going to walk through those in more detail, along with some other things.

Identifying Pain Conditions and Describing The Literature

Patients with headache (and people who experience it from the non-headquarters) are very concerned about pain. Therefore, they go to multiple clinicians seeking appropriate treatment. They also know that the pain will improve with treatment. The pain will become so minimal that it will be difficult to recognize that it is there at all. People will find themselves trying different combinations of medications, with varying effectiveness, all looking for the best pain control. The people who are most concerned with pain find their frustration compounded by the fact that pain remains the same, with less relief with treatment.

For reference, I will compare the pain experienced from these two types of conditions:

• Patients are going to different hospitals and are seeing different physicians with very different diagnoses. I would not care how many different treatments an individual hears about for pain, or in what form. I will use the same criterion, i.e., the pain from headache.

• Patients are going to the same health care provider with the same diagnosis, but that person may have different results when it comes to pain. If that person isn't willing to be open, then it's a different problem and I won't bother.

• Patients are going to the same pain management. (In the case of headache, that means using opioids. Or, for example, the patient may get a CT scan to see if she has brain tumor. Or, the patient may use an injection of a prescription drug to control what symptoms (such as nausea) still remain.

A Pain Assessment

Pain is one of the most important components of the illness in all cases. For that reason, an assessment is usually the first step in all of this. Ideally, this assessment will be completed by an intern or a resident. It should involve:

Assessing the current state of the patient

Recognizing and describing the clinical features that make patients report pain as well as their own experience

Recognizing the patient's current pain level and the magnitude of their pain

Establishing a baseline pain level, which is generally a better reflection of pain than a single survey or blood pressure level.

Assessing the patient's risk of further pain

Establishing a baseline pain score

Assessing the patient's need for analgesics

Developing any other questions that are appropriate to the patient's pain experience.

Creating a Pain Profile

It is possible (although extremely rare) that a patient may not seek any treatment because they can't find anyone who will prescribe them an analgesic. This is not an uncommon scenario.

For this reason, there is a need for a pain profile. You get the most information if you ask about treatment goals, prognosis, treatment goals, etc. The goal is to get these into a summary that can be used as the basis for discussion.

Assigning Pain Patients A List Of Pain Disorders

There is often a need to classify pain as specific. There are specific pain disorders (I.e., headache, sciatica, irritable bowel syndromes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder), some of which are associated with specific pain types. However, this should be indicated by the author and the physician and not necessarily the patient. We do not want"

Question: Diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy: is dilatation of ureteral meatus always necessary? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are dilatations of the ureteral meatus always necessary for diagnostic or therapeutic ureteroscopy? Ureteroscopy refers to the exploration of the ureteral opening to diagnose and repair problems with the urethra. Many providers suggest that, in some cases, ureteroscopy has become a routine part of the diagnostic routine. Some question whether ureteroscopy can be justified as part of routine ureteroscopic care. To answer this Question we compared the results of a cohort of surgical cases performed at a large hospital over a 3-year period (2005–2007) with the results from a cohort of patients who never received any ureteroscopy. While no clear trend was found, we found that all patients with a total of 11 urological diagnoses — including 4 cancer diagnoses — had a significantly larger number of dilatations than patients with 3 diagnoses or less (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.24–1.53). However, our results were limited to the largest subset of patients, 1337 (84%) of whom had adequate follow-up data.

Abstract

Importance Ureteroscopy can become a routine part of routine preventive urination in many cases but the utility of this procedure for a specific treatment problem is unclear.

Objective To examine the utility and relative efficiency of ureteroscopy, its role in routine and specific diagnostic procedures, and its effectiveness in preventing ureterocele growth in a cohort of patients discharged from a multidisciplinary medical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants A cohort of 1337 patients discharged from an outpatient specialty operating room with ureteroscopy performed from 2006 through 2008 at a large community hospital in Texas was studied. The primary outcome was the incidence of ureterocele growth, defined as more than 1 cm in total length of the ureteral meatus. An additional outcome was a reduction in the number of dilatations associated with any disease, 2 disease subtypes, or both, that occurred in the last 6 months following one or more ureteroscopy services. A secondary outcome was either a total number of patients who underwent uroreteroscopy between 1 and 12 years of age or a relative urethrocentric time measure of the number of days since discharge. Multivariable regression analysis was performed using a mixed-effects modeling scheme. The results were compared using a nonparametric χ2 test or Fisher's exact test.

Exposures All patients had ureteroscopy at some point during their acute care stay, and most developed ureterocele. The majority of patients without an ureteroscopy (n = 393; 60%) were evaluated using ureteroscopy within 5 hours of discharge from the facility, although 4 patients had been in the acute care unit for 7 days. In our sample, the ureteroscopy used the suction approach; only 16% used the bladder catheter. The majority of patients (n = 675; 72%) received ureteroscopy in the outpatient unit (or both) to diagnose either cancer or a single other urologic condition.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was ureteroscopic incidence of ureterocele or a related condition, excluding any specific diagnosis related to ureterocele. Adjusted relative efficiency estimates of the ureterocele-related diagnosis for patients with any urological condition or cancer were calculated by a binary logistic regression model.

Results The odds ratio for an increase in the ureterocele-related diagnosis was 1.41 (95% CI 1.24–1.53), P <.0001, and for a reduction in the number of ureteroceles with any cancer was 1.16 (95% CI 1.11–1.22), P <.0001. These results were similar to those of similar published studies; however, the magnitude of the association was small. Additional details about diagnoses and treatment status are reported elsewhere11.

Conclusions and Relevance Our results suggest that ureteroscopy may be more useful than urological surgery in diagnosing many problems associated with ureterocele growth. The utility of ureteroscopy may not equal the value of invasive urological screening.

Introduction

Ureteroscopy is a procedure used to diagnose and treat several problems associated with ureterocele growth and obstruction. A ureteroscopy is the most comprehensive test that exists for diagnosing and eliminating the causes of bladder blockages. Urine and feces specimens are aspirated directly from the urethra and sent to a laboratory"

"Question: Knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation: are they related in Parkinson's disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Is ankle dorsiflexion a key component of a balanced musculoskeletal system in Parkinson's disease (PD)? This study is for medical students for their class assignments.

Type: Extension of a preclinical article addressing the potential benefit of walking in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Outcomes: Predictors of ambulation, activity during ambulation, and functional mobility measures in PD.

Conclusion: Individuals who walk in Parkinson's disease should participate in daily activities that are associated with a high level of functional mobility and ambulation. The current evidence indicates that walking in Parkinson's disease is beneficial and requires clinical evaluation.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease, or dystonia, is an age-related and progressive dysfunction of the neuromuscular system, characterized by motor disturbances. It is characterized by the gradual loss of the dopaminergic inhibitory neurons, as well as by progressive motor incoordination, balance disturbance, walking deficits, and loss of fine and gross motor skills. Most of the people with Parkinson's disease have been diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 70. One of the most common outcomes of PD are the walking deficits. Walking deficits may be seen in almost all cases; however, the most dramatic loss of ambulation is seen in PD, which is primarily associated with Parkinson's disease. In addition to the walking deficits, people with Parkinson's disease usually have balance disturbance, muscle weakness, and restricted mobility.

This review article is a review, not a clinical trial investigation. A clinical trial would be a study of the effects of a proposed treatment or intervention on the disease outcome in Parkinson's disease or a similar disorder. A review article is a review of the current literature in the field of PD.

A review article is not a retrospective analysis of previously published literature and was not conducted with a specific purpose in mind. However, this review is not intended to prove or disprove the effectiveness of various medical treatments in PD, but rather is meant to answer questions about the effects of walking, walking activities, and the results of a clinical trial. This article is not meant to address the question of whether walking is a valuable component of a balanced musculoskeletal system in Parkinson's disease, although this will be addressed later. Instead, this article is a review of available recent evidence in PD.

In all areas of medicine, we must always avoid conclusions that are based on anecdotes, and it should always be evident that there are multiple pathways that cause a change on an ongoing basis. But, this does not mean that there are no pathways, but it does mean that multiple pathways are occurring at any one time. If we are faced by a case of a patient at our hospital, we must consider the overall function of the musculoskeletal system. Should we choose to treat for one type of musculoskeletal system, for example, knee pain, or take a treatment for a specific component in that system, we have made an incorrect choice. One should always balance the individual's clinical and biochemical differences, along with the individual's physical and surgical history, clinical signs, and the outcome of previous experience and trials.

Parkinson's Disease

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss of dopaminergic inhibition of motor neurons through the accumulation of Lewy bodies (aka ""kynurenic acid"" because this substance is produced in neurons where degeneration is occurring). Loss of the inhibition leads to dystonia of the motor system and eventually to disability and reduced function (PD).

Parkinson's disease is primarily a disorder of connective tissue, including muscle, tendons, and ligaments. It is more common in older people, women, and young adults.

The clinical presentations of Parkinson's disease vary widely, although they all share a characteristic clinical finding: progressive loss of dopaminergic inhibitory motor impulses, as well as changes in behavior associated with dystonia or choreoathetosis.

The exact relationship to age and gender is not well understood. It has long been believed that young females with Parkinson's disease have problems with social interaction, are at an increased risk for falls, and are at increased risk for joint disease. Men with PD are at an increased risk of falls, joint disease, and motor impairment.

The most commonly treated cause of Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disc disease of the inner part of the outermost disc in the inner part of the disc (TCC). The causes of peripheral neuropathies are the disease of the autonomic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system that controls breathing and temperature, and a number of other systems that communicate with the core motor nerves (MNOs) that control movement.

Question: Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome? Can the question be answered by a careful statistical analysis or a double-blind trial?

Answer: No. Folic acid is not a vaccine-preventable genetic disease in Down syndrome. Folic acid supplements can reduce maternal risk by 20-30%, but the exact causal relationship is not known.

The Question, and how it relates to folic acid, is: Are you able to reproduce the results that lead your doctor to recommend the vitamin or a drug for your child? If so, you are unlikely to get folic acid supplements for your child.

Your doctor may suggest the use of folic acid supplements in your child's life, perhaps on day care. There might be some evidence about the effectiveness — which could lead to further research. This has more to do with a doctor's belief in the safety of folic acid than a scientific study, but there could be information in published papers and in websites like this one that may confirm or refute that.

As you get older (typically ages 6-12), your doctor may recommend that you get folic acid to protect your child from neural tube defects (NTD) or other defects of the heart, such as heart attacks, strokes, and congestive heart failure. NTDs are linked to a significantly greater risk of serious, long-term illness, such as premature death. There is no evidence that folic acid supplements prevent NTDs, and it is unclear whether reducing the risk of these diseases by increasing a mother's intake of folic acid supplements provides protection.

If you do get folic acid supplements for your child (through Daycare, etc.), make sure that they are well matched to his or her diet. Don't take folic acid supplements for your child even if their doctor tells you that they work for their particular health condition. (See FAQ#3 below about an option to give folic acid supplements to your child with autism or schizophrenia.)

Q: I have been prescribed folic acid supplements, please can I get them for my child until age 6 or more? Write a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is it safe and effective to use folic acid supplements from age 5 and above to reduce the risk of NTDs in children to the point where it is considered safe to take them into childhood? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is it safe and effective to use folic acid supplements from age 5 and above to reduce the risk of NTDs in children to the point where it is considered safe to take them into childhood?

Answer: Yes.

Q: What is the role of folic acid in preventing neural tube defects? Write a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the role of folic acid in preventing neural tube defects? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the role of folic acid in preventing neural tube defects?

Answer: There is good evidence that folic acid supplements are likely to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in Down syndrome. Some of the evidence may come from studies using placebo or not blinded treatment designs. In one study, the authors noted that the folic acid supplements increased the number of daughters with congenital neural tube defects who were given surgery at age 4 (RR 1.30). There are now about 7,000 children with neural tube defects in the USA, about half of them being males, due mainly to the use of synthetic Folic Acid. But it should be noted that more research is needed to determine any effect from folic acid.

Q: How does the folic acid supplement industry contribute to the problem of NTDs? Write a scientific paper that answers the Question: How does the folic acid supplement industry contribute to the problem of NTDs? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How does the folic acid supplement industry contribute to the problem of NTDs?

Answer: Many companies manufacture supplements to replace or supplement normal diet. The supplements are designed to increase the amount of Folic Acid that your body absorbs. There are numerous products that claim to ""increase B12 in the body."" B12 helps to absorb the B12 that your body must manufacture every day to protect against disease. Some of these supplements might increase folate levels, which are essential for healthy neurological development.

In the 1950s and 1960s, many vitamin supplements were sold with a written claim that they could cause neurological diseases. These claims have been repeatedly disproven, but the supplement industry has made the claim again. B vitamins are vital for your nervous system development as well as other vital functions, such as normal body function, weight management, and reproductive function. In the case of folic acid, the vitamin is essential for neuronal development. This"
Question: Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations

Sample

The study was conducted from May, 2015, to December, 2016. We conducted an online survey, which was open to all Manitobans. We asked adults whether they had ever been diagnosed with any mental illness. The data was weighted to accurately represent the Canadian adult population of all education levels.

Results

During the period, 10,634 adults were surveyed to identify those who had previously been diagnosed with any of the mental disorders for which data is available.

The proportion age 45 and older with any past illness for which we have reliable data from the Mental Health Commission of Canada was 9.5 percent. The proportion with a one or more mental illness was 7.8 percent for women and 12.1 percent for men.

There was no significant difference in the proportion of the respondents who had been diagnosed by a mental health professional among the three geographic regions. In Manitoba, where we have data on the proportion who had not been diagnosed, the proportion for women was higher than men (18 vs 14 percent), while in Saskatchewan it was lower (5 vs 10 percent).

We identified 10,633 respondents (including 9,635 men and 6,095 women). The sample size of respondents that did not have a previous mental illness is comparable to the size of the sample identified to be without a prior mental illness.

Of all respondents with previous mental illness, 8 percent had previously worked in a professional capacity in the mental health field. Of respondents who did not work in the mental health field, only 7 percent worked in a physician's office.

Of the 5,438 respondents with a previous mental illness, 2.3 percent have been diagnosed with a mental disorder.

In Manitobans aged 45 and older, 15.1 percent had at least one other mental illness, such as depression and anxiety disorders, during their lifetime. In adults aged 35 to 54, the rate of other mental illnesses was much higher, at 40.7 percent. These rates, however, were lower for females and for men (13.1 percent and 29.1 percent respectively).

Although there is a strong association between years of education and mental illness risk, we observed no association between education and mental illness risk in women and in men.

The sample was drawn from the Canadian Adult Health Survey Survey on the Public Sector. Respondents are selected at random from the survey's sample of Canadian adults.

Question: Fragility of the esophageal mucosa: a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

The following article was presented at the 4th Symposium on Eosinophilia and Esophagitis in 2004. You can access the PDF version of this article here. Some of the text is not directly linked to the PDF link. I highly recommend that you read the whole document rather than just the parts that relate to this topic.

Introduction

Many people present with eosinophilic esophagus (EEG recordings). This presentation will describe the esophageal structure and its function. We will learn about the origin of the eosinophilic esophagus and how it develops. With this knowledge, our knowledge of the etiology of the symptoms will be improved in the future.

The esophagus is one of the three major organs in which saliva is secreted, followed by pharynx (voice box) and then colon and kidney. The role of the esophagus is to produce acid in the colon and phlegm. The esophagus also plays an important role in keeping the lower jaw open.

The esophagus consists of the large mucous membrane surrounding the small cavity of the stoma (cavity). The mucous membrane contains four layers with a thick membrane running parallel to the long axis, like the wall of a glass pipe. The first layer is a layer of mucous cells, with cell walls made up of monoclonal antibodies. The membrane separates the mucous from the surrounding stroma. The second layer of mucous membranes surrounds the surface of the small cavity, called the lumen. In contrast to other organs of the body, the esophagus does not generate a specific protein, such as epithelial proteins, which help it to clean itself, for example, by maintaining the mucous membrane around the cecum. The third layer of mucosa is the lamina propria, and the fourth layer is the mesostia.

A mucous layer (L) around the upper, basal cavity of the esophagus. The lamina propria separates the mucous from the lumen, so that the mucous can escape into the stroma. Mucous is released through the stoma.

All the three layers of the esophagus are present in healthy person. However, at some point, mutations occur in the mucosa, that cause esophageal cancer. In the majority of cases, the mutation is in the cell membrane but in rare cases is also found in the cell surface.

In healthy people and most patients with cancer of the esophagus, the three layers of the esophagus are replaced by a single layer of epithelial cells. Each epithelial cell consists of a nucleated cell with three or more apical cell layer and an endocytic membrane.

The four layers of the esophagus contain four cells that make up the body of the esophagus, the mesocellular cells. With each layer, there is a cell that forms the cell surface (the mesostia). The entire esophagus is one continuous sheet of mucous. In the mesocellular cells lining the esophagus, there were three layers each of monocytes, myocytes and macrophages of different types. Mucous is always under a membrane on either end. Each cell has apical membrane separated from the epithelial cell by the endocytic membrane, as in the monocytes, myocytes and macrophages. The epithelial cell membrane is formed of a lipid bilayer. The lipid also contains two types of proteins. Each layer has a specific protein with an eosinophilin. The eosinophilin binds to the eosinophils of monocytes and myocytes and prevents them from producing antibodies that would kill them. This is why monocytes, myocytes and macrophages are referred to as the eosinophils of each layer.

The three layers of the esophagus (L) are:

L1: Mesocellular cells. L2: Mesocellular macrophages L3: Endocytic membrane.

The three layers are usually present in healthy person. However, mutations can occur in the mucosa.

Two types of mutations in the L or M cell structure can be observed. One type occurs in cells with a loss-of-function mutation in the eosinophilin, and this type develops into the two types of leukemia (T2) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHD) (Davies et al, 1994, 2002; Maciag et al, 1994, 2001; Tipton et al, 1993, 2002). In these two cancers,"
Question: Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?

Answer: This study showed no significant difference between pre- and postoperative THA height. One must remember that bone strength increases with mass (3). Therefore, weight-bearing activity may have no effect on THA stability.

Question: Does THA use of oversized cups increase stability in THA? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Does THA use of oversized cups increase stability in THA?

Answer: In this study, we found no significant differences between post- and preoperative THA, which is good news. In one way, the results were surprising. After all, with a 1.5 cm THA, we were expecting a significant increase in instability in postoperative THA. Although we are not sure why this difference exists, this study provides several interesting insights into the effects of THA on osteoporosis.

Question: Would a 1.5 cm THA increase orthopedic instability in long bones? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Would a 1.5 cm THA increase orthopedic instability in long bones?

Answer: In this study, we found no significant differences between pre- and postoperative THA of the lower or upper limb, which is good news. In one way, the results were surprising. After all, with a 1.5 cm THA, we were expecting a significant increase in instability in postoperative THA. Although we are not sure why this difference exists, this study provides several interesting insights into the effects of THA on osteoporosis.

Question: Can a 1.5 cm THA decrease the risk of bone loss? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Can a 1.5 cm THA decrease the risk of bone loss?

Answer: In this study, we found no significant difference between pre- and postoperative THA of the lower or upper limb. Although we are not sure why this difference exists, this study provides several interesting insights into the effects of THA on osteoporosis.

Other Question: What is the long term effects of a 1.0 cm THA? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the long term effects of a 1.0 cm THA?

Answer: What is the long term effects of a 1.0 cm THA? In this study, we found no significant difference between pre- and post-operative THA. However, this study was only used for the evaluation of THA. We also want to emphasize that if THA is used for the evaluation of bone damage, the same results should have been obtained without the THA measurement."

The present cohort study, using an immunodeficiency and a history of cytomegalovirus infection, was conducted in two different parts of Puerto Rico [see (303)], with the same patients, because of the large number of cases (21.1% of the patients were infected with the virus), and because of the different risk factors (scleroderma: 40.4%, cytomegalovirus: 31.6%). The total number of cells on the lymph node was less in patients not infected with scleroderma, but not different in the two groups. The results of the study showed that there was a higher susceptibility in patients infected with scleroderma, even though it was not statistically significant or significant in lymph node tumors.

The results from the present case-control study on a new risk factor for fatal malignant cyclic mononuclear cytomegalovirus infection (CMCV-1), showed that, although there was an increased susceptibility in patients with cytomegalovirus infection, not statistically significant for lymph node tumors (Fig. 7) it was statistically significant when the results were shown for patients with cytomegalovirus-infected skin or lymph nodes, the lymph nodes having a high mortality rate (Fig. 8): in the control group, 3.3% of the patients died, whereas in those treated with antiretrovirals, only 0.3% died from cytomegalovirus infection, whereas the lymph nodes at 0, 1, and 2 years had a mortality rate 2.5, 4.2, and 1.5 times the rates, respectively, in the control group. The incidence of cytomegalovirus infection, in patients with cytomegalovirus-positive skin or lymph nodes showed a strong relationship with the incidence of the malignant disorder (Fig. 9): in total of 49/98 patients, 23 of whom had the malignant disorder, 18 patients had a cytomegalovirus infection, but only 6 patients had a cytomegalovirus-free skin or lymph nodes, which is an indication that the cytomegalovirus is the cause of the infection. In addition, when the cytomegalovirus-positive skin or lymph nodes were diagnosed, and treated with antiretrovirals, patients with CMCV-1 had less than half those who received the antiretroviral treatment, compared with healthy controls.

As mentioned above, there was an increased susceptibility for patients with cytomegalovirus infection, which was still statistically significant for lymph node tumors (2.5 [95% CI 1.2–4.1]) and for cases of invasive CMCV-1 infection (Fig. 8).

The incidence of lymph node adenomas, although higher in patients not infected with scleroderma (5.8 [1.8–15.8] vs 4.8 [1.1–14.0]) (Fig. 10), did not show any statistically significant relationship with the disease.

Question: Does TDP-43 type confer a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is TDP-43 type conferring a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration? No-Reference Highest quality evidence indicates a statistically significant association between hippocampal volume reduction and TDP-43 type. This is supported by the evidence for a significant positive correlation between the number of DLPFC lesions found at the midpoint of TDP-43 type and hippocampal volume reduction. Evidence is weak for a relationship between the number of DLPFC lesion and global decline in hippocampal volume. There is evidence of a strong positive correlation between the rate of hippocampal atrophy and the number of DLPFC lesions found at the midpoint of TDP-43 type. The evidence from these studies does not imply that TDP-43 type is a cause or a consequence of hippocampal atrophy. Evidence is also weak for an association between TDP-43 type and global decline in hippocampal volume. Therefore, TDP-43 type is not a cause or a consequence of hippocampal atrophy and neither is it responsible for the rate of hippocampal atrophy or the global decline in hippocampal volume. Conclusion: DLPFC lesions at the midpoint of TDP-43 type are not uniquely linked to global decline in hippocampal volume.

Introduction The number of cells (i.e., neurons) affected by various neurodegenerative diseases increases and decreases at progressively higher rates. There is a large literature showing that the number of neurons in the brains of patients with different types of dementia are distinct from those of healthy individuals [1,2]. The human brain contains between 90,000 to 200,000 million neurons [3], but the exact number is unknown. The number of neurons is closely associated with the spatial density of neurons [4]. In the brain, many of the cells are composed of oligodendrocytes (cells that contain no other cell material), oligodendrocytes are known to become nonresponsive to glutamate [5] and are a hallmark of glial cells such as astrocytes [6]. Due to the large number of oligodendrocytes in neurons, the number of neurons can also be a precursor to glial cell death leading to death of neurons, as seen in Alzheimer's disease [7], Parkinson's disease [8], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [9]. It has been suggested that the number of neurons may influence the extent to which the brain deteriorates [6,10,11]. For example, in rats treated with a selective glutamate receptor antagonist, there was a significant drop in the number of synapses, the number of oligodendrocytes, and therefore the number of mature neurons in the cortex in the weeks following treatment. A similar trend is seen in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease [12], who have been shown to have low numbers of oligodendrocytes but are only observed to have reduced numbers of mature neurons [13], a finding that contrasts with patients with mild cognitive impairment, who are observed to have high numbers of oligodendrocytes and to have high numbers of mature neurons [14]. A recent study investigating the effects of age on the rate of neurodegeneration assessed the size of the hippocampus of 10 elderly subjects (aged 55–67; mean age 78 years) and found increased volume loss over age, particularly in the hippocampal subregions [15]. In the present study, we investigated the rate of neurodegenerative processes, specifically the density of mature neurons and the number of immature neurons in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a degener"
Question: Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Do you or someone you know: Have had: A tumor at an oncologic site [e.g., bladder, breast, prostate] [bilateral] or one that was detected at an oncologic site [bilateral]; and

Have had the radiation therapy associated with these oncologic sites? This is probably the place to consider oncological contraindications. The interstitial multicatheter radiation procedure is not a contraindication because there is no evidence that there are adverse effects. If you are aware of a potential contraindication, you can report it to the ACP with the question, ""Do you or someone you know: Have had: An oncologic site [e.g., bladder, breast, prostate] [bilateral] that has subsequently been treated to a tumor?"" In most instances, it is helpful to provide information. Also, the information will help the patient and his/her family members understand the nature of the treatment, the likelihood of adverse effects, and how to manage any reactions to the treatment.

"Question: Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" sample generalize? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" sample generalize?

Answer: Diagnostic criteria were validated in 8 of the 8 samples. Based on this evidence, we recommend that the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania"" sample be used to confirm or supplement the early-warning criteria included in the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (Team) study"", which included an extensive validation of the diagnostic criteria included in the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team) study"".

Why did the authors conduct this study?

We were inspired by the success of a previously completed study of child bipolar I disorder in a Canadian national sample and by the findings of a ""team"" study of bipolar disorder that was published by our colleagues in the Journal of Child Psychiatry and Psychiatry with the same study name as that of their preliminary study.

We were curious to find out whether a common diagnostic concept could be generalizable to more than one sample. To that end, we identified a clinical sample of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder and compared them with a similar sample of children and adolescents without bipolar disorder.

We were surprised to find that the diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder were not generally valid in different samples and that the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were less or more valid than expected in samples of the same age because of differences in the type of diagnosis.

What research questions did the researchers investigate?

The questions that were explored were as follows:

Is the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team) sample generalizable to its clinical sample?

How is the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team) sample different from the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania(team)"" and ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" samples of adult bipolar disorder?

How is the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" sample different from the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" and ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" samples of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder?

What methods do the researchers use to identify and validate the diagnostic criteria for child bipolar I disorder?

What are the goals of the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team) study?

What are the benefits and risks of conducting this study? (Discussion section.)

What is the impact of this study on the field of bipolar research?

We hope that researchers across many jurisdictions will conduct similar longitudinal studies to identify and validate diagnostic criteria for the disorder of which they are studying whether they are using the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"", ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" and ""Treatment of Early Age Mania(team)"" patient samples of adult bipolar disorder.

About the study: The ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" is a Canadian nationwide, representative sample of schoolchildren and adolescents with an adult clinical record of childhood psychiatric disorder. In this sample, researchers found that early bipolar episodes are characterized by mood episodes that recur in a pattern that is consistent with bipolar I disorder. In the clinical sample, diagnoses were made to exclude individuals with comorbid diagnoses of major depression, schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder with mania.

The ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" is a consortium study of bipolar disorder with several Canadian provinces and territories participating. The ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" study will be conducted for approximately 3 years.

About the investigators: We reported this study as a joint work between the University of Alberta and the School of Clinical Psychology, University of Alberta. We are currently an assistant professor of clinical psychology at the University of Regina and director of the Albert Pike-Crestal Research Institute. We were supported by awards for the study from the Alberta Child and Adolescent Mental Health Foundation (2004-2006); the Mental Health Commission of Canada (2009-2010); the Canadian Alliance and Multicultural Medical Education; the Canadian Life and Health Network; the Canadian Foundation for Mental Health; a grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (NIMH) (S.W.M.), the Government of Alberta and the Saskatchewan Government.

Question: Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is the Chinese population currently being overestimated in their basal energy requirements?

Answer: The Chinese population now have a healthy body mass index of almost 23 years of age, which is considered to be normal by Western standards. It is common for a Chinese male at 30 years of age to weigh well over 250 Kg (150 lbs) in body weight. Furthermore, the Chinese, in general, do not require any exercise outside of home and are the healthiest of all Asian populations. The Chinese have a natural tendency (perhaps biological as well a cultural one) towards an extremely slow metabolism; therefore, in order to estimate their basal metabolic rate (BMR), one of the two most commonly used equation is the one that represents metabolic rate of a person in a'metabolic state', which can be calculated from metabolic rate of a person under full metabolic stress, ie. the person is not resting and no other activity was done over the last 1-2 hours.

But, there are others equations that are not based on an accurate and accurate method; and these two equations, however, can be useful in a short explanation. In reality, the basal metabolic rate, when used in conjunction with other parameters, can provide a good measure for estimating the energy requirements of the people in a population.

The calculation of BMR is done by finding an average daily metabolic rate in a community sample of 1,000 individuals, the basis for normalizing the metabolic rate. Then, using the calculated average daily metabolic rate, one is able to calculate a single daily BMR (or BMR/Kcal) for the population. The calculation of BMR is known as energy balance in China, and is usually performed as follows:

BMR = (energy balance) [body weight] - BMR

BMR = [100 kJ/kg] - BMR

where BMR is the daily metabolic rate, BMR/K is the BMR of the population that corresponds exactly to the energy needs that the Chinese currently require (ie. the population that needs to function optimally by diet, lifestyle, activity and health care), and 100 kJ/kg is equivalent to 10,000 kcal.

Note that BMR is the daily metabolic rate of the population that must use an energy-rich diet, as that food has about 100 kcal per kg (~25% of the average adult body mass) per day, which is equivalent to 1.02-1.03 MJ/day in adults. As a comparison reference, a daily intake of 1.07-1.6MJ/kg (~12% of the average adult body mass) is needed in order to have the appropriate energy expenditure (EE) in order to perform daily activities in an optimally energy efficient manner.

For example, the average daily energy intake for a Chinese population (age 18-45 years) is ~2100 kcal (~1500 kJ/day) for the year. As the figure shows, 1.02-1.03 MJ/day in this population corresponds to approximately 6800 kcal per day, corresponding to ~4.05-4.6 MJ of daily required intake for the same population. Because the daily energy cost of diet is very high, this result is valid for a large population (e.g. over half a million people, or more than 2% of the global world's population has an intake of 2-2.5 MJ per day, while 2MJ is the energy needs of all Western cultures), and is very close to the most appropriate value for a human being at their optimal physical condition. Also, the calculation of BMR/Kcal also assumes appropriate intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains throughout the day.

In order to apply a simple BMR model of Chinese adults who are over 35 years of age, one can calculate BMR/Kcal by taking the mean daily energy intake of adult individuals:

BMR = (average person's total energy intake)[(calories/day)] - BMR

The BMR can be divided into one of three components depending on age. The components of BMR that the typical Chinese have during their adult life span are summarized as follows:

BMR/cal = 4.6-7.3 + 7.3*BMR/Kcal (i.e. the BMR of the average Chinese adult over 35 years of age is 4.4-7.3 MJ/day)

BMR/kcal = 2 + 2.3*BMR/cal. (i.e. the BMR of the typical Chinese adult over 35 years of age is 2.3-5.0 MJ/day)

BMR/kg = 1.1-3.2 + 3.2*BMR/kcal.

Question: Can shape analysis differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or transient ischemic attack? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can the detection of atherosclerotic plaque in stroke or dementia with CTA improve the clinical prognosis?

Answer: It will help if the CTA is performed on a stroke patient or in a patient with a transient, ischemic brain attack. A normal CTA (which is an angiogram) performed on a healthy patient will not distinguish between atherosclerotic plaque and plaque containing free-floating clots.

If the CTA produces an abnormal finding in the arteries or brain, it will tell you whether you have a stroke or other brain problem. If there are no abnormal findings, the arteries may be healthy or may be damaged.

There is no known way to separate a stroke and a dementia.

If you have been told by your doctor that a stroke or other brain problem is in your future, seek the advice of your physician directly."

Question: Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India? Show Me The Data: A retrospective cohort study of patients with severe systemic tuberculosis and healthy controls. The controls were recruited to a clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a regimen of ceftriaxone with or without zidovudine in patients with resistant disease. The two groups were administered a combination of antibiotics for several weeks. The data were combined as part of a new study. The baseline data were not released or used for the analysis. After 1 week, 90 patients (60% of the original sample size) were enrolled, of which 28 (30% of those randomized) had already died, 8 (11%) received a high dose of ceftriaxone, and the final 10 (15%) received zidovudine. The three-week study was extended to a continuous study after patients showed no improvement. Mean disease progression was 3.7 (95% CI: 1.4, 11.8 months) and patient-reported disease severity was 3.9 (95% CI: 1.5, 12.4) compared with 1.7 (1.4, 1.9) for the controls (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.4-0.9). The trial was stopped before 90% of patients completed the study and the final trial period ended a year later compared with a median of 2.3 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.1 to 3.7) in the original cohort after a mean of 6.5 (16.8-27.5) months in the controls (HR = 1.8, 95% CI: 0.86-3.3). The authors suggested that ""the prolonged duration of treatment with ceftriaxone [with or without zidovudine] during our study may potentially improve clinical outcomes and reduce mortality in this population"" (p. 1168). The authors concluded that ""possible benefit from such therapies should not be overlooked.""

The use of antibiotics in tuberculosis patients is usually accompanied by complications. The complications can include the following:

Lethal infections

Fungal illnesses

Surgical complications and infections associated with surgical procedures

Drug interactions

Risk of antibiotic resistance

Prolonged therapy with antibiotics can cause significant morbidity and mortality (1, 2). Many patients who are critically ill with tuberculosis remain on antibiotics (1, 3).

Surgical complications associated with tuberculosis are the most common complications in large U.S. hospitals, accounting for 2-3% of all hospital-acquired infections (2). According to a 2014 report, surgical complications were responsible for 5-8% of tuberculosis deaths in the United States. According to the CDC's Surveillance Summary on Antimicrobial Resistance, a total of 730 hospital-acquired infections of strains that have increased antibiotic resistance were reported in 2014, accounting for 2-3% of tuberculosis infection deaths worldwide (1, 1).

Prolonged exposure to infection with strains resistant to antimicrobial agents poses a risk to tuberculosis patients. The potential for long-term adverse effects associated with long-term antibiotic therapy has been well documented in previous studies of hospital-acquired antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis in patients who received no long-term, high-dose therapy (6, 7).

A retrospective cohort study found that patients hospitalized for tuberculosis with an advanced stage of clinical disease who were treated with ceftriaxone or zidovudine experienced an eightfold increased mortality compared with those who received no therapy (8). This could be due, at least in part, to an increase in the risk of malignancy. To date, only one prospective randomized study has suggested a decrease in the level and progression of pneumonia and urinary tract infections associated with the use of antimicrobial therapy in patients with advanced tuberculosis, with a relative risk of 0.7 (95% CI: 0.67-0.97) when compared with those prescribed no antimicrobial therapy (9). A retrospective assessment of the clinical effectiveness of ceftriaxone (with or without zidovudine) versus zidovudine (with or without ceftriaxone) was conducted in patients who were transferred from a tertiary care center to the tuberculosis unit (10).

The most frequently reported infections in patients who receive high doses of ceftriaxone (with or without zidovudine) in clinical trials are tracheal and pulmonary tract infections, often due to exposure to organisms such as Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRS). Studies have reported increased mortality and significant morbidity, such as upper respiratory tract,"
Question: Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a predicted of different histological subtypes possible?

Introduction Many prostate cancer cells grow on the parotid gland of the prostate. These prostate adenocarcinoma (PC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and carcinoma of the prostate (COPD) cells are typically benign by histological standards and can survive long in the prostate adenocarcinoma (PC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patient until they accumulate tumors that are resistant to surgery.1–5 If the tumors do develop to the stage of ""diffuse large multifocal adenocarcinomas"", this patient can undergo prostatectomy with a very large and aggressive prostatectomy. When these tumors can withstand the large surgical incision and penetrating radiation of the prostatectomy, they can progress to distant metastases.1, 6–8 Because of high survival rates, patients undergoing a large prostatectomy can receive high-technology treatments.1 However, a majority of cancers in the prostate develop in the parotid gland, often in a localized location.1 The parotid gland is an ependymal gland that develops on the prostate and is the site of proliferation and survival of prostate cancer.11–13 Because of its location, the parotid gland is an excellent location to study prostate cancer growth in the context of the prostate, the male reproductive tract, and the endometrium.1, 14–16 This study was specifically designed to determine whether an improved prediction of the ""different histologic subtypes"" of primary parotid gland tumors could be achieved by Diffusion-weighted inversion recovery MR imaging (DART-I). The study will evaluate potential predictors for different groups of parotid gland tumors. The DART-I protocol is used for detecting prostate cancer with high precision and specificity and is the only standard MR imaging technique currently permitted by the International Conference on Functional MR Imaging Research. The DART-I has a 2D high-resolution image of the parotid gland that can reconstruct the entire parotid gland including the luminal region as well as the glans. Because prostate cancers are characterized by a wide distribution of density within a narrow region of the parotid gland, the study will evaluate how differences in the DART-I results could contribute to the predictive ability of the Diffusion-weighted inversion recovery (DART-I) imaging. In this study, a patient with normal histologic and imaging parameters is selected for the study to assess how much of the predictive power of the Diffusion-weighted inversion recovery (DART-I) technique is dependent on age and the patient's genotype. To determine whether we can predict the histologic subtypes of parotid gland tumors by the Diffusion-weighted inversion recovery (DART-I) method, all patients were recruited from the database of the Comprehensive Urology Group, Inc (http://www.cuny.ucsf.edu/). The following information was taken from the database of Comprehensive Urology Group, Inc as well as from the article ""Prostate Cancer-Specific Parameters in Aging: Age, Sex, and Pronorchoplastes"", published in December 2003 and currently the most complete and comprehensive meta-analysis of age-related PSA parameters published by the Cancer Genome System. The following PSA parameters were analyzed as subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors: 1) Urine Urinary BUN; 2) Urinary Glucose; 3) Urinary Cholesterol; 4) Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels; 5) Prostate Specific Antigen-1 (PSA-1) levels; 6) Prostate Specific Antigen-2 (PSA-2) levels; 7) Prostate Specific Antigen-3 (PSA-3) levels; 8) Hyperemia, and 9) C-reactive protein in serum. Primary and secondary parotid gland tumors were distinguished based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and by the number of tumors included. The primary parotid gland was regarded as ""prostate adenocarcinoma"" if: i) > 4 metastases were seen; iii) all metastases were of at least 5 years and from at least 50–75% contained Gleason score 0 (GLeC/GLeq) tumors, and v) at least 50% of the original tumor grade was grade 1. Secondary parotid gland tumors were regarded as ""prostate adenocarcinoma"" if: i) < 4 metastases were seen; iii) ALL metastases were of 4 years and more"
Question: Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis?

Answer: This research is ongoing with several groups investigating what happens in the brain at the end that determines how long people are able to stay on his machine [11],[12], and this is a very exciting area of research, as it has a potentially big impact on the treatment of many conditions. The potential of therapeutic approaches based on pharmacological endothelin enhancement is very exciting and we should all look forward to the results of this work over the coming year.

Question: What is the mechanism of effects of long-term endothelin inhibition? It has been proven that long-term, long-term endothelin inhibition can decrease blood clot levels in blood products [13],[14]. What are the potential consequences of long-term endothelin inhibition?

Answer: Although the mechanism has not yet been fully delineated, most have associated it with the ability to block the growth of platelets and thereby decrease the risk for thrombotic events [15]. There is, however, not sufficient evidence to date that a long-term reduction in blood clot levels in blood products (such as platelet products) actually leads to a statistically significant improvement in clinical hemodynamic and functional outcomes [4].

Question: How long do you need to go on this? What do you think is the most appropriate timing (months, years?) to start these protocols to ensure maximal long-term success? Please provide details on the current implementation of this therapy in your field. What are the current issues relating to research funding in a field requiring this kind of treatment?

Answer: The results from this study represent a small start-up program for a very exciting new and promising treatment approach which we expect to increase in popularity as we can now offer a new treatment option in both acute and chronic hemodynamic management. We believe that clinical development of this protocol as well as the implementation of this technology in many other hemodynamic conditions will be essential to advancing the therapeutic options for many patients who currently do not receive any viable treatment option. We are currently engaged in a long-term Phase 2 trial in the United Kingdom to design a large cohort study which will investigate the effect of continuous endothelin inhibitor (EI) therapy for a large cohort of patients with a range of different conditions.

About the Study

The study involved 678 patients ranging in age from 18-65 years who were undergoing endoscopically-guided or endogenously controlled hemodynamic therapy for acute and chronic conditions. Patients also underwent cardiac catheterization (coronary stent placement, angiogram evaluation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on the day of treatment to exclude those experiencing severe hypotension (a history of stroke or pulmonary embolism), hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease, and any other factors that might cause hypotension. In addition, the patients provided a baseline blood pressure assessment at the clinical site 3 days prior to trial entry as well as a cardiac stress test 1 week before and on day of hospitalization to exclude any known cardiac events, and a venous oxygen saturation measurement on hospital admission at the day of trial entry.

The clinical design of the study was as follows: After a pre-treatment baseline baseline interview, participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single (n=50) or two-hour (n=130) infusion of a single daily dose of the investigational drug endothelin (3 mg/day) or placebo (n=50). A standard course of therapy (maintenance treatment) was followed by 3 days of endothelin and 4 days of a placebo infusion. During follow-up interviews, blood pressure was estimated at baseline and over the 5 days of the treatment period. Biochemical measures of hemodynamic and functional outcomes were assessed on a daily basis during follow-up interviews and daily vital signs and hemodynamic measures while in the hospital.

Data Analysis

All data from this study were analyzed centrally using SPSS version 17.0, GraphPad Prism version 6.8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA to assess statistical significance); and as follows:

Sample size: The sample size was set at 678 patients and in consideration of the high statistical power and positive predictors of outcome that we were including in the primary analysis.

Primary findings: Hemodynamic and functional outcomes are reported in Table 1. We report the primary outcomes for each group separately.

Question: PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," PSA frequently fluctuates, but no biopsy is needed.

A: There is no scientific evidence to support the statement.

I could find a published study on the topic, though. The author of that paper, Dr. Jerald D. Johnson of the University of Houston, says that a large number of patients do experience spikes, even at low levels, after a PSA test because of a biochemical reaction called anaphase II. That reaction occurs when a chemical in the blood called EPO binds with a protein that normally carries oxygen.

But in other cases, a spike in PSA can be the result of simply a small increase in estrogen, which is released in response to a pregnancy test and can cause a small increase in PSA itself.

""It would be extremely unlikely to be caused by any single drug,"" says Johnson.

So if you do not see a spike in your PSA – it probably isn't caused by an old needle, or a recent mammogram, since estrogen levels are so low – then there are a few possibilities.

First, it could be time for an intervention to increase your estrogen, or to lower your estrogen level. Second, it could be a reaction to a particular substance that is produced during pregnancy. The third, and more troubling scenario, is that PSA simply happens to fluctuate randomly – that is, it is caused by either an unusual concentration, or by a chemical reaction that happens at high levels to some people.

If you did see a spike in PSA, Johnson says the primary treatment could take the form of estrogen.

""A dose of estrogen plus progestin, for example, could be used in conjunction with a screening test like the hysteroscopy,"" he says.

""So the more you know about the risk factors, and your chance of getting a disease, the better plan you should have with your doctor.""

You, or your physician, can work with a provider like Dr. D'Angelo at University Hospitals Medical Center in Orlando to discuss appropriate treatment. Otherwise, you'll want to consult your family physician if you or your pregnancy partner are worried about getting your PSA tested. He or she can help you make the most of the opportunity that may present itself to look for an underlying hormonal imbalance."

"Question: Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits?

Answer: Gastric electrical stimulation is the current technology of choice for the treatment of acute and chronic GERD. However, as with other treatments, as an effective treatment it can be used in a multitude of settings depending on the patient's individual characteristics, medical history, and the type of treatment being used. Since it is not known if gastric electrical stimulation is a useful long-term treatment option, it is appropriate for use as a first point of treatment for those who are already symptom free and have had gastric procedures such as gastric bypass.

There are a limited number of studies using gastric electrical stimulation that have been reviewed in earlier articles (1, 2, 3). However, few studies have examined the use of this method in the setting of GERD. Although we hope that these earlier reviews will be helpful to present the current state of the science in this area.

The purpose of this article is to provide the scientific basis for the benefits and complications of using gastric electrical stimulation. Studies comparing the use of gastric electrical stimulation with standard pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of GERD will be critically reviewed with key details of the study objectives, study design, patients with GERD studied as a control, and the study conclusions. The benefits and complications associated with gastric electrical stimulation will then be presented with additional references to the literature. The method of treatment will be discussed with specific reference to the evidence that is available.

Methods

Study designs and patients

In this study, we included studies that included patients with chronic GERD and at least one of the following: (i) GERD, (ii) gastroplasty, (iii) endoscopic intervention for symptomatic treatment of GERD or (iv) endoscopic treatment using a lumpectomy, endoscopic procedures leading to symptomatic recovery or treatment for treatment-resistant GERD. We also included studies that included at least one of the following: (i) women (women with GI symptoms) and (ii) men. The following subgroups were defined for our study: (i) inpatients with chronic gastrointestinal conditions (i.e., acute, long-term, or mixed conditions, including a history of GERD), (ii) patients undergoing a procedure for GI surgery under diagnostic conditions (i.e., gastric bypass) (2, 4, 5), (iii) patients undergoing an endoscopic procedure following surgery for gastrointestinal surgery (i.e., an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, cholecystectomy, colorectal carcinoma screening [PCS], endoscopic removal of colon or rectum, or an endoscopic esophagogastroduodenoscopy that results in recovery of both (6, 7), or (iv) patients undergoing endoscopic esophagogastroduodenoscopic surgery (i.e., EES) that results in a symptom free or symptom improved survival rate (7, 8).

All studies were reviewed independently by two or more authors (Peters and Zawislak, unpublished data). The studies were also critically reviewed by three authors from a large database of published articles. Studies were not excluded because of the size of the study, the nature of the study, or the authorship of some of the authors. A consensus was reached concerning the characteristics of data sets to be analyzed and a review was completed to obtain a detailed description of the data and how information was obtained.

Study findings

There are no studies that have evaluated the comparative effectiveness of gastric electrical stimulation with standard pharmacologic therapy and that document the effects on GI outcome. Many people have reported adverse effects from the use of gastric electrical stimulation. The number of reported adverse events is not known. However, for this article, adverse events were considered to be serious to cause harm and included gastrointestinal symptoms and death, GI complications, severe complications (dengue, gastroenteritis, intestinal blockage, haemolytic anaemia, hepatitis, septicemia, perforation, and perforation without need for resuscitation), and GI dysfunction and disease(9-14). Reported adverse events were included in each study as long as they were consistent with the definitions provided in the relevant studies. The definition of serious GI or GI complication was used to indicate serious adverse events that resulted in the need for intensive care (i.e., perforation requiring ventilation or hospitalization). A critical review of the literature was performed to assess the frequency of reported adverse events in the prior review(2) and to assess whether there have been any recent significant changes in the definition(2). These changes have included fewer non-serious adverse events, or new and significant"
Question: Should pulp chamber pulpotomy be seen as a permanent treatment? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should pulp chamber pulpotomy be seen as a permanent treatment? Answer: No. The practice of pulpotomy has become commonplace and as a result many are reluctant to do this in the future due to the risk to the patient. This is of concern because both the physical and psychological problems that could be resulting from pulpotomies are unknown although a study conducted at Yale University showed that many have had a significantly worse experience with this procedure (28).

Pulpotomy as a treatment for the prevention of scarring of the skin. As mentioned earlier, there is a group referred to as ""pulp children."" These young male patients are often very young individuals who were born with a scar in the cheek or cheekbone area. While this scar is not painful, it may be a reminder of more recent events. One theory proposed is that pulp children are being treated because of their ability to withstand pain. This makes the possibility of having such a scar difficult or impossible, if not impossible, to remove with traditional treatments. In other words, the practice of pulpotomy may have the potential to develop in such a way that it would have even a stronger potential to cause suffering to these individuals during the final stages (4).

Surgical treatments for scarring as a procedure that may require scar occlusion and scar occlusion and reduction (SCOR) (4). These treatments have seen a notable increase due to the practice of pulpotomy. It is suggested that these treatments may need to increase greatly in the future and to have a greater risk of causing scarring for these young individuals. As stated previously, this practice is thought to be causing the growth of scar tissue, which may then lead to scarring of the skin. This will have a larger impact on the patients' ability to function normally and to experience the positive side of life, which could be the main reason to engage the procedure (5).

Question: Are we seeing the effects of public awareness campaigns? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Are public awareness campaigns effective in changing public attitudes and behaviors?""

Results/Conclusions:

We found that public messages containing a narrative framing technique are more effective than other messages. The narrative framing technique was especially effective in terms of influencing public opinion on the importance of the issues facing our team. The narratives focused on the positive aspects of our team and emphasized how they had helped to reduce the number of road accidents by reducing road rage, which in Turnigy's opinion had been caused and contributed to by the high speed of our car, leading to a fatality. They also emphasized the team's dedication to road safety efforts and how they intended to continue to pursue those activities as the team continued to work for the safety of everyone on our roadways.

Conclusions:

These narratives succeeded in influencing public opinion. This is good news for the team because road safety is no longer a personal issue but an issue that can be handled by everyone in the car organization. In addition, the narratives helped reduce driver hostility toward the team. In turn, this resulted in lower fatality rates.

Appendix

Our Approach

1. We developed an original algorithm to search through our available information for evidence of impactful road safety campaigns. We then analyzed this initial data to identify the level of support from the wider public for various campaigns. Our method is based on five principles:

The goal is to identify meaningful impactful campaign outcomes. In the majority of cases, this means that the campaign has the potential to improve public opinion on an issue. It may only have a small impact on personal injury accidents, however, we want to be the first to detect and detect the possible effect of the campaign. The goal is to create a clear understanding of the level of public support for the campaign based on the outcome to date. The goal is to identify the campaigns and their levels of support.

2. To discover where the campaigns were successful and failed in terms of achieving that goal, we utilized our data set to identify the effectiveness for each campaign and developed a quantitative model to track the levels of public support relative to each campaign at multiple points in time. The model included the primary driver and secondary driver causes, the levels of attention for the campaigns, the number of ads each ad received for the primary driver cause (ROS and RST), the levels of attention for the campaigns for an alternate cause (CRASH), and the level of awareness for each campaign.

3. We then conducted follow‐up interviews to identify the drivers and secondary drivers involved in the crashes with the highest levels of attention. We included drivers (either the primary or secondary driver) who were the primary, secondary, or alternate driver in the vehicle during the crash. Our focus was on ""the primary driver"" and we used a ""high level of attention"" metric to account for the fact that many crashes involve multiple drivers. We found that the primary driver was the drivers who had the greatest level of attention to these accidents.

4. We then combined these driver metrics into a ranking system to determine the order in which the campaigns were effective at increasing the levels of attention for various causes. We found many instances where campaign success was not immediately evident due to an inability to detect the first successful campaign. As we progressed through the cycle through which we found our campaign successful, we identified one campaign that was able to increase high level of attention levels among the secondary drivers in a very small number of cases. The campaign had a very aggressive narrative framing technique for telling the story.

5. Based on these campaigns, we created a database to catalog the effectiveness of the campaigns. Using the database we created, we performed a statistical analysis of the effectiveness of the campaigns for each driver and level of attention. We created a list of top campaigns that achieved the most effective levels of attention and then ranked each campaign based on the impact on each driver and level, taking into account the primary or secondary driver, the level of attention, and the number of ads they received. The average level of attention was calculated to provide an indication of the effectiveness of each campaign given the various conditions and levels encountered during the crash. We calculated the average level of attention for each of these campaigns based on the campaign's effectiveness at achieving the highest level of attention for each of the three types of drivers (primary/secondary, alternate, and high level of attention).

6. We then identified and used a new strategy to reduce the importance of the primary driver in order to reduce the level of attention for the secondary drivers, with the objective of increasing the level of attention for the other secondary drivers. We used the same narrative framing technique with an emphasis on high level of attention.

7. Our analysis revealed that campaigns that directly stated the causes of crashes are effective. This is true at a variety of levels. For instance, in the event of RST, and for the secondary drivers"
Question: Is breast cancer prognosis inherited? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is breast cancer prognosis inherited? *

Answer: A very interesting question about the cause of breast cancer and gene therapy. Is it indeed, is it inherited, is it heritable? And what is the exact nature of that genetic predisposition? We will probably never know for sure but all signs point to it being genetic in origin. One would expect a more powerful effect on a patient who is genetically identical to the cancer donor. Unfortunately this is the nature of gene therapy. In principle the same disease should be a genetically identical patient with a different risk score. This means that if you know that there is a genetic predisposition the outcome should be predictable. However, in practice there is very much variability about the outcome of specific cases. In addition there is very often confusion about the nature of the genetic risk, for example if there is a very high chance of any outcome but the patient is very much at risk, then it is not possible to give a high probability of treatment, since we do not know what the true risk is. This may have something to do with the fact that the outcome has to be a single case and has to be evaluated on the merits of the individual case."
Question: Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy?

Answer: Nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester does not independently predict a woman's risk for developing GDM in the following months among non-Hispanic black women in the United States.

Methodological Note: We sought this population-specific risk for developing gestational diabetes (GDM) using a large database of pre- and postnatal birth records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This study is not representative of the US general population (i.e., non-Hispanic black women), although this particular population provides a unique and challenging opportunity to study the development of GDM during the first three years of life.

Results: Our study included data from 12,900 non-Hispanic black women aged 19 to 33 at the time of their first prenatal visit between 1999 and 2010. We excluded 3,770 women who had gestational diabetes (defined as the presence of gestational diabetes or preeclampsia) at the time of their first prenatal visit, making 16,800 subjects eligible. The mean (SD) total nuchal translucency thickness (TFI) at the anterior transverse process at the first trimester predicted an increasing risk of developing gestational diabetes from 6.0 (0.8) cm−2 (interquartile range [IQR]) through 32.7 (6.0) cm−2 (26.9) cm−2 (32.0) cm−2 over a seven-year period (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.20–37.15 cm). There were significant relationships observed between TFI and the presence of gestational diabetes at the time of her first visit (P < 0.05); there were also significant relationships observed between TFI, gestation week, and gestational diabetes (P < 0.01).

Conclusion: Results from the current study provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester, gestational diabetes and gestation week.

Question: Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype?

Answer: Yes.


Keywords: An experimental investigation of the relationship between the anaphase region of the neuropeptide neuropeptide 1 (NP_1) gene, the dopamine D1 receptor subunit β-endorphin receptor (D3R) gene, and the anaphase region of the microsatellite region of the vasopressin 1 gene, the arginine vasopressin (ARG) V1a receptor (V1) gene and the microsatellite region of the vasopressin 1 gene (V1a) gene in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar history that has been linked with sexual preference development. Journal of clinical imaging and genetics, 10(12), 1746-1754.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence to suggest that polymorphisms in the NP_1 gene and the D3R gene may contribute to the pathophysiology of borderline personality disorders in men. A preliminary investigation has found the D3R gene to be associated with hypersexuality in a sample of adult human males. To further investigate the link between the D3R gene and hypersexuality, the D3R gene transcript variant, ARG V1a gene type, and the microsatellite region of the vasopressin 1 gene showed that the D3R gene is associated with a hypersexual personality phenotype. ARG V1a gene type is the most strongly associated gene with hypersexuality in the human population and has been related to male impulsivity, homosexuality, depression, and gambling. ARG V1a gene type has also been implicated in the etiology of gender identity disorders. ARG V1a gene group and ARG V1a gene type have been implicated in the etiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Thus, the findings reported here suggest that the polymorphisms responsible for the hypersexuality phenotype may represent a novel risk factor for borderline personality disorder. More research is needed on the etiology of hypersexuality after a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this polymorphism.


Keywords: Arginine vasopressin gene V1a gene, dopamine D1 receptor gene, vasopressin gene, microsatellite region of V1, P450 enzyme, genetic variant, Arginine vasopressin gene polymorphism

Answer: Yes


Keywords: Early, prepubertal, and early adolescence

Answer: Yes


Keywords: Bipolar disorder (BD), prepubertal and early adolescence, pre-menstrual dysphoria

Answer: Yes


Answer: Yes, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the ARG gene's V1a gene type may lead to changes in body image and sexual preference to an attraction to younger, more feminine bodies.


Answer: Yes, the results of this study suggest that ARG V1a gene expression is in step with that of males that are hypersexual and appear to be sexually aroused during exposure to females' pubic hair, whereas ARG V1b gene expression seems to be in step of those that are hypersexual and are not sexually aroused (suggesting to most women that these two lines of evidence are consistent).

Question: Is arch form influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Please explain why your answer is different from what is indicated in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Answer: SAGITTAL MOLA

The sagittal molar is formed at the back, behind the teeth which were in a rosy, soft appearance while the crown was less rosy, although it did not appear more sunken than it does in a classic mid-sagittal view. In older subjects, for example, where the crown is rosy and the tooth is more sunken, this pattern can be observed. In other examples, where the crown becomes more sunken, this pattern can also be observed. The sagittal molar forms with each tooth about 1/10 the distance to the crown. It forms on the teeth in front and to the sides of the tooth in front of it. Thus:

The first tooth is in the anterior (front) axis and the tooth immediately behind it is in the posterior (sagittal) axis.

The sagittal molar (the front tooth) is formed in the anterior half of the mouth about 0.3 mm from the posterior edge of the molar that forms the tooth in the front.

The sagittal molar (the behind tooth) is formed in the posterior half of the mouth about 0.3 mm from the anterior edge of the molar that forms the tooth in the back.

The sagittal molar forms at the back of the mouth about 0.5 mm from the posterior edge of the molar on each side for a total width of 0.5 mm at the back of the mouth.

The sagittal molar forms to the sides, to the front and to the back, about 1/10 as wide as the widest of the two teeth.

The sagittal molar is formed with each tooth about 1/10 the distance to the crown, or 2/10 the distance to the opposite teeth.

As with the interdental molar, the sagittal molar is considered a ""nontraditional"" molar because it is formed independently of other teeth.

Although it was once believed that the sagittal molar formed with the crown at the back, this is not to explain how it can form independently of the other dental molars. The sagittal molar forms just behind the molars with the crown and not at the back. As you can imagine, you will also have to answer what happens to the molars when the sagittal molar (the front tooth) forms alone. The sagittal molar is formed through the process of metamorphosis. The molars in the front and behind have already undergone this process of formation.

The molar form on an old tooth showing the teeth above it: This is the front tooth, the second (bottom-most) tooth in the above photograph is the in front tooth, the root above that is on the next tooth in the above photograph is the crown. Figure 2. The molar form on a fresh tooth showing the teeth above it: In this picture the first (bottom-most) tooth is the front tooth, the second (bottom-most) tooth is in front a new tooth at the side is the crown, the next (bottom-most) tooth is the behind tooth, the root is beside the bottom tooth on the next tooth in the following photograph is the same as the root in the illustration above. Figure 3. The molar form on a fresh tooth showing the teeth above it: This is an example of cross-molarity. In this example the front tooth (the crown) is at the bottom and the behind tooth (the root) is at the top along the right lateral line. You will have to explain how cross-molarity can occur. These are the results of the above steps: 1. The molar forms at its apex on the tooth with the crown in front and on the opposite side of the behind tooth on the next tooth in the following photo. 2. In addition to the molar forming directly under the crown, the molar can also become displaced by the tooth below. When they form the same position and size, the front and behind teeth are now closer together on the top side of the molar. 3. The molar forms at the apex of"

Q. How do I know if a knife did conize or not?

A. All one need to do is cut the wrist (if done correctly) and open the case to the neck, and the knife will appear to be stuck because the blood has not seeped into.

Q. I opened a knife at home?

A. This is different thing, where is the bleeding, or not?

Q. I don't know how to open cases? How about in a lab?

A. I have heard this is the only safe way. (See the related Question on LEEP)

Q. I just saw an article on LEEP? How did that article explain my experience?

A. The article was published online. I did not buy the articles, I just read online what was provided. If you're still using a cold knife and the knife had ""conized"" or not, you can try this:

Place the knife under the skin of the index and middle forefinger and open the case with one of your thumb and forefinger.

This will make sure that there are no red or bleeding points.

Next, if you used a ""cold knife"" and it did not appear dead, then you could try that method again.

I suggest that you take the time to read the article. I cannot emphasize this enough. When I wrote questions for my science paper, i wanted to find something out that would help the reader with their own experience. Reading about these methods is very helpful, as it makes it clear that it is not a guaranteed method, as the method could be incorrect. I was a little disappointed that they did not provide clear descriptions about the different methods that were shown. Hopefully, this article will help to further educate in the realm of ""how to open a knife properly?""

Question: Updating emotional content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How do we update our emotional content in working memory? Do we need to focus on that part of the brain, or should we be focused on other areas?

Baker B, Brown R, Belsky V.

INTRODUCTION: Working memory (WM) is commonly referred to as the mental inventory. It is a set of long-term storage structures located in regions involved in processing and storing information and in attention/control. Working memory functions help the brain store and access information from a variety of sources and is thought to play a role in several domains, such as information processing, planning, memory, and memory retrieval, including delayed recall (DDR) for items and verbal recall for words. In clinical settings, working memory can be utilized to aid in completing a complex task. For the purposes of working memory research in depression and PTSD, working memory is often considered to be the core of these disorders. However, the question of how working memory is associated with depression and PTSD and what role it plays in these disorders has not been addressed. To address this issue and to determine if there is an established role for working memory in PTSD, we will be exploring the role of WM in working memory.

METHODS:

The study aims to assess the effects of working memory training on PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression, and symptom profile on working memory in PTSD. Using a randomized and double-blind design, subjects will engage in either a 12-week training course or the training portion of either a 4-week cognitive behavioral therapy or a treatment-as-usual trial. Prior studies of working memory-related effects of working memory training have shown that working memory training could significantly reduce activation in the ventral striatum, a brain region associated with depression (Wagner-Nolle CS). However, to determine if there is an association with depression and PTSD, we will assess WM while using a task in which participants must search for and match words in a short-term memory test (Friston & Pinto-D'Alberto D).

RESULTS:

We found evidence from training studies that the working memory-related effect of working memory training in patients with PTSD is not moderated by individual differences in baseline working memory load. The training-related effects of task complexity did not seem to be influenced by individuals' baseline working memory load. These working memory effects were found to be most pronounced in subjects with low baseline working memory load. There was also a dose-dependent relationship between baseline working memory load and the training-related effects of task complexity.

LIMITATIONS:

The limited number of participants is a limitation of this research. Therefore, the study cannot address the efficacy of working memory training on general symptoms of depression or PTSD. Furthermore, this study does not address the effect of working memory training on a more specific type of PTSD, one that involves working memory impairment. This effect could be due to an inability of the participants to effectively engage in working memory training due to fatigue, sleep deprivation, or other limitations, which are common during work shifts. These training-related effects in individuals who have trouble engaging in working memory training could make it difficult to adequately capture the effects of working memory training on symptoms of depression and PTSD when using a work-stressed or work-restructured condition during the study.

CONCLUSION:

For several reasons, working memory is considered as a core structure in the brain. It is thought to be critical for maintaining cognitive functioning during normal daily life (Brown et al, 2001). Although there are few studies looking at the effects of working memory training on symptoms of depression and PTSD in this population, the lack of any studies examining working memory-related tasks may lead to biased interpretations of findings."
Question: Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein cannulation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein cannulation? Please add your answer to this question.

Answer:

Your question asks whether or not intramuscular needle thoracoscopy is used in addition to surgical intrathecal puncturing of the jugular vein. Answering the question in this way requires careful consideration of the details of the procedure as well as the nature and type of the puncturing procedure.

A. Using Intramuscular Incisions as Replacement for Intramuscular Parenteral Incisions

The immediate results of the bypassing and suturing of the intrathecal jugular vein to the femoral artery are similar, including:

The jugular vein is not at the level of the blood vessel supplying the leg;

The blood supply from the abdominal aorta to the femoral artery from the femoral neck is a small blood supply (under 10 ml/kg);

The intraarterial volume has been replaced with more volume from the femoral neck and a longer intramuscular venous flow velocity will be achieved; and

A lower intraarterial pressure in the femoral neck may aid venous return from the ventricle to the femoral artery.

B. Using Intramuscular Incisions as Replacement for Intramuscular Parenteral Incisions

In the routine intramuscular puncture, no additional venous system is required. A few minutes after the intrathecal puncture is performed to remove any foreign bodies or other obstructions from the vein, the arterial blood flow is sufficient for blood to return from the femoral artery to the femoral artery. In the routine, intramuscular puncture does not use the intrathecal puncturing apparatus. Intraarticular vein cannulation is most often performed manually with a long thin needle, or externally by a tourniquet placed directly over the femoral artery (with appropriate technique).

The venous return from the knee may be assisted by one or more venous catheters (in one or both thigh venous catheter systems) placed to provide an external supply for reoxygenation. The venous return from the knee may not be aided by direct venous catheter placement in the femoral vein without using one of the arterial catheter systems, and is therefore not a replacement for intraarterial vein cannulation.

In conclusion, intramuscular puncturing of the femoral neck is a new procedure and the use of intramuscular techniques in addition to the use of intramuscular techniques is new technology or may need to be modified or replaced in older techniques. Intraarterial vein cannulation is a common procedure in the community but may not be necessary by surgeons with extensive familiarity with the anatomy of the femoral neck.

Question: Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? Answer: No. Because a prostate specific antigen that is higher than normal in older men may not be predictive of prostate cancer in younger men. However, a higher-than-normal prostate specific antigen may actually be protective against prostate cancer. In fact, a number of studies have suggested that a prostate specific antigen should be ""adjusted"" for body mass index. The rationale for this approach is that higher-than-normal prostate specific titers in older men are not likely to be a true proxy for prostate cancer risk in young men. Some studies also suggest that serum prostate specific antigen levels in young men may not be a reliable indicator of serum levels in older men, because serum serones of young men are also influenced by other factors that have not yet been fully elucidated. Nevertheless, a recommendation for adjusting prostate-specific antigen for body mass index is an appropriate way to reduce false-positive results in elderly patients who may have a prostate cancer biopsy showing only low-seropositive cells.

Question: Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness?

Objective: To answer this question, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of obstructive sleep apnea on aerobic fitness and VO2 max in healthy women.

Design: A systematic review and cross‐tabulations of studies that assessed the effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on aerobic fitness and VO2 max were performed. Studies examining the effect of OSA on aerobic fitness from the relevant literature were included in the review.

Setting: Eight systematic reviews and four meta‐analyses were identified. Studies were identified either from search and the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy of Asthma and Allergies (MCD) index, PubMed (a general text search), English language search, or directly from the study authors on an expert knowledge assessment. One investigator independently searched for relevant studies.

Participants: Sixteen studies (n = 45) involved 535 adults with obstructive sleep apnea for a total of 49 828 persons with asthma, and 849 healthy control subjects.

Measures: Aerobic fitness and VO2 Max were assessed by a physical activity questionnaire and aerobic fitness and VO2 Max were estimated by dual energy x‐ray absorptiometry.

Results: Results for each aerobic fitness and VO2 max factor were mixed. The correlation between VO2 Max and aerobic fitness was 0.82. OSA was not associated with an increase in fitness and VO2 Max. In the same group of studies, there was little to no relation between OSA and aerobic fitness or VO2 Max. Further, OSA was correlated significantly with lower values of aerobic fitness. A moderate increase in aerobic fitness or VO2 max with OSA was associated with improved survival at 7 years in all of the studies included. This relation persisted when adjusting for age, smoking, high baseline respiratory sinus disease, heart attack, and diabetes.

Conclusion: OSA is not associated with lower fitness or VO2 Max in healthy women."
Question: The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," If metformin treatment decreased plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe, as suggested above by the study by Schuwer et al., what happened to the plasma concentrations after the treatment had stopped? If the effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of melatonin on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe was present, it would not be surprising if the effect disappeared when the treatment was stopped. In that case, melatonin would remain a circulating factor of the circadian system and would not be thought to be the independent melatonin metabolite. A study by Volek et al. (14) found no melatonin accumulation at 2 h after the treatment had stopped, even after the treatment had been stopped for 48 h, so this hypothesis looks unlikely. Studies do not seem to support the idea that a low-dose melanic acid-treated ewe would have normal plasma melatonin concentrations because only one study, on a goat, had a low dose and melatonin concentration of 6 mg/kg (16) or 10–13,000 pg/mL, respectively. Studies on rabbits, on both the ewe and rat, have shown that melatonin metabolites are readily absorbed via intestinal enterocytes. One study (2,21) showed that the levels of plasma melatonin and their metabolites increased in the rabbit after i.v. infusion with an AMP-activated protein kinase activator rather than melatonin itself. When the levels of melatonin and their metabolites were measured in rat brain tissue 5 and 8 h after the treatment, melatonin was present in higher levels than in the rat plasma immediately after the treatment.

Question: Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is there evidence of an important gendered difference in the response of the genitalia and associated structures after injury, in particular hemorrhagic shock?

Answer: For both hemorrhagic shock and male-to-female transgender, a larger and denser female brain is found after injury than male brain [42]. The female brain is more complex with bigger and dense neurons than male brain [38,40]. Because of the smaller size of female brain after injury, the female brain is not homogeneous and different parts tend to form two or more brains [36-38]. The more complex of the two brains shows male-typical structure and gender dimorphism for both male and female [37,38]. Furthermore, it is known that transsexual individuals are less masculinized, with less brain area differences between these boys and girls, indicating the involvement of female hormones rather than male hormones in the male-to-female transsexuality [36]. Therefore, it follows that it is not the anatomical gender of the individual that correlates with brain gender and sex hormone levels, but rather the gender dimorphism after injury.


Q. How much do brain and heart size differences determine an individual's sex? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How much does volume difference in humans between the sexes affect an individual's sex?


Answer: Volumetric size is defined as the size of a brain minus thickness of its neurons. Volumetry in terms of neuron vs. brain size is not a direct measure of sex. Volumetric size measures the size of a brain in relation to a given mass - in other words, how big or how small a brain is compared to a given mass. In this regard, it is called volume as opposed to volume measurement, thus the two are not directly equivalent. Volumetry depends on the use of volume measurement methods [38]. For example, if a volume is measured in a particular unit of volume for a given brain, the same mass can have the same volume as the brain's diameter in terms of volume measurement. However, the thickness of the brain depends on volume measurement methods, thus the exact volume measurements have important differential effects on sex development [38,39,40]. Volumetric size measures the size of the brain in relation to a given mass of tissue in the form of volume measurement units/micro-channels of length/ width/ height. Because of this, volume measurement methods are based on volumes rather than volume measure units, whereas volumes are measured in units/diameters or micro-channels of length and width/ height. Volumetrics can be defined as measures of the length of the neuron in a tissue and of the volume of the tissue in comparison to other tissues. Volume measure units/ micro channel length/ width/ height are used to measure the thickness of a neuron and the volume of the tissue in comparison to other tissues. According to this definition, the sex differences in the number and location of neurons in the brain and heart can be determined in general by the volume measurement methods. The volume determines the size of the individual's brain, which could be defined independently as the size of the individual's brain minus the volume measurement units/micro channels of length/ width/ height. Therefore, volumetric size determines the size of the individual's brain. In this regard, many volumetric measurement methods including volumetric MRI and SPECT use volume measurement approaches in order to estimate the size of individual's brain. However, the exact size measurement depends on the use of volume measurement methods. For instance, the number of neurons in the brain in the human brain are measured in volume measurement units/microchannel length/ width/ height. Hence, the exact size measurement determined by volume measurement approaches depends on the use of volume measurement methods.


Q. Does the size of the brain play a role in determining sex determination with a small penis and small penis injury? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Does the size of the brain play a role in determining sex determination with small penis and small penis injury?


Answer: There have been an increasing number of studies on determining the sex of an individual with a specific congenital malformation of the penis [39,41-44,46,47]. The results of such studies have provided support to the idea that there are more males in the penis with small penis [49,33,45,48] in the general female population than among the penis itself. The fact that there is a small penis after injury provides support for the hypothesis that the malformation could play an important position in determining the sex of a baby. The evidence from sex determination studies points to a male brain as the likely organ of the penis with small penis, whereas the female brain has a male brain. The brain size of a male fetus does not correlate to the sex ["

Question: Delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer: does it impact survival? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer: does it impact survival?

Answer: There are no definite guidelines for the timing of treatment in breast cancer survivors, and although there is evidence that late treatment can improve survival as well as reducing the likelihood of recurrence (particularly in patients with a recurrence-free primary tumor), all clinical trials on the subject have shown no clear benefit (Buchner et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2006; Pflueger et al., 2006). In general, patients who are diagnosed early (in the initial 5 years) do better than those who are diagnosed late (at the time of surgery). Early treatment, whether it is late or early, will improve patients' clinical prognosis.

Question: What are the best strategies to reduce the risk of progression and breast cancer recurrence and the effect of chemotherapy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the best strategies to reduce the risk of progression and breast cancer recurrence and the effect of chemotherapy?

Answer: It's unlikely that a change in prognosis will necessarily be achieved without large numbers of patients undergoing treatment (for example, with radiotherapy). Thus, the most important strategies to minimize the risk of progression-associated complications (e.g., relapse, graft versus host disease, lymph node rejection or metastasis) are those that prevent, delay or shorten the initiation of treatment in an effort to maximize the benefit, and those that mitigate the risk of worsening outcomes.

Question: Can surgery avoid or be modified an increased risk for early-stage breast cancer recurrence and subsequent chemotherapy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Can surgery avoid or be modified an increased risk for early-stage breast cancer recurrence and subsequent chemotherapy?

Answer: As of 2013, there are no definitive guidelines for the surgical avoidance of early-stage breast cancer recurrence. The evidence is conflicting and the evidence from randomized double-blind controlled trials is limited. A variety of options, including surgery, can offer substantial protection to patients at high risk for recurrence. While we don't yet have the full story of the incidence and outcome of recurrence with the three different types of breast cancers, it's likely that all are in the same ballpark (Kreisel et al., 2012). As with most forms of metastasis, early breast cancer is a survival problem, but the prevention of recurrence will lead to improved breast cancer care and quality of life.

Question: How frequently, in breast cancer diagnosis, are patients referred to other specialists for more detailed screening options which may include breast biopsies and other breast cancer tests? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How frequently, in breast cancer diagnosis, are patients referred to other specialists for more detailed screening options which may include breast biopsies and other breast cancer tests?

Answer: The proportion of patients referred to a mammographer for mammography is high. The proportion of patients referred to specialists for more detailed screening includes breast biopsies and mammography results. For this reason, there is no reason to assume, or even assume, that mammography prevents recurrence of breast cancer.

Question: What are the long-term effects of early detection, for example, with respect to treatment and prognosis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the long-term effects of early detection, for example, with respect to treatment and prognosis?

Answer: The risk of treatment failure and the burden of disease progression are high risk factors for recurrent breast cancer. Early detection helps to keep patients from having to undergo chemotherapy and may eventually result in a substantial reduction in the overall risk of breast cancer recurrence."
Question: Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males?

Answer: As has been mentioned previously (1), this question is very difficult. Some recent studies suggest that there may be a slight increase in carotid pulse frequency during fasting that has been linked to increased vascular resistance, or at least increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. The data that have been published during the past 8 years do not provide strong evidence for these associations. However, additional research is warranted to determine whether certain cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., blood pressure/hypertension, cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, and C-reactive protein) and the presence of hyper- or hypocalcemia (high plasma glucose and low, or high, C-reactive protein) increase the risk of arterial dysfunction during fasting. It is also interesting to note that elevated pulsatility scores were more predictive of coronary artery disease and mortality in this study, and not all lower arterial pulse rates had this level of pulsatility. Another interesting aspect of this study is the significant change in age between men and women. Although the age differences between subjects were significant, the age difference between the male and female subjects is even more significant: 30 yr old subjects had significantly greater pulsatility scores than 25 yr old subjects.

Although previous reports have suggested that there may be an association between diabetes and pulse rate (2) and there may be differences in pulsatility across individuals (3), the degree of change in the pulsatility score and pulsatility score scores between men and women among this group of young male and female subjects is significant. In fact, an analysis by Todorov of a retrospective study of 15,455 subjects using the pulsatility score yielded an odds ratio of 1.2 (odds ratio 1.20) for coronary artery disease for each increase of 1 unit pulse rate. This represents an increase of 24 beats/min for each unit of pulse rate. This study does not include those subjects who reported a nonfatal stroke, ischemic heart disease, or other acute cardiac events. Given the relatively small sample size of the cohort studied, the study cannot say whether these differences are significant. Also, the study was performed retrospectively, and the subjects might have reported a more severe event and/or stroke history that was not captured in the assessment of pulse rates.

In summary, the findings concerning the pulse rate (3), blood pressure (4), resistance index (5), and level of insulin resistance (3) in young men and women are not consistent, and further research needs to be performed.

B. Respiratory Symptoms

1. Are there clinical signs of asthma and wheezy cough among children with obesity? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Are there clinical signs of asthma and wheezy cough among children with obesity?

A. Yes. Patients in this study were primarily children <3 yr of age, which is a very important category because it has been shown to have a greater prevalence of asthma and wheeze than older children (<2 yr of age). Patients younger than 3 yr, or patients in the second half of their second trimester, may be at increased risk for wheeze episodes or asthma compared to younger children. Also, this age group is at an increased risk for having an adverse preterm birth.

B. Some patients also reported wheezing, coughing, and/or sneezing at rest, either at home or immediately after physical therapy (6). There were significant age relationships; older children had lower wheezy cough and wheezing scores than younger children, particularly at the lower end of age. Some younger patients complained of shortness of breath.

2. Are there clinical signs of asthma in overweight children? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Are there clinical signs of asthma in overweight children?

A. The number of clinical events identified in this study was small. Only one study reported the data in this way. The objective criteria for the clinical course of asthma in this study were not reported. There also were no data on wheezing. These data were gathered retrospectively.

3. Are respiratory symptoms and heart rates predictive of asthma in children? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Are respiratory symptoms and heart rates predictive of asthma in children?

A. A prospective observational study of 100 children (3) has demonstrated that the severity of wheezy cough in these children was significantly predictive of a first episode of asthma, even at a relatively low threshold (0.01%) (7). These children were followed for three to six years, and they had a much higher rate of asthma in childhood as young as 4 y, than if they had never had an asthma"

Research methodological research in a field that consists of analyzing data, such as a survey, in the form of data, from a particular point in the process of gathering the data. There are several other research methods that are used frequently today to study data: data analysis. The study of a dataset by applying methods such as statistical analysis, computer programming, or qualitative analysis. The study of data by applying methods such as statistical analysis, computer programming, or qualitative analysis. Methodology is the study of the method of collecting data during a study. The measurement of a quantitative or qualitative outcome that needs to be assessed to determine its magnitude. The study of measurement involves recording measurements and measuring a quantitative or qualitative quality. The assessment of quality of data. Assessment of the qualitative quality of data includes determining how the quality is measured, for example, by measuring the perceived quality of an outcome, by examining the perceived differences between two outcomes and their characteristics, or by assessing how the quality is perceived by a particular respondent or an entire group or generation of respondents. Evaluation of the qualitative quality of a data set. The assessment of the quality of data by examining differences and similarities among different sets and comparing results across different sets. In a study of a data set, the evaluation of the quality of the data is a component of the research methodology and is considered a crucial part of the scientific methodology. The evaluation of the quantitative quality of data includes determining if the resulting quantitative results are within a given range of values, and when the differences are substantial. The evaluation of qualitative quality of a data set includes defining the qualitative content of the data, for example, by defining different levels of confidence that a particular result can be explained by a difference between two sets of values. The evaluation of differences amongst different levels of uncertainty is the evaluation of the qualitative content of a data set, the identification of the qualitative content that is associated with various degree of uncertainty, such as size, number of observations and level of level of significance.

Question: Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles on scientific journals?

Your answer should be ""no"".

The reason is that a scientific publication receives much less publicity for the findings contained within; the ""impact factor"" has almost no relation to publication quality! Most authors of scientific papers simply publish for publication, and don't put much effort into ensuring peer review, refereeing and other important aspects.

Open access publishing doesn't do any good for academic scientists

Academic scientists don't care about what journals publish, they care about getting their articles published, which means that journal editors are the only one in charge – not the author or journal itself. When one gets a rejection letter, that rejection letter is the last piece of feedback about the quality of a publication. Only when the manuscript gets accepted do academics get to assess the quality.

Even if a scientific journal accepts a publication, there's no indication as to whether the journal will publish the article, rather it's a purely chance occurrence, as many journal editors choose to reject all publication.

Open access journals aren't just a good business choice, they're a key driver for academic scientists because it's in the public interest! Many academic journals are published in closed access journals such as Elsevier's Cell Press. However, these journals are not open access, meaning that the journal owner is essentially allowing the journal article to be published for free through their service. As soon as a scientific article becomes available on EBSCO's open access journal, and other publishers like The Open Access Journals have a financial interest in it, all journal articles are being published under one paywalled, closed access, monopoly.

There's now an incredible push on science to publish in peer-reviewed open access journals with a focus on scientific integrity and transparency. But unfortunately, academic science has been slow to move to this new format, because we don't want to be the journal that'sinks' the future of the scientific publishing world.

Please sign this petition urging your academic colleagues and peers to call for their institutions to publish their articles in open access journals such as EBSCO journals.

What to do if your university doesn't publish in EBSCO journals

For universities that are interested in making some substantial investment into becoming an open access publisher, there are two simple options you can choose, both of which involve less money than your university's budget.

Open access publishing is already popular in countries where it's relatively cheaper to make a publishable piece of work available to the public, including Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. As a result, most academics have chosen to publish in open access journals without making a real investment, but there is still some debate in academia as to whether open access has the necessary impact on the scientific publishing world to justify continued funding support from universities.

Alternatively, academia could choose to start by investing in a large research database to gather relevant datasets in different parts of the country, something that a university that is committed to free access publishing need not do. However, to fully understand this decision, it would be wise to consult your university's academic research council or vice president in your country.

We'd like to know what universities are doing with the money they've invested into open access journals. We have compiled a list of these contributions:

Bishop's Research Foundation. Invested in the creation of an online database of biomedical research datasets across Canada and the US.

Duke University. Involuntarily published the work of its researchers, published its own work, supported the creation of an open access database of open-access research in several journals.

Nova Scotia Science and Technology Institute. Publishing a large number of articles from some of the world's most respected social sciences journals, including the Journal of Social Ecology and Ecology Letters.

University of Queensland. Creating open access content is one of its main priorities, with the university's journal of environmental medicine being one of the first to publish it.

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Publishes articles in Nature, Nature Climate Change, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Science, Nature Communications and Science.

University of California, Berkley. Publishing open access articles in Nature, Science, Biochemistry Journal, PLOS Research, Environmental Science and Technology, Cell, Nature.

University of Adelaide. Published a large number of work in open access journals: BioMed Central, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Nature journals.

Vanderbilt University and Vanderbilt University. Publishes papers in BioMed Central, BMC Biology Journals, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, Journals of Biological Chemistry and Journal of Neuroscience.

Question: In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role? Abstract:

A:

Patients usually require an intrawear of gastric mucosa to be a good criterion of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, the most common endocrine defect. Although it is suggested there might be an etiological role, the mechanisms remain speculative. In infants with the most severe form of hypertrophy, the gastrocnemius often lacks both muscle strength and intrawear and the intraepithelial connective tissue is usually absent, which might lead to inferior gastrectomy and/or the need for surgical repair. We present a case of peritoneal mesenteric hypertension in our clinic, a syndrome that is difficult to delineate. Its etiology seems to be unknown."

Abstract:

Nasal bone fractures occur in China with a wide range of age groups, sex, and geographical area. Of the 57.2 million annual outpatient visits in China, 22.2% are for fractures of the nasal bone. In order to help prevent and treat such fractures, it is important to ensure efficient treatment and care. In some studies, there are two major methods for reducing the severity of nasal bone fractures. One method is long-term closed reduction with endoscopic technique, the other is open reduction without a direct visualized path. There are differences in the effect of closed reduction as well as open reduction, based on the anatomical location of the nasal bone. In this paper, I compared the effect of long-term closed reduction and normal endoscopic reduction of the nasal bone. For both approaches, the time needed by patients for radiotherapy and for maintenance of nasal bone were similar. The effect of closed reduction was also evaluated. In conclusion, my suggestion can be to consider long-term closed reduction, including surgical techniques, as additional treatment in some of the cases. For open reduction, further study comparing long-term closure and normal endoscopic closure should be conducted more carefully."
"Question: Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival? The answer is yes, especially if we are focusing on children with severe prematurity or infants with a critical birth defect.

Preterm Prematurity: What Can We Learn?

A preterm baby can come into a hospital weighing only one or two pounds. Many of these infants will go on to live for many years. But these babies often die later because of delays in treatment, and premature babies may require dialysis or other complex medical care. Despite their age, preterm babies represent the greatest medical emergency because of their severity, severity of the injury, and their potential to cause significant health impact if left untreated. For these reasons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun a public awareness campaign to educate the public about the benefits of preterm infant neonatal care. The campaign seeks to create a greater awareness of the health risks that preterm infants present, how to reduce the risks of morbidity/mortality, what health benefits are possible, and how to reach out to expectant parents. The campaign also provides information on the availability of services that help preterm babies improve their health. The agency has also created a preterm birth resources page to help parents and community representatives become part of the solution.

Preterm Birth: What Can We Learn? provides the following information:

A list of resources regarding the risk of preterm birth.

An online resource to assist mothers with preterm delivery and give them access to the materials and resources that are available.

A list of health plans, including hospitals, that offer pregnancy testing and other prenatal services.

A list of local organizations and social workers to contact if you have any other questions.

An overview on the health of preterm and premature babies.

A list of resources on infant care.

An overview on the health of preterm and premature infants.

Preterm Hospitalization: What Can We Learn?

Many people believe that preterm infants are ""just waiting to die"" – but that is not true. In fact, the National Institute of Health estimates that approximately 5-8 percent of all births will be preterm (4). The NICHD estimates that these children have a survival rate of approximately 75 percent. While this is an excellent prognosis, preterm infants with serious genetic defects can experience a higher mortality rate. Therefore, these children receive special attention from medical personnel and families to help prevent and treat complications of preterm birth.

To help families understand what to expect, this short video provides parents, guardians, and providers with valuable information and an understanding of what to expect during an infant's initial visit:

Preterm Mortality: What Can We Learn?

Preterm mortality is determined by the time of birth, duration of respiratory distress, and outcome of all the factors considered. Early intervention measures such as antibiotics and supplemental oxygen, as well as emergency room care are important in preventing and treating premature death. When a preimplantation pregnancy is identified, an autopsy should be performed to determine cause of death. Many states use preemergence screening systems (such as the United States Medical Examiners Council Prepacket Pregnancy Screening Instrument) to determine if a pregnancy is preterm. The United States Department of Labor recommends that all pregnant women undergo routine screening (usually at 15 weeks of gestation) in order to screen for preterm delivery and to detect those who experience severe respiratory distress and other complications of preterm labor.

There is also some evidence that delaying delivery significantly increases the risk for preterm death. However, delays in preterm delivery may not have an immediate impact because some preterm births are delayed long after the fetal heartbeat is heard. Additionally, there is some preliminary evidence showing a relationship between preterm birth and the risk of developing asthma. Therefore, there is a need to further investigate how the underlying developmental or respiratory dysfunction or a combination of both causes these premature deaths.

Preterm Babies & Chronic Illness: What Can We Learn?

While preterm birth can be a life-threatening condition, the American Academy of Pediatrics provides guidelines for the management of preterm infants with health conditions. The guidelines recognize that these children cannot survive on their own with a health condition, and so care should be obtained.

An individual's health status, whether it is being measured (for example, a child's weight, height, blood glucose level, or thyroid function) or predicted (like a child's IQ test or IQ score), may influence the child's care and treatment. However, health status should be closely monitored and care should be provided so any changes in the child's health status will be well known and will be in line with medical practice.

Question: Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is the spontaneous remission of polyarteritis nodosa a true remission?

Answer: Yes, in many rare cases spontaneously remission occurs. This may include as many as two-thirds of the time. It can also occur in some patients in which there is no other cause for the symptoms. It can happen from time to time and requires many days of treatment with a strong anti-inflammatory. To avoid problems caused by the anti-inflammatory drugs which may cause further damage, one must be extra cautious for long periods. The best way to achieve an effective treatment in most cases is to follow the rules of preventive medicine.

How can I maintain remission?

Since the original outbreak in the late 1990s, there has been a clear increase in the incidence of polyarteritis nodosa. It has become easier than ever before, with excellent quality medical research, to find a diagnosis, diagnose the cause, then follow all the stages of the disease in its progression, and finally to identify and treat the best treatment available to achieve remission. But it is up to us to know which of these three steps are our best options.

In each case, the treatment options are not dependent on the condition but may vary over time. It is now possible to treat it with early immunosuppression in many cases and to detect the disease early. It is also possible to introduce a drug into the blood stream which can help to cause remission. However, it is not easy as the patient often shows no response and then is treated with drugs or immunosuppressive drugs that never worked and may not at all. In many cases, other treatments that have been tried may have the effect of only increasing or creating an adverse effect.

In the last five years, I have tried various pharmacological and immunomodulatory drugs. Several have worked for mild to moderate cases but most failed for others.

It is important not to overreact, as with some anti-rejection drugs which may make the disease difficult to control in many cases and others that cause more complications and have serious side effects. It is a patient decision as to if and when he/she decides to try alternative treatments. The decisions we make with our families, with our doctors and in the process of making the decision to try a new treatment can have a great impact on achieving remission in those whose disease does not respond well to current treatment.

The key question is: do we choose the ""best"" treatment or, do we decide to follow the rules of preventive medicine? This brings me to my main point: what can parents and physicians do to provide their children with the best chance of developing remission in polyarteritis nodosa? My guess is that we all will need more resources and research to find a strategy in order to be most effective in controlling recurrence in a patient.

Why are there so few articles about polyarteritis nodosa remission?

The lack of a reliable remission rate is a serious problem and a cause of concern to families of children with the disease. Many researchers are working hard towards finding a cure. It certainly is the case that some patients do show response to several different treatments, and with more research and effort it may help to find a better strategy. However, the problem remains that we have seen few reliable studies over many years. A study published in 2002 found remission rates of up to 80% in some cases but still found no definite cure and no significant benefit in the remission rate of some patients. We have seen many new drugs being evaluated and tested as they are developed to treat the disease; some of them have no answer.

If there is a cure, will we still use immunosuppressive drugs, will we still use drugs with known toxicities when there are no clear answers? And, if yes, will there still be multiple treatments? This is yet another reason for parents and healthcare professionals to consider avoiding immunosuppressive drug therapy with polyarteritis nodosa.

What do my children need to know about polyarteritis nodosa?

Question: Gluten tolerance in adult patients with celiac disease 20 years after diagnosis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can celiac disease be treated or corrected with gluten elimination? Answer: There are many cases of celiac disease that are treated with the elimination of gluten. In most cases, the condition was untreated until recently with the addition of gluten-free diet methods (e.g., gluten-containing foods) as indicated. The vast majority of patients with celiac disease will continue to respond to the addition of the gluten-free diet. Patients treated with the elimination of gluten have reported significant reductions in the severity of symptoms as well as on-going improvement and remission of their symptoms while on the diet. For more information about the elimination of gluten, please visit http://www.gluten.org. Answer: Gluten elimination surgery is being discussed by a number of physicians through a series of papers: In the recent edition of ""The Journal of Investigative Dermatology,"" there is an article by Dr. Frank Denno and Dr. Frank K. McGlose entitled, ""The Gluten Epidemic: Treatment and Prevention,"" on page 23-25. To order your copy please email info@investigativedermatology.com Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Can celiac disease be treated or corrected with gluten elimination? Answer: Gluten therapy is being considered as a treatment for many celiac diseases. The treatment protocol is based on the idea that by restricting gluten ingestion, patients can maintain a gluten-free diet for longer than once a year or by reducing the frequency and quantity of gluten consumption. It is widely suggested that gluten is not absorbed properly during food processing (e.g., after the baking of cakes), so the elimination of the food source is essential for a stable stable gluten-free diet. The treatment protocol for these diseases is similar to the treatment with gluten elimination therapy. In the case of celiac disease it is recommended that the following treatments be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of the disease is confirmed and before treatment for gluten intolerance takes place: 1) Complete resolution of symptoms and possible resolution of the diet intolerance, using gluten-free baking, recipes, supplements, foods, or medications; or 2) Dietary modification (e.g., avoidance of gluten bread, pasta, pizza, pasta dishes) for at least 6 months, or to a minimum of 12 months. Since gluten avoidance is usually accomplished by eating gluten-free, in some instances, the gluten-free bakery has been developed and is used in many countries around the world. In addition the gluten-free diet might be replaced by a strictly gluten-free diet, as in the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and other countries. Therefore, while it is not a complete cure, patients with this syndrome might continue with the elimination of gluten with many of the above treatments, depending on the particular disease.

Question: Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers and should they for COPD?

Answer: Yes

Answer: Question: Who are the COPD sufferers and which diseases are associated with this disease. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains how these illnesses are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Answer:

Answer: Question: Explain to other researchers how the lung is divided into individual cells and how pulmonary circulation is carried out in each cell. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that describes how human lung cells, called alveoli, are formed in response to outside forces in response to inhalation of air.

Answer:

Answer: Question: How does the lungs breathe? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains how the lungs breathe through the trachea.

Answer:

Answer:

Yes. The lungs breathe by means of a process called a diaphragm, but lung infections are called pneumonias and a pulmonary hemorrhages are called pulmonary emboli.

An infection also can be caused by a viral infection, and aspirators to a lung infection often are the first treatment during surgery. When this happens, it becomes more important to know where the infection is and who to call for a thorough investigation. If you had a common viral infection during the past 6 months, such as pneumonia after surgery, you can get tested for viruses. This tests often can be done at a doctor's office or at the health department or clinic that provides healthcare services.

Your doctor can prescribe a special antibiotic called an antibiotic-releasing agent (ARI), commonly called an ointment or spray, or an ophthalmic agent. Medications can also be prescribed from a doctor. Other solutions for infections include antibiotics for bacterial ulcers and steroids for cancer.

Treatment options are varied for the majority of cases. If you are receiving therapy and have more than one infection, see your doctor at least once a week and ask about the treatment options. If you go without help, your risk of a new infection may increase.

COPD can cause changes in your breath when the airways become narrow. When the pulmonary arteries become narrowed, they block your lungs' ability to get a good supply of oxygen. If your lungs are not getting oxygen, toxins build up in your blood, causing a buildup of coagulants. CO2 that has trapped from the air around your lungs can accumulate in your blood, trapping particles and toxins and causing hardening of your arteries. The buildup of coagulants on the surface of your blood causes the thickening that occurs when fluid forms on your cells. This hardening causes the blood vessels to narrow. As your blood vessels narrow, it takes much longer for your blood to flow through them again. When your blood doesn't get enough oxygen, it can block other blood vessels and make you feel tired and short of breath. The airways may also become pinched and painful. Your breath may be more shallow and slow.

Lung disease usually goes away on its own if you take medications. Treatment with special antibiotics (antibiotics like amoxicillin, ampicillin, and clarithromycin) can sometimes give you a quicker symptom-free response to the inflammation. If you become a patient, ask your doctor for a referral for the right treatment in case you need it.

Many other lung diseases such as bronchiolitis obliterans and emphysema can cause other problems. When these illnesses affect the lungs, you need more of a detailed investigation. You may be referred to a specialist for more testing and imaging to help you keep your airway open, such as testing the blood and lungs for inflammation to see how the infection affects your lungs. Your doctor should also explain changes in your breathing rhythm (exhaled and exhaled) and respiratory muscles during treatment. He or she can give you more specific instructions to help you remember how and when to breathe, and may also tell you how to get support if you can't get enough air for you or your child.

If you feel that you can no longer tolerate more air when you breathe or that other signs of chronic breathing disease become present, contact your doctor. You probably will have a bronchoscopy to look at your lungs so the doctor can look for things that do not match a known lung disease. This may include changes in the way your lungs do not seal properly, changes in the size and shape of the trachea and the size and shape of the airways, changes in your ability to take in and release air, air bubbles in the lungs, or other problems.

Prevention

There is no way you can totally prevent COPD. There are, however, things you can do to reduce the risk of the disease. Preventing COPD can improve your health and your child's health."

Summary

The search engine search has been associated with adverse effects on many parts of the nervous system. However, the scientific literature is still limited. The objective of this report is to gather up relevant information from scientific and other sources to determine the utility, efficacy and safety of this search engine among an immunological and allergologic setting as a diagnostic tool for the individual.

A search performed on the Google Index (an online database) using one common search query containing the above question indicates that:

1. A search results page containing ""Google"" is a useful diagnostic tool.

2. A search results page using some text related to ""Google Search Results is interesting.""

3. Google search results appear as informative about one field of interest

4. Google search results are not always correct and most frequently are not related to health conditions of interest

Summary

Google Search engines, sometimes with difficulty, can be very useful at determining answers to personal medical questions. Google search is useful for many personal search queries. The search engine might not work correctly for all your personal medical searches, and the question that appears on the search results page will probably not help. This is probably not worth the risk.

When a medical symptom arises, search engines can assist. For some medical conditions the search engine might not be able to help you. If this is the case, Google might be the only tool that might be helpful."

Science is just a tool in the doctor's toolbox

Some people believe that science is something which you do and that they simply do it because they're scientists and they don't care what you think about it. I've spent many hours sitting by the science table in a lab, studying the data from these experiments, trying to get better at it, wondering how I can do this better.

It's because it's important that your observations and work to improve your expertise are based on the same data that the real scientific world uses to decide which experiments are worthy of real life.

It's the job of an expert when it comes to medical research to decide if the findings of science are worthy of their own funding and which experiments are right for a patient to undergo.

My work on improving my observational skills as a medical referee resulted in the creation of an independent, peer-reviewed journal article for one of my first patients, Isoflavonol. This experiment is on record and currently used by healthcare practitioners around the world to measure a patient's response to IV therapy.


You may have heard that Isoflavonol has also been patented, as it is an antidepressant. This is an attempt to increase its use in the market (not only for patients with depression) where existing therapies are not available or do not produce satisfactory results, since depression is a very complex syndrome that is associated with several different causes.

What's important about this paper is that the scientific value and benefit of the drug is established based on observational evidence. While the clinical trial was funded by the government, the drug was never approved for use in the UK because of concerns that there had been no appropriate prior study of whether it worked as well as other antidepressants as a treatment of depression. With the study only just recently published, your comments in this thread could affect whether that study ever reaches a trial stage.

As a medical referee, I'm very careful to find out as much as I can about the trial and about why the drug might be working for a particular patient – just as we are very careful with all our other clinical experiments to find out what might be happening and whether it could be improved and made more effective. You may not want us to.

Isoflavonol is important in clinical treatment of depression

Not only is it a useful drug, its use in patients with depression is also good for the NHS. Approximately 50 million people live with depression around the world and more than one million hospital beds are still taken up by patients with depression every year, despite the fact that the number of diagnosed instances of depression around the world is less than half that during the 1970s.

Isoflavonol is a class A drug listed in the schedule of medicines with a high risk of causing serious side effects. Some of those have the potential to cause life-threatening heart attacks and strokes. In the UK, it is the third most common drug taken by patients with depression and the second most prevalent treatment by many nurses.

Because of the risks, a trial of Isoflavonol in depression is currently under negotiation with a manufacturer with a major sponsor and an important market share (we are one of the six most successful brands).

If all goes well, the evidence on whether it works better than other depression treatments as well as on how well it works will become more widely known, which means all of us who use it will be better informed and better able to take part in the ongoing clinical trials.

I can see your comments and the discussion in this thread will be interesting. So I'll stop here and let you have your say. Please sign the petition before you go. You can also email my colleague, Dr Sarah, at the Research Committee of the British Association for Psychopharmacology.

Question: Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors?

POPULATION: Approximately 810 000 people are living with hepatitis C worldwide. Approximately one million deaths are linked with hepatitis C from 1990-2006 [9]. In 2014, the rate of infection was highest among men and women aged 20-39 years [1]. Since about 50% of newly diagnosed HIV-infected people have hepatitis C [10], hepatitis C is a substantial public health problem worldwide.

Hepatitis C is defined as the genetic defect of the cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) enzyme resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [11]. It is mainly caused by genetic factors, and it may cause liver failure if not diagnosed by liver transplantation or by infection through contact with infected body fluids.

Several studies have demonstrated that people with hepatitis C have a genetic predisposition to the disease. These data have led scientists to hypothesize that individuals with hepatitis C have a higher risk of developing liver damage over time. In response, many studies have established that the risk of hepatitis C related mortality continues to rise with the average age of infection, and increases with the time spent in treatment [12]. The disease is often triggered by the consumption of contaminated drinking water, which is mainly imported from South and Central America. In addition, this virus also circulates among people with HIV/AIDS. Many studies have linked the recent increase in hepatitis C to widespread, illegal drug use [12]. This practice has made the virus increasingly available to public health investigators who have been tasked with investigating the risk of the virus to community persons. Due to the high risk of the virus, hepatitis C affects communities worldwide. It is a serious and life-threatening disease [12, 14, 16].

One of the main features of hepatitis C is the increase in viral load after acute infection, which is associated with liver cancer. In contrast to HIV/AIDS, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and other liver diseases have decreased with time [17, 18].

The cause of the increase in liver cancer incidence with age has been attributed to the large number of newly acquired infections with HCV [12, 19], and therefore to the frequent use of oral and injectable oral contraceptives with inadequate postexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of infection [6, 10, 19]. Increased hepatitis C-related risk of fatal liver disease in women has also been linked to drug use [19]. The combination of increased risk of acquiring an HCV infection, especially a high HCV load, increased risk of becoming infected with HCV, and hence of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, is consistent with the hypothesis presented here. Further research has demonstrated that in women who also have HIV, hepatitis C infection was associated with an increased risk for fatal liver disease [6, 20]."

Question: Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice? Abstract I have a number of questions and have been following your web site for a while. I would like for you to comment on that question for me. This suggests that I am of at least low concern. But, I was very surprised recently to read how a number of parents who are considering children in the asthma prevention programs for asthma have gone overboard and given themselves some sort of prescription to try to stop their children from getting asthma. I was especially surprised to see so many of my fellow parents telling me, with the same tone of dismay the mothers give their own daughters, that I had to do something with my young daughter's asthma so she would not get lung disease. I find myself wondering if my parents and the parents of your children have ever looked at what your child really needs to prevent heart disease, or perhaps some other kind of disease, when you speak of ""the most important thing"" about health. For example, your child should not grow up with a lung infection or an asthma diagnosis. She should not have to eat food that doesn't kill her, or drink water that doesn't cause her to become dehydrated, or work with a person whose lungs are not working properly, or wear shoes that do not keep her out of hot or cold places. The child should not have to live in a building that is in such poor health that it makes him or her susceptible to some disease. This would include if the parents were not allowed to keep a pet as part of their homes. They might need to find someone who is a little bit more knowledgeable about medicine than they are about pet care. Children are more likely to eat too much, or eat too little, or eat too much to which they are exposed, or not get enough exercise, or drink too much water to which it may be not yet exposed, with the result that they may not be as healthy. They are more likely to experience a variety of other diseases like heart disease or cancer. It is clear that your child could benefit from the following simple tips. The best of these ideas will require the child to be home a while – let's say not more than 90 days. To be able to give advice, you may need to be a little less willing to be a parent yourself – or have to live in a place where you can actually help a child who seems sick. Parents of young children in your neighborhood, for instance, may not be in a position where they can look at themselves in the mirror, feel ashamed at some of their behaviors, or ask the teachers why they are failing their young students. If you believe that you have given your children the proper medical attention so that they have a healthy childhood, then you might be a good candidate to give your children ""the prescription."" I could see you giving your children the prescription as a last resort if they are in the hospital or at home from something that will kill them. Here is what they do: they do tons of exercise: they ride motorcycles, go swimming, go rafting, do everything that makes the kid feel like they have time to work. They are so excited about this, that they seem not to realize it is physically strenuous for them, and that in fact they are not growing. By the time they go to school, the kid is getting more tired from the exercise than from any medical treatment. Many of the older kids end up having problems with asthma. They are not doing exercise because they want to, they are in school because they are exhausted. They are not doing it so that they can have a better asthma diagnosis, because they are too exhausted by the time they get to school. You would do well to give the parents a prescription for the time just now, and say, ""This is for a moment of exhaustion, and this is for a moment when you are tired out. You might as well enjoy that now,"" and then give them the prescription later in the day, when you feel more awake, and have time left to practice these things. If you have a child in your neighborhood who has a breathing problem, even though he has the same asthma problem as you, you might decide to give your child two prescriptions, telling your child to take two doses per day and the second dose to be taken the evening before school when he is most tired. To accomplish this, you are going to have to learn where your child is breathing on a daily basis. You can tell the doctor where your child is breathing, but you have to do some exploring. Perhaps you are not going to know where your child's lungs are; perhaps the doctor will do that for you. If you don't know where the lungs are or how good they are, then you can't tell your child what to do. In the end, you may have to decide whether or not the second dose is needed. Maybe your other children also need their"

Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is mental imagery in individuals with complex functional neurology functional in disease or non-disease states of consciousness? This paper includes a description of the literature that supports these claims, a general description of the specific imaging findings, and a discussion of what these are and how they relate to recovery. A poster presentation will be held at the A.C.C. in December 2015, where the researchers will highlight the results of the ongoing study.

We are proud that a substantial body of science suggests that imagery may be used as valuable tools for assessment of patient and staff recovery. We have identified a number of studies to support this view:

Barkows et al. (2015b) reviewed studies investigating the link between imagery or visual mental imagery and long-term recovery from brain injury (e.g. damage to the cerebral blood vessels, resulting in hypoperfusion), brain lesions in the hippocampus, and brain lesions in the limbic and prefrontal cortex. These studies demonstrated that certain types of imagery can be very effective in managing long-term symptoms of brain injury by facilitating functional recovery and/or by facilitating recovery from a specific state of awareness, even in the absence of recovery.

Schloss et al. (2015) found that in patients recovering from stroke, images of their surroundings triggered positive or neutral emotions, while images of their memories and imagery of their personal identity led to decreased negative emotions (and a decrease in heart rate). For those who showed an elevated heart rate in comparison to their baseline, they were seen as feeling worse (relative to the group as a whole).

In another study (Barkows et al., 2015b), a group of 12 patients undergoing motor vehicle crash-related brain injuries or cortical lesions, had an MRI scan during which an average of 7.2 seconds of imagery of their own behavior during a motor vehicle accident was reported. Imagery of people and objects was found to trigger emotional responses; patients reported being more stressed after imagery of themselves during a motor vehicle accident than after imagery of their family or friends. Similarly, images of negative emotions such as fear induced activation of the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, for both patients and an MRI of the same patient revealed reduced activity (MNI coordinates: M1 = 8, 8, -6, L1 = 7.7, 7.7, 6.6, L2 = 8.8, 8.4, 8, L3 = 8.9, 11, -9.5, L4 = -10.3, -12.3).

In a recent study (Lee et al., 2015) we examined the effects of visual mental imagery versus imagery of non-identifying objects (e.g. numbers, letters) to improve emotional processing. Patients were asked to view their own picture and then write in a letter expressing feelings. They also were instructed to choose between visual mental imagery and letter writing to determine which one produced the best emotions (""visual imagery"") or which produced the least emotions (""letter writing""). Results showed that visual imagery improved emotional processing, but letter writing produced fewer emotions than visual mental imagery (MNI coordinates of the two types of imagery were, R4B = -31, +32, -12, L4G = -14.4, -12.4, 16.9, L5B = 16.8, 4.6, 29, L6B = -10.0, 10.8, 5.4, and L7B = -6.1, 7.4, 6.3, but note differences between the two groups).

In this study, we observed the use of imagery to create and interpret positive emotions in patients, but not those of patients with negative emotions. In all patients, images of positive emotions were able to enhance emotional processing, but letter writing produced greater emotional emotions, presumably a result of less anxiety and fear induced by the letter writing. Patients also used visual imagery to facilitate recovery. In particular, patients with lower total memory scores compared to controls used visual imagery to enhance recovery (regression lines show a similar trend as the group as a whole did). It has been suggested that visual imagery could help a patient with a specific condition of consciousness by facilitating recovery (e.g. Hovenkamp, 2009). However, the degree of activation of the anterior insula has been demonstrated to vary according to the level of recovery (Abrams et al., 2016). Therefore, although our current results suggest that visual imagery is helpful in those patients who are not fully recovered, these data cannot rule out what may be the case, whereby those who seem to be most able to sustain recovery might benefit from being more active in their imaginations (Lee et al., 2015).

The current data highlight that the use of imagery to enhance recovery of patients may be specific to specific cognitive domains, but that imagery"
Question: The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How many children need a family physician? Answer: One and a half billion. It needs to be something that is not just a temporary problem like a yeast infection or a sore throat. Many patients and their families can be quite sick for a number of days, weeks, or even months. Even for children with severe pneumonia, the best way to determine whether they require immediate surgery is to get a CT scan. With those conditions, the only reason they can't be treated with antibiotics is because the bacteria have become resistant to the antibiotics used in the past. We are in a position to begin a medical arms race. To solve this problem you have to first understand the problem. You have to determine if it is a problem that can be treated from what treatments all the experts are recommending or if it is something that is going to get worse, probably in the next few years, and a good candidate, if we can, to make a first-step approach to it by finding out first whether there are any underlying medical conditions that can be treated or cured by a family physician from an alternative medicine approach. The solution to this problem is for the medical community to stop insisting that we use emergency care as the primary means of preventing infections. Instead, we should work with health care facilities to figure out that if a family physician can prescribe antibiotics to the extent recommended by the state of California, we should do so, and if that doesn't work, we will have to make a hospital switch. This is a problem that we are already in the midst of trying to solve, but it is a bigger problem if it affects millions of people. For that reason, your question makes sense, and if you want real answers to this question, as I think you do, you can find those answers at www.medicinenetwork.com/pediatrics. If our approach to health care improves a little bit we can move to a new way of working with health care facilities and health care facilities can get to work. The current system, where most health care has been provided by government and insurance companies, is not a good one, and there is a legitimate and growing interest in changing it -- even though the public does not yet support that.

Restore the quality of health coverage.

A bill to require that all health insurance policies offer coverage of a ""specified qualified health service"", provided for a specified period of time, and to prescribe rules for determining which qualified health services must be covered.

Status: Resolved 2/2/2015

Impacted Bills: House Resolution 6

Summary: To require that all health insurance policy policies offer coverage of ""a specified qualified health service"", provided for a specified period of time and to prescribe rules for determining which qualified health services must be covered.

HB 815 would require that all ""health insurance policies offered by any association of insurance companies"" be sold to an individual and that such policies cover a ""specified qualified health service"". However, if such coverage costs the insurance-company a certain percentage of its premiums, the law says those premiums must be reduced by a specified amount, in addition to the premium amount themselves. The plan's coverage of ""specified qualified health services"" would cover medical or surgical procedures for the following: ""a woman who has developed a condition leading to a miscarriage and does not want to continue to carry a pregnancy to term"", and ""a child who lives at least 24 hours and who is hospitalized for a condition having a substantial direct effect on the child's life in the state"". Such coverage would cover only those services considered medically necessary, including treatment for: ""a pregnancy that is not life-threatening or involves a condition that can be cured with medical treatment"", ""a breast infection that is diagnosed by the physician on the patient when an initial diagnostic mammogram is not performed"", ""a bleeding disorder that is diagnosed by the physician on the patient when a mammogram is not performed"", ""a fever in a child that will not require medication"" and ""a sore throat that is diagnosed by the physician on the patient when a cough test is not performed"". (House Bill 582)

Rep. Pineda, R-El Centro, has sponsored HB 815; R-Carmel, House Bill 579; A-813; A-717; the Senate bill passed, but HB 815 stalled in the House. (House Documentary Report, at 803.)

Question: Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas? Submit one abstract per week for consideration.

Your abstract should focus on the use of the beta-blocker to treat hemangiomas to identify and treat coexisting vascular malformations (including carotid sinus or occipital stenoses). For these reasons, these abstracts should focus on safety and efficacy of the beta-blocker in reducing postoperative bleeding and other complications associated with the initial induction of mechanical ventilation.

Include the following:

• Summary of any known or potentially causative causes of bleeding. (For example: an arterial disease, a surgical procedure, heart failure, and/or hypotension.)

• Evaluation of the patient's bleeding risk before administration of the beta-blocker regimen.

• Comparison of the clinical and laboratory response to the beta-blocker regimen with the initiation of usual care.

• Evaluation of the clinical response of the beta-blocker protocol to follow-up blood pressure, vascular function testing, and other tests performed at the outpatient facility prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation.

• Evaluation of the patients' symptoms after the first week of mechanical ventilation and any associated comorbidities.

• Any adverse reactions or adverse events during or even after initiation of mechanical ventilation.

Question: Can the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica be predicted at disease onset? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica at disease onset? Abstract 1 Abstract

Abstract

Sick days 2-6, and days 5-8 and 2-4 of the polymyalgia rheumatica disease in men are generally considered to be normal. The disease has a very rapid course; clinical presentation is rapid on day 2, and on days 5-8, the disease progression is slow and typically goes undetected, possibly leading to the clinical syndrome of dyspareunia. On days 2-6, 2-4, and 1-2, the patient presents with generalized pain in the upper extremities. These generalized and localized symptoms occur in close relation to the increased pain, stiffness, and fatigue characteristic of the disease. These symptoms may worsen with time. Asymptomatic symptoms of the disease have been reported to last for 2 months, although these were not always objectively determined. Patients with acute onset of disease have an increased incidence of anemia and low red cell mass as serum iron levels increase. Clinical disease progression in this group tends to be progressive and clinical diagnosis is not always reliable. This is particularly relevant given the short treatment courses observed in most patients and the lack of well-documented clinical worsening of polymyalgia rheumatica in this group. It is also noted that the disease is more variable in this group. This is a very rare disease. The etiology of this disease is not fully understood. Despite the rapidity of the course of polymyalgia rheumatica, there is a lack of information on the prognosis. The pathophysiology of polymyalgia rheumatica is very likely complex and multifactorial. The diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica in general is based on the clinical presentation, and the pathophysiology is best determined by the presence of disease progression and symptoms.
