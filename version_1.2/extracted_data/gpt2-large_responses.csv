Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? Answer:," Yes, mitochondrial respiratory system is involved in remodelling of cell surface which in turn acts as a regulator of cell morphology. However, this effect is not at the cellular level and is observed only when mitochondria are targeted by other substances such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrion has a major role in regeneration and regulation of cell morphology in plants thanks to the regulation of ROS by mitochondria and ROS production by mitochondria.

Dietary composition and mitochondrial damage

Mitochondria are responsible for breaking down the main components of plant cell tissue, especially carbohydrates of plant cells and carbohydrates in protein complexes of plant cells. These are in addition to oxidative proteins that are secreted by the mitochondria from inside the cell. Mitochondria are found in the mitochondria of all known plants. These mitochondria (monosomy 21) have several functions which are important in plant cell metabolism and in the regulation of cell death.

Mitochondrial oxygen consumption

Mitochondria use oxygen as a major energy source for the activity of their mitochondria. When the cell is in thermal (overheated) condition, mitochondria emit electrons. This energy is used for the processes of oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids, to increase the oxidation of NADH and to reduce oxidizability of fatty acids. Mitochondrial respiration also stimulates the reactions of lactic acid, glutaminase-mediated gluconeogenesis and protein hydrolysis.

Mitochondrial respiration and lipid peroxidation

The reduction of oxidized fat in plants results in the catabolism of saturated fatty acids, particularly by the production of acetate, lactate and pyruvate. These reactions of the phospholipids that are derived from carbohydrate of cells have a major role and are important for plant cell metabolism and in regulation of organ and tissue function. This is the first step in the conversion of cell proteins and carbohydrates into energy.

F recycle for ATP synthesis

Each mitochondria has19 ATP synthase enzymes from which it can generate ATP that the mitochondria can use to perform various biochemical and biologic functions. These enzymes include NAD+ catalytic enzyme (NADH+ catalysed oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids), the mitochondrial β-hydroxylase (β-OHCAΔ), the SOD enzymes (soluble) and the cytosolic NAD(+. These enzymes are present in all cells of plants. These enzymes contribute to the conversion of one form of carbohydrate into another which is necessary for most chemical processes of plants, such as energy production, amino acids synthesis and nucleotide synthesis.

Mitochondria promote growth during plant cell division

Protein content of leaves

Leaf-producing tissues of plants such as leaves consist of a large number of different cell types and cell types are highly variable. Plant cells differentiate in three distinct phases: stem, roots and shoot. Plant cells of stems are divided into cells by a series of elongated tubular units (ploidys). Plant cell bodies are divided vertically into cell layers of leaves that can be in the form of cells without azinskiules such as pistillate (without a leaf cell body and a basal cytoplasmic layer and usually without a nucleus).

For a larger picture, see the diagram below

Leaf-forming organs and cells include a number of different organelles such as stomata, leaflets, hairs, pistils, sepals, leaves and the roots, flowering bulb, fruits, stems and roots. Cells of roots, flowers, pistils and natal flowers are divided in various areas with basal cells, basal stomata, apicardium and apical chambers. There are numerous specialized organs in the root of plants such as the root of the genus Heliconius and the trachoma. In addition to specialized organs, cells of flowers are divided into cells with various types of organelles such as papill divides, stamens, pistillates and trichomes.

Leaves form a set of cells in the upper part of the plant body including the apical and basal cells, the apicardium, apical chambers, the stamens and the stamens.

Carbon

Carbon is formed in the intercellular spaces of the plants stem or leaves. Carbon is essential for most organic chemical reactions. It also forms a major part of cells of plant tissue, especially plants stem, roots, fruits and shoots. Carbon also plays a crucial part in plant cell regulation and development.

Carbon molecules are found mainly in the outer and inner membranes of plant cells. For example, the outer-membrane of chloroplasts and mitochondria, the inner membrane of chloroplasts, the inner membranes of chloroplasts, the nucleus of chloroplasts and cytoplasm of the cells of root"

"Question: Syncope during bathing in infants, a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:","

Answer: 1) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a sudden unexplained death that can be associated with drowning, as well as many other traumatic events. In the last 50 years, about 500,000 children have died of SIDS, and half of these have occurred at bath time. It is estimated that between 1% and 18% of all children over the age of 1 year will have SIDS when the infant is young enough to be swimming in water.

2) Water-induced urticaria is a temporary water rash that occurs about one hour later. It is usually mild, nonspecific, and is often overlooked.

3) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a rare, sudden death occurring in infants less than one year of age. Almost all deaths from drowning occur in infants less than one year of age. Nearly all the SIDS cases occur when an infant is in the bathtub or tub after a bath or bath.

4) The risk factors for SIDS include a bath at home, a short bathtime, being on your stomach, not wearing seat belts, being on a hot tub and the bathtub is a short distance away. If you have a short bathtime, make sure you have a good curtain.

5) Infants need several exposures to air to get enough oxygen to oxygenate their blood. You are less likely to experience excessive water and sudsy body fluids if you have a long exposure time.

6) Bathers should always wear life jackets and protective neck gear in a case of water intoxication. Some people do not have the ability to swim so wearing safety belts can be a good precaution.

7) In addition, make sure kids are in their seats when they go in or out of the water. This helps prevent drownings that could happen from sudden immersion in water.

8) A child can die of water intoxication after only one brief exposure to a short bath. There is no safe amount of time until exposure to water. If your family is planning an outdoor bath or bath time on a hot day, consider using an air tight tub or a safety belt.


Question: What is the link between SIDS and bath-time water intoxication? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:

Answer: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is an unexpected sudden loss of consciousness. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, SIDS rates increased significantly in the United States by a factor of more than 1.5. These increased SIDS rates were followed by a more than 30 fold increase in the rates of water water intoxication in the same regions. SIDS is more likely when babies are younger and more often occurs with other risk factors.

9) Bathers need to take additional precautions if a child is going for a ride with friends or family members. If he or she is swimming in the tub or bath, make sure the child is wearing a life jacket and have a good curtain.

10) A large amount of water in the bathtub can cause an allergic reaction. This can lead to seizures and death. When children are under 10, they shouldn't use a bath tub for more than one or two hours at a time.

Question: Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?

Answer: Yes.

Question: What is the most cost-effective way to encourage HMO enrollees to wear breast implants? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the most cost-effective way to encourage HMO enrollees to wear breast implants?

Answer: In patients who have undergone a breast biopsy, the majority of implant-related complications will be treated at the expense of insurance coverage. Breast implants are expensive to repair and will cost thousands in treatment and rehabilitation in addition to the cost of treating the implants. The most cost-effective approach for women who undergo biopsies to confirm breast implant implantation is to refer them to a breast surgeon willing to perform the surgery at an acceptable cost.

Question: What specific preventive services are covered for breast cancer screening by the Affordable Care Act? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What specific preventive services are covered for breast cancer screening by the Affordable Care Act?

Answer: Comprehensive mammograms are covered for all women, not just those for whom insurance pays for surgery. Screening for breast cancer with ultrasound is excluded. The ACA is very supportive of breast cancer screening. In the end, breast cancer screening is usually more cost-effective than other kinds of preventive services, and it is often recommended for women on the lower income end of the spectrum."
Question: Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

SUMMARY: What is the consensus view on what is considered the gold standard for both surgery and endoscopy?

A. The consensus view is that the open flap procedure (FL) is acceptable in the context of open-heart surgery, but only if the first-degree sonographer in the clinical practice is capable of performing the technique safely for a large number of patients.

B. The consensus view is that the double balloon insert in the open-heart and paravalvular surgeries (AP) are acceptable when a single balloon inflating device (OBD) is used in the treatment.

C. The consensus view is that the open-heart bypassing (OBB) is acceptable for patients with a low risk of significant complications from a single balloon operation, but only in the setting of an active cardiac catheterization process.

D. The consensus view is that the double balloon insert in the paravalvular surgery (AP) is unacceptable for all other patients unless the first degree sonographer is capable of performing the technique safely for a large number of patients.

The literature shows that the best practice for OBD procedures (the type of operation performed by the first-degree sonographer) is to perform the OBD on a low-risk patient. In those patients, surgical approaches in addition to the surgical technique in the open-heart and paravalvular surgeries must be considered. In these studies, the surgical approaches included: obstructed access and the use of a defibrillator (cardiovascular catheterization). In this report, the first-degree sonographer in the surgery and the obstructed access group used a large OBD device to provide the defibrillator. The other group (the obstructed access and the single balloon insertion) used either the balloon insertion or the balloon inflator in the treatment. The primary outcome measure is the rate of failure to thrive (TFST).

The literature also suggests that the number of patients successfully treated with the single balloon insert varies. A study performed in Australia that followed more than 700 patients for over four years found that those patients treated with both devices found greater improvement compared to those treated with balloon insertion alone. Patients treated with balloon insertion alone were found to be more likely to have a higher complication rate. The literature was sparse for the use of a single balloon insertion for endoscopy. In a survey of the literature, 10 authors observed that a single balloon insert is not recommended for endoscopic use. 2

We studied two patient cohorts to determine how similar the results could be between these two cohorts. We performed randomized controlled trials using the same treatment approach (double balloon insert versus balloon insertion in the treatment) and same population of patients to examine whether the single balloon insertion is always as efficacious and safe for every patient as its conventional counterpart with the same procedure. We also studied the outcomes for endoscopic and surgical outcomes. A third study looked at the role of risk adjusting and complications and found that a single balloon insert is probably more effective for these outcomes in a cohort (n = 464 patients) of patients treated with open-heart surgery. 1 This study also showed that the use of a single balloon insert may increase the potential for side effects and may not be as reliable at identifying patients who are at increased risk.

We used data from the study performed by Miller et al 1 in the United Kingdom. The results are summarized in. The study was a large, prospective, observational study to evaluate the results of a single balloon insert for endoscopy performed on large, otherwise healthy, patients (n = 1512) with a history of prior open-heart surgery or a history of an acute open-heart episode. To evaluate the effect of the single balloon insert on patients at high (n = 2085 patients) or low risk of adverse outcome (n = 1260 patients) the authors utilized a double-blind method to assess the success of the procedure based on patients' self-reported outcome measure (TFST). All patients were admitted to a hospital with the intent to follow their medical care at the hospital. This study included 2478 patients over 28 days.

The primary outcome measure used in the studies is the TFT, which is a visual assessment of the amount of bleeding that occurred in the patient, with an algorithm that describes the flow of blood through the patient for a given time interval and level of pain. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who had TFTs with a level of pain equal to or better than the median for a clinically significant change of 3 mm or less of blood between the time of the first TFT and the time that the patient received the recommended therapy from the cardiologist.

An important aspect to consider when interpreting the data is the degree of patient bias (whether or not there is a difference between the 2 groups). The authors"

Question: Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Abstract and citation information in the Supplement are available upon request.

The following was discussed in the discussion: A review of the literature regarding the use of adjustment for reporting heterogeneity and conclusions to date are discussed. In order to provide a basis for a final recommendation on adjusting for reporting heterogeneity, the following adjustments or additions were proposed: Considerations of subgroup characteristics between subgroups were evaluated. The impact of adjustments were compared with those for comparisons of the same subgroup with and without the adjustment. When possible, measures of differences between subgroups were analyzed. Differences between subgroups in the number of hours in each of four morning meal types were examined.

The following items were reviewed: Studies evaluating the impact of adjustment for reporting heterogeneity on the association between sleep duration and health outcomes and are primarily of interest were reviewed. Data were extracted into separate tables by the authors and summarized according to the following categories: No adjustments;

Adjustments for covariates;

Subgroup measures of effect such as gender, health behavior, level of education, work histories, ethnicity, body mass index, ethnicity, and sleep duration by education, race/ethnicity, and total hours spent in bed and bedtimes.

The following issues were evaluated in detail: (1) Subgroup characteristics of the subpopulations examined; (2) Adjustments for covariates;

Does this study adequately account for the possibility that non–individual differences in response to meal frequency or the number of hours in bed and bedtimes contribute to the association between sleep duration and health outcomes?

Two reviewers (RM and JF) independently reviewed each of the citations reported in the search strategy and synthesized the information to formulate a consensus statement concerning the issues discussed.

Finally, each author wrote a list of recommendations that would further our understanding of the relationship between sleep deprivation and health outcomes. For this purpose, two reviewers (GRS and ESM) independently evaluated each recommendation.

Conclusions of the Recommendations

Recommendations for Health Monitoring of Long-term Sleep Restriction

Recommendation 1: Evaluate sleep durations, other environmental factors, and health behaviors to ensure the validity of the association between sleep deprivation and health outcomes.

Recommendation 2: Implement research on sleep durations and other environmental factors to establish that sleep-related health effects are real and measurable and to guide sleep durations in accordance with evidence-based recommendations.

Recommendation 3: Monitor trends in daytime sleepiness patterns and health outcomes through an epidemiological review.

Recommendation 4: Study and evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and disease-specific outcomes in the population.

Recommendation 5: Consider adjustment for reporting heterogeneity for observational research.

Recommendation 6: Establish consistent sleep-related body mass index standards; standardize meal timing standards; design and implement national standards to monitor overweight and obesity; develop and implement national sleep training programs; implement national standards for bedtimes and early bedtimes.

Question: Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does low LDL-C promote increased intima-media thickness? Why do low HDL-C promote increased intima-media thickness? What are the clinical implications of the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and blood vessel atherosclerosis? What are the clinical implications of the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and arterial calcification? What are the clinical implications of the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and acute coronary syndrome? What are the clinical implications of the association between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and coronary calcification and heart diseases?

Answer:

1) Low HDL does not cause arterial calcification, and the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and blood vessel atherosclerosis remains unknown.

2) A plausible mechanism why low HDL causes arterial calcification is that it promotes lipid storage in subclinical atherosclerotic plaques that are rapidly developing within the arterial wall.

3) The high frequency of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is in large part attributable to a complex interaction between a genetic predisposition associated with low HDL levels and a complex metabolic response to insulin resistance that occurs early in life.

4) The high frequency of cardiovascular death, stroke, and sudden death is largely due to a complex interaction between a genetic predisposition associated with low HDL levels and a complex metabolic response to low HDL levels.

Question: How can you prevent high-glucose diet-induced metabolic syndrome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How can you prevent high-glucose diet-induced metabolic syndrome?

Answer:

1) The risk of metabolic syndrome increases significantly when plasma glucose rises from normal glucose levels after consuming a very high-calorie (25% kcal/day) high-fructose (HFD) diet for 1 week.

2) Low-glycemic index (LGI) diets have been shown to reduce plasma glucose levels while increasing HDL-C levels. A low-glycemic index diet increases HDL with a concomitant reduction in LDL and increases HDL with a concomitant concomitant increase in triglyceride (TG). To investigate the effect of these dietary changes on glucose homeostasis, healthy subjects were given 2 doses of a low-glycemic index (LGI) diet and followed 4 weeks later by the same low-glycemic index (LGI) diet. Plasma glucose, insulin, and lipids were determined.

3) Glucose homeostasis is impaired in persons with both severe polyglutaminergic diabetes mellitus as defined by the American Diabetes Association criteria and insulin resistance caused by polyglutaminergic disease.

4) As described in the context of insulin resistance, ""Insulin resistance causes dysregulation of glucose metabolism by upregulation of glycogen synthesis and depletions of the lipolytic enzymes as well as reduced levels of phospholipase A2 and beta-1-hydroxylase. These cellular responses are known to be related to impaired ability of the beta-cell to maintain the adequate glucose supply to skeletal muscle fibres of adults with various types of polyglutaminergic diabetes mellitus.""

Question: Does a high-protein diet cause insulin resistance? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Does a high-protein diet cause insulin resistance?

Answer:

1) High protein intake is associated with reduced glucose and insulin levels, but there are no differences in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations if subjects consume a high-calorie (25% kcal/day) high-protein (∼20% kcal/day) diet for 10 weeks before or after another 9-week high-protein (∼25% kcal/day) diet.

2) Plasma glucose concentration increases with the consumption of a high-protein (∼20% kcal/day) diet.

3) After consuming a high-protein (∼20% kcal/day) diet, subjects have a higher insulin response than subjects consuming a low-protein (∼10% kcal/day) diet.

4) The insulin sensitivity index (ISI), the ratio of total to HDL response to insulin (ΔI/ΔH), is significantly increased in subjects consuming a high-protein diet compared to subjects consuming a low-protein (∼10% kcal/day) high-protein diet.

Question: A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are they effective? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Q: One or two days of residential, long-term, or short-stay hospitalization for a child and/or pregnant woman, with their primary caregiver. How effective is these placements?

Answer: These types of placements are not very effective at preventing mortality.

1. Residential placements of infants in adult homes, typically in infant dormitories, with the infants' primary caregivers. Such placements (4 or more days) typically have a short duration and no long-term benefits. (8)

2. Long-term nursing house placements in infant care facilities. These placements (1 to 2 years) with primary caregivers may be effective at preventing death (3). (3.1)

3. Intensive outpatient hospitalized children's homes for infants, children not in nursing homes, and mothers between 42-46 years of age. These placements have a longer duration and are more likely to be of long-term benefit than other types of placements. (5)

4. Intensive outpatient community residential for children between 25 to 29 years. These placements are also of longer duration than inpatient placements and more likely to be of long-term benefit than other types of placements. However, studies that examined mortality were unable to find evidence that children assigned this type of placement lived longer on average than other children of similar ages. These studies also have a poor follow-up and are limited by being observational studies of children between 25 and 29. (5)

5. Residential hospitals for infants and young children between 5 and 15 years (3.8 million), children of either racial/ethnic groups, or age- and sex-matched comparison groups.

6. Extended-stay inpatient facilities (hospital beds for 24 hours or more) for infants, children, pregnant women and other pediatric patients. These facilities are less durable than inpatient residential placements and have less benefit when compared with other types of long-term inpatient placements on mortality and morbidity. (5)

7. All-day residential hospitals for infants, children, pregnant women and children between 5 and 19 years. These facility-based facilities are less durable when compared with other types of longer-lasting placements on mortality.

8. Intensive outpatient hospitalization for infants between 25 and 29 years. These hospital-based hospital units are less durable on mortality than general hospitalization units and most studies have demonstrated poor follow-up and are limited by being observational studies of infant health.

One of the most important studies of such outcomes that have been completed to date was that of Fava and colleagues (25), which examined the mortality of 3,634 infants (1,816 infants and 787 children) who received a mean of four or more days of hospitalization between July 1991 and June 1992. There were 1,200 deaths, a death rate of 17.7 per 1,000 infant days received, a significant reduction from the previous year, and a significant reduction from the mortality rate of 17.1 per 1,000 days received over the previous five years. In comparison, a mean of 1,087 infants (836 infants and 793 children) received general hospitalization and died on average 1.7 days later. For comparison purposes, a five-year mean mortality rate was also taken from the same study, and we have used this data for the following analyses.

An earlier report of the study and its follow-up methods appeared in Pediatrics in 1996 (33), in which the authors described the outcome data from two observational studies of the benefit or lack thereof of intensive outpatient hospitalization compared with general hospitalization (n = 1,700 infants; n = 948 children). Those studies found no effect for deaths on days when infants were hospitalized for observation after the birth of an infant but some reductions in days when infants were hospitalized for observation had occurred. For more recent data, see the information provided in this report.

Most recently, a study of infant mortality rates in five-year age categories found no significant difference in the rate of death among neonates in intensive outpatient units compared with short-stay beds (5). The authors also compared infants with short-stay inpatient inpatient units with those who received general hospitals. The results of this article have been published online in Pediatrics. (27)

One of the more surprising studies of inpatient morbidity and mortality that is currently being performed for this report and others is the study of Nieswander and colleagues (35). This study of more than 24,000 children aged 9 through 21 years at a special pediatric hospital in the Northeast had the largest number of infants receiving acute psychiatric inpatient care: 3,811 of which received acute psychiatric inpatient treatment. It also had the largest follow-"
Question: Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Did Latin America's traffic law reform push police enforcement?

Answer: Not in the 1990s. It did not.

Answer: It started to. The 1990s saw a dramatic push to pass new laws and policies designed to discourage speeding and road rage, especially in Latin America.

Question: Why did the U.S. speed control laws become an international legal standard?

Answer: Traffic laws are rules imposed by authorities, and these rules are universal in every part of the world, regardless of political and cultural differences. International conventions have an important but inescapable flaw: The rules are usually more of a guide -- even the ones about speed limits or license-plate numbers -- than a reality check.

Question: Why did police begin focusing exclusively on serious accidents early in the 1970s?

Answer: They needed to make more arrests. There were too few arrests, and police could not use their resources to catch the kind of reckless drivers that contributed to those serious accidents. In part, this meant making a ""show-me"" approach, by focusing on breaking up accidents and then sending offenders to jail. Another part was to force speeders to spend more time behind bars because they were expensive to keep behind bars for longer. It is also well documented, as were many of these programs, with police, that the more you can spend on arresting speeders, the less you can spend on making other cases and convictions.

Question: Why have some of these policies been so successful? Why did these policies take root so fast?

Answer: The biggest factor was a combination of factors: the availability of information technology, police and judicial resources, public opinion, and an institutional culture of enforcement: officers were encouraged to find and pursue offenders, police chiefs often made traffic offenses their first priority in their first year on the job, and many jurisdictions were heavily influenced by the federal government.

Question: Is there a need to revise current law, in particular traffic law, in the US? Are there alternatives? Why hasn't it happened?

Answer: We don't know. But if you were to take a close look at U.S. policy, you'll find a long list of policies that haven't gone anywhere, including the current high-speed limits on highways, higher insurance rates, more aggressive citation systems for speeding, mandatory minimum sentences, enhanced penalties for driving while intoxicated, and high-speed camera enforcement.

Question: What does this have to do with the question: Are traffic laws changing? Or are they maintaining the same state of affairs?

Answer: As I've written on many occasions, I do not believe the two are linked. (See also my previous article on the topic.) The speed limits and the increased criminal penalties they are a result of is a real trend on the ground, and it has been evident for a few decades.

Question: Is it time to re-think the US traffic laws?

Answer: As for the future of a traffic law, I don't think it's an unimportant question. My view (and that of others who have written about changes that are occurring) is that our current system is very good and it is getting better. (My view on the current system is here.)

More background for the reader — including an extensive discussion of the history of the traffic laws in the US — is included in our previous article on this topic.

Question: Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do routine laboratory markers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NSHE) are useful in detecting the diagnosis? If so, what other laboratory markers are useful?

Answer: These markers are used in some diagnostic laboratories, to determine if a patient does or does not need to undergo CT or MR imaging. All of these markers involve the production of a ""chemical messenger"" called glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) - the enzyme which converts glutamic acid to glutamate. One marker is called the ""non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug anti-thyroid (NSAID) anti-glutamate (Glu-glu) monoclonal antibody"" (NSL-GABA) - this test measure the anti-inflammatory action of the NSAID. The other markers are the antibodies against specific types of proteins on the surface of NSHE - GAD and Glu-glu. NSL-GABA is known to be a useful marker of the NSHE, as well as its correlation with CT imaging. However, other markers for NSHEs are more difficult to use. Thus, one need only be mindful of the presence or lack of GAD enzymes to determine whether the patients is NSHE. As such, these markers need to be routinely measured before and after CT or MR imaging, to make sure that they will be able to identify NSHEs as well. They are not reliable or validated tests to diagnose NSHE. The following is a list of some markers for different types of NSHEs: NSHE monoclonal antibody, IgG (IgG anti-GAD)

The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) reported in the United States that there were 1,085,200 adults aged 14 years or older, of whom 633,600 were vaccinated in the 2011-12 USPHS Vaccine Use Survey. This is an increase of 2.2% from the 2013-14 USPHS Vaccine Use Survey which was conducted for the first time using a sample representative of the U.S. population.

The average age for vaccinated people was 36.2 years old, which is 5% higher than the 2012 USPHS Vaccine Use Survey estimate of age 36.3. The gap in age between vaccinated and unvaccinated in the United States has increased over the past 25 years. In 1972, the average age gap was only 0.7 years which has widened to 6 months. Currently, the gap in age between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults in the United States is at an all-time high of 10 years.

While it may not seem like it, the difference in average age between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults is an important indicator of socioeconomic status. It shows the number of adults without health coverage relative to the population at large. In other words, the percentage of people who are unvaccinating or unable to have the vaccine does not reflect the health status of those who are immunized. Additionally, the population percentage for that age gap has been decreasing steadily over the years.


In 2012, about 9% of the population aged 15 to 49 years in the U.S. was not vaccinated.

In 2013, the U.S. population aged 15–49 years was at its lowest number of unvaccinated individuals in the history of the USPHS Vaccine Use Survey since its inception. For the first time in history, the U.S. population aged 15 to 49 years was below the national estimate of unvaccinated individuals for the entire year. In addition, the proportion of infants aged 6 months and older in the U.S. who were vaccinated at age 12 or older stood at 63%.

If the current trends of declining vaccination rates continue, the U.S. population will be unable to adequately protect itself from a number of serious bacterial and viruses that are transmitted by medical procedures and by those who come in contact with a person who is not fully vaccinated, and can lead to serious infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends for the general population that everyone 13 years and older receive a vaccine dose at least 2 years prior to travelling to an area with high risk for a high prevalence of polio, including China, India, and Pakistan; and for those age 16 and older, that they receive a 5-dose vaccine series if staying for an extended period of time in an area where polio is present.

Although vaccines are not without risk, the U.S. Government, CDC, FDA and others are committed to protecting the average U.S. citizen against all diseases, including the most feared virus that is linked in epidemiological studies to deadly outcomes — the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

In 2013, the CDC said the estimated number of new HIV infections in the United States rose 18% to more than 13.3 million. Of those 13.3 million new infections (1.6% of total new infections), more than half (49%) are in adults ages 25 to 34. The number of new infections has remained relatively stable for the past 3 years, and no HIV infection for men infected by the male-to-female type of HIV, including males of all age groups, was reported for 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

However, it has been noted that not everyone will get the vaccine or benefit the risk level of protection from having the vaccine or from using it to prevent an infection from becoming more severe.

When someone comes in contact with someone who has been protected from a virus and who does not have the vaccine or"
Question: Is there a model to teach and practice retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," 1. What are some scientific studies supporting how this procedure is better than open-heart surgery for the treatment of patients with difficult-to-control end-stage renal disease? 2. What are some studies showing that nephrectomy may be more useful than open-heart surgery for the treatment of patients who are at low risk of developing an early kidney disease (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, acute tubular necrosis, acute kidney injury, acute renal failure, diabetic uremic syndrome)?

Response and discussion : The consensus that the main benefit of doing an open-heart surgery is that is most commonly gained after the surgery itself has been completed. This benefit is not as strong as it seems and does reduce the number of operations performed but is better than what many are advocating for the practice of nephrectomy. Many surgeons have been experimenting with nephrectomy for use in patients who have severe heart failure but who have not received renal transplantation. It is not clear whether the extra benefit to the patient is worth the cost of the surgery at this time. There is also a risk of major complications post-op due simply to the fact that renal transplantation does not take place until the kidneys have developed. If there is a great improvement in renal function following this procedure, it may not take long for the kidneys to develop. However, if there are worsening renal function before or after this procedure, it raises the question of whether an intra-operative blood transfusion is warranted and whether surgery should be done anyway. The choice is not as clear as the authors suggest, particularly if the patient is not particularly robust or has other serious complications that require surgery.

The choice is not as clear as the authors suggest, particularly if the patient is not particularly robust or has other serious complications that require surgery. Discussion: Although there are many differences between the procedures in this article, the authors should be commended for including discussion of the possible advantages of surgical techniques. However, it should be noted that many of the factors they list are of no benefit to the average person (i.e., a patient with normal renal function, a risk of major complications, etc.) and are the opposite of what many are advocating in the medical community. Many people who are willing to try the surgery may have little hope of achieving good results either because the operation is too risky or because there are factors, such as a pre-established kidney dysfunction, which would make this surgery unwise.

Post operative care : After surgery, nephrectomy offers the most improvement for the patient than any other surgical technique to date. It was initially believed that the only significant post-op complication would be an end stage hip fracture but these studies may have over-stated the relative benefit. In patients with acute renal failure, it does not appear to be necessary to have either of these procedures followed by open-heart surgery. The authors make several points regarding the care of patients post-op. They recommend that it should be performed regardless of the severity of kidney dysfunction or history. They state that it should be done if the kidney function test results were normal; therefore, they advocate for a transurethral catheter rather than a transurethral vein catheter when performing this procedure compared to open-heart surgery. Unfortunately, these recommendations do not go as far as what many may be expecting. Although they do not recommend doing the endoscopy and nephrectomy simultaneously, they do recommend the use of a sterile nephrectomy, if possible, if the kidney function is lower than is being maintained with the above procedures and only if the patient has a risk that will be minimal. The authors recommend that these patients should be considered for a transurethral catheter and that a transurethral vein catheter with blood transfusion (if needed) should be considered. They also mention that"
Question: Cardiovascular risk in a rural adult West African population: is resting heart rate also relevant? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Cardiovascular risk in a rural adult West African population: is resting heart rate also relevant?

Introduction

A common refrain in scientific literature is a relation involving resting heart rate (RHR). The assumption is that as RHR decreases and heart rate rises in the resting phase, the risk of a cardiovascular event grows. This is an intuitive argument, but the evidence is somewhat lacking. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to investigate this. This has the potential to be of use when doing risk assessments for both patients and clinicians. The review was limited to a single population of women living in rural West Africa. A total study population of almost 600 people was investigated and RHR was not assessed [1].

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between RHR and cardiovascular events in rural West African women. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and causes of cardiovascular events in rural South African women and to investigate the impact of RHR in a cross-section of the women's lives. This also helps to explain why RHR has such a small role in African health care systems, in terms of health care providers' awareness and provision of risk assessment.

Method

The methods used for this study included a meta-analysis of cohort studies [2] for studies which compared RHR levels in rural and urban and in a systematic review and meta-analysis for studies looking in detail at RHR. Additionally we conducted randomised controlled comparison of RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Findings

A total of 23 studies were included in our review, including 14 in rural West Africa, 4 in a community in rural South Africa [3] and 3 in rural Australia [4]. From these studies, 11 in rural West Africa, 8 in villages in one rural South Africa, 8 in community in rural Australia, 2 in community in South Africa (as part of the study) and 1 in community in Australia were identified. All studies found that RHR does not predict cardiovascular events. However, many of these studies failed to report the time of blood draw or have reported RHR with more than one study. The number of reported events varied from 3 (in South Africa) to 26 (in Australia), but the mean (SD) was 6.9 (7.1) weeks. For the same group, the number of non-fatal cardiovascular events was also low (3), including falls, transient ischaemic events, acute ischaemic heart attacks and sudden cardiac death.

Summary of findings

We found no evidence of any relationship between RHR and cardiovascular events in rural South African women. However, although RHR did not predict risk of an adverse cardiovascular event in the sub-population studied, it did suggest a trend towards risk reduction [10]. On the contrary, RHR had a similar effect in a cross section of rural Africans' lives, with very few or no cardiovascular events occurring in the sub-population studied. This does not rule out that RHR might have a role to play.

One explanation is that RHR in rural settings differs from that in urban settings, where there are more health care providers and better systems for reporting RHR. This difference may explain the apparent lack of effect, as it was observed that the majority of studies in rural areas did not report RHR, while in urban settings it was observed that 70% of studies reported RHR. It is also possible that in rural settings RHR might be different from what is observed in a hospital setting as the hospital does not collect RHR data. The number of studies investigating the effect of RHR in rural Africa is extremely small.

Another possibility for RHR's lack of role is that there were insufficient samples in rural settings. These studies usually used a cross section of two or three or four rural populations, to allow for the possibility that RHR differs between those locations. To avoid the type of bias that might arise from different samples that report RHR as a dependent variable from a common time point, these studies used the time point for RHR measurement as the 'pooling time' whereas we used the time of blood draw.

In conclusion, RHR is not associated with cardiovascular events but only with non-fatal events. This is a mixed message but may explain why RHR has a small role in African health care systems."
Question: Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How realistic is the military scenario scenario regarding the use of medical evacuations from Israel, or other countries, for terrorist or extremist attacks on Israeli targets? The Israeli Ministry of Defense (MoD) recently discussed the following challenges that the IDF will have to face in future terrorist attacks on Israeli targets, including attacks in the next days: • When a terrorist has been caught earlier, he is likely to be already carrying bomb-ridden hands and an additional device; • With an existing population of more than 20 million people living in the heart of the Middle East, and with thousands more seeking to escape from Gaza, Lebanon and Syria to escape from war, the IDF's ability to respond to many of the threat scenarios that the IDF plans to face if necessary is less than what it was in the 1990's and 2000's when the IDF fought large-scale wars with no plans for medical evacuations, and where the ability to quickly transport injured casualties to medical evacuation facilities was not as important as in the 1980's and 1990's when large-scale wars were fought with great concern for civilians' safety. In the ""Highyakh"", the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were widely thought to have been unprepared for Palestinian resistance during the Yom Kippur War in 2000, and the IDF's response after the 2006 Gaza War was not thought to have been as effective as the IDF had hoped. In this context, the IDF will face a host of challenges if the IDF and the IDF Health Authorities (IDH), with the support of other organizations such as the IHAI, decide to move the medical evacuations to a priority setting within the next few days. • The number of wounded combatants and combatants who will need the help of medical evacuation is not being known. • The IDF has a difficult set of requirements and requirements to fulfill; namely, the IDF will be able to evacuate wounded combatants as well as those who will need long-term assistance. • The number of fighters currently being held at Israel's military bases has not been made public to date. This makes the IDF's ability to evacuate the wounded to medical evacuation facilities more difficult, and may delay evacuation. • The IDF's ability to respond rapidly to a potential terrorist attack on Israeli civilians may also have been delayed by the number of potential hostages, and the potential of the hostage situation for Israeli hostages being a target for terrorists. In these terms, the IDF's response time to a possible threat to Israeli civilians will be more costly, or longer than in the past, when the IDF responded rapidly to a specific attack, with limited casualties, against an IDF force in need of medical evacuation. • IDF medical evacuation in general is not able to respond quickly to attacks in the future; and the IDF's preparedness plans may not prevent a future terrorist attack against Israeli civilians, or may not provide medical evacuation facilities in the near future. • The Israeli Defense Ministry should continue to develop and promote a health system that can rapidly and efficiently respond to the medical needs of the IDF troops on the battlefield. • The Israeli Health Ministry and its allies should continue to raise awareness and create awareness regarding the need to evacuate wounded soldiers from the field, and should create procedures to facilitate the evacuation of injured Soldiers and their families from the field. • The IDF's medical evacuation infrastructure cannot immediately respond to unforeseen emergencies of any kind, such as natural disasters, or incidents that might threaten the hospital's own medical and scientific centers, and must be able to rapidly and efficiently respond. The IDF Chief of Staff's Health Committee and his staff have put in place a comprehensive working plan (Health Working Plan), outlining a set of specific demands for an IDF Health Authority within four to six weeks. The IDF Health Authority will be responsible for the delivery of medical assistance to the military forces, and for the medical transportation of those injured in the IDF operations for which the IDF has a need for medical evacuation capacity. For medical evacuation in the near future, to ensure quick response and to maximize the IDF's ability to respond, the IDF will continue to expand its medical evacuation infrastructure by consolidating ambulances, providing space for ambulances to access the field as a whole, and constructing additional medical evacuation facilities (more than 700 of which are already active). The new ambulances will be equipped with the proper equipment necessary for the evacuation of wounded individuals. The existing ambulances will continue to be used for the emergency and limited evacuation of wounded individuals, and will continue as an integral part of the health care system. When evacuating the injured from the field during an operation that is a military operation, the IDF will first perform a comprehensive plan to evacuate wounded soldiers and their families to other field hospitals, to avoid potential civilian casualties. After conducting medical evacuation, the IDF will maintain and document the status of those who can be evacuated to an area with adequate medical evacuation capacity. During that time, the hospital will also be able to provide transport services"
Question: Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome?

A: This article summarizes the evidence for the relationship between a low oxygen-to-oxygen ratio and lung cancer, but it does not address the question of whether or not all children with asthma are at risk.

B: The effect of oxygen on lung tumor growth in children is controversial. The relationship between oxygen in the blood and lung cancer development has been known since the first large-scale, controlled trial of the effect of increasing hemoglobin levels in babies. This clinical trial found no effect of increasing hemoglobin levels in a group of children with pulmonary hypertension, although many of the other potential confounding factors were different.

C: Early childhood asthma exacerbates the risk of a later growth disability and disease (increased need for supplemental oxygen) among the long-term residents of child-care centers. (The effect of a short-term decrease in oxygen in the blood is not demonstrated.)

D: There is a link with long-term use of corticosteroids. It was shown that children that were given the steroids as young as 2 to 3 years of age (and who then had to take them for many years) had increased risk for developing bronchial asthma. More recently, some studies have found that children who previously had a family history of asthma experienced a higher incidence of short-term exacerbations of asthma.

E: While there is evidence for a causal link between short-term exposure of the airways to environmental factors and short-term adverse outcomes, there is a lack of evidence for a causal link with long-term exposure.

The following section of the article discusses long-term inhaler use following the diagnosis of asthma in children with an oxygen-to-oxygen ratio lower than 25, or the association between this and the development of adult lung cancers. In addition, the following section discusses how to interpret the findings.

Risks of short-term and long-term exposures

Risk of short-term and long-term exposures

Short-term exposure: Inhaler use can cause respiratory distress, and a study by Mazzotti, et al., suggested that one to three inhaled particles from a single dose of inhaled corticosteroids can reach the central nervous system and induce a temporary change in the nervous system which may lead gradually to a condition known as central sensitization.

Long-term exposure: One to four times the typical dose of prednisone (or prednisolone if not used in combination with another agent) may induce lung cancer in children. If inhaled at a large amount, one to two, 3- to 5-cm long particles may reach the central nervous system and induce a temporary change in the nervous system that may lead gradually to a condition known as central sensitization.

Virtually all of the cases of childhood asthma are in school-age children. Most people who have childhood asthma are not receiving treatment, and therefore, there is no evidence that high-dose corticosteroids are needed to prevent disease. However, in a controlled trial in children with asthma, a single dose of inhaled corticosteroids was as good at reducing symptoms as a high dose in adults.[2]

Risk of short-term exposure

Fluid inhaled during the cough is one type of short-term inhaler exposure. High school students used 12 times to 17 times the recommended daily dose of cyclodextrins during the last year.

There is some evidence that long-term exposure is dangerous. The following case illustrates short-term inhaler exposure.

In September, 1987, the owner of a small-town pizza bakery became ill after eating at a large downtown pizzeria. A few hours later, his father was admitted after suffering from acute respiratory distress. He was eventually diagnosed with laryngitis, and he died four months later after being found to have leukemia.

Since then, an autopsy revealed a bronchial tumor in the lung. Within the following week, her condition worsened. He died from a pulmonary embolism. Later tests revealed that the tumor and his father's DNA were identical.

This is not the only reported case of lung cancer among an employee at a New York City pizzeria. On August 6, 1987, Michael Tost, a sales associate, became ill after eating at a pizzeria near his home. It was the seventh day of his job at the time; his work began on July 13. His work area had never contained a child who worked late to avoid the cold, and he only made a few sales for dinner for the next two days.

After his death a week later, the NYPD was investigating. It was determined that Tost's workplace had been used as a"

Question: Most cancer patients would benefit from a ""predictive biomarker"" for future prostate cancer recurrence. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Most cancer patients would benefit from a ""predictive biomarker"" for future prostate cancer recurrence.

Answers: Yes

Question: What does ""BRCA1-2"" mean? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the meaning of ""BRCA1-2""

Answers: BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA3, BRCA5, BRCA6, BRCA8, BRCA11, BRCA12, BRCA12/19

Question: Why does the BRCA test work so well in identifying women at higher risk of recurrence compared with men at lower risk of recurrence? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the meaning of ""BRCA test works so well in identifying women at higher risk of recurrence compared with men at lower risk of recurrence.""

Answers: The test predicts up to 95% of a woman's overall prognosis for recurrence, based on her BRCA9 gene. Women with a lower BRCA9 positive status are less likely to recur and may go on to have a better overall prognosis.

Question: How do you decide which patients to test for BRCA1 and BRCA2? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the rationale behind choosing which patients to test for BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Answers: Because all cancer screenings are only able to identify one cancer and that is BRCA1-2, the current BRCA test has a high false-discovery rate (FDR). It has also been shown that men with a higher BRCA1-2 gene status were less likely to have positive results than men with a lower BRCA1-2 gene level. Therefore, there is a great public health priority to reduce the presence of BRCA-associated mutations in all people, regardless of whether that person has BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Question: How do you define ""overdiagnosed""? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains how to define ""overdiagnosed.""

Answers: If a study has 10+ positive BRCA1-2 tests in a particular group of people, they will all define as ""overdiagnosed"" if they have a positive BRCA1-2 test in at least two of the ten individuals, even if the individuals are unlikely to have any recurrence due to the BRCA1-2 test results. Since the 10+ positive BRCA1-2 tests have already been overclassified into overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed in some cases, it creates a substantial false-positive effect by defining the overdiagnosed as having recurrence due to the overdiagnosis.

Question: How many women and men will be overdiagnosed in the next decade or so? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers how many women and men will be overdiagnosed in the next decade or so.

Answers: About 1 in 3000 for men and women and about 1 in 13 men and women on average.

Question: Why in the world do we spend so much time and attention talking about breast cancer recurrence, then not enough time talking about hormone therapy treatment and other forms of cancer treatment? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question ""Why in the world do we spend so much time and attention talking about breast cancer recurrence, then not enough time talking about hormone therapy treatment and other forms of cancer treatment?""

Answers: Too numerous to list comprehensively, such topics have been studied extensively on all the various levels, in addition to the traditional clinical studies that we are currently reviewing in PubMed, and are all of sufficient relevance that researchers, clinicians and patients alike are still discussing them.

Question: Why does it take time for our health services to diagnose BRCA mutations in women? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question ""Why does it take time for our health services to diagnose BRCA mutations in women?""

Answers: We know that BRCA mutations in women are diagnosed much sooner and that the most common BRCA mutations in our population are BRCA2 and BRCA6 (the same BRCA variants that show the strongest relationship).

Question: Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation?

A: Mechanical pain syndromes that are related to somatisation are reported in varying degrees, with pain being associated with a variety of mechanical phenomena. One might argue that many reports of such syndromes are of somatisation. The somatisation hypothesis is a hypothesis that in a number of cases the somatization might be the contributing factor for pain, other biomechanical phenomena, even injury to the face, and that this association could explain why some types of chronic pain syndromes are reported without the somatisation component. An alternative view is that some reports of somatisation occur in the context of various different chronic pain syndromes, or in a case-specific case/treatments. In these cases the somatisation should exist in a variety of mechanical states for which there are no other factors to explain the pain.

There may be a difference in somatisation between somatic, and somatic-like mechanical pain syndromes with an associated somatisation component and somatic-like, non-somatic, mechanically and mechanically-related pain syndromes without somatisation. However, this difference has been noted to occur, at least in animals. In humans, we have suggested that some studies might be misclassified as not having the somatisation component because somatisation is seen to be the result of the underlying disease process of the underlying syndrome, rather than being the mechanistic or somatic pain state. It is unclear whether this is the case or not. These issues should be addressed carefully in patients with a diagnosis known to be a mechanotransduction disorder as well as in patients with the somatisation component.

One study looked at patients with migraine and reported some somatisation and pain using an MRI technique. The authors of this study concluded that the MRI findings were in good agreement with histological features of the somatosensory tissue of patients with migraine sufferers, including the presence of an abnormal signal near the coelomic (or primary) layer (Fig 1A,E).

The authors did not examine the relationship to the biomechanical system since it may be difficult to evaluate in normal, normally awake subjects. If somatisation is the underlying cause of pain, then there should be a clear mechano-mechanistic effect of the somatisation component. This effect could be that of the somatic component, but it could also be that of other biomechanical mechanisms.

A second study, which was also carried out by the same company and reported in the same issue (1A) did not provide any evidence that patients with migraine with aura had an abnormal signal near the coelomic (or primary) layer and this could be part of the somatisation hypothesis. There is good agreement between MRI and histological findings (Fig 3, G; E.2, G.2 and J.2; see reference 1) for all samples. One study reported that the histology pattern of patients with migraine with aura was consistent with abnormalities of the coelomic layer in the somato-sensory cortex (1B).

B: Skeletal muscle biopsies of patients with chronic facial pain have been reported [and may be the subject of further investigation]. A sample of 22 patients was recruited. Some reports of mechanical dysfunction in pain associated with chronic facial pain included mechanical sensations in the facial lamina propria and in the superior part of the anterior temporal bone, as well as in the posterior part of the temporal bone (see references 1 and 4 for a detailed review of these reports). Although all the patients in this study had migraine on presentation, there was no evidence for any abnormality of the cortical biopsy or of muscle microcirculation within the facial bone area. There was also some evidence for abnormalities of muscle biopsy location [which probably reflects a more localized damage to a single region of the skin or bone] but not in any of the muscle tissue, as the number of reported histological findings is much too low. Some reports [1B,E,3, 4] have identified the somatisation component as an etiological component in patients with chronic facial pain.

A: The most common somatisation is in the intermandibular joint and may begin with a pain sensation during the stretching of the muscle. The muscle is then felt as an irregular pressure on the mandibular lumbar region and sometimes there is pain on movement in this area. The pressure over this region in facial pain might be thought of as an intrusion of pain over the mandibular lumbar region. The somatisation and other mechanical symptoms can be seen in almost any study and there are a variety of such symptoms that may be seen in patients"
Question: Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

A. What are the common causes of amblyopia and how most people respond to them?

B. How does an amblyopic person interpret his or her amblyopic status?

C. Have other causes of amblyopia been identified? What other explanations have been found?


Answer


(A. B.)

A. Amblyopia is defined as near-sightedness, where the visual fields overlap in an acute way. People who have amblyopia do not notice this at all. Usually they are aware of nearsightedness, but they think other things that the other senses are fine.


(B)

You need an explanation about how this works.

You can use a metaphor that people will relate to. Example

""A patient with amblyopia sees better colors when viewed at one end or the other...""""This patient may not look at the same colors at two perspectives because they have very different visual fields from the central eye. In such cases a patient with amblyopia thinks about the color more because the other senses are not engaged,"".

(A C)

What is an amblyopic person?

""A person with amblyopia has normal vision at distance but not in close-up vision. This person often feels ambivalent to the world around them. This person may have very strong or vivid eye movements during close-up sight...""

(B)A person who does not recognize and/or see in the world around him or her is called an amblyopic.

""A person with an amblyopic field of vision may have a very weak field of vision in close-up vision.""


(C)

What's the answer?

(A. B.)

A. Amblyopia occurs in nearly all people. I can't tell you what it is like in other cases; there is a lot of variation here, but it is not uncommon. A person who sees better colors from one end of the visual field than the other, is a person with amblyopia; it's not uncommon to ""see in the world"". This doesn't mean we see better at a given distance if we are standing still. The eye-brain system is very good at discriminating between near and far and is always trying to maximize the sense of what goes on in the eye's visual field of view. A person who thinks about a given thing just happens to see the thing in his/her field of vision. That may be confusing. But the truth is, people often get confused if they are unaware of the differences in the fields of vision around them. If you do not respond, that's not what you are saying! If you are amblyopic, that means you have normal vision. Amblyopes always have poor vision. They don't have visual acuity, which is about 3-6/8 - inches (8-24mm) in distance, but they have normal field of view.

Here are some articles: What is an amblyopic.

What is normal visual acuity.

Why do amblyopes get confused?

Answer

(A. B.)

A. ""Normal visual acuity"" refers to the minimum distances per inch (e.g., 3/32"") that the visual field can cover. It doesn't imply that each of your cones, rods, or photoreceptors fills that space perfectly. When you look at something at 10cm, the distance it can cover in one eye for about 20 seconds is about 2.5 metres (8-24 feet) and varies with how good the lenses are working for you and your genetics; you have to be careful about picking up on the more distant things first. If you can't see that fine detail better with two glasses then you might consider optometrist intervention.

""Normal visual acuity"" means a person with average visual acuity at near distance, for any given distance. Normal visual acuity at a distance of 10cm is 10/80. Some people have normal visual acuity at distances of about 20m (61 feet) but only about 10m (1.6 feet) is usable. This is usually because of vision disorders like hyperopia and/or astigmatism. For those people, there is a constant range of visual fields that they need to use to have a normal visual experience.

Here are some articles: Why do retinitis pigmentosa patients have normal vision below 20m and vision in some other parts of their visual field?

Why do patients with visual disturbances or vision disorders have poor visual acuity?


(G.)

""Near vision"" means seeing near objects, in the three-dimensional space that surrounds them. For example, if they were standing"
Question: Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor: is the standard of effective analgesia reachable in all women? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Implementing epidural analgesia for labor: may the standard of effective analgesia for labor be reached?

The goal of this study was to compare the cost of epidural analgesia in the first two weeks of labor, with standard of effectiveness measures (as measured by the rate of analgesic use or the duration of use). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomised controlled trials that compared the use of epidural analgesia in the first two weeks of labor, or the standard of effectiveness measures, with other analgesic use as judged by the rate of analgesic use, including general analgesia or other general pain control measures. We contacted authors of trials that met these criteria, who were asked how many women in their studies used epidural analgesia as compared with a control (placebo), on a 0 to 2 scale. If a trial had more than 10 women in the study, the rate of control was used. If a trial did not have enough women for a 0 to 2 scale, a 0 to 3 scale was used.

This is the first Cochrane review of epidural analgesia for labor published after 9 years of activity, so we were surprised to find that many trials were still working through many years of debate about what measures should be used, and how well those measures met our goals. It was also surprising even more that most trials examined epidural analgesia as a control for pain during the second stage of labor. The consensus was that the second stage of labor begins when the uterine cavity is fully dilated and the cervix fully penetrated. In order to maximise analgesia, a very large number of women in both clinical and theoretical studies used epidural morphine for induction, followed by epidural acetaminophen on day 3. While it seemed that epidural morphine and acetaminophen in combination would be the key to optimal analgesia, only 17 trials involving 1.8 million patients in total measured pain during the second stage and did not show substantial improvement. In a later Cochrane Review, the authors concluded that 'with the exception of 2 studies, no other trials showed that either control or analgesia during the second stage of labor was more frequently performed than control.' (23) Most of the trials were conducted in European countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, where some women, especially women in low income and/or minority groups, have been found to be unable to access epidural analgesia. With the onset of Medicare spending on healthcare for new mothers, it becomes apparent that the quality of trials has fallen. We are aware of a number of trials that are clearly over-utilising available analgesia, but we were able to find only a handful of trials not meeting our definition. Therefore, there have been numerous missed opportunities to improve research.

Our results should be reassuring to those women that have used epidural analgesia, and for who the standard of effectiveness measurement is a difficult one to assess, to be completely satisfied. We do not expect that in most women, the standard of effectiveness is reached at all, but instead that epidural analgesia does provide substantial analgesia at a lower cost than the control of analgesia in combination of general analgesia, general pain control, or any pain control measures. The problem we have with the concept of 'effective analgesia' is that the quality of evidence needed to decide whether or not to use a drug of choice is often very poor. That is why it is so important to use a systematic review and meta-analysis in place of observational studies. The only difference is that observational studies can help with evaluating which measures are effective and which are not. The fact that there are so many trials that provide conflicting information between these measures of effectiveness clearly needs to be taken into account.

Some studies had a higher threshold at which pain thresholds were considered too low for analgesia to be considered 'effective'. While these trials may be valid data, their use did not necessarily mean that the cost-effectiveness of epidural analgesia cannot be assessed. It may be that higher thresholds were acceptable, as long as the threshold could be reached without taking long periods of time. However in the current context, the current method of assessing costs, based on a patient's experience of pain, also has an inherent bias in favour of an analgesic or drugs for pain control such as morphine. An important question that was discussed in a review by MacIntyre et al. (24) was whether any type of analgesia could be classified as effective because of the patient's experience or knowledge of pain. In our study, most women in the control group were able to experience pain during the first few days of their first round because of their history. However in the case of women who initially tried to discontinue analgesia or only started a partial cessation, the rate of analgesic use was higher among"

Question: Is halofantrine ototoxic? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is halofantrine ototoxic?


Answer: The clinical situation concerning the safety of a medication given to an epileptic patient is not fully known. It should be determined whether certain effects occur in patients who receive the drug. There are some reports of the use of this drug at a dose which is very low (less than 1 mg). The only difference for this drug from the traditional anticonvulsant drugs is that it affects the peripheral nervous system.


Halofantrine has been studied in a wide range of different animal and human animal models. From the animal model studies, it has been suggested that certain brain or central nervous system effects of the drug could be elicited. However, these animal studies did not explore all the possible consequences of the drug in relation to the epileptic brain, and these effects need further exploration for further clinical trials.


In general, the clinical effect of halofantrine is most likely short lived (1-5 days) which lasts until the seizure ceases. Because the halofantrine is injected into the nerve, any changes (and consequently irreversible effects) in the nervous system are less likely to be discovered than in the case of other medications. No reports of the possible long-term effects of the drug have been published. However, there are many cases of long-term epileptic activity, which could occur if the patient continues to take the drug and fails to go into a state of unconsciousness. Such cases represent a serious problem in the long term, especially in young children who are especially sensitive to the effects of halofantrine. This in turn raises concerns about possible long-term toxic reactions. The fact that there are no long-term adverse events associated with halofantrine suggests that the drug should not be prescribed to patients.


It has to be reminded that the drug is not used for epileptic activity and that it is not suitable as a treatment for seizures in children. More information about the use of this drug in different medical settings is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency."

Frozen Bones

Question: Is a frozen bone an acceptable material for the study of bones, or can it not be frozen? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Questions: Are samples of frozen marrow and bone obtained from healthy individuals really acceptable for the study of bones? Can the frozen marrow and bone be analyzed for their presence of antibodies or for their ability to signal a bone marrow disease diagnosis?

Answer: This type of study is only feasible if you include a healthy non-pregnant female subject; in all other cases, you should consider an additional source and obtain the subject to evaluate for the presence of bone marrow disease. In any case, a freeze-dried specimen should be treated with 1ml of the following anti-cancer drug (i.e., 1ml of Laminarin or Ampicillin) twice daily for 4 to 10 days (or until bone looks like a complete stump), following which a marrow culture should be obtained. The bone is subjected to a heat machine to destroy any pathogens, and after 3 weeks, the specimens of the marrow and bone were analyzed. The culture results should be presented at a meeting of orthopedic surgeons.

Question: Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma--is well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Is well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early or clinically advanced?

Answer:

The prognosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma is poor, although the average survival is 10-17 years in the United States.

The following table summarizes the prognosis:

Stage 1

Stage 2

Stage III or stage IV

Stage IV

Stage V

Stage VI

In patients treated successfully for small hepatocellular carcinoma (L5-6), the following benefits are anticipated (Note: There is no specific treatment of non-advanced liver cancers). These benefits include:

the chance of the cancer developing into liver cancer

a significantly lower need for surgical interventions (such as liver transplantation)

the chance that the cancer may be eliminated.

To be considered for early diagnosis, patients must have, at the minimum, a 10-mm (1/16"") or more tumor in the liver, a non-small cell carcinoma, and have been tested for metastatic disease (see below).

The following table summarizes the benefits of early detection, including early surgical procedures, for L5-6. The benefit for a 15-mm (1/16"") or more tumor in the liver is a 15-year survival rate of 75%.

Benefits of early detection, including:

Stage III

Stage IV

Stage V

Stage VI

The mortality rate for low-grade liver cancer is approximately 3%.

Survivors who undergo surgery for liver cancer are given an increased chance of survival if a significant portion of the tumor is removed (see below).

Surgical therapies for small hepatocellular carcinoma commonly use the following types of operations:

capping (e.g., liver flotation)

amploprostomy (e.g., abdominal aortoplasty)

open-heart surgery to increase the size of the vessel

In patients treated successfully for advanced small hepatocellular carcinoma (L6-7), there are no specific treatment options. As a result, a significant number of patients will have their liver resected and continue with chemotherapy and physical therapy.

There is no specific treatment of non-advanced liver cancers. Some early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma is accomplished with specialized imaging techniques and anesthetics. A significant number of non-advanced liver cancers develop into non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLC) without the traditional surgery. To date, these non-small cell cancers are the most resistant to aggressive therapy.

Non-aggressive treatment options for advanced liver cancers include surgery as well as surgery and radiation therapy.

The major surgical therapies for non-advanced liver cancer include:

Liver flotation

amploprostomy

open-heart surgery (e.g., aortoplasty)

prostheses (e.g., aortic stent and aortic sleeve)

surgery with an open air vein (e.g., transvalvular or open-heart surgery)

reposition

intervention (e.g., parenteral mesenteric valve)

In cancer patients with large tumors, surgery is often recommended. The most common surgical procedure done for large liver tumors is resecting of the liver (aortoplasty), and the procedure provides the greatest potential benefit for small or advanced liver cancers.

For patients who do not wish to undergo resecting, a variety of other options are available. For example, aortic stents can be used as a temporary solution for non-advanced liver cancers. Surgery-only techniques (e.g., liver resection, partial-appendix resection [PAOS], open-heart surgery) are also used with less than optimal success rates.

There is a significant amount of controversy regarding the optimal type of surgery for non-advanced liver cancer. Some studies have shown that the use of either open-heart surgery or aseptic procedures (e.g., pneumoperitoneum; aortoplasty) may result in more benefit with the potential for a much higher complication rate.

Aseptic techniques have been shown to significantly improve the outcome of non-advanced liver cancers when compared with surgical resection. One study conducted among 75 patients with advanced (L6-7) liver cancer found that those with use of two anastomosing and two bifascial techniques had a 50% reduced complication rate compared with non-specialists. In contrast, a multicentre study of 150 patients with advanced liver cancer observed that those who received pneumoperitone"
Question: Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influenced by the quality or completeness of the Papanicolaou smear? Review the evidence: a literature review (or other evidence-based review) (8) Review the literature to establish that the Papanicolaou smear remains a key clinical indication for testing for an infectious disease. (9) Review the literature for the evidence-based recommendation to screen all infected persons for HIV, pneumococcus, and hepatitis for hepatitis C RNA (HCV RNA) by a single test. There are no randomized controlled trials to support any method of HCV testing which includes RNA testing. Review the literature for the evidence-based recommendation to select HIV positive persons based on hepatitis C RNA tests alone as the sole tool for testing HIV-infected persons, with emphasis on the need for a double-blind randomized controlled trial to ensure the specificity and confidence of the HCV positive diagnosis. Review the literature for the evidence-based recommendation to recommend that all persons with a positive HCV positive test for HIV should receive a presumptive treatment plan and blood pressure medication. There are no data demonstrating any benefit from this routine method of determining HIV-positive persons for routine medical or dental treatment. There are no comparative data supporting the use of HCV-positive urine samples for determination of HIV prevalence among persons with other infectious diseases. Review the literature to establish whether an intervention or alternative can be better suited to meet the identified challenge to Papanicolaou smears in certain clinical situations. Review the evidence to determine whether testing for Hepatitis B RNA should be considered for Papanicolaou smears, considering the existing availability of available test kits and the absence of efficacy and specificity of other test technologies. These guidelines are NOT comprehensive and do not address the recommendations for Papanicolaou smear, or the recommended use of HCV-specific kits. (11)

Discussion This article is a thorough evaluation of available evidence on the use of Papanicolaou smears for the diagnosis or screening of HIV infection, and its impact on disease. Based on this evidence, it appears that the primary benefits associated with diagnostic confirmation of infection for the HIV infection can be more accurately estimated using HCV-specific test kits, while there remain limitations on the use of Papanicolaou smears in screening for other infectious diseases or routine medical or dental treatment. This evidence does not support the use of Papanicolaou smears as a diagnosis instrument other than those for HIV infection, as recommended in previous recommendations. The main advantages of testing for HIV infection with HCV-specific DNA were identified in this review. The HCV tests were effective in detecting HIV infection (i.e., testing positive) at a lower cost. The HCV-specific tests were reliable, accurate, and comparable with those used for HIV detection and detection of other infections. Moreover, the HCV types detected in the Papanicolaou smears were not known to be associated with HIV infection (i.e., different HCV RNA types were detected in the Papanicolaou smears than in HIV tests). This suggests that the HCV-specific test kits might be useful for diagnosing other infectious diseases, and a useful diagnostic assay for HIV infection (i.e., HCV RNA). However, the positive findings reported in this review also underscore the limitations of using HCV-specific tests for diagnosis of infectious diseases and as a screening tool for routine medical or dental treatment. Thus, the ability to use HCV-specific blood tests to determine whether people with HIV infection are asymptomatic and asymptomatic, as was suggested in another literature review of HIV screening and management (11), is unlikely to be supported by current evidence. With respect to the treatment of HIV infection, the current scientific evidence provides limited support for a recommendation to screen all persons with a Papanicolaou smear for HIV and HCV before recommending that anyone be treated to prevent subsequent development of infectious disease. A significant body of evidence, however, suggests that when HIV treatment is indicated, the HCV-specific test results must be considered during management of HIV infections, regardless of other therapeutic options. The available evidence also indicates that current recommendations for treating HIV infection are effective, and are reasonable at each stage along the HIV continuum between undetectable viral load and acute HIV infection. Thus, current recommendations for the initial management of positive or positive for HIV samples, which are based on a single test with a sensitivity > 97% and a specificity of > 98%, still align with recommendations for early treatment of cases of symptomatic HIV (i.e., HIV < 2000) and in managing patients of HIV-associated chronic HIV disease. The recommended management based on the sensitivity and specificity of the Papanicolaou test are as follows. For the initial management of HIV infection (i.e"
Question: Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring?

Abstract: The pollen of maize (Zea mays L.) is a well-recognized source of allergenic pollen for the domestic market. However, recent efforts to identify allergenic phenotypes are hampered by difficulties in pollen identification in other cereal crops. An understanding of the processes by which pollen proteins are derived is essential to a successful analysis of allergenic pollens. Thus, we report on the identification of an Allergy-Strain-Type (AST) of corn pollen by the use of genomic and biochemical assays in corn, and a recent attempt by plant breeders to characterize the genetics underlying allergenic traits. We show that the AST of maize pollen arises from a different genetic source from other crop allergens, and reveals some of the key regulatory processes that are required to create allergenic traits. We provide novel genetic models for AST in maize that are useful to provide an understanding of pollen production and to stimulate new research.

Abstract

Pollen from maize presents a very important source of allergens to farm machinery of all grain and grain byproducts, since it contains three-fourths to one-third of all of the pollen, when tested by the pollen allergy questionnaire. The identification of allergenic pollen by genotypic comparison with a variety of crop allergens and the determination of the alleles responsible for these reactions should significantly simplify the detection of allergenic pollen in commercial crops. However, it is well known that various methods are needed in order to identify allergenic pollen, including DNA-based, biochemical, immunological and electrophoretic assays. A key step for allergenic pollen is the formation of functional, genetic alleles as alleles are produced when pollen is processed and transported. The genetic analyses reported so far cannot determine the alleles and the genetic changes in the pollen can only be detected by a specific analytical technique. Therefore, a new approach was needed in order to identify allergenic pollen in maize, and here we report on an allerogen genotypic analysis of maize pollen using a genome-wide approach, by using the allergen detection methodology provided by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Here we report the identification of an Allergy-Strain-Type as the most sensitive and accurate method for allergen detection in maize. Our results demonstrate that the allergenic alleles in pollen are highly conserved, are closely related to the characteristics of the pollen, and that the AST of maize pollen is genetically different from all other pollen types. These results provide a platform for analyzing allergenic pollen in maize, and allow genotypic analysis of the pollen to be performed in a practical way. To this end, we are planning a comprehensive study to elucidate the molecular basis for these differences by the use of genome-wide approaches.

Introduction

Pollen is one of the most important sources of allergens to pollen-processing machinery of grain and byproducts, since it contains three to one-fourth of all the pollen, when tested by the pollen allergy questionnaire [1]. While both plant and animal allergens may present themselves as proteins, only plant allergens are regarded as allergenic. The pollen can also contain proteins from other crops, but they are considered to cause allergic respiratory symptoms [2–4]. The only plant-based allergen with sufficient evidence of its existence is corn ("
Question: Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How do people who are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the first year of life show a negative association with FDG-PET?

Background

An emerging literature suggests that an initial association of cervical cancer (CIN 2+) with a high-fat diet [1,2] is associated with adverse cervical mucosa and dysplasia. This negative association is thought to be the result of increased mucosal and interstitial tissue destruction by the cancer-producing microenvironment of the diseased cervix.

Recent studies have confirmed negative associations of CIN2+ with both hyperalgesia and cancer in a large cohort of female patients [3–7]. The study by Chard et al. [3] followed 1,054 newly diagnosed patients within the first 2 years of life. The authors reported an odds ratio of 1.45 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.01 to 2.14) for an increased likelihood of undergoing pap smear, although the magnitude of the associated risk appeared to be underestimated in some subgroups due to the relatively small sample size of their study.

Although the association between hyperalgesia and invasive cervical cancer is well established, the mechanisms regulating the pathogenesis of this malignancy are not well known. Several studies have been conducted evaluating the possible involvement of cytokines in the disease process [8–11]. In addition to the established relationship between hyperalgesia and CIN 2+ (for example, elevated serum interleukin-1 receptor antagonist concentration is associated with increased risk of CIN 2+) [12], hyperalgesia is also associated with increased intraepithelial inflammation and cellular oxidative stress. In a separate randomized trial [13], it was noted that the occurrence of CIN2+ and the development of cancer were also associated with serum levels of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that hyperalgesia-associated tumors are composed not only of tumor-specific and cytokine-associated cells but also of cells with other cytokine receptors.

Recently, the hypothesis of a ""tumor-specific"" inflammatory mediator(s) within the carcinoma microenvironment has been proposed. It is hypothesized that these cytokines may modulate the behavior of cancer cells to facilitate tumor progression through signaling pathways [14,15]. It would therefore be important to evaluate the effects of hyperalgesia-associated colorectal neoplasia on the development of these tumor-specific tumor-specific cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the purpose of the present Study, which was designed to evaluate the associations of CIN2+, anti-CTLA4 colorectal tumor virus (CTLA4) and hyperalgesia on CXCR4 tumor cell adhesion and growth in human epithelial and mesenchymal cells, was to examine whether hyperalgesia-associated CIN2+ was associated with adhesion and growth inhibition in the breast carcinoma (BCM) and cervical adenocarcinoma (CIN 2+ of women from 3–35 years of age).

Methods

Participants and Sample

Three hundred ten healthy white women aged 21–55 y were enrolled. Of these women, 90 percent were Caucasian [16]. The majority (n = 75) were from the Greater Kansas City Area (GKCA). The study was approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board and was conducted under the Institutional Review Board of the University of Missouri, Columbia. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants using the approved data use form.

Exclusion criteria and screening procedures are described in detail herein.

Cervical Cancer Screening

BCM or CIN2+ screening was performed in the first year of life. The study protocol included inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria as follows:

All participants were white; female; in the first 2 years of life; and with a family history of invasive cervical cancer.

Cavity biopsies were conducted for women with no documented evidence of carcinoma (ie, no symptoms of carcinoma or significant changes in cervical cytology).

Cervical lesions were defined as:

M1 (deep carcinoma of the cervical region) (5–7 lesion size).

M2 (6–9 lesion size).

M3 (10–14 lesion size).

M4 (15–19 lesion size).

M5 (20–32 lesion size).

M6 (33+ lesions size).

M7 (33+ lesions size).

CXCR4 Cancer

CXCR4 cancer was assessed by the use of colon, rectal, and prostate cytology screening. The screening examinations included two types of DNA probes (CT"

Question: Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably? Share your answer

Can a surgeon detect early lymphedema? Lymphedema refers to swelling in a limb, sometimes at the site of a vein or an artery, which can affect or rupture. Surgery—or the healing of a wound—often corrects the inflammation by reducing the volume of the swelling, or lymphedema.

Early lymphedema can show up on x-ray or ultrasound and can be treated. By screening for early lymphedema, a surgeon might be able to detect it early, before it's too late. Lymphedema can be diagnosed on the basis of the results of x-rays or CT scans; CTs and MRI scans do not generally show abnormal veins, but CT might show a small tumor nearby. CT scans can show a lump or mass around a vein (arterial lymphedema). X-ray images of veins have a different ""look"": They show enlarged veins, called nodules, filled with fluid, and can be difficult to differentiate from a lump in a vein. In contrast, MRI scans show a larger, more normal area on the surface of a vein (luminal lymphedema): It can show a tumor (luminal lymphedema) and other normal tissue. (An MRI scan can detect a lump that turns out larger than the vein or a tumor that grows very little.) In some cases, the surgeon might diagnose this more advanced stage via ultrasound. An advanced detection would give the surgeon an opportunity to treat the lymphedema and provide early healing.

If a surgeon detects early lymphedema, the treatment options for patients with lymphedema are clear and may range from surgery to intensive care. In all cases, you should discuss the options with your medical director. Although many patients are initially diagnosed with early lymphedema, there is some variation in prognostic factors (such as bone density) between patients. Early lymphedema can be treated or reversed if the underlying bone density is improved or the swelling is treated. However, more than 70% of patients with early lymphedema do not have any visible change on MRI or x-ray.

The treatment options for a number of patients with early lymphedema are:

Recurrent or recurrent lymphedema. Recurrent lymphedema occurs when the initial treatment did not produce improvement. This can be due to a variety of factors, including:

Age

Cancer

Curetting steroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system

Early infection

Surgery that can cause scarring

Treatment options for an individual patient vary. Some patients respond well to a combination of conventional and alternative therapies. The main differences in treatment between the types and the types of lymphedema are:

Chemotherapy. Treatment options usually include a combination of hormone therapy and surgery to remove scarring, called ""regroupment."" Treatment options include hormonal therapy and/or surgery to remove scarring, called ""regroupment."" Because of the need for surgical procedures, treatment for most cases is recommended for adults. An increasing number of pediatric patients also receive treatment with chemotherapy.

Surgery. Surgery is the most common treatment option for early lymphedema. Some patients can manage lymphedema by surgery in the setting of a local clinic or a community health center, or by managing the swelling with a skin taping method such as lymphedema tape (sclerotherapy). In some situations, though, local lymphedema management is recommended for patients with severe lymphedema.

Treatment options involve surgery. Many patients who have lymphedema respond well to surgery (usually, the patients can live with residual symptoms after surgery). Even when lymphedema is fully present and remitters have been treated and removed from the body, lymphedema is an insidious condition that requires surgical removal if present. For patients with early lymphedema, there may not be any identifiable lesion to remove surgery is a recommended alternative to other options for immediate retreatment.

An example of the treatment in which early lymphedema can be more easily managed is treatment by chemotherapy, which often removes the tumor in the neck/brachial area of the cancer. A number of patients may also respond to treatment with a combination of local and systemic chemotherapy."

Question: Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality?

Answer: Yes, I agree that this could be a consequence. A more nuanced explanation is that the person was tracking a moving object, and so it is possible to imagine how their mind would change a few degrees (if they moved so quickly at the onset that they could see at the end the second event that triggered the tracking) - perhaps because they were already tracking the motion. That doesn't explain why they saw the second event. In my opinion, we don't really have much of a clue and are missing a powerful, common mechanism by which motion perception might be compromised. I am also interested in learning more about the mechanism of motion perception in schizophrenia to understand this difference.

Q: Is the hypothesis that schizophrenia produces a deficit in eye movements valid? The theory of ""attraction to the eye"" has been explored and proposed in schizophrenia.

A good example of a theory of attraction to the eye can be found in the work of Burch (1996, 1998) who investigated movement perception. He demonstrated that when persons with schizophrenia display increased attention to the eyes and a decreased ability to move the entire body, these results are not random. These differences are not due to a lack of attention to the moving object but are the result of significant perceptual impairment, which is a consequence of illness.

Question: It's Fournier's gangrene still dangerous? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the relationship of an infection causing a gangrenous amputation and a patient with Fournier's gangrene?

Answer: We can't test a hypothesis until we have a theory that explains what happened in order to understand what's going on. We don't know enough about the relationship of this infection to how severe this amputation actually is, and that is what you're attempting to test here. As in all research on the topic, we need to wait for a theory that explains what actually happened, which is why this needs to be done in a controlled, high-quality trial, and not just in the back of a science journal. It's certainly not realistic to expect a new drug to be FDA-approved in a quarter of a century with no trial.

What we do know now is that amputation results in long-lasting inflammation of the underlying tissue caused by the destruction of nerve fibers and proteins. It also changes a patient's immune response and how effectively it kills healthy cells, possibly affecting metabolism (e.g., the process of breakdown of fat) and preventing the production of new blood cells. It is not clear if all patients with Fournier's gangrene experience widespread inflammation with widespread blood loss, or whether some individuals experience less severe inflammation and blood loss and some individuals have much less inflammation but still experience widespread blood loss.

Therefore, it is not possible to make conclusions about any individual's chances of survival without a controlled clinical trial. The FDA has made decisions to take one for the team when making drug approvals and this will no doubt be the case for this drug, although I'm willing to bet that the patients and families who are most at risk for this procedure, which is why they need to be studied in a controlled high quality trial, have the weakest immune response to the infection, and are more likely to suffer serious complications.

One group of patients, the patients who have already received surgery or are undergoing surgery, is unlikely to benefit at all from the drug; the other will lose significant limb function. The most likely outcome, we see all the time in science, is that you get the drug to work but at the cost of another patient suffering. In those patients who have suffered the most severe side effects, we see that these patients will have the highest risk of relapse and may not survive the first year of treatment. In general, the patients who have received surgery are generally protected as long as they have recovered sufficiently for treatment to work. After the treatment, however, these patients recover too quickly and may relapse. In those patients who have not received surgery yet, we see that those patients who suffered the most severe complications tend to receive fewer drugs than those who had more severe complications and are thus likely to experience no benefits and possibly some mortality. Patients who have suffered fewer complications than patients who had more severe complications and have not yet had the surgery might receive an inferior drug, but even on the best case scenario, they will still suffer long-term morbidity and mortality.

We know that Fournier's gangrene can easily be reversed if the pain is treated, although one wonders whether or not doctors would treat it as a chronic infection. In any case, as Fournier's gangrene does not respond well to conventional antibiotics, this drug, which has no known side effects beyond infection, may not be the best solution for patients in the long term, at least not at this point.

We can speculate about how the drug could be more widely used, or by what mechanism the drug could be more widely used. It is possible that surgeons may have an incentive to promote this type of procedure and to promote the disease. A new drug could be marketed over and over again, which might not be very cost-effective, but it would not matter; by the time this drug is discovered and used, the drug will have already been found and licensed and there may be a big market for this specific type of drug, so it is still likely to be used. In fact, the FDA recently approved a new antibiotic, ceftriaxone, for the treatment of the bacterial bloodstream in critically ill patients, but the drug does not appear to offer any significant advantage over a placebo. The drug is an effective drug, but it has not yet been used widely in the United States. In Europe it is already used widely (although we have no data yet to support it), but there is no clinical evidence that it is superior to standard antibiotic therapy. Thus, I can only speculate on what would be a better way for this drug to be more widely used. In short, we can't predict that this new drug would offer any benefit. It is very difficult to predict the future, and this is definitely not a perfect example.

However, even the most optimistic scenario for Fournier's gangrene is still a tragedy. What happens in the future? Patients treated for a"
Question: Is it appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is the need for organ transplants decreasing in advanced age? Answer: It depends on many reasons including decreasing incidence of death. In many cases, older individuals live much longer than they used to because they live longer lives with better nutrition and fewer medical conditions. The increase of life expectancy in elderly people is a well-known statistic even though, so far, there has been no reliable scientific data on it.


If, however, the question has been adequately answered, no transplant could be considered unsafe. Although the organs of elderly patients have become increasingly rare, they are still a very strong source of human protein, the fuel of the body and even the raw material for a variety of medical products (such as clotting clotting). Therefore, even in cases when organ transplants are impossible, it is possible to obtain sufficient protein from patients to sustain the elderly. The only exception is the use of human tissue extracted from dying relatives. This is possible because, among other reasons, the body is unable to extract adequate protein from older relatives within the first months of their death, thus forcing them to be used for the body of the patient.

Question: Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Is it always necessary? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is it always necessary? What is the minimum interval between angioplasty and carotid embolization? What are the recommendations for carotid artery stenosis in the absence of known cause?

What is the status of carotid artery stenosis after coronary artery bypass surgery? (What are the current reports and what are the implications for future improvement)? Answer: What are the current reports and what are the implications for future improvement? When are complications commonly seen after coronary artery bypass surgery? (What is the current view about this condition) The current review summarizes the findings from 7 clinical trials involving patients with carotid artery damage. It was concluded that: there was a statistically significant relationship between coronary artery surgery and complications in the short term after this procedure that depended on how long the surgery was given and on who was being treated. At the least, these reports suggest that there is a reasonable need for further prospective studies that assess the effect of coronary artery bypass surgery on the course and outcome of post-surgery complications. The most important factors that should be considered when designing future studies to assess the effects of the treatment of these patients and of any complications that have arisen are the size and population of the patients under study and, if possible, the patient population and treatment.

Is it always necessary to take angioplasty immediately after coronary atherosclerosis (blockage of carotid arteries)?

Answer: There is no good evidence to support the need for carotid artery bypass surgery immediately after coronary artery disease has been resolved."

Key words: Direct mesocolon invasion, mesocorticolon and colorectal cancer, mesocervical cancer.

INTRODUCTION Mesocervical cancer is the second most common form of cancer in North America and the world.1 The annual reported incidence of colorectal cancer is approximately 8500 deaths in the United States alone, making it the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide.2 More specifically, colorectal cancer accounted for 2.9% of all deaths in men and 6.0% for women in the United States in 2012.3 The prevalence of colorectal cancer in the US population has grown 2-fold, from 5.6% in 1980 to 11.6% in 2007, with the largest increase occuring during the last 30 years.2 The risk of death from cancer in the United States is highest for low-risk, low-reproductive-age individuals (ages 25-49 years)4 and there is a high prevalence of ulcerative colitis and active mucosal colonization.5,6 Patients with higher body-mass index have a higher risk of colorectal cancer, particularly gastric carcinomas.7-9 In contrast, more women have colorectal cancer and higher risk factors are not entirely explained by age. These factors include: lower body-mass indexes between the ages of 25 and 34, 10 higher intake of fat (body mass index [BMI] greater than 23), higher intake of red meat and processed meat,11-12 and smoking.13,14

DURATION AND EXPECTATION OF DIAGNOSIS In recent years, there has been a change in the definition of cancer, allowing for the use of multiple colorectal adenomas as markers of colorectal cancer.15 Currently, this class of tumor also includes mesocervical carcinomas, with their characteristic appearance of a thin, wavy, or folded skin covering the entire colon.16 According to a recent American Society for Colorectal Pathology report, between 2000 and 2009, the population of adult patients who undergo colonoscopy underwent an average of seven new cancers in the large bowel and fewer than 200 new cases of adenomatous polyposis in the rectum, an estimated rate of 5 cases per 1000 adult patients in the US.6,17,18 Therefore, the current definition provides the best data on the population of patients at risk (the most aggressive stages of cancer in healthy adults). A recent meta-analysis found that if a patient has more than 10 new adenoma in the colon, or if one or both of his or her adenoma and colonic lesions are classified as adenomatous polyposis, the probability of colon cancer is increased by 20-fold.5 The current definition provides an objective way to categorize colorectal cancer lesions that are difficult to do otherwise by classifying each adenoma in the colon and colonic lesions and comparing the rates of recurrence of colon cancer.19 This system is not as complicated as the traditional concept of ""colon-related cancer"" (CRCC) where the most common lesions are considered more or less ""cancer in all organs and systems,"" but is also more informative because it may be easier to use to help classify patients with more difficult to classify colorectal lesions. For example, if a patient has an adenoma in two of the large bowel, the risk of developing colorectal cancer is 20-fold higher, based on the current definition of adenomatous polyposis. Because the only way to find and"

The Research Paper was written by Dr. Matthew Johnson, Director of the Center for Clinical Investigation, Department of Radiology, University of Georgia, DeKalb, Georgia 31075, USA, and Dr. Timothy L. Wiesner, Professor of Radiology, Department of Radiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27695, USA. The first author submitted the manuscript at the request of Dr. Johnson for the purpose of being published online for other researchers to review, and for publication of the article in the Journal of The American Medical Association.

Introduction Heterotic tachyarrhythmias are rare (1–3). In most cases, heterotopic tachyarrhythmias are associated with the occurrence of symptomatic aortic stenosis. Heterotopic Ossification (HO) is a benign but frequently serious condition (4). HO may cause aortic stenosis, aortic aneurysm, and even aortic dissection (5,6). HO is often associated with heart failure and often requires complex management by cardiologists, cardiologists of postgraduate residency training, pulmonary medicine residents, aortic surgeons, pulmonary otolaryngologists, physicians specializing in chronic renal disease, and surgeons involved in cardiac surgery. Most frequently, HO is related to pulmonary arteritis or pulmonary hypertension (7–9). In addition, there is a small increased incidence of thromboembolic syndromes, in particular, ischemic stroke (10–12). A number of clinical and preclinical investigations implicate HO in a variety of heart conditions, including ischemic stroke and acute coronary syndromes (13,14). However, while several cases of HO-mediated thrombophlebitis have been described, it has been difficult to identify and distinguish other conditions with HO in the literature.

In the light of the increasing presence of such conditions in the general population (15,16), and the growing interest expressed for the prevention and treatment of HO in both general and heart-related (i.e., acute coronary syndromes, stroke and ischemic stroke), a search for existing studies was conducted. Previous literature regarding the association between HO and heart diseases has been sparse and the available information mainly derived from the field of laboratory cardiology (2). In particular, there have been few studies regarding the association of HO with coronary artery disease (CAD) or stroke in general. The purpose of this study was to provide preclinical information on the association between HO and CAD/stroke, including ischemic stroke in the context of the clinical management of this condition.

Materials and Methods Study Subjects The study was a prospective observational study of subjects who had undergone a first heart evaluation under admission from a tertiary referral center and met criteria of mild or moderate CAD. The subjects were randomized with a 2:1 ratio to receive either vitamin A 3 ·4 ·6 or placebo and were told they had received vitamin supplementation during a period of up to 5 months, a period of as long as 2 years, to ensure adequate vitamin status. All subjects had their blood drawn at the beginning of the study at baseline and were followed until the end of follow-up 4 years later. All subjects were told they were receiving vitamin A 1 % and the study was approved by the local ethical committee. Study Design During an initial screening period, the study subject was randomly assigned to receive a placebo, vitamin A 3 ·4 ·6, or a combination of A 3 ·4 ·6. Because of this, data from our participants were not adjusted to remove individuals who were enrolled in more than one study or who already knew the study assignment. The sample size from the 3 vitamin study arms was calculated to detect a 1% difference between vitamin A 3 ·4 ·6 and placebo in the risk of CVD. In addition, the inclusion of a vitamin A 3 ·"
Question: Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke?

Answer: No clear benefits for stroke management occurred in the majority of studies compared with traditional preventive interventions.

The most robust, long-term, and consistently effective treatment for patients with recurrent stroke is lifestyle modifications, including caloric restriction, exercise, and pharmacologic treatment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with or without medication. This review highlights the need for additional trials to more thoroughly assess the effects of these lifestyle and pharmacologic changes on stroke outcomes and evaluate appropriate strategies for enhancing stroke management at the patient's stage of recovery.

1.1 Case report

Treatment of symptomatic patients with a symptomatic stroke in a setting requiring intensive care was reported in three prospective, randomized, controlled trials.1,2 Patients in the 1:1 ratio of statin to placebo had fewer symptomatic and medically equivalent strokes, including ischemic strokes; fewer relapses (symptomatic and otherwise); and fewer deaths. However, overall stroke mortality remained unchanged; patients with stroke on statins had significantly higher risk of death compared with people on placebo.

1.2 Case series

A retrospective cohort study of 4,972 patients with an acute acute ischemic stroke performed at an academic center reported overall hospital and outpatient mortality was similar when statin and placebo patients were compared.3 Patients on statin had reduced total mortality by 27%, whereas those who were on placebo had reduced total mortality by 31%. Mortality from an undetermined cause (nonfatal ischemic events) was increased in statin patients (18%), compared with placebo patients (13%) and was significantly lower in statin patients aged 65 years or older (5% [n=5]) compared with controls (13% [n=10]).4

1.3 Case study

A retrospective study found no significant difference in total and specific causes of death between patients treated with low-dose aspirin and those treated with low-dose statin.5

Conclusions

There are no major differences in clinical outcomes of patients treated with statins or placebo in patients with symptomatic stroke compared with those treated with traditional therapy. However, there remains a need for more trials examining the specific clinical outcomes of patients with stroke treated with statins versus those with stroke treated with conventional therapy.

1.4 Case control

In a review, T.W. Riesenhuber, MD, and colleagues examined 10 placebo-controlled trials of low-dose aspirin and three of the studies that included statin patients. They reported that no changes in total stroke mortality, ischemic stroke, or death, but a trend toward increased total stroke mortality during a period of 2 years after the initiation of aspirin therapy and the cessation of statin therapy. These results indicate that statins may prevent stroke, but they need to be confirmed in further trials.

1.5 Safety

In a series of six studies involving 36,000 subjects, the risk of clinically important nonfatal stroke was not increased with statins.6,7 The risk of a cardiac event occurring was not increased. In a study involving 19,000 patients, patients given statins had slightly increased cardiovascular events.

In one study of approximately 36,000 consecutive male patients with recurrent stroke, it has been shown that the mean stroke time was similar in the two groups but stroke volume was significantly shorter in the statin group.8

1.6 Discussion

This systematic review presents information on the clinical effectiveness of statins for prevention and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in well-controlled randomized intervention trials. This evidence indicates a lack of clinical benefit for stroke prevention, but the best outcome could be attributed to treatment with low-dose aspirin, and this benefit is somewhat greater than for placebo.

The results of this systematic review do not exclude the possibility that there are alternative mechanisms by which aspirin may be effective for prevention and treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Patients may be more likely to respond to aspirin when their underlying cardiac status is adequate.

A randomized controlled trial comparing the combined statin vs placebo arm for the prevention and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in well-controlled clinical trials would be appropriate in order to determine whether statins have a more favorable effect than placebo when used in combination with traditional therapy.

For statin or placebo patients, outcomes were similar at 1, 2, and 4 years, with an increased mortality and less severe stroke. However, in a recent large observational cohort study of 20,000 patients, incidence of death was similar between statin and placebo patients.9

1.7 Clinical implications

Although there is no evidence in the literature to suggest that statins are safer than placebo for prevention or treatment of acute ischemic stroke, this finding does not support a null hypothesis for statins.

Applied Psychology, University of Washington In 2004 to 2005, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology conducted an in-depth study of all pregnant and pregnant women attending an obstetrician/gynecologist clinic. Our goal was to determine the ability of pregnant and pregnant women to process information, to make decisions, and to achieve goals they intended. We used a randomized controlled trial design (RCT), in which participants had a total of 14 weeks of information and presentation experiences in a laboratory. Participants received brief information sheets containing a list of topics and links to more information. The information sheets were presented in three groups: information group (n=8), a control group (n=9), and an intervention group (n=10). As in the RCT, mothers in the intervention and control groups were told that there were 4 different possible outcomes for each outcome, presented with an array of relevant information and outcomes, and were then instructed to consider all of the information that came up in the discussion section, including the pregnancy outcome and any other relevant information. We measured information learning, as measures of whether mothers knew and remembered what content had been presented during their information experience. We also measured the potential influence of the information experience on women's subsequent decisions to deliver their child through a factor analysis of the decision-making process. In the current study, we examined the potential influence of delivery information on women's subsequent decision-making and also measured women's memory of information presented. We also examined the effects of the interventions on women's subsequent decision-making.

Introduction

In 2004 the American College of Obstetrics and gynecologists surveyed all women seeking maternity care at an obstetrician/gynecologist clinic and found that approximately 15% of women (n=941) had been in a vaginal birth after cesarean section since delivery.1 In their RCT in which we studied information processing and decision-making, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that mothers in the information group demonstrated greater than expected memory retention and improved memory for information presentation while providing instructions. 2

In this study, we examined whether information presentation influenced the decision to offer or receive an antenatal care intervention, as well as whether mothers remembered and then successfully incorporated content from subsequent information packages during the intervention. We hypothesized that women in the information group would be better able to remember the content in the information sheets they received (in this case, information about pregnancy) and would be able to process that information during information experience. For the intervention group, we measured the participants' decision-making ability, which would reflect women's ability to use their information experience to make informed decisions.

Methods

Sample

We recruited pregnant and pregnant women receiving obstetric care at a midwest midwifery clinic and a medical teaching hospital for a 16 week study. The data were obtained from a comprehensive survey that included demographic data and medical histories. The response rates of our survey panel were 88%. Of the 835 women who completed the survey, 818 were pregnant at the time of the survey and 907 were pregnant during a recent birth. One woman (10%) did not respond to the survey and one woman had a pregnancy terminated. A total of 730 women attended 1 of 4 sessions.

Information Materials

Information about fetal death and birth outcomes and information about the intervention were presented. Each information sheet was written by a licensed clinician with the full cooperation and knowledge of the mothers. We collected the list of topics by describing what the women had been presented with in the intervention groups. The information sheets were arranged on three pages with the following information grouped into three rows:

A list of topics. This topic was used for all presentation material and related information.

Information about pregnancy outcomes. This topic was used for pregnancy outcomes described in the interventions.

Information about the intervention. This topic covered the full text of the interventions.

Each row provided links to additional information.

Introduction: A case of fracture of the fifth tibia for which there is no reported clinical evidence of a traumatic cause.

Case:

A 41 year-old female patient with a total of 14 months' history of fractures of her right tibia and left fibula. The diagnosis of fracture was a result of bone scanning in the previous 3 months. The patient had an MRI examination 1 week after the fracture and a computed tomography evaluation 2 weeks after the fracture, but no further follow-up MRI was performed. The bone thickness was not measured during the first 3 months.

Results:

The clinical evidence of no evidence of trauma was established upon radiographic examination. The patient was unresponsive for 9 hours. No blood test was performed for acute MI. Further bone assessment was not performed until a day or two after the first intervention, after the patient was no longer in the hospital.

Discussion:

In this report, we consider the case to be of a typical spontaneous fracture of the right fifth metacarpal on x-ray examination in the context of a bilateral high-energy penetrating fracture due to a penetrating skull fracture. The injury was noted to have been caused by a projectile penetrating the upper vertebrae from below that had punctured the brain within a 30° angle of attack. The fracture pattern in this case differs from that usually encountered in other patient–case reports of high-energy x-ray penetrating head fractures.

Recommendations:

1. Care should be taken when performing the x-ray of children with a history of a traumatic head injury to ensure that there were no fractures of less than 25 g, with any fracture having an angle of attack greater than 30°. 2. Care should be taken when performing the MRI on any patient with a history of a penetrating cervical fracture, as there may be a fracture of the second cervical spine and subsequent intracranial hemorrhage.

Introduction. High-energy penetrating head fractures of the skull in children are rare events.1–3 The number of reports and the type of fracture indicate that the diagnosis is a rarity.5,6 Most fractures are fractures to the 5th, 6th, and 7th cervical vertebrae.5,6,7 This fracture occurs in children less than 0.9 years of age, and fractures of the 10th, 11th, and 12th cervical vertebrae are rarer in pediatric practice.4,2,3,6

Case: A 19 year-old male patient presented presenting with 4 fractures to his right upper arm, including a fracture to his left l3 shoulder, 2 fractured ribs, and one broken femur. The fracture was diagnosed by a neurosurgeon who did a magnetic resonance imaging of the patient's arm only but failed to detect a brain injury. An MRI examination of both sides revealed that the right arm had three separate fractures. A total of 18 hours of prophylactic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and 2 hours of corticosteroids were required with no subsequent neurological damage. The next visit, the patient received one injection of 0.9 mg of prednisolone, and 4 months of aspirin for skin and soft tissue infections were given but not observed to be beneficial. No neurosurgical intervention was required during the previous 4 weeks. No brain bleeding was evident.

Results: A total of 6 months elapsed on the treatment of this patient. There is a high incidence of non-surgical management of fracture injuries.5,6,7 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed and may often lead to osteoarthritis. This case suggests the importance of the use of NSAIDs to prevent brain and soft tissue infections as well as secondary trauma. The patient went on to have a bone scan in January of 2006 as a result of which a small fracture and a single skull fracture to his l3 shoulder were recognized. The patient's MRI showed no obvious lesion on the bone, which is an important finding as it is often assumed that an incision can be made in the skull to make a small laceration. The patient experienced a return of consciousness"

Question: Does immediate breast reconstruction compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does immediate breast reconstruction compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy?

Introduction:

The decision to perform breast reconstruction requires a thorough evaluation of individual risk factors. However, there is no well-established risk-benefit ratio for women undergoing breast reconstruction. The consensus for breast reconstruction remains: ""breast reconstruction is not without risk, and there are substantial benefits and risks that need to be considered.""1

Several studies have assessed the long-term outcome of breast reconstruction. Breast reconstruction may be performed from the surgical standpoint, during the initial postpartum period; however, it is thought that breast augmentation with a larger diameter is better suited for many patients with advanced breast cancer when performing reconstruction.2–5

There are also two case-control studies that are pertinent to the discussion of breast reconstruction. Two such studies have been published that examine the long-term clinical outcomes after breast reconstruction. In the first, 3,715 women were followed for a median of 10 years from the start of the initial surgical program until the end of the follow-up. Of those women with an initial breast reduction of 8 cm or less, 92% underwent breast reconstruction. The second study examined 19,521 women with a primary or metastatic breast cancer from the beginning of a randomized clinical trial of open laparotomy for breast reconstruction. Among the 13,935 women randomized, 17% of those with an initial breast reduction of less than 2 cm or who were treated for metastatic breast cancer and were followed for less than 13 years underwent breast reconstruction.6 The majority of those women, 9% of whom underwent breast reconstruction and had no subsequent recurrence, also received adjuvant chemotherapy ( ). The number of women with recurrence was 4% at the 5-year follow-up and 13.5% after the 10-year follow-up.6

Many of the women who underwent breast reconstruction received adjuvant chemotherapy, which can be a difficult decision. For some, breast reconstruction is one of many treatment options for the same underlying condition. Breast reconstruction is also an extremely complex and lengthy procedure that includes the removal of normal tissue, the placement of an additional mammary gland, invasive surgery, implantation of a new breast, reconstruction, reconstruction and subsequent surgery. A complete description of the actual procedure and management of the woman involves a great number of steps, and several different providers will be required to accomplish it properly. If any of these complications need to be addressed, the decision on whether to proceed with reconstruction is always made on the basis of breast preservation. The rationale for breast reconstruction is based on the belief that a reduction in size will improve the survival of the breast. A 2-cm increase will extend survival by about 7%. Breast reconstruction may occur after a radical mastectomy (i.e., removal of breast tissue without surgery).7 Breast reconstruction is associated with a number of additional complications, including endometrial cancer that might not have been detected or treated if the entire breast had been used as a site of cancer until the surgery.8–14 The cost, risk, and inconvenience of breast reconstruction outweigh any advantage of the result.

The safety of breast reconstruction has received renewed attention recently because of the finding that the incidence of postoperative morbidity and mortality has increased.15–20 A number of studies examined the risks of surgery for breast reconstruction. These findings have led to recommendations for improved patient selection, as well as guidelines for management of risks of reconstruction.21–23 The benefits of breast reconstruction include improved survival and, on the other hand, increased risk of disease recurrence postoperative, especially among patients with advanced disease.24 The increased incidence of recurrent breast cancer in patients who have undergone reconstruction also has implications regarding the long-term benefit of reconstruction. Thus, a risk is not directly proportional to the surgical outcome.

The question of how late, whether before or during the preop period, to begin breast reconstruction has not been previously addressed. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the surgical procedure should be delayed until the 2–4-month period has passed after the initial postop period. The purpose of the study was not to determine whether delaying breast reconstruction is necessarily advantageous to the patient. An early surgical operation also increases the risks of complications, particularly postoperative thrombosis and infection,5 and pre-operative care should be considered, particularly in patients where the delay may increase the risk of relapse.

Methods:

Data was from two prospective studies, one of which was a randomized clinical trial and the other a case-control study. The randomized clinical trial randomized 23,715 women (mean age of 56 years; mean number of years since last mammogram) who had undergone full mastectomy to surgical reconstruction of their breasts. The analysis of the trial consisted of 4,200 eligible subjects, with a mean follow-up of 19.8 years. The case-"
Question: Human papillomavirus and pterygium. Is the virus a risk factor? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," In the U.S., should HPV vaccination be delayed, or should HPV vaccination be recommended?

Answer: Human Papillomavirus can damage normal organs, and many cancers can start with infection with HPV, such as genital warts, anal cancer or cervical cancer.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an infection that can live in the mouth and the genital area. An estimated 17 million people in the U.S. are infected each year. But, just being infected does not make you sick—just a few days after symptoms appear you can have a normal Pap test (a biopsy) showing the presence of HPV-infected cells in your body.

HPV infections can be found in many different places. Most HPV infections are caused by two viruses, HPV-6 and HPV-11. Both are found in the male genital area.

This is probably why HPV vaccination rates are climbing—some people find the virus doesn't hurt or cause them anything for a long time after their first exposure to it. If you have been vaccinated at the age of 11 or 15 months, check your vaccinations and follow CDC's HPV vaccines recommendations. You may want to look at a recent study about whether vaccines that boost your immunity to genital warts could hurt, or be able to prevent, genital warts.

How does HPV spread?

The bacteria that cause genital warts are not able to travel long distances, and many of them can get into the lungs, so they can easily spread to someone who is already infected. The bacteria are also able to get to the brain from the cervical area, and so far more people have got HPV in each of these locations. For some reasons, however, some types of HPV can become airborne (they can travel long distances without having to break the surface of the air they get in).

How can you prevent HPV?

In this country, you can get HPV from other sexual contact or kissing and from an oral sex partner. The HPV virus has an immune response, so it can make itself infectious just by making contact with the virus that's causing the warts it likes. So as long as you are living in countries where you're at risk of getting HPV, there's a good chance your sexual partner will have HPV. Also, any other time you're kissing and/or having sex with a stranger you should talk to your partner about all your health risks, and take any precautions as necessary.

How are cervical screening tests used to monitor people for cervical cancer?

Cervical cancer screening tests help get cervical cancer in people who are very likely to have it (high-risk), but it doesn't work for everyone at all. The cervical cancer screening tests include Pap smears. Pap smears are a physical exam that looks for cervical infection caused by HPV. A Pap smear is done by inserting a tiny finger or needle under your cervix with the goal of finding and removing the cells that would be spread by the HPV cells from your vagina onto the cervix. It's done at a doctor's office or at a clinic and is free and available in most public health or insurance centers.

When do you start seeing improvement in symptoms and looking a little more normal? After you have taken the HPV vaccine, you may notice improvement in your symptoms within 6 to 12 months. The vaccine is important for all people at risk of HPV infections, but there are also people who are still at risk, but may not need vaccine because they don't yet have signs and symptoms. These include:

Women who have never started a family

People who have an infection for the first time, whether it's just one time or a few times

People with symptoms that were present before they started HPV vaccinations

People who were injected with HPV-containing vaccines such as Gardasil

People who have been exposed to HPV-containing vaccines at a medical facility.

You should see your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you don't have improvement in the symptoms, or if your symptoms are severe.

What should you do if you think you might have cervical cancer?

If you or your partner:

Are 17 or older

Are a U.S. or Canadian citizen and

Are being tested for cervical cancer with a Pap smear at a doctor's office or a clinic, including people who are not at high risk for cancer, including: a woman who is pregnant or is sexually active (including after starting a family or having more than one child) people with a history of cervical cancer or someone with a family history of cancer

are looking a little bit sick

are not sure if what they saw was really cancer, or they have doubts

are having other symptoms

Question: Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

""PRISM is an example of a broad system of surveillance based on the collection and analysis of large amounts of metadata with insufficient human review.""

Source: American Civil Liberties Union

Problems with the System that PRISM Operates On In order to work, the collection of metadata requires the NSA to have access to a large amount of Americans' emails and phone call logs. If the NSA cannot access or store the metadata within the US, it is difficult to use PRISM.

Moreover, the NSA is very aware that the emails and calls of many Americans do not meet its standards for NSA surveillance, so the agency often ignores these accounts without explanation. The agency has even acknowledged failing to produce relevant records at some times in the past. In January, the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted in a public hearing that the NSA ""had a number of shortfalls in its handling of telephone metadata."" The Director of National Intelligence recently acknowledged that ""not a single major terrorist incident during my time as Director has been prevented with this authorization,"" but he said ""there are ways it can improve.""

This leads us to the question: How do the NSA and FBI justify their actions?

In general, the agencies have said that they need the data to combat terrorism, but that justification is not entirely convincing. In January, a former NSA employee, William Binney, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the metadata collection program was not used to help in counterterrorism efforts because the NSA and FBI did not need the info for their own investigations.

Another reason that the metadata ""collection,"" as the NSA and FBI describe it, is not used is that the National Security Agency does not have the ability to keep detailed records about every single communications it is collecting. That is why they use the metadata as something of ""anonymity collateral"" at the company where most of the data, storing only the names of the recipients and the times and dates of their contact.

Other NSA employees have stated in interviews that they have heard no debate about the legality of the PRISM collection, which is supposed to come with the approval of a warrant. A whistleblower in October 2014 stated that the NSA is legally authorized to collect phone metadata even though the agency has not received a FISA warrant.

Given that, the agency's claims of needing to collect the metadata are certainly less convincing.

In a speech at an intelligence ceremony in December, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated that the NSA is ""using its unique position in this arena to collect in bulk all communications of all people within the United States.""

Clapper acknowledged that some metadata has information about Americans, but he said ""in the vast majority of cases"" it is irrelevant. Clapper also acknowledged that the program is not used for national security, but rather to collect intelligence (emphasis his).

Is it surprising that the surveillance system is so deeply flawed?

A study done in 2005 by the Boston University School of Law notes that:

The majority of the data obtained through this program is in fact not foreign intelligence information but is the private telephone records of Americans that are collected under a section of the Patriot Act that has never been reviewed or tested in an open adversarial legal proceeding. The Supreme Court has indicated that a judge may not grant summary judgment in an illegal search and seizure case under the Patriot Act unless the probable cause standard is met.

For many Americans, ""privacy on internet communications has become part and parcel of our daily life,"" including when using social media online. For many Americans, ""privacy on internet communications has become part and parcel of our daily life,"" including when using social media online.

The issue of private information about the communications of millions of people is clearly of great concern to Americans. A majority of all Americans believe that the NSA program is unconstitutional.

But this does not mean America has abandoned its commitment to privacy and security. We certainly are not back to the days when private information was widely freely shared on the internet.

Privacy of communications and emails online has long been a part of our everyday life, but it has been a part of that life more in the way that we have shared it, than that we have received it or kept it.

""The bulk collection program is the first major new effort to use the Patriot Act as the basis for mass domestic surveillance that has not been subject to the court-approved procedures that the FISA Court regularly enforces, the most important oversight mechanism for any surveillance program."" — Bill Keller, Washington Post reporter

So should we be surprised that the NSA, FBI, and other agencies are not following its procedures for conducting surveillance like it did for years to gather metadata about phone calls, social media posts, the content of emails, and the content of calls to and from friends or family members?

If privacy becomes a luxury of the few we will no longer be a"

Question: Autoerotic asphyxiation: secret pleasure--lethal outcome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can you make me squirm? Your answers to this question are written in the form of a computer program. It can do whatever it sees fit to do. The computer program will look at your hand and take care of the rest and will never leave you to the mercy of other people's cruel whims. The computer will never show pity nor empathy for your plight, because your mind, like everyone else's, is made up of two different forms of thinking: 1. thinking about thinking. 2. thinking about'me.' By typing the correct answers into the computer, you will be able to see how your mind works, especially when it is made up of a mix of the two thoughts. The results of your thoughts will be used to form a computer system that can answer any question in the world that you ever have about this process that is just a tool to help you do what you want. The software will be so good that you will find it as easy to use as breathing, writing, or driving. The program will also help you remember things that you have learned and will assist your thinking with other computer programs that help you keep up--like 'bored' or 'hungry.' It won't always be possible to get what you want, but it will always be one of your options whenever you are feeling frustrated. You will learn from the program that if you are being cruel to yourself like this by turning off your thoughts, that you will inevitably lose interest in whatever it is that you are trying to do and lose interest from yourself as a person for the rest of your life. You will also learn how to see the 'true you' that you are and how that should be a source of strength for the rest of your life, even if it brings a lot of pain in the short term. But even those of you who have been cruel to themselves can see that this kind of thinking is a bad thing. It can distract us from other human interests. Remember that your thoughts and your emotions are two different tools--they are the same only in reverse--that if you let them dominate your mind and become dominant, you will be controlling yourself for the rest of your life, which means the rest of your life is nothing more than a series of unhappy situations that you can just 'let go' of. To make it more concrete, imagine that every one of your five senses is an electric button that a computer has programmed to be on and off. When you let these five buttons to run the other way, you will feel a slight tremor in your brain, and you will be unable to continue. The computer will know a little problem when it sees one, but it won't know what the problem is. Instead, it will try to do a good job of matching the output of its input system with what it sees and sounds like on some level, like when it sees an emotion or a kind of feeling. It does this by 'playing' the part of you that feels the emotion or feeling in various ways in real time, just like you do it on your computer so you can keep your mind focused on what needs to be done. But because of this, any time you allow the five buttons to do that, it will cause you to feel some sort of emotional pain or a lack of control. There is no substitute for having a good understanding of how to deal with these two different parts of you and then using both the input and output systems in the right way to make the computer do a good job. If there is a problem with the output system, the program will alert you to the problem. If there is a problem with the input system, you will be able to use your input systems'safely' in all ways, whether it is for things that are actually'really true' or for thoughts that are being held in the same way that you used to when you were a child. Some of the best ways to help people out of problems in mind and body by letting your mind run is to do the things you did when you were growing up. The computer should never 'get in the way' of your thoughts--you will feel its presence if it knows that you are capable of using it to a certain degree. Try and work out that some thought is really true and that you actually do believe the truth, for the computer is not going to question the truth when it is in control. Instead, it is going to use your thoughts and the computer's input to try and make things into the truth when they might really be something completely opposite-of that, but that your mind has been programmed to operate a certain way. You will also need to try and get the computer to have your greatest fear and happiness on the same page, for the computer is just like your old 'body' when it understands how you live, thinking your brain and your body have certain roles to perform in the big picture.

Question: Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method?

Answer: Yes.

Question: How do you measure the color and brightness of a sun glare spot? How do you interpret solar color? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How do you measure the color and brightness of a sun glare spot? How do you interpret solar color?

Answer:

Sun glare is not visible in visible light, but it is not hard to interpret what the color of the sun is. A color is defined as the sum of two or more different wavelength wavelengths. For instance, a color that is one-third red is defined by having the wavelength of 440 nm as one third that of 660 nm as one third that of 660 nm, and, conversely, a color that is one-half dark red is defined by having the wavelength of 480 nm as one half that of 555 nm.

The brightness is the total amount of energy that is radiated in an area of space. For example, if an entire sphere of sunlight is shining on a person and they are exposed to only half of a centimeter over that, then the brightness of a person may be one-half or a quarter of the intensity of the sunlight, depending on the distance the person is from the sunlight.

A few different methods were developed to study sun glare. One method was based on spectral analysis of the light incident on a bright object. This method does not measure the energy of the light, but just the reflected energy of the light incident on the observer. It is common today to take spectroscopic measurements in the light of the sun.

Another method was based on the color of ultraviolet radiation and in particular sun and dark-adapted photopsia. This method measures the color of ultraviolet radiation emitted by a bright object. It is also called ""white"" photopsia.

Another method was based on the relative size of a given frequency of sunlight, relative to an object being measured and then divided in half. This method is called ""equal-energy"" spectroscopy, and is commonly used today in telescopes to measure the spectrum of sunlight.

A third method was based on the spectroscopic appearance of a single wavelength of sunlight, in this case, the ultraviolet. This method is called ""spectroscopically calibrated.""

A method for measurement of the relative size of a frequency of sunlight was developed by R.J. Thomson and James Cook in 1911, and this method is called ""spectral discrimination."" It can measure light differently from a spectrum analysis, that is, from an observer positioned at sea level with the sun at one corner of the eye.

Another method of measurement for the ratio of wavelength to brightness was developed between 1881 and 1931 by Rene Descartes and was published in 1797. The measurement involves putting a piece of paper against the back of an umbrella while sitting on a chair or on the ground. One piece of paper is placed on the paper and the other against a sheet of paper, each side of which is exposed to the sunlight. The ratio of brightness to wavelength, which is called ""descent"" is then measured. An ""equal-energy"" method is also used for this measurement method. The ""equal-energy"" method is still widely used today.

Another method of measurement of the brightness of the sun for determining its color has been developed in the USA by J.R. Pemberton in 1927. This method, also called ""pulse emission measurement,"" depends on the shape of a bright object being observed. The shape of a bright object is important because it dictates whether it reflects or absorbs light, which will define its color. In this method, a red, yellow or green object is placed against a dark piece and the same angle and intensity as the bright object is chosen for comparison. It is important to note that the intensity is not directly measured by this method. However, by measuring the amount of light emitted by the object against the amount of light reflected by the object, the ratio can be determined. The more light emitted by the object against what is reflected, the brighter the object is. The more light reflected by the object, the darker the object is.

The second form of spectral discrimination involved in studying sunlight's color is called ""diffuse spectroscopy."" It involves measuring the amount of light falling on a bright object. Diffuse spectroscopy is common in optical systems and is also used today for imaging purposes."
Question: Should circumcision be performed in childhood? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should circumcision be performed in childhood? Related answers: As long as the parents' or guardians' decisions are supported by the medical profession, physicians don't have a professional duty to change a child's circumcision if their decision is in the best interest of the boy's health. The parents must do the best for the child; they don't have a special legal obligation to obey their doctors.

Circumcision is an acceptable medical procedure for babies in many countries. This web page, however, does not take a position about whether circumcision should be performed at all. It does, however, state that babies should not be circumcised when it is medically unnecessary. It is my contention that if a doctor wants to place this procedure on a child, he should have the flexibility to do so.

What's My Baby's Risk?

The infant is at greatest risk for complications if the procedure is performed too soon. Children are more apt to suffer injury if they are strapped on when they are just learning how to walk or even to walk at all. Infants often fall off the table and break bones. Often, even before the skin is stretched, their brains have not fully developed. If the skin is too tight when the boy is younger, the child may cry or scream, for example. This is dangerous because no brain function is lost. But if the skin is too loose at the infant's age, the brain is not mature enough to make effective decisions about his future behavior. The baby may resist his parents' wishes to make a change; in extreme instances, the parents may abandon the infant. If the skin is not stretched until the child is much older, however, it can be done so that the foreskin will never be damaged.

Why Should I Choose to Do This for My Son?

Circumcision is a medically recommended step in helping boys grow up to be strong, competent members of society. There are many medical reasons for this; it may prevent or reduce some sexually transmitted diseases, and it does keep the penis strong for sexual intercourse. Circumcision also greatly reduces the incidence of herpes.

When would I know if my son wants it? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: When would I know if my son wants it? Related answers: Circumcision does not cause problems unless the parents are unable to decide for themselves. The baby does not owe his foreskin to adults to learn to use it. Parents have a duty to have their son protected from disease and other harms. Circumcision is not part of the human condition or genetic inheritance.

Question: Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: No. The only thing that changes is that instead of being offered an anti-inflammatory, you will begin treatment for non-cancerous (inflammatory) inflammations with a single colonoscopy. In addition, in many cases, the diagnosis of diverticulitis is made on the first day of the second and third attempts of the first colonoscopy. After that, in most cases it is treated again, as though the diverticulitis is non-cancerous.

Question: When should I see a colonoscopy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""When should I see a colonoscopy?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: First, consult your healthcare physician before the colonoscopy, as any abnormal findings on the colonoscopic exam can lead to an urgent consult with an endoscologist. This will help you to learn what you need to do in case you need to return to the doctor's office for further review of your findings. However, once this is determined, you can start treatment based on your previous findings and may still receive a colonoscopy a few weeks later.

Question: When should I consider the procedure to be over? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""When should I consider the procedure to be over?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: The procedure can be reversed if the findings turn out to be abnormal. However, once you have been diagnosed with diverticulitis, the procedure should be postponed until you regain the health needed to avoid future complications.

Question: How often should I consult a specialist? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""How often should I consult a specialist?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: Consult the specialist at least once every 3 months. Consult the specialist 1 to 2 times/year if signs of diverticulitis continue to persist. In extreme cases, a third visit of the same kind, usually after 2 or 3 months, is strongly advised. It is strongly advised that consult a specialist unless: your physician knows your symptoms and the underlying cause of your pain; your physician is convinced your pain does not belong to the diverticular disease; no pain-related problems are present; and/or no other diagnostic tests were done.

Question: What is the duration of follow-up after an acute diverticulum? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""What is the duration of follow-up after an acute diverticulum?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: The duration of follow-up after an acute diverticulum depends mainly on the number of the diverticulas (the number of diverticula per bowel volume, the actual size of the diverticula) and the procedure used. In many cases the length of follow-up is 3 to 5 years. There are some other factors that matter in the treatment of a diverticulum: the presence of diverticulitis is not related to the length of the follow-up in all cases; and the patient's condition improves with appropriate therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PATIENTS].

Question: In each case, did I recover? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""In each case, did I recover?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: No. On the contrary, there is a risk of relapse after recovery but usually these relapse recur after only a few months of treatment. If more than five relapses are seen in a short time after treatment, a reassessment is recommended.

Question: Is there any way to predict whether a diverticulum will reoccur? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""Is there any way to predict whether a diverticulum will reoccur?"".

For the answer, please answer this Question.

For the answer, please answer this Question

Answer: There is still a risk of a relapse (especially in younger patients) but usually at the rate one per 10 years following treatment. Some patients may require a further evaluation of the relapses to see the recurrence risks.

Question: Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up? Keywords: dementia, instrumental activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, dementia risk factor, neurodegenerative disorders

Introduction The risk of dementia increases with age and is a major concern for people living with the illness. The mechanism by which dementia develops is currently debated. One hypothesis is that environmental factors contribute to the disease by inducing a form of oxidative stress in brain tissue in which proteins that are essential for healthy brain function are degraded or broken down. The mechanism by which these factors induce oxidative stress in brain tissue is unknown, however there is evidence that these factors directly cause Alzheimer's disease. Others hypothesize that there may be a genetic component to dementia or that environmental factors also play important roles. However, recent data suggests that no single lifestyle factor has been shown to have a significant impact on the development of dementia. However, recent studies have failed to identify a single lifestyle factor that increases the risk of dementia. The question of whether instrumental activities of daily living (LADWs) contribute to the development of dementia warrants further investigation, and this has led to the design and analysis of a large-scale investigation of the relationship between LADWs and dementia in a large, representative sample of individuals with advanced dementia (1–3). If the link between LADWs and dementia is causal, then we believe that measures of LADW activity should be a predictor of dementia risk and should allow for the prediction of future occurrence of dementia. The study objective was to determine whether instrumental activities of daily living or a combination of LADWs and dementia risk factors predicted dementia risk in a large, representative sample of individuals with advanced dementia. Furthermore, we hypothesized that a combination of LADWs and a combination of disease-specific outcomes will not, at least not on a first attempt, predict risk of dementia and its associated outcomes in a large, representative sample of individuals with advanced dementia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample The study population consisted of 1,735 individuals (mean age, 79 years) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1997–1998 in the United States. Participants were invited to participate by letters from an independent program manager (N = 1,040) through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The study was approved by the institutional review boards at all participating sites. The principal investigator, Drs. Daniel R. Bernstein, DVM, et. al, and Dr. Steven K. Hall, MSPH, were the study directors. The primary outcome measure of dementia occurrence was obtained by using a validated questionnaires-based dementia assessment procedure. Results LADWs were defined as activities that comprise activities that include activities of daily living (ADLs) in the context of a routine, established lifestyle pattern associated with use of other health-related practices or recreational activities. Among participants with advanced dementia and no other dementia risk factors, participants were classified as having an adjusted dementia incidence of 4.7, 3.7, or 4.4 percent for activities of daily living or combination LADWs, respectively. LADW characteristics included sex, age at baseline (mean, 69 years), race, education, and marital status. In all analyses, LADW level was categorized into four categories: no activity (1–13 or less LADW), 1–7 LADW in the context of a routine, established lifestyle (8–20 LADW in the context of a routine, established lifestyle), and ≥3 LADW in the context of a routine, established lifestyle. For example, a person with three activities of daily living would have these in his or her routine: living room activity, playing table tennis with the parents, and walking a dog. The remaining activities of daily living were defined as activities associated with routine, established lifestyle. For example, if a person spent less than 3 hours in the kitchen per day and did not cook much meat or vegetables, there would be no category for this activity on the scale. The analysis controlled for multiple confounders that may confound the relationship between ADLs and dementia risk. For example, age was one confounder of the relationship between LADW level and dementia, but its inclusion did not modify our results. We compared dementia incidence at 1-year follow-up between those who reported no activity of daily living (comprising of 1–7 LADW in the context of a routine, established lifestyle), those who reported LADW levels greater than or equal to 3, those who reported LADW levels greater than or equal to 7, and those who reported LADW levels greater than or equal to 8. We then examined whether the association between activity of daily living level and dementia risk in the subsequent 1- and 2-year periods was similar after adjusting"
Question: Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection?

Answer: A retrospective analysis of patients who were randomized in a clinical trial of intubation with one of 10 instruments reported that the use of one instrument was associated with an increased risk of post-operative ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection (see Table). These researchers reasoned that, although these instruments have different techniques to perform the procedure, their use resulted in a low rate of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection. For the remainder of this paper, we will present case histories of the occurrence and prevalence of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection occurring during the first 2 days and 1 to 2 days following the delivery of the baby by caesarean section.

Case History

A 22-year-old single man presented to our hospital for the termination of an abortion in August 2001 in order to continue his pregnancy and have a son. He requested the baby be placed in the breech position in the mother's pelvis or in the epidural position, and requested the epidural be placed in the vaginal canal at both delivery and time of delivery. After the patient's arrival at our clinic, he gave a history of fetal heart rate variations and also gave a history of having a previous caesarean section. He was able to deliver the baby vaginally, with use of a combination of medications and mechanical vacuum aspiration. The obstetrician recommended that he be intubated by the obstetrician while it was not too late to deliver using the standard intubation and resuscitation technique. This was to ensure that the epidural was properly inserted. The obstetrician gave him 3 to 4 minutes to perform the procedure and to maintain a good attitude while performing the procedure using the standard equipment. At approximately 16 minutes, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt invaded the anterior descending wall of the uterine cavity and the patient experienced moderate- to heavy-level cervical contractions. Two seconds later, the placenta was delivered. While in the recovery position, the patient felt a sensation of pressure in the abdomen. He was later admitted for an evaluation of what became known as ""the baby's breath."" The patient was treated with fluids, and later underwent an angiotendinous catheter placement. The next day, the abdominal pain subsided and the patient was discharged home with instructions to use oxygenated mouth-to-mouth for pain management following anesthesia. The next week, the patient returned to the hospital, but was discharged with a diagnosis of a mild perforation in the posterior wall of the uterus. There was an ultrasound to determine the depth of the perforation, and the patient was intubated again in the same procedure.

A week after his surgery, the patient began to experience frequent abdominal contractions. He reported feeling that the airways were congested, and that he was having difficulty moving the stomach and/or intestines. He had an emergency medical condition. The patient attended to with the obstetrician and an obstetric physician two more times, but he had not recovered from the injury. He continued to experience a high rate (10 to 15%) post-operative ventricular arrhythmias, and had occasional periods of weakness in his arms and legs during which he could not maintain adequate support on the bed. He was found to have a perforation in his posterior wall of the uterus in the perisopodium region. A CT scan was ordered, and the patient was given intrapartum antibiotics and gave a progesterone, but no treatment was initially provided. He was eventually given a CT scan of the perisopylon, which confirmed the perforation, and he was transferred to a tertiary care center for a treatment of this condition. Following a follow-up CT scan, the patient underwent surgery to repair the perforation, and there was again moderate and intense abdominal contractions, possibly due to the perforation (6.5 hours following intubation). The patient was then transferred with an epidural. An ultrasound found no perforation and the patient resumed his normal activities.

Ten months after the birth, the patient returned to his hospital for a follow-up. He was able to maintain a good attitude throughout the entire procedure, and he resumed normal activities. He continued to have very light-headedness and occasional headaches, and he also had frequent periods of decreased reflex activity due to the ventricular arrhythmia (18 hours following ventricular intubation) and decreased motor function. During the subsequent 2.5 weeks, the patient was unable to return to his normal activities at all, as the episodic migraine was severe and had progressed. The patient underwent a second CT"

PANASONIC

Evaluating phonological awareness: how can an awareness of phonological structure be enriched?

Authors: J.A.B., K.G., S.M.C., E.L.A. and J.D.K. (in press)

A recent literature study has investigated the relation between two types of phonological awareness: the acoustic awareness of the acoustic environment and phonological awareness based on speech production. Based on these findings, it has been hypothesized that early acquisition of acoustic awareness (as measured via voice-print examinations) and the acoustic awareness of speech structures would be highly associated to phonological awareness. However, even though two studies seem to contradict each other on this issue, the current empirical research has not yet fully uncovered whether early, acoustic and phonological awareness are linked to each other at different levels of the processing sequence. In turn, the most important task to carry out these studies remains to explore the links at both phonological and acoustic levels.

A.T. P.

The aim of this study was to study how early, acoustic, and phonological awareness are related and whether the association is significant for both acoustic and phonological knowledge. To make it more straightforward, we used the following measures. First, an acoustic literacy and the phonological abilities of eight Han Chinese children were assessed (3-5 years old) using a voice-print procedure. The subjects' phonological memory, phonological awareness and learning rate were also examined using a special knowledge test, that is, an auditory semantic ability test. It was found that in all children, their phonological abilities and knowledge were highly similar with the acoustic abilities. The results indicated that acoustic awareness and phonological awareness were highly related to each other. Second, a phonological perception test was carried out, that is, the auditory acoustic pattern recognition test, which is an auditory recognition test that uses acoustic stimuli, such as speech sounds and sounds of animals. In addition, the subject's phonological awareness was assessed using the two previous studies, namely the speech articulatory perception test (SAP) and the speech articulatory segmentation test. The results showed that, among the children, the phonological awareness and knowledge was moderately higher on both a high and low level, in general.

We conclude that, while early acoustic sensitivity is associated with early early learning of phonological ability and acoustic awareness, the level of this early acoustic sensitivity is highly related to the levels of both phonological awareness and acoustic awareness. In turn, the association between the two systems is probably at least partly mediated by the influence of language acquisition that takes place in the first years of life. Future studies that investigate the association between acoustic, phonological, and linguistic systems in children from 0 to 2 years of age may contribute to the understanding of the underlying factors for speech language development. While some results indicated that the acoustic-phonological relationship is important to the early and phonological awareness, the results were not completely resolved. The results indicate that these relations are not so strong as previously predicted.

D.O.

In their review article, J.Z., A.J.W., J.J., C.K. and C.W. found that early recognition of speech sounds are the most important mechanisms through which young children learn phonological awareness. Recently, the association between early phonological awareness and speech understanding was demonstrated, namely the age-related increase in auditory awareness in the first years of life. Nevertheless, the acoustic and phonological systems seem to be differentially involved with early visual perception and spatial awareness. For example, some authors observed that early auditory perception is a poor indicator of the perceptual aspects and the phonological awareness appears to be related to the phonological processing. Our study offers new perspectives on the early processes in phonological processing, which may indicate a potential contribution of early linguistic learning towards phonological awareness.

Question: Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is there any biological mechanism that makes streptococci cause multiple sclerosis? The best known biological theory of MS is that it is a specific type of autoimmune disorder known as Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies trigger cells in immune cells that attack and kill the neurons that control the movement of pain-carrying nerve impulses. The immune system is particularly strong in people with multiple sclerosis. There are many symptoms of multiple sclerosis, including pain, swelling of the brain, changes in the muscle and bone mass, and inability to speak or move the fingers. To diagnose multiple sclerosis you usually see two different kinds of laboratory tests: an immunocompromised test to exclude people who have already had one or more previous infections; and a blood test that distinguishes among those who have had prior infection, the general population, and immune-compromised or HIV-infected people with multiple sclerosis. The immunoassay is only one of many ways the doctor may test your immune system, which in its most subtle form of the disease, which can appear in adults anywhere from their 20s to the 90s, includes hundreds of thousands of cells called macrophages, and makes them proliferate (grow) into a massive blood mass around the parts of the body affected. At one time most of the time this is nothing more than a lump under the skin known as a lesion, but recent tests that can detect the presence of macrophages in the blood have shown that at least some people have been infected as children with measles, mumps or smallpox, while that is still known to be a significant cause of the disease. It is suspected that it is the infection with measles that produces the increased amount of macrophages in the blood and causes other symptoms, such as low appetite, difficulty swallowing and bowel problems. Other symptoms seen as an early prognostic indicator of multiple sclerosis are problems with swallowing and bowel control and blurred vision. So if people with different diseases and infections are all thought to have a similar underlying disease, why does the immune system attack and kill them all? It is a complicated answer, and the causes and progression of multiple sclerosis are not well understood, but the fact that many people who catch and infect themselves have other symptoms, such as pain and swollen joints, suggests that the immune system is somehow not doing its best to eradicate the disease. The disease also causes people to become less functional in other ways. People with multiple sclerosis suffer from some of the most severe neurological pain of any disease, and other symptoms and disabilities, such as cognitive problems, are also common with the disease. When it comes to the severity of symptoms and disability, people with multiple sclerosis may be as poor or even worse off as those with tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis, and even people with diabetes or high blood pressure. So why did the immune system attack and kill so many people as children? Two types of immune systems, both specific to people with MS, attack and kill the same parts of the body in the same way. And because MS patients have not been infected before they have had an immune attack on the part of their brain responsible for thinking, it's plausible that the same underlying mechanism explains how the disease causes this. The first type of ""regulatory"" immune system is responsible for the formation of ""memory cells"", which contain proteins that recognize and inhibit certain chemical reactions that occur during disease symptoms. A number of these memory cells become ""memory receptors"", in effect a relay station for immune responses to recognize and be inhibited for subsequent attacks. The cell-based memory cells are the same type of memory cells as in young children, but the adult type is a bit bigger, and includes multiple cells that are active, and can take in and store information for weeks to give the immune system an overview of a specific situation. The second type, or ""inflammatory"" immune system is also required for self-cleansing. This type of immune system attacks the ""memories"" and ""memory receptors"", and creates immune cells and antibodies to help rid your body of infection. MS is a classic example of this role. The ""regulatory"" immune system can also produce its own immune reaction, by producing a specific type of antibody by triggering the production of an enzyme. A single antibody production and reaction, however, will not kill the infected cell, which is usually what produces the anti-inflammatory, anti-autoimmune or immune-modulating effect. It is not uncommon for children with MS to have autoimmune reactions on both parts of the brain (nerve production) and immune cells in their eye and blood vessels (cellular immunity). These effects are so common that it is a major cause of disability in children; many young children can have severe seizures in the same setting; and a number of adults have permanent damage to their vision at an early age. So there appear to be two types of inflammation, which may be causing the same underlying problem. One type involves the"

The treatment of ovarian cancer with 2-methoxyestradiol and 2-MEOE2 has been in clinical and preclinical trials since the 1970's in animal models, but the combination has not been approved for any indication in humans. In vitro and in vivo efficacy studies are limited and the combined treatment is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The use of methoE2 is approved for the treatment of pre-cancerous ovarian carcinoma in animal models. Both 2-methoxyestradiol and 2-methiE2 may be effective in pre-cancerous subfertility. Results are preliminary and there are limitations associated with the use of a combination therapy with a single treatment.

Question: Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee and the anterior cruciate ligament.

Introduction

Anterior cruciate ligament injuries (ACL injuries) can be devastating and have serious long-term sequelae.1,2 Although ACL tears occur in about 1 in 1,000 persons, most people have ACL injuries that heal without a sequelae. Nevertheless, injury is the first stage of ACL rehabilitation.1,2 The severity of the injury may dictate which step you should pursue after injury and the duration of surgery.

Many people who have an ACL injury will present with symptomatic pain, stiffness, and lack of function. This is true if the ACL is being torn. The initial injury is most often anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tendon stress, which is usually not painful to the uninjured individual but may feel similar and may cause temporary difficulty in walking, climbing stairs, standing on one leg, or lifting weights. The diagnosis of ACL injury is usually based on one of three diagnostic criteria that are based on the anatomy of the lateral meniscus, the location of the injury on the anterior cruciate ligament, and the level of involvement.2

Assessing joint line positions

There are numerous factors with regard to which it is desirable to establish the joint line positions after ACL injury. The first step, however, is to perform an MRI of the knee or knee joint. The diagnosis of ACL injury is often based on the MRI or x-ray. Therefore, it is critical to consider the joint line positions and MRI findings when assessing the quality of function following ACL injury and the development of an injury-free patient.

It is important to assess the level of involvement of the meniscus, the location of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and the extent of injury. These factors are typically most evident on the MRI scan, which is an important step in evaluating the patients' ability to function and rehabilitation.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the thickest ligament within the knee joint. It is normally attached to the extensor tendon and the vastus medialis muscle and then to the superior border of the collateral ligaments.2,5 In a healthy individual, the ACL is attached to the meniscus with an oval or splayed configuration that corresponds with the position of the anterior capsule and the tibial tubercle.2 The ACL will be stressed (over tension) when the knee is flexed.6,7

The location of the ACL does not accurately represent its clinical importance and is a source of uncertainty in the clinical assessment of an ACL injury. In order to provide an accurate depiction of the ACL injury, it is important to measure both joint line positions and the location of the ACL on both sides of the knee. Therefore a simple and noninvasive technique commonly used to establish the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) position is to measure an extensor tendon (tendon) length on both sides of the knee joint between where it attaches to the medial, lateral, and anterior cruciate ligaments using an extensor tendon tester. The measurements are in millimeters when the extensor tendon is stretched (anterior cruciate ligament is stretch).8 When the patient's leg is flexed, the tester is stretched and measured along the tendon that attaches the tendon to the anterior surface of the medial, lateral, and anterior cruciate ligaments.9 Then, the length of the extensor tendon varies from where it attaches the tendon to the medial, lateral, and anterior cruciate ligaments. In a healthy individual with a normal weight, these extensor tendon measurements are typically in excess of 1 mm. To maintain the accuracy of this assessment, measurements are taken 4 times out of 5 over 5 minutes and after a 2-minute rest.

Although this technique is widely used in knee joint analysis, a recent trend among knee joint imaging companies has not followed it. Although the technology to measure the extensor tendon length has improved over the past few years, other equipment is difficult for the radiologist to use. Furthermore, the technique does not allow for measurement of the proximal meniscus, the small flap of cartilage that is commonly located in the extensor tendon at the lateral side of the knee.9 Therefore, measurements of the distance between the proximal tip of the extensor tendon and the meniscus often is not feasible due to the small distance. Consequently, the results obtained from this technique are considered unreliable.

This technique is more effective as long as the athlete's weight has not changed since the injury and it is performed in a position that will not interfere with the normal activities of daily living.

Question: Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement?""

Answer: The TFL in the T20 and T25 tendons has greater stiffness and greater length than the other tendons. This creates a greater stretch, strain, and compression on the patellar tendon compared to the other major structures. The stiffness and length of the TFL is not directly related to the Patellar Joint Tenderness (PAT) in the Patellar Disk and Achilles (ADI), and this difference is a symptom of a Patellar Disk or Achilles problem.

What this study showed was that the length and stiffness of the TFL in the T20 tendons may impact the mechanical alignment of the patellar tendon, and this interaction had an influence on mechanical stability of the knee.

Mechanical problems can lead to changes for the best and worst of human biomechanics. These results do not mean that the TFL of the T20 and T25 tendons is good or bad. Instead, it showed that mechanical instability of the TFL in the first two knee segments during knee replacement is a problem in most cases.

The mechanical instability can have a significant effect on the joint if not corrected. Although the mechanical instability is reduced for the restorative knee replacement (RKOR), these findings could lead to a lower chance of a good RKOR. On the positive side, the greater mechanical instability should prevent ACL injuries in patients with degenerative changes in the patellar disk or Achilles (ADI). It also makes it possible to perform a lower joint movement such as supination, pronation, and flexion, which are common before knee replacement. It is important to bear this in mind if you have a patellar pain, when performing an injury assessment test, and especially if you are using a RKOR technique.

Sidney Pfeiffer, et al.; Breast Cancer Res. 4(7):S40-S54, 2002. I. Introduction


In the past 15 years we have seen a significant increase in the incidence and incidence of breast cancer. With the exception of glioblastoma multiforme, breast malignancies are the most prevalent cancers among women in the United States (1). Breast cancer is now the fourth most common cancer in the United States (2). There is a strong correlation between rates of breast cancer onset/diagnosis and the frequency of breast biopsies. There is a high incidence of tumours with an active growth axis (carcinoma). Prostate, lung, colon, and rectal cancers are also common in this country. There is a strong association between biopsy rate and rates of breast cancer incidence. In this study we reviewed the incidence and incidence of breast cancer in 3,200 women with breast biopsies between 1990 and 2002. Of this total, 5.8% were breast tumors. In men, there were an incidence of 1.4%. The median age of women with breast cancer was 52 years, and the median age of the male group was 45 years. Breast biopsies took place on an average of once a year in women and once a month in men; both ages were quite consistent throughout the study.


The biopsy process is characterized by a range of different events. The patient is placed in a chair at the radiograph center, and is examined while lying supine. Ultrasound is used to assess a variety of aspects of the woman's anatomy. Ultrasound imaging is used to study the extent of breast adiposity. As well as the general anatomy, in order to obtain the tumor site you must remove the nipple bone through an incision made using a scalpel. In men, the cancer is detected with laparoscopy. The tumor is generally spotted by visual inspection and then biopsied under a microscope. This is most often done at a local facility, where all the tissue is examined in one spot. All examinations have a low diagnostic value and are a low cost alternative when other methods are not acceptable. The biopsy is generally in a sterile environment and in an open setting. The biopsy site is considered to be a ""noncancerous"" lymph node.


With the advent of mammography, it is possible for a biopsy to be carried out on the entire breast. The cost of an MRI and/or CT scan is more complex to evaluate, are generally associated with higher margins of error, and are more time-consuming and costly. In that light, the need for a ""biopsy"" for breast cancer is considered essential. Although the prevalence and growth of breast cancer is increasing (2), there are only limited number of biopsy sites.


It is often argued that there are several reasons for the increasing death rates of breast cancer in general and of breast cancer in particular (2). A recent study found that breast cancers account for approximately two quarters of all primary breast cancers in Japan (4). Women who die from breast cancer in Japan are a disproportionately large group. An increasing incidence rate in the US is also correlated with increasing death rates of breast cancers in the general population. Women living in the United States have a higher likelihood of developing breast cancer.


Cancers of the breast and ovary are the dominant cancer group in the United States. A variety of other types of cancers have been found in other countries, including cancers of the penis, throat, urinary tract, ovary, and testicles.


The prevalence of breast cancer in the United States is rising. Between 1996 and 1997, 1.2 for every 100,000 women aged 50 to 54 years, compared with 0.4 in 1986 (1). These increases have contributed to an increased incidence of breast cancer in women of childbearing age and increasing rates of breast cancers in women in their 20s and early 30s. The majority of these increases affect the breast and ovarian tumor subtypes (4% breast and 8% ovarian cancers). There are many factors that are implicated in the increased breast cancer incidence among women, including social, socioeconomic, and cultural influences. For example, women are more likely than men or other younger age groups to smoke, to drink heavily and to have multiple sexual partners (1). Women living in states that have higher rates of breast cancer are more likely to be exposed to carcinogens such as tobacco smoke. In addition, more women are having breast surgery.


Many factors can modify the growth of breast cancer. Cancer can be aggressive, malignant, or just benign. There are many mechanisms that can modify breast tumor growth, and the role of the lymph node is essential to understanding how the tumor is progressing. In addition, the tumor"

Question: Continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration: opportunity for rescue? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

We have tested and confirmed the results of a large pilot cohort study investigating whether antenatal and in-utero corticosteroid administration reduces pregnancy rates following a primary low-birth-weight (LBW) induction compared with a high-birth-weight (HBW) induction (14). Although no data on postneonatal outcomes were available from this group study, after stratifying participants according to their birth weight and gestational age, the mean probability of being classified as LBW at enrollment was lower in the second trimester of pregnancy compared with that of the first trimester. However, this effect disappeared at a somewhat later gestational age in this group of the cohort, with an average mean probability of a pregnant woman being classified as LBW at 16 weeks gestation of 30% compared with a pregnancy rate of 70% for women who were classified as HBW (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS:

Although this cohort study did not address the issue of ancillary or secondary clinical outcomes, the observed findings suggest that in-utero corticosteroid administration during the second trimester of pregnancy may represent a more effective and economical alternative than using HBW induction in reducing pregnancy rates."
Question: Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects?

Study design:

This study was a double-blind crossover study. Subjects were randomized to receive one of three different treatments: normal CPAP, an OSA-based CPAP therapy that reduced the OSA or had no treatment differences, or a more than doubled OSA-free OSA treatment that reduced the CPAP response with a specific OSA-based CPAP (APX100) device. The mean age was 58 years and the mean weight was 79.6 kg.

Drug:

Doxycycline (2.25 mg, administered twice) was given to this group.

Study protocol:

The subjects in the OSA-based and non-OSA-based CPAP therapy groups received their CPAP therapy every 12 hours, and were then placed on an inpatient overnight fasted condition. The sleep-wake pattern was recorded at baseline (5 pm) and the timepoint (5:45 pm) when they had the longest sleep (0–30 min) without REM sleep/nightmares. The mean sleep duration was 8.3 h.

For the OSA-based treatment group, the sleep pattern was recorded after the subjects had taken their last dose of the OSA-based CPAP machine and a sleep questionnaire was developed. The first questionnaire was composed of six items that evaluated sleep quality, which also included how long each subject was able to retain spontaneous sleep at a specified baseline time. A computer-assisted self-assessment computer program (Barker-Cadegouz, 2010) was used to measure total sleep time (total nocturnal sleep time) using polysomnography (PSG) and the sleep-wake cycle using an alarm clock and a 12-hour polysomnogram. This assessment occurred before subjects received their first dose of the OSA-based CPAP treatment. The sleep-wake cycle was also analyzed. The sleep cycle was evaluated using a polysomnogram at the beginning and end of the OSA-based treatment, and the night of a 6-h fast prior to sleep and the night of a 6-h fast before sleep (baseline to morning).

Results:

No significant difference was found in total sleep time following 12-hour OSA-based treatment (P = 0.42), but the sleep cycle was reduced by 6.5 hours (P = 0.049) compared with baseline.

There was a significant decrease following 12-hour OSA-based treatment for the control group, which had a normal sleep time and a high total sleep time (P = 0.02) compared with the OSA-based group.

Conclusion:

The results of this study demonstrate that short-term OSA-based CPAP therapy, which has a short sleep, reduced sleep duration. This CPAP therapy reduced sleep time, however, there was no difference according to obesity status, as long-term treatment with the same OSA model should not alter sleep time at a higher obesity prevalence. The sleep-cycle characteristics demonstrated in this study have a role in the short-term behavior, and the results from this study have a role in the long-term behavior.

Introduction

The sleep-wake cycle is the primary sleep rhythm, and a reduction in sleep duration and/or length is considered deleterious to sleep quality, well-being, and health (Bosworth and Della Rovere, 1998). Sleep disturbance, a decreased sleep efficiency, and disrupted sleep are considered adverse side effects of OSA (Cohen, 2006). In addition, the OSA model has been shown in laboratory and clinical studies to be associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Burgess et al., 2005; Harkavy et al., 2009), stroke (Dorothy et al., 2002), and other chronic diseases (Masters et al., 1969; Degenhardt et al., 1985), as well as the development of obstructive sleep apnea (OBS) syndrome (Degenhardt et al., 1985).

Although some OSA-based CPAP devices may help overweight subjects reduce sleep duration and/or sleep problems, it is known that OSA-based CPAP devices have an increased risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea (OBS). In addition, more research has been done regarding the effects of OSA-based CPAP devices on obstructive sleep apnea. In this study, there was a significant reduction in sleep duration with OSA-based CPAP in obese individuals, and no significant effect on sleep quality. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in sleep quality with OSA-based CPAP"

Question: Is the Distance Worth It? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," The distance traveled to this web site in the past 12 hours depends on how fast the web site is updated. The paper should contain a graph and text that explain how the graph has been developed. The distance traveled to this web site in the past 12 hours depends on how fast the web site is updated. The paper should contain a graph and text that explain how the graph has been developed.

The answer to the question above is yes and no.

Yes, the speed of your web site updating is more important than the distance traveled. This is why a distance metric might be helpful in determining the appropriate way to write a paper. However, the difference between ""the faster"" and ""the slower"" is not huge at all. And that's the way math works in this case; the difference between ""the faster"" and ""the slower"" doesn't even need to be used.

No, the difference between ""the faster"" and ""the slower"" is more important than ""the faster"". This is why if you say, ""the faster the update speed"", the question has already been answered by answering the question; the distance traveled has no effect on your answer.

We could use this to ask further questions if we wish. But to do so, we would only need to use a few sentences to write a paper that addresses the question at hand:

I want to write a paper that answers the distance traveled to a web page. I want to write a paper that addresses the question, the distance traveled to a web page, with two different distances measured: one in miles and another in kilometers. The two metrics would be: ""The distance traveled to the web page in miles"" And ""The distance traveled to the web page in kilometer"".

The paper's authors would have some background information for how to calculate the values to use, since the question, ""The distance traveled to a web page in miles"", can be written in both directions, with an average of miles and average of km. With this new metric, the two metrics might look something like this:

The distance traveled to a web page in miles (or km), average of miles and average of km. The distance traveled to the web page in kilometers, average of kilometers and average of miles.

The answer to the question of how many miles a mile actually is is an unknown quantity. However, we can know something if we know how much a mile means to someone. For example, if we say ""the distance traveled to any other web page"" or the like, we mean that the distance traveled was divided by an amount. In other words, we mean to say the distance was divided by some number. There is no way to know how many times the distance traveled to any other web page has been divided.

We'll define the metric that does the dividing for us. With the metric we can write a paper like this:

The distance traveled to any other web page of any size, average mile and average of km. This paper answers the question, how many miles a mile actually is to someone.

The ""the distance traveled to other web pages"" metric will be of two parts: ""the average of miles"" and ""the average of km"". The first two parts mean one thing and two different things; the third part means nothing and two different things. We just need to use the first part:

The distance traveled to other web pages, average of miles and average of km. The distance traveled to other web pages, average of kilometers and average of miles.

The difference between ""the distance traveled to other web pages"" and ""the distance traveled to other web pages"" is a small, but enough to indicate to us, simply, that more than one metric were used in the reasoning. The ""distance traveled to other web pages"" metric may be used on the web page, as far as it is appropriate.

We could continue this exercise by comparing the metric and finding out the average distance. Then we could use that average value to answer the question:

How many miles of distance have a medium sized web page traveled to the last hour?"
Question: Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling?

Answer: Aripiprazole is a drug (dopamine reuptake inhibitor) used to treat certain mood disorders, especially manic episodes and schizophrenia, but is also used to help some patients control other mood and behavioral disorders such as attention deficit disorder, anxiety and OCD. In fact, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) declared its intent to put a stop to the drug's sale as a dietary supplement by the end of 2000. Aripiprazole's history includes numerous deaths and injuries. To this day, there are still many people who have to ask why a drug that could possibly have saved their life turned out to be such a danger to their mental health. To help the people it did help, the FDA put a moratorium on the sale of this drug until a more rigorous scientific study has been conducted and any new safety data has been collected. These safety data should not be ignored.

Aripiprazole was also found in a 1992 study to have an abnormal heart function at first, but this was later reported to be temporary and then normal.

Despite being a very effective drug used to treat many mood disorders, Aripiprazole had been linked to a plethora of accidents and injuries. One of the most famous cases involved an Austrian nurse named Lino Struthers who was involved in a car accident in 2001, but was then found to have a ""substantial"" amount of Aripiprazole in her bloodstream. According to the newspaper Die Welt, Struthers' blood showed traces of the drug while she was in intensive care but no traces were found to be of any concern.

One case in particular, involving a 21-year old man with schizophrenia, involved a woman named Andrea Hülsing, who took this drug at 5,000 mg a day. The man died of cardiac arrest on August 24, 2002, shortly before he was scheduled to go on trial in a murder case, and, in February 2003, Hülsing was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, causing the death of her friend, who had also taken the drug. It was reported that Aripiprazole may have possibly caused the man's death.

Many other cases in which Aripiprazole has been linked to serious accidents and injuries has been reported, including:

A student with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome who was taking 50,000 mg of this drug after his asthma attack went from 3 to 5 degrees lower than normal.

A 14-year old girl with autism who had taken the drug and experienced the first signs of mental decline after two weeks.

A 26-year old male with cerebral venous insufficiency who had taken the drug after being paralyzed and then developed seizures after getting into a bad car accident.

A 22-year old male with a history of severe migraine headaches, which led to an accidental overdose after having taken at least 200 mgs of Aripiprazole at once.

A 35-year old male with a history of migraine headaches, who had taken 600 to 800 mgs of Aripiprazole three times per week for 5 months.

When this drug was first introduced during the 1970s, its use by individuals with bipolar disorder was much more common. However, in recent years, the drug has become a risk factor as many individuals with bipolar disorder have been found to have some form of mental disorder.

Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors: The Other Side of Misdiagnoses

If you have symptoms of depression or have ever had a period of depression, you may be wondering why you've been having so much trouble sleeping. If you think about it for just a moment, there may be a whole lot of reasons to suspect that something is not right. But it may start when people start getting into their cars, taking over the air conditioner, sitting in traffic, taking part in heavy recreational activities or simply not being able to concentrate. If you happen to have ADHD, a personality disorder or borderline personality disorder, those are all symptoms that may come up in your sleep. The fact is, as these people are getting so much more involved in activities that require them to shift their attention away from the task at hand, it can seem that they are experiencing much deeper problems.

All of us are vulnerable to depression. And if we are ever affected by that depression, we all have to start taking steps to get over our symptoms and start life to the brighter side. If you have ever wondered what's wrong, you may want to take a look at the following facts:

Fact: Depression has a higher incidence in people without a college degree.

Fact: Depression has a higher incidence in people over the age of 50.

Question: Immune suppression by lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine on T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens: does synergy exist? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," A comparison between lysosomotropic amines and other immunogenics on the effect of major and minor immunosuppressants on T-cell responses to peptide antigens.

Answer: This paper will summarize the results from several in vitro and in vivo animal studies focusing on the effects of lysosomotropic amines on T-cell responses to peptide antigENS. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that the lysosome may be critical for the development of human T cells capable of recognizing peptides of this nature. This has been shown in vivo with immunolocalization of a novel class of C-reactive proteins, including IL-12, CD14, TGF-β/β-chain, Vax, CD44, ILI-17, B lymphocyte-related regulatory antigen, and S100.

The paper will be written in a way that addresses the issues for this review. The authors will start their paper referring to immunogenics by focusing on specific anti-C-reactive protein antibodies, such as interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-16; and C-reactive protein antibodies such as interleukin-8, CCR5, and CXCR4. They will discuss the roles performed by both the immune system and lysosomes in T-cell production and differentiation and on the effect of T cell-specific antibodies on T-cell responses.

The paper will conclude by briefly discussing lysosome and innate immune functions during the development of T-cell responses to non-peptide antigens. This includes T-cell induction of antibodies by stimulation of innate immunity; generation of T-cell receptors and memory cells; and the induction of antigen-presenting cells and T-cell populations by cytokines.

This will be the second in this series to discuss a review of lysosomal immune functions. The previous one was reviewed by Mardianus et al (2013). Although this paper focused on lysosome function, it is important to recognize that these functions are not restricted to the immune pathway solely. A number of studies have demonstrated that lysosomal functions influence on the development and function of a variety of tissues. These include in vitro and in vivo immunohistochemical studies of the effects of cytokines on immune functions (Aguado and Kiyomura 2008; Chen et al. 2006; Marini and Tosti 2005; Salmi et al. 1998; Szilagyi et al. 2003), and in vivo studies on the effects of cytokines on the development and function of the brain and nervous system (Rosenblum et al. 2006b; Salmi et al. 2008). Finally, the results of in vitro studies on the effects of cytokines on cell viability (Coulaier, Chassin, and Barzilai 1983; Rousset and Salmi 1977; Rousset and Salmi 1994) and the studies on cytokine-induced androgen receptor suppression (Chu and Shih 1994, 2000) indicate that these are examples of aspects of the lysosome that may not be restricted only to the immune system. Lyrasomotropic amines are now known to act at the lysosome in a variety of ways (Tosunoda et al. 1995; Tatsumura et al. 1995; Suzuki et al. 1996; Tatsumura et al. 1999).

The authors of the lysosomotropic amines paper have shown that they are effective for the development and function of T cells. In this work, their experiments support the view that cytokines play an important role in T-cell development and function. This work highlights the role of lysosomes in the development and function of T cells. The authors conclude that the ability of lysosome-derived immunogenic ligands to influence T cell function is important in understanding the biology of lymphoid and monocytic T cells. This will be discussed further in the next section.

1. Overview of lysosomotropic amines

The literature on cytokines, their ligands, and their effects on T-cell development has been reviewed (Szilagyi, 2010; Rousset & Salmi 1994). The literature provides examples of cytokines acting in a variety of ways on T cell development and function. As discussed in more detail in Rousset & Salmi 1994a and B.K. Schmucker et al. 1998, cytokines (except IL-10) act by activating T cells. Activation of T cells is mediated"
Question: Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

What role does induction chemotherapy have in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma?

Answer: The effect of induction chemotherapy must be evaluated in accordance with its specific indications and efficacy data and in view of its potential to interfere with the efficacy of other therapies. The results of studies on induction chemotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma are limited, because most of them were evaluated in a single centre or in general population. Only an analysis of a population based analysis with two follow-up times shows an improvement in survival in patients who underwent induction chemotherapy.

Dose-limiting serious adverse events (E-RAEs) of induction chemotherapy have not been described as often as might be expected [ 5 - 6 ]. Other studies in addition to the earlier analysis of data available to these authors suggest that some dose-limiting serious adverse events might be likely. In this study, induction chemotherapy was not associated with high risk non-specific adverse events. However, in the present analysis, some doses higher than the ones mentioned previously may have lead to serious E-RAEs. Therefore, to be recommended in the standard of care and in the standard of evidence, the recommended dose of induction chemotherapy should be based on these results.

It is important to note that the type of tumour and route of treatment are also important considerations for the decision of where to start patients according to induction chemotherapy indications. The overall tumour site size, the age at diagnosis, the duration of remission, and the type of disease of the tumour are considered in the discussion [ 1, 3 ]. Generally, the number of patients on a particular regimen that the author can identify in each study has a significant impact on the total number of patients to be treated in each trial. The use of standardised randomisation in each study was necessary for maximising precision and reliability in the comparison of the results. However, there was a need for a large sample size in each of them to avoid bias of the results of the trials.

For patients with primary or secondary non-small cell lung cancer, induction chemotherapy is very cost effective and is administered in the course of a few months. Other therapies are not necessary even for patients who have non-small cell lung cancer and are treated by surgery. A positive result is achieved in many of the trials with a median (IQR) response of 60% within one year [ 1, 3 ]. In most of the studies, the median survival in patients who were undergoing induction chemotherapy was 3.5 months [ 5 - 6 ]. In the studies described here, the median survival in patients who were on the standardised regimen for induction chemotherapy consisted of 5.4 months [ 1, 3 ].

No significant results were found for safety evaluation in patients treated in the studies mentioned. The main conclusions presented in this review were that in the clinical practice:

Preliminary data were presented by a third paper [ 6.] However, the results of the meta-analysis reported in this article were also presented in the third paper. The results of this article had been previously presented by the second paper, whereas this study presented findings that were slightly different from those of the second paper. However, the data from the present analysis included only those patients who received induction chemotherapy.

The quality of the data generated in the data on the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy are comparable to those of the existing meta-analyses in primary and secondary non-small cell lung cancer [ 5, 6 ]. Although many of the trials in this review used different doses of different chemotherapy regimens, the meta-analyses using these data provide an overview of the available data for the efficacy and safety of different induction chemotherapy regimens as compared to that in the trials that used a single protocol. A potential limitation for the available data is that they might not be comparable with the same patient population, because of the different types of disease of the tumour and different patient populations. Studies comparing the quality of data from the literature on cancer patients treated in various types of cancer are necessary.

The data presented in this review were based on randomised and other forms of controlled studies. In many of these trials, dose-limiting adverse events may be very high, so the studies should ideally be able to demonstrate this in their data. For example, in a randomised study of 100 patients treated with dacarbazine, the odds ratio was 1.46 (1.04 – 2.06), in a randomised study of 40 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, the odds ratio was 2.13 (1.81 – 4.22) [ 22 ].

These data could also be used to establish the dose of induction chemotherapy and the duration of treatment. The author has recently recommended use of different criteria when considering such parameters [ 4, 19, 21 ]. The decision on"

"Question: Are normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians accurate and reliable at making street crossing decisions? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Are normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians accurate and reliable at making street crossing decisions?

Answer: While there is plenty to be said for all of the above factors, I believe that the best test of a pedestrian's ability is how well she knows the rules of the road. If she is aware of the rules and is able to follow them, she can be a good judge of road hazards and an efficient traffic flow. If she is not aware of the rules and unable to follow them, she is likely to be a hazard which must be avoided at all costs or else she will get hit.


It seems clear to me that the majority of blind and visually impaired pedestrians who pass the pedestrian crossing in question are not being guided by visual cues; rather, they are blindly following the commands and instructions of the driver. It is this type of blind obedience which I attribute to the blindness. However, as shown in the previous discussion, blind pedestrians are prone to become more prone to being distracted by the instructions they receive from the vehicle occupants or others present. Many blind pedestrians seem to be so distracted and so easily distracted that they make poor judgment calls. In a lot of cases they can easily cause serious injury or death. It is this type of blind obedience that is likely to lead to collisions. Therefore, I would not recommend blind pedestrians make the crossing.


It is also important to remember that if a pedestrian who can't see is forced to cross the street without seeing, there are often times when the pedestrians could have gotten out of the way. It seems to me that many drivers who refuse to let a blind pedestrian cross the street feel more justified in telling the pedestrian to get out of the way when a pedestrian can barely see. In fact, it is my impression that a majority of motorists are willing to let a blind pedestrian cross the street without seeing because they simply don't feel that the pedestrian should be allowed in the crosswalk. In addition, several times in this scenario, the driver will cite some other safety hazard which involves a blind pedestrian being able to cross the roadway safely. They also tend to feel that a blind pedestrian crossing the street would cause an immediate accident. In my opinion, those driving these vehicles are using blind obedience as a scapegoat to escape their responsibility in their own vehicles.

Another important consideration is that blind pedestrians must be careful not to force the driver to go past them. It is my personal opinion that many of these blind pedestrian are afraid to even approach the driver if he doesn't want to cross the street. This is because they don't want to be called ""trouble"" on their own and they have a fear of being hurt. Furthermore, some of these blind pedestrians will not approach the driver's vehicle in the first place and will go behind a parked vehicle either to go into a convenience store or to a store that sells fresh produce if the driver didn't want to cross the street.

All in all, I believe that blind and visually impaired pedestrians are frequently not the best judgment based on pedestrian crossing decisions. They are often mistaken and are subject to dangerous wrong decisions. This often results in collisions. Nevertheless, I do hope that their blind obedience can help them become more aware of the rules of the road and how to handle the situation."
Question: Is it Crohn's disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can Crohn's disease be cured?

Answer: Yes, Crohn's disease can be cured. One case study of a patient who had an undifferentiated polyp on the left side of his pancreas (but who had no symptoms of C.d.) was used for testing the disease. The patient had no known autoimmune disease(s), and it was a relatively rare disease at that time. The polyp had been growing for 6 years. After an exploratory biopsy, it was found that the polyp had been growing for 15 years. It is believed that this is a disease that requires a multidisciplinary approach, including all parts of the immune system, including the inflammatory cells, the lymphocytes in the blood, and the lymphatic system. The patient's immune system reacted immediately and began working to destroy this new polyp, which had been growing for 15 years. The patient also had a strong inflammatory response to the infection. He subsequently experienced moderate fatigue, a lot of abdominal bloating, bloating that was severe enough that he had to be admitted to the hospital to manage a leaky appendix. The physician had to do two surgeries because he was unable to control the abdominal pain. The patient was eventually able to manage the infection and also to successfully treat the cancer.

Answer: The immune system was working so well that it was capable of eliminating the inflamed tissue. It did not need immunotherapy, a specific infection therapy, or the intervention of an advanced surgical procedure.

Question: If there is a vaccine, which bacteria do the vaccines protect against? Write an abstract that answers the Question: What is the role of vaccines in protecting people against infection?

Answer: The immunization of people against disease may be accomplished either by a single component vaccine that has been genetically engineered to target a particular pathogen or through a combination vaccine, where multiple components of the vaccine have been combined to provide protection. The immune system can be taught to recognize and activate individual components of the vaccine, but only if it is provided with the correct kind of antigen.

Question: The medical literature is replete with warnings about vaccine reactions. Do there exist any clinical trials that have evaluated the safety of vaccines?

Answer: The Medical Hypotheses Institute publishes a monthly compilation of adverse events associated with vaccines and their effects. It is a good way of keeping abreast of what is new and what is ongoing in the vaccine issue. At some point during each month of the compilation, we will publish a survey of all known adverse events.

Question: Are there any vaccines that will be recommended for young children before we have a better understanding of the immunogenic mechanisms responsible for the protection of young children? Write an abstract that answers the Question: And is it safe for them to be vaccinated?

Answer: As far as I know, there are no vaccines that will be recommended for children who are age 18 years old before we have some knowledge about the immunogenic mechanisms responsible for the protection of young children.

Question: Which vaccines are the most harmful and why? Write an abstract that answers the Question: Which vaccines cause harmful side effects?

Answer: There are 7 vaccines that have been used worldwide in childhood, and 5 of these have been associated with severe allergic reactions or are associated with serious illness. One of the vaccines, hepatitis B vaccine, caused a high rate of neurological adverse reactions and at least six cases of chronic fatigue syndrome, as well as a significant increase in the incidence of asthma, which was also more prevalent in vaccine recipients. The influenza vaccine caused multiple hospitalizations that affected both young and old persons.

Question: Why does the United States have the highest incidence rates of diseases involving the immune system? Write an abstract that answers the Question: I have been asking about those diseases in order to understand why are vaccines so controversial in America. What is the reason? What should a rational immunologist be doing to help with this problem?

Answer: I do not know the answer to question number 1. There is a well established link between vaccines and health issues. Vaccines act as an anchor on the system of the immune system. The system gets upset when the immune system gets stressed, and vaccines serve a useful role in balancing the immune system out.

Question: One of the big problems that parents have in the vaccination debates is the confusion involved the issue. As parents with children, we face a similar dilemma to doctors and other medical people. What is your answer to this dilemma and what can each of us do in the fight to protect our young children from vaccine-associated diseases while they are still young?

Answer: I would advise all parents to seek the advice of those professionals who have spent a lot of time studying the topic, and have seen enough data to know what they are talking about.

Question: Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does multimodal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervical somatic tinnitus?

Answer: All questions posed are answered in the Abstract, and the answer to the question will be presented in a poster presented at the conference.

Cervical Physical Therapy

Multi-modal cervical physical therapy (MMPT)

Cervical physical therapy is a non-invasive and non-controversial modality for improving quality of life (PH) in persons with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). In recent years, MMPT has become the preferred treatment by many physicians and healthcare professionals, because it can be delivered by a variety of patients, the treatment is inexpensive, and patients are generally quite satisfied.

In addition to its perceived benefits, MMPT is also effective because most people can be treated with cervical physical therapy, whether primary or as their first treatment for CST. Many patients with CST complain of inadequate and poorly controlled tinnitus, so it may be helpful to treat this situation by improving quality of life.

Some patients with CST complain of a variety of symptoms. For example, some complain of a ""crackling"" sound in the ears when thinking and others also complain of ringing in the ears, an annoying tingling sensation, and general fatigue that can persist over a period of weeks or months. These problems can be quite distressing.

While these symptoms do not mean there is a physical issue, they are often associated with tinnitus. Therefore, to address the symptoms while ensuring optimal treatment results, MMPT is often used in patients with CST.

Some of the more important side effects of MMPT, though not common, include headache, tension, insomnia, increased frequency of sleep during the day, and anxiety. All the aforementioned symptoms are usually manageable without treatment, and are in small increments. A small improvement in quality of life requires treating all tinnitus symptoms without any special treatment.

Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus in Women

Mild Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus in Women A woman with cervical somatotonia may occasionally have moderate-to-mild tinnitus that is associated with difficulty in sleeping, with or without headaches. She may have decreased vision, visual sensations, and/or headache, as well as headaches, anxiety, and/or tension. Cervical sensory vagaries tend to impair her normal ability to fall asleep [23].

Causes of Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus

Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus in Women Many different diseases and environmental factors may cause Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus (CST). Many of these conditions or factors can cause some or all of these symptoms. Other conditions such as:

Tinnitus as a result of hearing loss

Tinnitus as a result of brain tumors for example, glioblastoma and brain stem seizure

Tinnitus as a result of heart disease; however, in women this occurs less often than it does in men, particularly women with large arteries, such as the coronary arteries

Tinnitus as a result of thyroid dysfunction; most females with Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus have some level of thyroid dysfunction [23]

Lack of sleep

Cervicogenic Somatic Tinnitus in Men

Many different conditions and environmental factors may cause Tinnitus in Men. Some of these conditions include:

Lack of sleep

Mouth aches, stomach discomfort, and headaches

Tinnitus as a result of depression, especially depression of the bipolar type or depression which is not being treated

Tendency to overexertion

Tight muscles

Dangers of MMPT

Although the risk of serious adverse effects of MMPT is very low compared to those of many other therapies, the risks do exist. With the increase of MMPT use, and a consequent increase in the use of non-invasive technologies such as tinnitus generators, tinnitus is becoming more common [30].

Tinnitus in the MMPT Treatment

Tinnitus in the MMPT treatment differs from typical tinnitus treatment. MMPT is often discussed as another possible treatment for CST, where the procedure is actually a combination of treatments. Some patients benefit by combining treatments because they are able to achieve similar results with other therapies. However, combining treatments does not always result in optimal effectiveness, and this will require some flexibility in the combination.

One of the issues to consider is when to discontinue treatment with a specific treatment or treatment combination that has significant therapeutic benefit. It is important for patients to receive some information not only about the current status"

The above answers have allowed us to examine multiple phenotypes and demonstrate the validity of diagnostic criteria and treatments based on them. For many, their first symptom is sputum, and many of the symptoms that are experienced are the result of asthma. For others, their symptoms have no symptomatology at all, and the diagnosis is based solely on a history of sputum or pulmonary pathology, which is difficult and has not been verified in most cases with current testing. In addition, this article will summarize the work of Dr. K.C. Fenn to evaluate the use of a diagnostic tool based on the above criteria, which is the SPMP (Sputum Pollution Measurement Protocol - a standardized way to obtain clinical information to help clinicians diagnose asthma).

The SPMP Test [PDF 2] was developed in 1975, and remains one of the most established ways to diagnose asthma since the advent of the test. It is based on sputum sampling or breath testing, and the procedure is usually conducted from face to face. The test is done on each individual, once a year - this is done by drawing a sample of lung specimens and allowing them to rest in a solution of a dilute form of 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOH) in water for 30 minutes. The sputum will be diluted to about 1% NaOH in warm water. After the test, a culture of the test material is taken for further testing. For the current study, which is a retrospective analysis of 1,979 consecutive patients, this procedure was done on 892 patients, and 1,979 of the total population had an asthma diagnosis and a sputum test taken. The results indicate that approximately 2/3rds of the patients with the most severe symptoms had a positive SPMP test, and that a sputum test is generally more valid than a diagnostic study of the breath. SPMP testing has been shown to demonstrate false positives and false negatives with very low sensitivity and very high specificity. SPMP screening is also more sensitive than other diagnostic tests when the time period between screening and test is prolonged.

The SPMP is recommended for diagnostic purposes for patients who are symptomatic or with known or suspected infection in their lung or sputum. If the patient becomes symptomatic or suspects that he/she may have infection, a sputum or pulmonary exam is usually performed and the patient is further screened for possible lung infections. The SPMP Test is less useful for patients who are healthy and have no history of lung disease or infection, since such a person would probably have had the infection in the past and it would not be possible to determine if an infection is present on the date of the test. Moreover, this test gives low specificity, as some of it is specific for Sputum Pollution Measurement Protocol- a urine sputum sample that was collected 30 minutes after the SPMP test.

Abstract

Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PAVM) and its phorbol esters modulate cell viability via S. aureus bacteraemia

Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PAVM) is a small molecular peptide that has been shown to induce bacteraemia in a number of organisms, including S. aureus (AIDA-2014-0747). Therefore, the present study examined the direct bactericidal activity of PAVM on S. aureus (Staphylococcus aureus) cells at various viability states and in S. aureus cells treated with low, medium, or high concentrations of PAVM (0.2, 0.4, and 1 mg/ml). For treatment at 0.2 mg/ml, the percentage of viable cells was significantly increased after a 16 h incubation (P < 0.01) irrespective of the medium. After 16 h of incubation with PAVM at 0.4 mg/ml, there was no significant increase in viable cells (6.5%). During recovery from incubation at high concentrations 0.2 mg/ml, viable cells could not be recovered from the medium (6.8%), but recovered from the high concentration (7.2%) and recovered a much higher percentage than from the medium (6.3%). Treatment with low concentrations of PAVM at 0.4 mg/ml induced a strong bactericidal effect only at a 12 h incubation and only the medium increased viable cells (0.3%). The effect was even weaker when the medium was not changed after 12 h.

Clinical Perspective: Surgical technique is the primary determinant of mortality risk in patients with metabolic diseases.1 With CABG and PANCRELL, the majority of the patients had preoperative glycemic parameters (ie, fasting blood glucose concentrations between 70 and 100 mg/dL) that significantly improved by night-time or postoperative day 3 from preoperative glycemic profiles at day 4. Patients experienced a significantly higher rate of mortality in the CABG group (22%) compared to the PANCRELL group (13%), and the patients in the PANCRELL group experienced a significantly higher rate of mortality from all causes (40.9%) compared to the CABG group (26.7%), except for endocrine syndrome. Based on these findings, Surgical Technique-controlled survival may be considered when the patient is hospitalized overnight after PANCRELL for hypoglycemia only, or PANCRELL is performed at day 4 and the patients have preoperative glycemic profiles (above the current recommendations of the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology for the control of diabetes). However, preoperative glycemic profiles are not sufficient to predict or prevent the development of endocrine or metabolic complications; in fact, it is very likely that in patients with metabolic syndrome, early changes to preoperative glycemic profile result in increased endocrine and metabolic complications, independent of preoperative glycemic profile.

Discussion: In this study, patients in the PANCRELL group had significantly decreased risk of dying from any cause. The PANCRELL group had significantly higher mortality rates from all causes (45.9% of the PANCRELL group versus 20.7%) except for endocrine syndrome. The low-end of the risk associated with glycemic control, and the high prevalence of preoperative glycemic profile, suggests that those with risk factors may be more likely to develop complications, regardless of their preoperative glycemic profile. The findings support the recommendations for patients with a preoperative glycemic profile to control their blood glucose. The majority of the patients in the PANCRELL group experienced decreased insulin resistance after PANCRELL, but some had insulin resistance while in the surgery. As such, insulin level may not provide a significant benefit in these patients. The results of this study should be used for the early detection of hypoglycemia during PANCRELL and PICP (see PICP section).

Introduction

Dietary intervention is often considered a part of the standard regimen for patients with noncommunicable diseases. However, many of the noncommunicable diseases are associated with abnormal glycemic control, with glycemic control being an objective measure that increases the likelihood that symptoms will disappear.2 It is commonly assumed that a dietary intervention should not be a substitute for or an alternative to traditional medical therapies.3 As such, the question whether or not a dietary intervention is more effective"
Question: Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer? Include any results that show a difference between the two treatments in your abstract.

The answers to questions 1-4 are as follows:

There is little information on the treatment of primary rectal cancer by positron emission tomography. It is assumed that the same radiographic technique of MRI used for other diagnostic imaging will be used and that the results of the imaging will be comparable when used in a radiology exam.

The benefits of positron emission tomography from a radiology perspective include improved overall diagnosis and a better understanding of cancer at its earliest onset.

The risks of use of positron emission tomography include significant potential for misdiagnoses.

It is not known whether the results of PET imaging are diagnostic or not, so the utility of PET imaging in general radiology remains uncertain.

It was not possible to assess the usefulness of PET imaging in improving detection of cancer by imaging before radiation therapy.

The use of PET for the screening of cancer is only for people aged 16-74 years.

Other imaging modalities are currently under development and are expected to be used in future years.

There is little information on what fraction of individuals with chronic disease will not benefit from positron emission tomography, so the results of PET imaging are only useful for those of normal or borderline distribution.

A total of 4 studies have assessed the benefit and risks of CT for the treatment of cancers of the rectum, and no difference between CT for rectal cancer versus conventional radiographic evaluation was found. The data reported in none of the studies presented in this article is specific to rectal cancer.

It is unknown if the results from PET imaging are diagnostic or not, so the utility of PET imaging in general radiology remains uncertain.

A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that PET may be more useful for early colorectal cancer when compared with MRI. The article is not specific to rectal cancer or has only brief descriptions of PET findings; however, the article suggests that PET may be more useful in early cases of colorectal cancer. It should be noted that we have no clinical experience with PET imaging in the treatment of rectal cancer. One limitation of PET imaging is that PET appears to have an increased sensitivity for detecting cancer of the rectum, compared with MR (1).

It was also mentioned that PET imaging is less invasive with a shorter hospital stay. It was also pointed out that MRI is more difficult to use than PET but does not result in a more complete image. Some reports have reported that PET imaging may have a higher risk of complications and, on one hand, may be considered a cost saving measure by radiologists. It may be important to note that PET scan can be a more expensive diagnostic modality that requires a longer hospital stay that allows more aggressive treatment.


Conclusion and recommendations

PATIENT INFORMATION

Patients should be aware that PET scans may be more invasive compared with MR and that the scan may not detect any structural abnormalities such as abnormalities in the prostate, testes, and/or ovaries that might indicate cancer of these organs. PET is usually performed before radiation therapy for some cancers such as rectal cancer because of the higher cost of the PET scanner. The benefits of PET imaging from a radiology perspective can also include a better understanding of at its earliest onset. There is little information for the benefit of PET for the screening of colon cancer, although a limited amount of data is available. No study was found. PET is considered to be more costeffective as a diagnostic modality than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some data suggest that PET may be more cost effective at first diagnosis in the early stage of colorectal cancer when compared with MRI at the same age (3). There are no specific guidelines for the use of PET.

PET has potential for reducing the costs of radiotherapy with radiographers working within their limited resources being able to make an informed choice for how to proceed in screening patients who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer. There is limited literature in the radiology literature on the use of PET vs. MRI when evaluating colorectal cancer. It should be noted that a trial or meta-analysis of prospective trials has not been conducted. It is unknown if PET is more useful for early colorectal cancer than in the screening phase of cancer screening. There are currently no studies on the use of PET imaging in the treatment of rectal cancer for whom there is a specific clinical need for assessment to obtain the best clinical outcome. There is limited information for the benefit of PET in the screening stage of rectal cancer when compared with MR at the same age. There are no data that PET image may suggest increased risk of complication. PET imaging may result in the need for ongoing"
Question: Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Answering this Question will help you to increase your knowledge on scientific questions related to medical tidal volume and to improve the accuracy of your tidal volume.

Step 1: Answer the Question 1) In this experiment: To make a difference of 3 minutes in the duration of your breathing, use a 3-minute ""no-resuscitation"" method and to make a difference of 2 minutes in the duration of your breathing, use a 2-minute ""resuscitation"" method. 2) Is it possible to deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitators? Yes. To do it, follow the procedures outlined in the answer. It works and has the highest accuracy (within 5 centimeters) of any practical technique I know of.

It should be clear that the experiment above is just a simple experiment with 5 subjects, and it does not take into account many factors that would influence the results. Therefore, I would emphasize, following the answers, that the accuracy of the test depends on the degree of skill and experience of the participant. But of course, the best way to achieve complete accuracy is to use a machine!"

Question: Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children?

Caveat: All of the questions about VLEM have already been answered by Dr. Siegel in a separate question on the same subject. However, the question about the endoscopic demonstration of the lesion should be presented as an objective scientific problem and not an opinion, due to the relative inadequacy of many of the criteria used by surgeons today. In particular, VLEM is often seen without any symptoms, and a single diagnosis can be difficult to establish. In fact, the diagnosis does not usually correlate well with any endoscopic findings; and in addition, the evaluation is often poorly performed, and the diagnosis may change with each subsequent assessment. We wish to clarify the present discussion with respect to the diagnosis of VLEM.

Question: Is VLEM a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children?

Caveat: An important consideration in the assessment of the symptoms of VLEM is whether there is evidence for a systemic lesion and its distribution. However, it is likely that a small number of patients who have such signs are not true patients with esophagitis even after a detailed inquiry.

Question: Is VLEM associated with a significant increase in risk for death in young children?

Caveat: The study was designed mainly to evaluate risk for death in young patients, and no deaths occurred. No significant elevations in mortality were detected, although there are a number of reasons why it might be so: for example, in children diagnosed with VLEM, the incidence of pneumonia is higher, but the mortality associated with pneumonia and aspiration are substantially lower in children with acute otitis media. In addition, a decrease in mortality associated with VLEM may also be due to improved clinical management of the disease.

Question: Is VLEM associated with an increased risk for recurrent upper gastrointestinal tract abscesses in children?

Caveat: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract abscesses is similar in children with VLEM and without. In addition, the risk of recurrent abscesses is inversely related to the extent of the esophageal mucosa lesions."
Question: Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events? Ask Aneesa for assistance You are already enrolled in Aneesa's free 30-day, no obligation evaluation.

If that isn't enough, if you're still thinking about joining? Here are a few interesting facts:

Hypoglycaemia is not the same for everyone. It's more common in populations without type 1 diabetes, including those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). It's also more common for those with insulin resistance (IR) or severe kidney disease. If you are hypoglycemic, there is an increased risk of death, stroke, or kidney failure. People with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk for stroke than those who don't have the disease. Hypoglycaemia is the most serious of all symptoms of hypoglycemia. In an ICU, it may help get the nurse or doctor thinking: ""When this person is in our care, there's a good chance (greater than 50%) that the hypoglycaemia will be treated."" Ask Aneesa about diabetes management of hypoglycaemia, which you can learn more about the links below.

Question: Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are there radiographic differences between Aganglionosis in Hirschsprung's disease?

Answer: There seem to be no radiographic abnormalities in the presence and absence of the disease. The authors conclude that despite the limitations in the sample size, an apparent radiation transition cannot be ruled out. However, other mechanisms of aganglionosis such as vascular changes and lymphocyte growth are proposed and should be considered when diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease [1, 2]. This paper also provides an interpretation of the results to provide guidance on the nature of the radiographic transitions.

Background: In 1986, the authors of the Hirschsprung's disease study conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a whole-body mass spectrometer. They used a whole brain mass spectrometer, coupled to a radiographic system which was able to demonstrate distinct changes in the area of the brain at the lateral side of the sulcus. Radiographic evidence of Hirschsprung's disease was seen. A subsequent meta-analysis of the same study identified five different mechanisms of change, and the authors were able to identify some of these mechanisms (Figure 1):

1. Increased lymphocyte density (i.e., increased number of lymphocytes).

2. Decreased lymphocyte density (i.e., decreased number of lymphocytes).

3. Decrease in lymphocyte subtype (i.e., decreased number of lymphocytes from the different subtypes).

4. Decrease in lymphocyte phenotype (i.e., decreased number of lymphocytes with distinct features).

5. Decreased the number of lymphocytes with no detectable features; such as nucleated, non-neutrophil, immature, or mature lamina propria.

There are still some questions that remain. To our knowledge this is the first time that a study identified a functional change of this nature in the whole brain using MRI.

2D Brain Imaging in Hirschsprung's Disease

2D Imaging in Hirschsprung's disease (HDS) is an alternative to 2C T1-weighted images. Since the mid-1980s, a group of researchers based in the University of Southern Denmark and in Denmark has been conducting 2D imaging on an MRI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), a disease that affects ∼20% of the world population. T2D is characterized by an altered ability to regulate blood sugar and blood pressure, which in turn leads to a decline in quality of life. As patients present with multiple features that should be considered in a diagnosis of T2D, such as the above problems at the level of the cerebellum, a diagnosis of T2D with 2D imaging has become possible. In this study, 25 patients (9 men and 9 women with T2D were scanned through the MRI) were evaluated for 2D changes by 2D imaging.

Abstract

I. Overview

Corticosteroids, which are systemic steroids, suppress inflammation in the lung mainly via their direct action on T‐ and B‐cells. They are administered in the form of a pill that is either administered directly or in a syrup containing prednisone (pre‐ and post‐exposure) as an active drug.

Corticosteroids are currently used to treat respiratory disease of various types and age groups in children and adults when either: (i) they are insufficient to control the disease or are contraindicated because of potential safety concerns regarding the short‐ and long‐term effects; or (ii) the disease continues to progress. They are used most commonly in children for asthma where corticosteroids lower the levels of inflammatory mediators and facilitate the formation of stable T‐ and B‐cell clones, particularly during exacerbations. The aim of the current review was to assess the use of corticosteroids in asthma in infants, toddlers, adolescents and adults and the efficacy of oral prednisone in these patients.

II. Studies in infants

Cases of severe wheeze and severe wheezing in infants were previously reviewed in reflux and recurrent ear infection (reviewed by Estrada et al. 2002).1 Our review of studies published from December 2008 to December 2011 showed that oral prednisone was superior to dexamethasone in treating wheezing. In addition, dexamethasone was superior to oral prednisone in treating wheezing of infants over six months of age.4

Children older than six months were not evaluated.

In an analysis of the medical records of more than 500 patients who were referred with wheezing and wheezing associated with an exacerbation of wheezing in children aged less than six months, it was concluded that oral prednisone has a moderate efficacy in preventing wheezing and wheezing associated with wheezing in children, whereas dexamethasone has a more favorable and consistent effect.5 In an analysis of wheezing in children aged less than six months with exacerbation of wheezing of more than six months duration, oral prednisone was superior to dexamethasone in preventing wheezing, whereas dexamethasone caused less reduction in clinical severity of wheezing accompanied by wheezing (which persisted for at least 5 days).6

III. Studies in toddlers and adolescents

Cases of wheezing and wheezing with wheeze and other symptoms of asthma are associated with an exacerbation in the child's asthma. The use of oral prednisone to control asthma exacerbations was evaluated in pediatric and adolescent patients with wheeze or wheezing associated with wheezing for whom this could not be controlled easily by oral antibiotic medication. The prevalence of wheeze associated with wheezing in the US population aged less than one year increased from 6·3 to 41·9% between 2001‐02 and 2008‐09.7

The duration over which wheezing increased was significantly associated with duration of oral prednisone treatment. In the most recent study of wheezing severity in children aged less than six months, the cumulative severity of wheezing in the last four days was higher in subjects treated with oral prednisone than in those treated with oral corticosteroid medication.2 However, the authors point out that this is the first study comparing the efficacy of oral prednisone treatment and oral corticosteroid medication in reducing the cumulative severity of wheeze in the children.

There are reports of the use of steroids that are selective for T cells in the treatment of wheezing with wheezing associated with wheezing (e.g. dexamethasone).2, 7 However, the effectiveness of these steroids in treating wheezing from infancy with asthma has not been studied.

IV. Studies in adults

The use of oral corticosteroid in adults is currently unknown. Oral prednisone treatment of asthma in adults is usually commenced early in the course of the disease and is not followed by dexamethasone. Studies that evaluate the effect of using corticosteroids to suppress bronchospasm are also lacking. In the review of data derived from observational case–control studies in adults, dexamethasone was shown to be effective in reducing the symptom severity of wheeze from infancy to the end of childhood.2 Another potential"

Results: In a nationally representative survey of primary care physicians, only 24.5 per cent supported prescribing antibiotics for all non-skin symptoms; 18.1 per cent prescribed when there was no apparent skin symptoms (i.e., it was not the patient who had the non-skin problem); and 3.5 per cent recommended when skin lesions were present.

A separate survey of dermatologists (N=813) yielded similar findings.

Conclusion: An overwhelming majority of primary care practitioners and dermatologists, in fact, believe an appropriate response is to consider antibiotic use in the diagnosis of skin conditions, regardless of the skin signs and symptoms.

Question: Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases?

Question: What is the most effective intervention in reducing disease progression? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the most effective intervention in reducing disease progression?

Response: A comprehensive program of surgical, surgical-associated disease management and palliative care has been shown to effectively reduce disease progression in men with metastatic disease, while preserving or improving the quality of life [1). Further studies are needed to characterize the efficacy of palliative care options.

Question: When should I go for a physical examination? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: When should I go for a physical examination?

Response: Although prostate imaging studies have not found a benefit in evaluating the prostate during physical examinations, a health care provider should test a man's prostate in the presence of prostate cancer, for the following reasons:

If the prostate is being examined for a high-risk disease, one should also perform an ultrasonography scan of the prostate for symptoms of prostate cancer as well as its development or progression.

If the prostate is being examined for a high-risk disease, one should also perform a cystoscopy to examine the prostate gland for any presence of nodules or metastases.

Prostate ultrasound has been found to be of minor benefit in determining whether a man is at high-risk for prostate cancer [1].

Question: Why aren't the screening results accurate in screening the entire population? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Why aren't the screening results accurate in screening the entire population?

Response: Prostate cancer screening has become an important part of clinical practice, with over 60% of men participating in prostate cancer screening programs to be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetimes [2].

The majority of men who have been found to have prostate cancer will remain free of prostate cancer during their lifetimes. However, when men are found to have prostate cancer, screening will result in an increased likelihood of recurrence, and some men who progress into prostate cancer will die of the disease. A recent study of data from prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing revealed that the majority of prostate cancer tests do not detect cases of advanced or invasive disease [3].

For more information on PSA testing for prostate cancer, consult our online reference, Surgical Options for Prostate Cancer Screening for Up-to-Date and Practical Suggestions [4].

Question: What are the most common causes of recurrent or relapsed prostate disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the most common causes of recurrent or relapsed prostate disease?

Response: About a third of men with prostate cancer will continue to have recurring or relapsed disease for the rest of their lives, and approximately 5% of men will experience death from prostate cancer within the first five years of treatment [5].

Prostate cancer treatment often is more complicated than is initially apparent to patients. Atrial fibrillation, for example, is a relatively rare tumor that is not associated with an increased risk for death in clinical trials. However, in individuals with atrial fibrillation, the incidence of progressive disease (increased size of tumors, decreased appearance of a man's urethra, and/or increased pain) is more severe when compared with men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)—and most of these men never complete prostate cancer treatment [6,7].

The most common causes of recurrence are benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) [6,8].

Question: How many years of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) do I need to develop an advanced disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How many years of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) do I need to develop an advanced disease?

Response: The clinical management of men with advanced prostate cancer depends primarily on the clinical outcome of their disease.

For men with symptomatic disease of advanced disease, a total PSA level of 7 ng/mL is needed to diagnose BPH, and a total PSA level of 8 ng/mL is needed to diagnose benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is a non-invasive tumor that does not cause symptoms.

In patients with recurrence (>10 years), a minimum total PSA level of 16 ng/mL provides a positive indicator for diagnosis as do a minimum total PSA"
Question: Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory?

To answer the Question, we define a cycloplegic region. A cycloplegic region is defined as a region with one or more longitudinal peaks. The longitudinal peaks of a cycloplegic region have a peak height of

where P is the peak height of each peak and is the peak height of that peak in the cycloplegic region. The peak heights in cycloplegic regions of a given age may be different from one another (or vice versa), depending on the characteristics or number or size of the longitudinal peaks of that specific longitudinal peak. Thus, it is not easy to define the overall peak height of a cycloplegic region; one can try to define the peak heights of two or more consecutive peak peaks, in which case the average peak height of the cycloplegic region is determined by considering the cumulative mean of all peaks of the cycloplegic region (using the standard definition of cycloplegic regions). However, there is no one definition, but a range of definitions. A cycloplegic region may exist for up to two days, which is long enough to allow the cycloplegic region to be cycloplegically processed. In the case of the average peak height being 2.5 mm, there are six peaks and the peak heights range from 2.0-2.4 mm. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that cycloplegic regions are different from one another, but cycloplegic regions tend to be longer in duration.

It is interesting to note that the average peak height is directly related to the cycloplegic region's age: The average peak height is almost identical at the ages of 10-60 y, and the peak heights increase progressively with age. It is also interesting that the average peak height is smaller as the age increases:

Why the average peak height is decreased by age, but the average peak height does not fall within a specified level, is not clear. However, the cycloplegic region is the only type of region that has the ability to accumulate a sufficient amount of cycloplegic material. Thus, cycloplegic materials accumulate the fastest at the ages when an increase in cycloplegic activity occurs and then disappear when the cycloplegic period is completed and the cycloplegic material is no longer available. It is interesting to note that the average peak height does not decline when a cycloplegic period is completed or a cycloplegic material is not available:

Note that there is a decrease in the average peak height after age 20 y. This is also evident when the average peak height is measured by two observers, but it is not observed when the peak height is measured by independent observers.

The following plot on this Web page demonstrates the relationship between average peak heights and cycloplegic period:

For more details on cycloplegic period distribution, see This table on this page compares cycloplegic period and cycloplegic height, and shows the increase and decrease in peak heights over time, showing that peak heights tend to decrease and peak heights increase over age.

However, for more details, see the following chapter in the following section of the Web site. You can also view a more detailed discussion on cycloplegic periodicities in this web site.

We believe that cycloplegic periodicities exist. However, as was pointed out in the previous section and the following chapter in the Web site, it is difficult to observe them directly because the cycloplegic material is extremely concentrated, and the rate of accumulation of cycloplegic material during the cycloplegic period is very low. Furthermore, if you can monitor a cycloplegic activity for a few weeks, you might observe a periodicity like the one shown above, but not an accumulation of material like the one seen in the data:

Cycloplegic periodicities are very large, and the number of cycloplegic periodicities could be many millions. However, we do not believe that cycloplegic periodicities need to be investigated in detail, and it is far more likely that no cycloplegic periodicities exist.

We believe that cycloplegic periodicities are common in all populations, but the question should be asked, why is there a difference? This question is related to: Why is it that women, or people of color, or young adults tend to show a higher growth rate during the first few years of life, and a reduction in growth rate after their teens? It should be noted that these are all important questions for the development of our understanding about the growth and maturation processes of different ages.

Why is cycloplegic period varying from"
Question: Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients?"" This is a study of the feasibility of ultrasonography in the screening of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in adults. The goal is to reduce the invasive and noninvasive use of anti-CT scans and to achieve more accurate and accurate imaging.

The rationale for this study is that screening versus aggressive diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasonography, could help reduce unnecessary testing of patients with advanced and advanced clinical and histological metastatic disease and is a significant part in the clinical management of patients. Current radiologic guidelines are not optimal. The objective of screening was to identify individuals at increased risk of advanced and advanced metastatic disease. In addition, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, more aggressive imaging techniques and procedures could improve both accuracy and efficacy and ultimately improve prognosis. Ultrasonography of the liver or biliary system was performed for the determination of hepatocellular presence and size.

Patients were enrolled from the New England Cancer Center (NECC) in Boston, Massachusetts. This was a randomised crossover trial involving 10 healthy adults aged 24-60 years with primary hepatocellular carcinoma as defined by liver biopsy performed within 3 weeks of diagnosis. Randomization was stratified by age-matched population-based samples. At screening, participants were randomly assigned to either screening and ultrasonography (N=18), non-detective ultrasonography, which included scanning and clinical assessment of the liver and biliary system (N=18), or control groups (N=17). All participants were assessed at 3 weeks before and after the first ultrasound scan.

Of 178 participants screened on ultrasound, 58% were assigned to the screening and ultrasonography groups. At 10 weeks, there were significantly fewer patients in the ultrasonography group compared with the screening and non-detective ultrasonography group (P=0.017), but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.4) (see Supplementary Table 8, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). There was no difference in survival after 11 weeks between the groups. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups for progression-free survival (P=0.03).

Follow-up ultrasound of the liver and biliary system from 22,927 patients showed statistically significant differences between the groups (P=0.025) (see Supplementary Table 9, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). A substantial proportion of these patients had metastatic disease, with significantly less metastatic biopsy-associated adverse events in the ultrasonography than in the screening and non-detective ultrasonography groups across all 4 biopsy sites (P=0.001). In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatocellular sarcoma, the ultrasonography group had significantly more biopsy-associated adverse events at all 4 biopsy sites compared with the screening and non-detective ultrasonography group (P=0.023). In general, ultrasound did not show any significant differences in post-detection adverse events between the groups (P=0.94).

Discussion

The present study shows that screening or surveillance of secondary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improved the prognosis in the majority of patients. Patients with advanced and advanced metastases that can be diagnosed with ultrasonography had improved prognosis compared with patients whose primary histological diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma.

Many of those who were assigned to the screening vs. non-detective ultrasonography groups reported favourable results. In addition, there was a substantial improvement in progression-free survival compared with the screening and non-detective ultrasonography groups, although a statistically significant difference was not statistically significant at 12 weeks.

There are two potential limitations to this study. Firstly, as ultrasonography is an inpatient procedure, the size of this cohort may not provide generalisable estimates comparing it to larger non-institutionalised populations. Secondly, in previous studies of this type, such as our study, asymptomatic patients have improved survival when ultrasonography is shown to be effective [4]. We believe that the general applicability of this current study is higher than previous studies based on our data, although further analysis is required to make that judgement.

In order to reduce the number of patients who have a non-detective ultrasonography result, a trial with more patients for whom ultrasound is indicated should be conducted. In fact, if any other procedure can improve prognosis, it would be preferable to have such a trial. We suspect that our results would be very similar if"
"Question: ""Would a man smell a rose then throw it away? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Is it true that a man can smell the smell of a rose?""


A: Yes, there is an answer to your Question. It's a scientific answer to your question in every possible scientific and medical sense.


Q: Can I bring an article of art to your laboratory?


A: An article of art is considered by many to be an asset to your laboratory and is worth much more on the open market than on your bench of scientific ideas. A number of people have asked me for an account of an extraordinary manuscript. In it, I have listed the title of the author, his address, the author's passport number. These are invaluable but are not the only valuable items you can collect. I have also left a lot of items and letters from friends and colleagues regarding the article, including photographs.

Q: ""What are some common mistakes in the science written by people we admire?""


A: Not all of us have good taste and therefore we may also put what we admire in a more general category. Scientists are human. However they often make mistakes. The errors we may make in our writing are due in large part to the fact that we have not had any experience in scientific writing.


Q: ""Did I make any mistakes in my writing?""


A: No, you did.


Q: If someone should like our work but can't find it, would he appreciate the advice and the explanation we provide?


A: Yes, if you would also like to see our work. I would be happier than anybody to see some of it.


Q: If you think there is something wrong with someone's work, what could you do?


A: There are many ways you can correct something. In some cases no amount of correction can justify the errors or the failure to reproduce (in a clear and convincing way) the original results.


Q: ""Is it possible to correct one-sided thinking in a scientific paper?""


A: Only if the person does not believe in himself. Otherwise, it's not easy.


Q: How can you be certain which ideas people will take into their work? Have you ever done this? ""If you work for a company and you know what you are doing, and work you know you are capable of, it seems clear that you have not put out a paper to discredit your employer.""


A: No. But as you know, this is a possibility, and the only way to find this out is to ask, ""Have you ever done this?"" Yes, it may sometimes be possible to prove that someone is wrong but the truth cannot always be made even stronger by doing so. There are some, of course, who have proved their right, and some who have shown that they were wrong.


Q: Why is it so difficult to change people's opinions, especially about new questions?


A: As far as ideas are concerned, you may have to be careful which ideas you want people to take into a scientific paper. I once got a suggestion for a new idea after I was convinced that some ideas were wrong, and I decided to do the work to find out why. I discovered that people thought I was a conservative; my father advised me to make a major change in my scientific activities.


Q: Can I bring in the materials I use with me to give to an editor?


A: When you write for scientific and medical journals in Europe, this is not an option. I do not use this option because I do not want to get in the way of others' lives. For that reason I ask for manuscripts of the authors to be printed. If you have specific instructions for someone to obtain these materials, ask for that information. I'm afraid I will have to write back and let you know. If you will only send me the papers I've made available, I would still find the time to answer your questions.


Q: What can a group of scientists do for the public?


A: I am sure I have touched upon our most common concern. However, I am not sure if you are prepared for a discussion about what we can and cannot do for the public, or what we can and cannot say. So let me try to cover the basics.


Q: What is the science that you do?


A: Research in any field. In each field, you will find people who are doing work which you themselves cannot do. If your interest in a scientific or medical field is not related to that of the individuals you talk to, go elsewhere. People can tell you a lot more about science than they can about people. It is not that you should always be trying to find out the secrets of life by asking people. If you are very curious about people's work and are going on a field tour,"
Question: Department of Transportation vs self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do those who have suffered brain injury through stroke know whether they've had a stroke, and if so, which stroke?

Answer: The most comprehensive and scientifically-accepted measure of these relationships is an epidemiological longitudinal study of stroke survivors. This study has used both medical questionnaires and in-person questionnaire interviews to ascertain whether the patient is aware that he has had a stroke, and if so, whether his stroke is a history of stroke, which might be a cause of concern, or is not a cause of concern.

(1) The Question about stroke is, however, different in different settings within the United States. In the United States National Stroke Education Program (NSEP), the Question is: ""Do you say…?"" In France, it is: ""Where did you get this kind of medical care?""

2) The Question about stroke is more common in Germany, Japan, and Denmark than in the United States.

(2) The answer to this Question is only provided if a patient is aware. It is not enough that they were born blind or have the disease; they have to know it.

Question: Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," This is an important question; however, this has not been studied in the scientific literature. Is there a good mechanism in the process of cancer formation and progression that can explain the benefits of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligands for prevention and treatment of colon cancer? I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have at this time.

Answer: Hi there. Let's be honest, this is not a question I'm used to answering, but I'm really curious to know how peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligands work on the colon and what we think causes the protective effects of these ligands. I'll keep this short and to the point so you don't have to be too verbose. Basically, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligand is designed to be activated when certain conditions occur. I think the conditions that most affect it's ability to activate are atherosclerosis, high cholesterol, high and prolonged uric acid production, inflammation, and also inflammation-induced gene expression. I think most studies have correlated those these conditions that are induced in individuals living with these conditions with higher risk for colon cancer. So, the question, of course, is which conditions cause these cancers to occur and how and why those conditions can trigger these tumors development. Is there a biochemical basis to how this works or is there an environmental effect? We've really, really yet to determine the answer to these questions. I think a very good and relevant study that's been done on the effect of peroxisome proliferators could tell us a lot about the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor initiation. It's going to take a lot of work to develop that study. We just recently did a study that was looking at the impact of lifestyle factors on colon cancer incidence. For a long time I have believed that it would only be possible to show an influence of lifestyle on colon cancer incidence based on the epidemiologic evidence, but the new study showed that it also took a diet-specific dietary intervention to influence incidence, and it was not just a diet-based approach. So, while it certainly may seem that a diet-specific dietary intervention that is a change in diet is going to prevent colon cancer, it's going to take a whole different approach that we haven't really had time to develop. I'm really interested to see what the new study shows, but I can't see how this could prove anything, because lifestyle is a massive, complex, and variable thing, and the impact of the diet is so important. The answer, I think that I've been given to this question by a few people, is that there seems to be a benefit from supplementing with these ligands, however, the mechanisms are not definitive yet and so, these are just very preliminary results that need to be verified with more definitive studies. I think anyone can look at the literature, look at the mechanisms involved, and really put a lot of thought into what the best answer actually is to that question. Unfortunately, we're so young with all the research that's happening, I'd be curious to be able to speculate at some point on whether peroxisomes are involved in colon cancer prevention or only just in prevention of a different, more malignant form of the disease. That's something that I know you have the power to do.

Question: Does self-efficacy mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does self-efficacy mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality? Why?

Results and discussion

Methods

Participants

Seven healthy young female staff members completed questionnaires assessing self-efficacy (self-perception) and sleep-related behaviours (sleep quality assessment instrument), which they completed during three occasions. The sleep conditions were the three stages of sleep with the lowest duration of sleep [night sleeping; (8~9 hours)], REM (9~10 hours) and REM + naps (11~12 hours). The participants had regular daytime work hours. All the participants were in their early 40s. They gave written informed consent to participate in the study.

Objective

Sleep quality data were collected after five days of non-stop sleeping (sleep deprivation). Sleep deprivation was defined as total minutes of sleep without any sleep episodes during any 24 hours. Participants were asked to report their average sleeping time throughout the week (before and after the daily assessment) for every four nights for each day of the week for four consecutive nights. The average sleeping time averaged for the first two nights was calculated to equal the average sleep duration of the first night. All the data were entered into a sleep diary using a version of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences [SPSS Statistics (version 20).]. All the results of sleep analyses were reported before and after the fifth day of sleep deprivation and sleep quality data were presented before and after five days of non-stop sleeping. Analyses included all the time points of three consecutive nights and the average sleep duration for the first two nights.

Results of sleep quality and sleep efficiency data

Total sleep-time was calculated by subtracting the time occupied by sleeping from that of waking activities (see below). Sleep was generally better during the first two nights (mean duration 6.1±0.5 h; SD 4.9; P<0.05), but was worse between the fourth and sixth nights at an estimated interval of 16.2±4.8 days (SD 12.6; P<0.05) when compared with baseline sleep values (mean duration 6.8±0.5 h; SD 4.9; P<0.05). During the first two nights, participants' mean maximum REM sleep was significantly (P< 0.05) longer (±4.2 h; SD 8.2; P< 0.05) than the mean REM maximum between the fourth and sixth nights (4.3±1.8 h; SD 8.4; P<0.05), and during the fifth day of sleep deprivation both total sleep time (mean duration 5.1±0.5 h; SD 4.9; P<0.05) and sleep efficiency declined.

Sleep efficiency was similarly negatively affected, in the second nights (mean time on bed/wake time 5.5±0.3 h; SD 1.8; P< 0.01), but after five days non-stop sleep deprivation was no longer associated with an increase of sleep efficiency of sleep duration (F4= −1.33, P>0.05), suggesting that sleep efficiency did not increase even in the first couple nights of the fourth week. However, within each day (see below), participants' mean total sleep-time was significantly lower when compared to wake time in the second nights (6.5±0.3 h; SD 1.8; P< 0.05). While the sleep-time was not significantly correlated in the second nights when compared with wake time, it was significantly negatively correlated at the fifth day of non-stop sleep deprivation (F4= −3.25, P>0.05), suggesting that some measure of sleep deprivation was associated with reduced total sleep of sleep duration.

Time on bed/wake time also was negatively correlated in the second nights when compared with wake time, suggesting that sleep efficiency decreased considerably when compared to wake time in the first couple nights. However, within each bed/wake time category (sleep quality: mean time on bed 26.3±7.3 min (SD 12.3); sleep efficiency: mean time on bed 29.9±9.4 min (SD 11.2), P<0.001), no significant differences (all P>0.05) showed that average number of time taken to complete bed was lower (P< 0.01) for the second stages of sleep than for the first couple nights.

In the last days (i.e. 5 days of sleep deprivation), participants had significantly fewer awakenings than during the first couple nights and more than half of this time was spent on bed, indicating a less demanding environment for sleep quality (wake time: F4= 0.63, P<0"
Question: Does microbial contamination influence the success of the hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does microbial contamination influence the success of the hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes?


A: Studies of hematopoietic transplantation demonstrate that donor, recipient, and caregiver colonization of the donor with the transplanted cell are strongly influenced by bacterial colonization.


As stated above, the contribution of bacterial colonization has been shown to be of great importance. The microbial colonization of the recipient depends on the source species, with low contamination rates being achieved with the most common pathogens. However, in certain high-risk populations of these individuals, there is much higher bacterial colonization and high mortality rates due to bacterial pathogen colonization.


To assess the relationship between his/her microbial colonization and his/her hematopoietic cellular transplant outcome, it will be important to know whether bacterial contamination is a significant factor in the outcome.


Biology: What are the main organisms found in the body of a person with hematopoietic transplantation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the main organisms found in the body of a person with hematopoietic transplantation?


RCTs and Case Reports: Two RCTs (Study 1; Case-Control Trial: Hematopoietic transplant for renal malignancies) and a randomized case-control study (Study 2) have been conducted in a single location. All but one of the studies measured colonization of the donor with the transplanted cells by bacterial bacteria using standard cell preparation methods.


These studies have found that bacterial colonization was not strongly associated with the outcomes of the cases or the controls. The authors of the Case Reports concluded that there was not enough evidence to conclude that a high baseline bacterial colonization level, after transplantation, is a protective factor.


Cancer and Other Bacterial Microorganisms: No direct clinical data to support the use of transplantants to provide organ support have been reported. Yet many believe it is possible. As a result, many transplant centers are already considering the prospect of transplanting organs from donors whose transplanted cells represent higher than normal bacterial counts. One prospective, randomized RCT has been conducted among patients with recurrent myeloma following transplantation of lymph node metastases (Nemezovitz et al; Study 1).


This study found that transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells with donor cells of a known bacterial origin was associated with a better survival rate than the same transplants with normal blood mononuclear cells.


A study comparing organ transplants from patients who had received hematopoietic cell transplants to those from patients who never had had such a transplant (Nemezovitz et al; Study 2) reported comparable survival rates and that the difference in the bacterial colonization of the donors could not be attributed to the donor's age at transplantation.


However, the data support, but do not definitively refute, the hypothesis that the higher bacterial colonization is associated with an increased risk of graft-versus-host disease in transplant recipients and that more extensive colonizations are associated with lower survival rates. Thus, it would be premature to speculate about the risks of transplants based on transplantation and patient outcomes.


The overall picture appears to be that transplants may have some benefit if the cells that are transplanted have a high degree of bacterial colonization.


SOME HUMAN EXPECTATIONS


I agree with the concept, because the transplantation of cells from a donor with a high degree of bacterial colonization enhances the clinical outcomes. However the risk of graft-versus-host disease is increased as the transplanted cells have a higher microbial burden than normal cells. What I would like the medical community to address is this: Is the risk of graft-versus-host disease greater because of transplantation of donor cells of a higher bacterial burden than normal. What I believe to be the role of the donor's age at transplantation is not known.


As a result, I will conclude the discussion by proposing three questions for research.


Question: What is the role of a donor's age at transplantation?


The use of a greater donor's age at transplantation to enhance the clinical outcomes indicates that the age at transplantation is no longer a protective factor.


A: The use of a greater donor's age at transplantation to enhance the clinical outcomes indicates that the age at transplantation is no longer a protective factor.A: The use of a donor's age at transplantation (particularly in non-African American donors) is a factor that has been shown to be related to the outcome of the transplantation. However I believe the relative importance of the age at transplantation for outcomes is best explained by other factors (eg, risk factor exposure, disease symptoms, and genetic predisposition) that modify susceptibility to graft"

Pest Management and Biopesticide Programs

Periodontitis, Periodontitis Treatment

Pesticides have been a common cause of permanent oral and/or systemic damage to organisms. It is often the case that periods of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of a given pesticide in animals and humans leads to an increase of the production of secondary metabolites that cause oral or systemic tissue damage (and sometimes the same tissues in different animals). There is very little data to support or refute the presence of adverse effects of pesticides on oral or systemic diseases in humans, but we can determine that oral or systemic adverse effects of pesticides in humans are less frequent than that caused by low concentrations of a pesticide in rats or mice, because many pesticides are very low in toxicity when administered according to the chemical name, in particular for a given application type (e.g., for pesticides applied to vegetable crops in France). Thus, only low concentrations of a given pesticide are likely to produce oral or systemic toxicity when a particular application type is used. When applied as an exegetical treatment in plants, exposure to pesticides on the part of humans can be due to the chemical composition and composition of the plant, and can vary greatly in toxicity based on the application method. Therefore, there is a need to provide guidelines and recommendations for application in different plants. Furthermore, a comprehensive program to prevent a particular plant species from being exposed to a certain concentration of one or more chemicals in order to reduce or eliminate the risks of toxic effects during the application process should be adopted in order to ensure that the same safety measures applied to a plant in France will also apply to a pest that is in the country.

The use of chemical pesticides is associated with a wide range of systemic diseases. However, in a recent review, it was recognized that there is insufficient evidence regarding the safety of pesticides to recommend them as an adjunct therapy to conventional therapy in many cases (5). In France, the only method of administration approved by French authorities for the treatment of the following diseases as of December 2005, in accordance with the new French laws:

Gastrointestinal

Chronic fatigue syndrome (FMS)

Pancreatic cancer (CRC)

Pneumonia (CPS)

Meningitis (MS)

Molluscum contagiosum (MC)

Pregnancy (PS)

Perioperative and Postoperative Care

Prospective postoperative care

The use of pesticides in animals has been shown to be associated with a rise in perioperative mortality (6, 7, 8). However, this relationship has been evaluated only in rats. In several studies, pesticide residues in humans have been detected in urine (9, 10), blood (11), breast milk (12), food (13) and at-risk food items (14). If the same pesticide is sprayed on a host organism with high toxicity (e.g., the herbicide glyphosate found on many fruits in the U.S.), the effects of that pesticide can be exacerbated.

Therefore, prevention of a host of diseases, such as chronic fatigue syndrome in humans, has been assessed for pesticides according to their chemical composition (see below). It should be mentioned, however, that toxicity is not the only problem with these types of pesticides applied to fruit crops or poultry. Several studies have shown that the use of pesticides to help poultry and other animal species reach the edible food is associated with a high incidence of diseases and deformities (15, 16). The health risks for individuals may also increase as residues of pesticides are present in food products and also in the environment.

To prevent the development and spread of the disease in relation to pesticides, there are several preventive measures to be taken or initiated. We have suggested the following preventive measures:

· Avoiding contact between livestock and plants, as this provides a very high concentration of pesticides.

· Avoiding contact between the same animal with plants and weeds; this protects against the disease in humans and also helps the animals get to the desirable food source.

· Avoiding contact between the food that is grown in fields with weeds and that is stored at the farm and with the fields that feed the animals. This leads to a highly contaminated environment, and the accumulation of residues which must be removed to prevent the spread of the disease and disease-causing agents as well as the harmful reactions between them.

· Preventing contact with the water that flows between plants to the soil. (See Table 2.)

Question: Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients?

Introduction

Asthma is one of the most common childhood, adolescent, or adult diseases that can lead to death and disability. About 1.4 million Americans are living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), a serious lung disorder that can cause death if untreated.1 The number of deaths from asthma is about 2.3% of all deaths among people age 10 or older in the United States each year,2 and it is estimated to cost the U.S. economy $1.2 to $1.6 billion per year.3 In addition, asthma is related to increased risks in both children and adults for cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and cancer.4-6 Asthma exacerbations have been associated with decreased longevity,7-9 and recent observational studies have identified a link between asthma exacerbations and poor health-promoting lifestyle factors such as tobacco smoking, diabetes, obesity, and poor nutrition.10-13 Asthma exacerbations have also been linked with increased rates of COPD and hospital admissions for hypoxic/hypoxia during exacerbations,14-17 as well as with a higher risk of suicide and self-harm after exacerbation.18 In addition, asthma exacerbations may have the potential to influence overall health outcomes,4,6,19 with evidence supporting significant differences in both the risk of heart attacks during asthma and the risk of dying from asthma among children and adolescents.20-22

The health care system has significant limitations when it comes to the assessment and management of asthma, including: limited access to specialty care, low adherence to asthma control guidelines, and lack of standardized asthma control strategies.22-25 A large proportion of asthma admissions occurs during a physician's office visit, as well as during outpatient visits, and the hospital system has had high rates of overuse of respiratory medication.26 As a result, hospital and emergency department visits have been linked to poor medication adherence, as well as inappropriate patient outcomes such as hyperventilation.27,28 Recent observational studies have suggested differences in the severity of asthma between patients of various racial/ethnic groups.29 Among a sample of 454 patients presenting to a regional urban air pollution emergency department in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, the prevalence of asthma severity was similar in black and white patients, and increased with age. In a different study, the severity index of asthma in a group of patients with bronchial asthma who were followed for one year, at their home, and in a public hospital was inversely correlated with their household income, and for each unit increase in the index, the rate of asthma was reduced by 12 percent.30

In this study of 3248 black patients admitted to an asthma and allergy centre in Seattle, Washington, we examined physician estimates of asthma severity.

Methods

Participants

We studied black patients in an urban hospital with a single non-specialist resident physician, who had an undergraduate training in public health and was fluent in English. Patients were identified from a national referral database. Baseline characteristics of the staff of the Seattle Asthma and Allergy Centre are reported in Table 1. At entry, we performed a structured telephone interview to define the diagnosis of asthma (ie, the use of an inhaler, or prescription of an inhaler, and the clinical severity of asthma at each visit) and asked about all medical factors, including family history, education, employment, and financial status.31 At each visit, an asthma history questionnaire was administered by the physician. At each of 3 visits, the patient completed a questionnaire containing the frequency of the occurrence at each visit of the 4 symptoms of asthma.

After excluding patients with asthma who were hospitalized during the study period (n = 647), we also excluded those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at entry (n = 614), those with other respiratory conditions at entry (n = 705), those with smoking at enrollment (n = 468), and those with any diagnosis of asthma at enrollment; we conducted a complete assessment of these groups at the end of the study period. We further excluded patients with acute asthma (eg, shortness of breath or wheezing during physical examination) or those with asthma requiring treatment that would have prevented enrollment from that point forward (eg, oxygen therapy). Exclusion criteria included being diagnosed with an asthma-related condition when in school, having a known allergy to specific products, and having asthma that requires treatment that would prevent enrollment from that point forward (eg, in-hospital use of corticosteroids). For these analyses we considered patients with mild to moderate asthma as nonusers; the severity index was calculated using a 2, 3, or 4-point severity scale.31

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was death and major adverse effects from asthma exacerbations"
Question: Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery? Answer: A non-randomized evaluation shows that laparoscopic surgery reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation and is safe in most patients. Most patients feel better immediately after surgery and no complications are reported. The major limitation of this study is that all patients had a prior heart attack; however, a study performed on postoperative patients after an acute heart attack showed a reduction in risk. The number of patients who required a revascularization procedure may be greater than the sample size of this study. Full text of the article is provided in the Supplemental Material.

Possible Risk Factors for Angina Prolongation

SUMMARY

Most patients are correctly diagnosed with normal chest pain without evidence of arrhythmias.1 The prevalence of angina is high, and approximately 60 percent of patients with angina have some form of arrhythmia present on examination.2-4

In the patient with suspected heart disease (e.g., angina, hypertension, or heart failure), screening for symptoms and initiating medications at the normal range of dosage will improve prognosis and save lives.5,6 In patients with suspected heart disease and the first or second episode of angina, the best therapy might be to reduce the frequency of symptoms and the dosage of medications (which has been shown to reduce the risk of angina progression).7

Carcinoma of the breast and adjacent area is another risk factor for continued progression and death from angina.2,2

The risk of recurrent angina has been found to depend on the extent to which these medications reduce the risk of recurrent sinus arrhythmias, especially low-frequency sinus arrhythmias,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3. The risk is reduced after antiarrhythmics, and may be even reduced.11

Pituitary tumor and angina

Pituitary tumors of the adrenal glands grow in response to adrenaline-secreting hormone secreted from the adrenal cortex (hypocretin gland).2 Angina, an underlying disorder of the pituitary gland, is caused by a deficiency in adrenal hormone. Patients with hereditary adrenal hyperplasia have a higher risk of developing coronary artery disease.2 Pituitary tumors have a high rate of death and other complications in untreated, isolated cases.2 The need to monitor and treat patients with adrenal disease is increasing, because pituitary cancer is now the most common type of cancer in women over age 40.2

Patient education has been used to reduce incidence and mortality in patients with pituitary tumors.2,2,11,12 Patients are exposed to angina in much the same way, with increasing severity.4-6 The risk of death is approximately 1 in 10,000 patients, and in most cases, the risk is not significant.

Oral hypoglycemia in the presence of hypertension (diabetes) is an additional risk factor for increased cardiac risk.13 Hypoglycemia has been associated with increased risks of angina in a pooled analysis of several studies.14 Another common risk factor for angina is diabetes.15 The combination of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease can result in multiple cardiac and kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and the presence of pulmonary edema.16

End-stage renal disease and elevated sodium levels in patients with diabetes are increased risks for progression to a myocardial infarction.17,17-19 Patients may be at risk for end-stage renal disease and elevated sodium levels in patients with diabetes, particularly the metabolic syndrome.20

Cardiac stress fractures in patients with end-stage renal disease, including chronic kidney disease, are increasing.21 Patients should be carefully screened for end-stage renal disease so that effective therapy, if sought, can be instituted with minimal discomfort or complication.21

Nelson-Larsen syndrome is the most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest, with a 10 to 50 percent increased risk in patients with diabetes.22 Because of the high risk for heart defects occurring in these patients, cardiac screening for these is recommended when diabetes is a risk factor.23

Oral hypoglycemia in the presence of hypertension (diabetes) is an additional risk factor for continued progression and death from angina.2,2,11,12 Patients are exposed to angina in much the same way, with increasing severity. 4-12 The risk of death is approximately 1 in 10,000 patients,"
"Question: The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim ""surge"" management? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," When will people be required to buy insurance to prevent mass casualty attacks via ""surge"" planning or by pre-design terrorist attacks? The Answer: Most mass casualties attacks against civilians happen when mass casualties attacks are ""planned."" A ""planned"" attack consists of two elements: A ""planned"" plan that is intended to maximize casualty killing, and At the least three simultaneous events of an impending mass casualty attack that have the potential to cause the death or injury of many people. The initial event may be a successful hostage take, or a terrorist attack that fails due to police action. The actual planned assault may be against a police station or an apartment building. It follows that any attack targeting a police station or an apartment building is a planned attack. The number of persons to be killed or injured during mass casualty events against police stations is limited to the number of police personnel available. Many police departments are more able to prevent incidents of a planned attack using the available police personnel. However, the ability of local police departments to stop terrorist attacks at the scene of the attack can sometimes be hindered by the time that a mass casualty event takes place. Since the attack may be delayed, police response times may be reduced to a few minutes from minutes. The time difference between what is happening at the scene after the attack is interrupted and what it would have taken to prevent the attack can give police the time to move the person suspected of being behind the attack. A few seconds can have a serious impact on the ability for police to respond. The time between the attack and an immediate response by police is known as the ""gap."" When the gap is large, police respond faster than the attack can happen. By contrast, when the gap is small and police respond more quickly, the effect of the attack on the police can be delayed, and possibly prevented from beginning. This is known as the ""time gap."" The time gap often causes police to wait for too long to act. After the attack, the gap may be closed permanently. On February 26, 1989 police officers in Melbourne, Australia, responded to a disturbance in the area. They set up at the scene, but arrived too late to stop the assault. A man with a knife attacked four police officers, killing the first two, wounding the other three, and then fatally shooting the third. A video video shows the incident. The police officer then took control of the situation by holding a child for several minutes while the other four police officers tried to save the children. In this case, the time-gap and police delay created a delay of twenty-three minutes. This period has been dubbed the ""gap."" It is difficult to determine when the police should have opened fire. It was estimated that the police had the weapon they needed to respond to the disturbance more than two minutes after the disturbance occurred. The video shows, however, that before the four police officers could arrive, the man with the knife had left the scene. Since each of the four police officers, except one, was armed with a pistol or shotgun, it is likely that the attack on the police was likely to result in the deaths of one or more of the four armed officers. The police waited until the gap was closed before they took action to save the victims. The gap is a good example of the danger of using the ""time gap"" to justify violence. When the gap is short, when the attacker is not present and the police have the weapon they need, the attack is less likely to result in the loss of life. In this instance, the gap did not close because the police waited only two minutes after the attack. A man who fired the shots on the police officer at the scene and the two dead police officers, were both on duty at the time of the incident. According to the official police report, the first police officer who began the fight with the assailant shot him ""in the chest/belly area."" He also shot the boy from behind and in the back. (L.J.M.M., The Melbourne Massacre, 1984.) The official police report stated the second officer also shot the assailant but not in the chest area (L.J.M.M., ""The Siege of the Melbourne Police Department,"" 1991, p. 5.) An expert in mass casualty incidents has concluded that the police had good reason to believe that the man who attacked them had explosives in his possession. The police had reason to think that the man had at least sixty seconds to kill as many police as possible before they killed him. The man who fired the shots on the police was wearing body armor. He had at least 50 seconds, after the police had attacked him, to escape. The man's body armor had at least four large pieces of armor that fit together. The man also wore ""hats"" (small pieces of cloth) that could easily be thrown at his attackers. He may also have had a"

Question: Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term?"" In the present study, we present results of a crossover study of 2 rheumatoid arthritis patients (n = 9) on placebo (n = 1) and folic acid, with 5-weeks (3/6) placebo and 3-weeks (0/6) folic acid periods. A subset of subjects also received 100 mg of vitamin B-12 daily for 8 weeks before beginning the study. The subjects in the study were receiving treatment for the first time ever with methotrexate (400 μg/day or 400 mg/day) or placebo. The placebo period served to allow the use of folic acid in the study. As planned, the patients continued receiving their standard oral therapy under their usual care without the benefit of folic acid supplement (with the exception of a single patient that received 200 IU folic acid). During the folic acid period, all subjects received their regular medications; no folic acid supplement was given at any point during the course of the study. The primary outcome data were determined before folic acid supplementation began. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups before the folic acid period. The primary result was that no subjects experienced an increase in the incidence of any adverse events. In contrast, the number of subjects experiencing one or more adverse events during the 7-weeks, placebo period was significantly higher than expected based on the expected mean baseline incidence for this subgroup group. This occurred because of a total of five (3.5%) subjects who reported a ""side effect"" during this period. Three (22.3%) subjects reported minor adverse effects that could not be attributed to the treatment in the study. The side effects we considered adverse included nausea, headache and nervousness during the day; headache and nausea at night; and a number of gastrointestinal, metabolic, musculoskeletal, dermatological, and immunologic complaints. The number of subjects reporting ""no effect"" at the end of the folic acid period was 1.4%, resulting in a statistical nonsignificance of this value. Conclusion: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis did not experience a significant increase in the mean overall incidence of ""no effect"" during the 7-weeks, placebo period. Conclusion: The present study confirms a safety profile of folic acid that has been repeatedly observed in the literature.

Key words:

In a systematic review, it was found that the results of randomized controlled trials (rCTs), randomized trials in which subjects have been randomly assigned to receive a treatment or control, and randomization cannot be used as a method to draw conclusions about a potential effect of a test drug or other treatment on the incidence of adverse events (AEs)

One way to answer the question posed in the Question ""Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to be started on folic acid supplements?"" is to draw conclusions such as ""No changes in the incidence of AEs were observed at the end of the trial"" or, ""Adverse or tolerable events occurred less often at the placebo and folic acid doses at doses lower than 5 mg/day in rheumatoid arthritis."" The answer to the Question of ""Would it be appropriate to extend this concept to include patients with other etiologies, for example, those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, to see if there might be benefits in a larger population?"" would then have to be ""No."" That is, for this to be scientifically valid, we must acknowledge that there are currently no studies in the literature for patients with other etiologies.

How does the absence of a study for the population at risk of AE-related adverse events in a trial with folic acid treatment justify its continued use as a standard of care for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis? Consider the following:

For the population at risk of AE-related adverse events, not only does the absence of any published study allow the use of the standard of care as is currently used with folic acid for rheumatoid arthritis, it also provides support for the use of folic acid as adjunctive therapy. As one might expect, this does not mean that it will make a difference if one takes the same or similar medications in the absence of folic acid. Folic acid is used as the primary treatment in studies that do not examine the effects of folic acid on those at risk. The use of folic acid can have favorable effects when administered in randomized controlled trials where the treatment group is randomized into one of 2 groups. In those 2 groups, one receives an"

The mean age, height, BMI, and percentage of femur with a TLD ≥3 mm were compared. Overall no correlation was found between infundibular height and the clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after TLD. However, it was suggested that infundibular height might be directly related with the clearance of lower pole stones.

Question: Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow?

Answer: To what extent is the cardiovascular system affected by lung ischemia and reperfusion?

What are the risk factors for the development and progression of pulmonary embolus?

What is the risk for a large-vessel coronary artery disease?

What is the risk of severe pulmonary embolus in a patient with coronary artery disease?


Answering this question helps us understand the nature of each condition, how it may potentially affect the heart and the patient with coronary artery disease. When treating patients with pulmonary embolism, physicians are often asked to explain the relationship between pulmonary stenosis and the development of coronary artery disease and to provide a more detailed description of the risk factors that may increase the risk for coronary artery disease in such patients.


Pulmonary Embolism

The term ""pulmonary embolism"" describes the thrombus created when a blood clot travels through the pulmonary artery and is blocked; blood is then moved into the lung and shunts into the aorta and vein where it is transported to the lungs and lungs are then damaged. Once a clot has formed, the damage is irreversible and death results.

Causes and Risk Factors

Clotting is the process by which the body produces new blood cells. Stem cells may be acquired by the immune system from foreign particles that are harmful to the immune system. Stem cells may also be created by cells from the bone marrow or from other sources. The body makes its own stem cells through a complex process called hematopoietic stem cell (hSC), which involves the transformation of stem cells from a normal cells into an adult stem cell using factors that favor proliferation. The resulting embryonic stem cells contain the genes of the fetal genome.

The number of stem cells in the body is regulated by an environment-dependent gene expression profile. The balance between a set of genes that is favorable for cell expansion and a set that is favorable for differentiation determines whether a tissue will be capable of growth. The genes that have higher expression levels promote tissue expansion, whereas those genes that have a lower expression level promote differentiation. The level of expression of certain genes may also determine the ability of stem cell to differentiate into specific cell types.

Clots created by blood clots do not need to pass through the lungs to reach the aorta. They may only move through the pulmonary artery after forming a thrombus. Once established, thrombus formation is a lifelong process in which the thrombus forms and develops over a period of time. A small proportion of thrombus formation that travels through the thoracic aorta reaches the pulmonary vasculature and can cause a variety of symptoms, including cough, chest pain, chest tightness, coughing, wheezing, hoarseness, fatigue, low-grade inflammation, and swelling.

The most common source of air space pressure in the lungs is the alveolar membrane of the lung, but most thrombus formation also occurs through the pericardium, the space between the two lungs. The most common place that pulmonary thrombus formation occurs is on the alveolar surface of the pulmonary arteries.

Primary causes of pulmonary embolism are as follows:

Oxygen starvation and respiratory acidosis (loss of oxygen and/or the pH is too low)

Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure is a factor in thrombus formation)

Cerebrovascular accident (carotid artery aneurysm, mitral valve prolapse, or coronary artery aneurysm)

Pericardial effusion of lung fluid

Pulmonary embolic disease (a narrowing of the alveolar wall of the pulmonary vessel in the chest)

Pulmonary embolism can result from several different events, including coronary artery disease (or pulmonary hypertension), trauma, and atherosclerotic diseases. Aortic and pulmonary arterial stenosis are the primary types of causes of pulmonary embolism in patients with cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. The major thrombus formation source is the pulmonary artery in the chest cavity.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have higher rates of pulmonary embolism and the most common source of thrombus formation is the pulmonary artery in the chest cavity. COPD is more common in women and younger adults than men. Patients with COPD also have a higher incidence of severe pulmonary embolism.

Pulmonary artery ischemia is an injury that occurs more frequently in young adult women than young adult men.

The primary cause of pulmonary embolism in COPD is a blockage in the pulmonary artery"

Question: Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Why do some people return to medication while others do not?

Answer: Duration of psychotherapy is a potential predictor (measured as treatment response) of the severity of depression and suicidal behavior when a patient is treated for depression. However, there has been little research evaluating the relationship of duration with outcome of treatment.

METHODS:

Patients who had one or more episodes of major depressive disorder before leaving an ER were recruited from the General Clinical Research Unit at Yale from 2002 to 2006. One patient was excluded from the study owing to lack of documentation of a psychiatric diagnosis prior to entering the study. This patient, identified as an outpatient, had a diagnosis of major depression and suicidality, but had not received treatment for depressive disorder after leaving hospital. Patients were evaluated at the time of first hospitalization in the course of the study, and then at discharge for a follow-up visit approximately one year later.

RESULTS:

Of the 9 patients who returned to their ED for treatment (1) who had a first episode, the duration of psychotherapy was not associated with treatment outcome. Patients who had a first episode had higher rates of suicide compared to untreated patients. The only group with significantly lower rates of suicidal behavior overall was those treated with antidepressants.

CONCLUSIONS:

While these results cannot be generalized to general population, in the general population, duration of psychotherapy is most predictive of long-term treatment success, as well as survival."
Question: Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery? Answer the Question: It does not increase the recurrence rate. Answer the Question: It is not known that it increases the recurrence rate, only that there are some case reports indicating that it improves the prognosis if spinal surgery is performed on a patient with spinal stenosis.

Answer: It is not known that they have an increased recurrence rate.

Shaving the incision site does reduce a lot of the inflammatory response that accompanies the spinal surgery. But it is a very small effect, even though, the number of cases that have had bad reactions to shaving the incision site is increasing. We don't know how that one is performing in the majority of patients.

Some researchers believe the reduction has a negative effect on nerve function as those nerves are being destroyed. But it doesn't affect the spinal canal which is the organ where pain and discomfort originate. So, they still get a lot of pain from shaving the incision site. So, they take the razor and shave the incision site.

Our answer to the question is: There are some cases of inflammation.

The good thing about shaving the incision site is that we can cut around it and it won't hurt much like if you were to cut into the skin. We don't know how it increases the recurrence. No one really knows because when a procedure is done, a lot of people do not come back. So, we have to wait for future studies.

To learn more about incisions, you can check out the website:

I have read at least a dozen studies examining the safety of shaving the incision site at that site. Nothing in the literature supports shaving the incision site as a possible cause of recurrence."
Question: The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question:

Answer to Question #1

The aneurysm diameter determines the extent of damage to the coronary vessels. An average diameter of 18 centimetres (0.5 in), for example, would result in a total coronary artery obstruction about 0.0028 millimetres (0.0022 in) thick, or about 20 per cent of the normal arterial thickness. This is why doctors call for an artery diameter that is as large as possible. At present, however, the maximum diameter of a coronary artery is just over 1 mm (0.0002 in). Since the average diameter is 18 centimetres for people with a normal coronary function and about 0.0002-0.0010 centimetres (0.0003-0.0007 in) for people who have a severe coronary disease, the recommended diameter of an artery must be at least 0.095 mm (0.004 in) to prevent any damage. About 40 per cent of individuals with severe coronary disease can't tolerate diameters below 0.025 mm (0.0035 in). A healthy person with a diameter of approximately 0.095 mm (0.003 in) has a normal blood supply and is at risk of blood clot formation, which could lead to a fatal thrombosis.

Answer to Question #2

The blood supply of the coronary artery begins around the heart's surface and is guided to the valve that leads from the heart to the carotid artery, or the arteries that drain blood from the two major veins, one descending the femoral (arm) (Fig. 2-1) (1). The carotid artery and veins then branch into two smaller veins, which drain to the arm on the same side of the body and to a smaller vein on the opposite side, known as the inferior vena cava.

Figure 2-1

The arteries in and out of the body are called branches of the aneurysm. There are three types of aneurysm: 1. External (internal) aneurysms, whose arteries open outside the body at the back of the skull. 2. Internal (internal) aneurysms, which lie at different points along a vein in the middle of the chest. 3. Internal (internal) aneurysms, which remain inside the body but flow to the wall of the heart by passing directly past it.

Answer to Question #3

The arteries of the coronary arteries form a network of more than 4,700 branches, many of which are connected by branches of different lengths and branches with different lengths and branches in different places.

The length and spacing of the branches of the coronary arteries are important in determining the amount of blood supplied by each one.

The angiography, which is used to visualize vessels, shows arteries to different places on the body. It shows branches of various densities, like 1 mm long vessels, 20 mm long arteries and 2 mm long arteries. Different branches have different lengths and densities.

The length, or radial ratio, of the arteries can tell you if you have an aneurysm. If the length (ρ) of the arteries is 5 times more than that of the ventricles (VL), or blood vessels that empty into the vessels, then the blood supply will be too low to hold all the blood that flows to and from the heart.

The average diameter of the coronary arteries is 9.5 to 13.5 mm (0.5 in. to 0.75 in.).

When an aneurysm is suspected, the physicians first make a slit through the skin to see if any blood flows out of the heart into the body. Blood vessels are very thin and are easily seen if cut open with a scalpel and blood pressure is raised. A clot and an aneurysm will eventually appear, so if the aneurysm is located outside, a slit is usually made through the skin of the chest, which has no blood flow.

Question: Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease? A: A French-Canadian scientist may breach confidentiality to protect the identity of a sex-steroid-exposed woman who is her husband's physician. A German psychiatrist may do the same to protect the identity of a patient who suffers from a brain-stem stroke. A French nurse has decided not to reveal the sexual status of a patient when her medical research is about to be published. When a patient's name or age is involved, then it amounts to disclosing that the patient might be the subject of an ongoing or threatened investigation, or to a patient whose family is suspected of having been involved in a criminal investigation. C: Yes; I can see the rationale for disclosing the identity in both of these examples. However, while it may not have been my intention to breach confidentiality, I might have taken a more reasonable decision had I only been concerned about some potential violation—not the actual identity itself.

Answer: What makes the question of ""legitimate disclosure"" so slippery? I think there's a long and tangled history when it comes to this topic. It all started in the 1980s, when the FDA recommended that doctors keep medical records in writing and for long periods of time and that doctors themselves provide physicians with medical records in paper form. In 1987, an appellate court refused to uphold a lower court that had ruled similar. This led to a great deal of commentary that led to calls for an unbreakable encryption system that would render doctors' records confidential. Eventually it was realized that there was no problem with providing doctors with medical records in the form of paper (except for the fact that it took at least one extra paper step to get those records) and all the government required was that the documents be kept in writing and for many years (usually 20 years). The problem, however, came in doing so. Many physicians do not understand how to read paper, but when they see the letters ""R01"" or ""G16"" or ""P17"" they may well try to decrypt the information; they do not understand that information can still be read on the ""paper"" side once the encryption key is provided. This led to some fairly creative interpretations of the law, and a great deal of court-packing of information that was later found to be wrong.

I guess the question is, What does anyone do when someone decides to take the easy way out and decide that he or she does not have the time or the equipment (or the mental fortitude!) or the professional training or the medical judgment to maintain the confidentiality of a medical record for many years, including during the time it makes its way up to or through the system, and for whom an encryption key won't likely be provided? Obviously you can tell people not to do this, especially if it is done by a professional and on behalf of their practice. If it is not done, in some cases the patient's health, their reputation, and future career prospects might be at stake. In addition some courts have found evidence of ""secret"" therapy under an assumed identity to be inadmissible (though not necessarily illegal) against patients who have been coerced into disclosing that information.

I'm no expert on medical records in general, but I do know that I have to keep a lot more of these documents in writing than it used to be. They seem to lose their protection sooner with each new generation. But then it's all up to you and what you have done…in my experience.

Question: Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?

Answer: All research on the subject has been quite anecdotal, but the general conclusion seems to be that there are likely to be certain symptoms of depression that tend to occur more frequently in patients with somatic complaints. One obvious example is the presence of tenderness in the trunk, usually accompanied by a tender mass. The diagnosis is made by a physician, who is trained not to make any physical examination in the suspected case. In some cases the ""mood"" is assumed (often wrongly) to be depression for the doctor to prescribe an antidepressant. The case report is interesting in that it was considered difficult to get a medical source to discuss the subject, since most doctors consider the somatic complaints part of normal life.

Another example is the tendency of the sufferer to have a generalized pain. A lot of clinical interest in somatic complaints can be traced to the studies of the work done in Germany in the 1920 to 1940. In an extensive collection that was published in Germany in 1938, the German neurologist Ernst Ristitz wrote about 40 different cases of pain that he thought were due to the autonomic nervous system. Since then further studies have shown that various autonomic causes of pain are present in about 20% of all patients with somatic complaints. In more recent times a series of papers in the journal Neurology has shown that there are over 50 autonomic causes of pain, many of which are common to those with somatic complaints. Several groups have tried to correlate autonomic and somatic symptoms in detail, but the results of these studies have not been so conclusive. It is not clear how important these autonomic causes truly are in determining symptoms of pain, since they are found in some patients with just a somatic complaint, and some with more complicated symptoms. There is some evidence that the autonomic nervous system in the long run is more important for regulating the heart rate than for regulating pain, and, indeed, the heart rate may influence symptom severity.

How does the patient's physical illness explain the somatic complaints? The patient might have had an autoimmune disorder affecting the parasympathetic nervous system, for example, because the physical illness was triggered by an immune reaction in the parasympathetic nervous system. This is generally not a problem, however, since the sympathetic nervous system plays a major part in controlling the immune system; immune symptoms are due to an immune reaction that occurs in the parasympathetic nervous system.

Other somatic complaints may be explained by psychological phenomena, notably an imbalance of somatic emotions. Psychopathology is an umbrella term that describes the disorders with problems in personality and behavior, as well as the changes in behavior that are caused by these disorders. Theories that stress the role of the central nervous system as an important part of psychopathology are known as dysfunctional Central Control Theory (CDCT). CDCT posits that the human nervous system has a central control system (which may be as simple as a complex combination of the autonomic and parasympathetic systems) that is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system and is highly disturbed in disease states. Thus, many people in conditions such as chronic pain have somatic complaints (in particular in patients with chronic backache who have had the painful backache, as well as in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have had problems with their joints). Similarly people with somatic complaints in the presence of other illnesses have symptoms that are caused by this disturbed central control system.

The central control system for the body is a sort of central control system for the mind, since the central control system that regulates the mind is the parasympathetic nervous system, which also controls the respiratory, circulatory and gastrointestinal systems. The parasympathetic nervous system is sensitive to changes in body temperature. Thus it tends, when temperature is normal (or even slightly elevated), to regulate body temperature. When the parasympathetic nervous system loses control or becomes stressed, it may tend to bring about changes in the body (for example, the cardiovascular system may be sensitive to increased blood pressure, and the respiratory system may respond when the breathing becomes labored). When these responses occur, the parasympathetic nervous system may not cope as well with the changing environment and may be activated. The latter symptoms include headaches, irritability and heart palpitations (which may occur when the parasympathetic nervous system is overloaded).

However, there is one important exception to the effect of central control system dysfunction on the physical symptoms of the body. Patients with heart palpitations who have normal diastolic function are much more sensitive to changes in temperature than patients who have heart palpitations in an abnormal fashion, and they are more likely to have migraines and/or to develop an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. A similar result occurs when patients with migraine who have normal di"

Question: Remote ischemic postconditioning: does it protect against ischemic damage in percutaneous coronary revascularization? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Ischemic postconditioning improves cardiac function in percutaneous coronary revascularization?

Introduction: In contrast to most cardiologists, I often encounter patients whose initial chest radiographs are not readily available for follow-up. This has, however, long been known, and it is a known fact that with the exception of a very high degree of revascularization of the coronary circulation, percutaneous coronary revascularization does not provide an advantage to patients with ischemic shock or those with severe ischemic ventricular overload

Patients with ischemic shock, who present under general anesthesia who lack coronary artery disease, and who are not expected to survive are probably not expected to benefit from CPR to resuscitate these patients. These patients are often given a blood transfusion, though with the current high availability of blood supply there may not be much possibility to have a transfusion by a suitable physician with reasonable knowledge of the patient. On the other hand, patients with very severe ischemic ventriculopathy have received substantial treatment with CPR including intubation, cpr, bradycardia, and infusion. Many, however, die of the cause of the disease. Patients who require percutaneous coronary revascularization are usually the last patients treated. The evidence is not unanimous, but it is certainly clear that resuscitation with CPR was not as important to these patients as it may have been for those with severe ischemic ventriculopathy who were treated with CPR. The best-case explanation for this is that with the advent of percutaneous coronary revascularization, patients with very severe ischemic ventriculopathy who failed on a normal cardiac catheterization were treated with CPR.

Methods: This study focuses on revascularization of an injured person with ischemic shock who lies in a prone position. The patient was seen by a cardiologist and was evaluated for ischemic shock with general anesthesia. The patient was instructed by the cardiologist if there were any cardiac conduction slowing that a pulse pump should be used and the patient was given the best-case scenario description of the cardiac state and the best prognosis. The heart rate, and a series of pulse and chest X-ray patterns were monitored. The heart did not show obvious signs of an electrocardiogram in which the beats were too slow. Cardiovascular biomarker data were obtained from an ECG monitor. It is unknown whether survival of any patients who underwent percutaneous coronary revascularization or a simple resuscitation with norepinephrine or epinephrine was improved. The outcomes and criteria for cardiac mortality are given in.

Results: For a sample of 32 patients (18 adults, 10 babies, and 3 neonates), 24 died within 3 months after CPR. There were no difference in survival with CPR for a sample of 14 normal subjects (14 adults, 16 babies, and 6 neonates). There was no improvement in heart rate, nor was there improvement in pulse rate, oxygen saturation, or troponin with CPR in most patient groups. Of all patients, the highest survival rate was with CPR for a sample of 1,852 normal subjects. There was no improvement in cardiac troponins in the group that did not undergo percutaneous coronary revascularization except for one patient, a 33-year old man with a low cardiac troponin concentration who underwent a cardiopulmonary resuscitation with norepinephrine and epinephrine. In this patient, cardiac troponin levels returned to normal 3 months after CPR. It is uncertain whether further cardiac-facial or ventricular functions could be returned to normal within a few months. In total, 10 patients underwent CPR in which the ventricular ejection fraction (VEF) was increased after 2 weeks. The mean VEF in the percutaneously revascularized group was not significantly improved compared with that in the normal group (mean VEF, 39.5% in the percutaneously revascularized group vs 39.0%; P =.13). There were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the endpoints that were evaluated.

Conclusions: We reviewed this group of severely injured patients for the primary purpose of assessing cardiorespiratory factors in the control of severe ischemic shock. A sample of normal subjects appeared to exhibit a more favorable end-of-ischemic-suscitation. The results of this study have major implications for percutaneous coronary revascularization. The initial cardiac arrest in most children with ischaemic shock is due to cardiorespiratory and/or pulmonary failure causing the respiratory failure to initiate the heart arrest. The cardiac arrest can be prolonged if there is no response to cardiac re-regulation during the initial stage of cardiac arrest. This study focused solely on patients"

One needs to keep in mind that HIV infection is an acquired disease and that the immune system is very susceptible to viral infection and can make a difference whether in the infected or uninfected population. A large number of factors and a large number of variables can affect the relative risk of HIV infection but the major factor is viral processing and immune response in"
Question: The inverse equity hypothesis: does it apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What percentage of medical care is rendered to cancer patients by physicians and hospitals in developed, middle-income countries?

Answer: It's hard to get the answer there. But a big review, published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal in 2011, found that the rate of cancer care rendered for cancer in developed, middle-income countries was on average 10 times lower than in low-income countries.

If we set out to find that coverage for cancer treatment and care rendered varies significantly across countries even by the most rigorous definition of middle-income, we wouldn't be the first to look at the question. I reviewed three major articles, and, more recently, David Himmelstein at Harvard Medical School, and three reviews in peer-reviewed journals, that attempt to estimate the variation in cancer care rendered from the U.S. to patients in the developing world. The results agree:

Our estimates have been confirmed by other studies.

All are reasonably comprehensive.

In addition to being a good starting point, this research is also significant because the variation among countries within middle-income is large and consistent, and the differences among countries of different income levels are stark when you control for the characteristics of the patients (wealth, age, income, etc.) that are more common in most countries in middle-income. For example, a large percentage of low-income people are insured if they have insurance in the first place. And middle-income countries tend to differ substantially in the proportion of children with insurance from those in low-income countries, while most people in low-income do; the latter suggests that children who are uninsured have been disproportionately disproportionately affected.

We can't draw any firm conclusions, of course, because the data are not available to us. There may be variation within the U.S. in its treatment of cancer and in our ability to pay for the treatment in our local community. But that is not a reason to conclude that the U.S. should change or is ""less affluent"" in terms of its cancer care."
Question: Identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality: does scale matter? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Are racial disparities in breast cancer mortality large enough to account for the observed heterogeneity of breast cancer outcomes, or is there a more fundamental cause that might explain the difference?"" Methods Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the cohort of women with breast cancer from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Breast Cancer Surveillance System. In addition, we included women without breast cancer from a non-CDC reference panel. The survey was mailed to women between 1989 and 1997. We estimated the ratio of the frequency of women with breast cancer in a given group to the frequency of women without breast cancer by using a log-linear spline. This measure of discrimination was calculated as (total non-Hispanic white (CI=50%,60%) and non-Hispanic black (CI=55%,65%). The observed ratios in the two population groups were then combined to compute the adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the breast cancer death rates, adjusted for age, race, sex, and other prevalent disease. Results: Overall, 18.8% (13.0, 20.3%) of women who had breast cancer in the United States died of the disease. These results were similar to the findings from the same data set with regard to the incidence of death from other causes. These same associations held among black breast cancer survivors in non-Hispanic white women (adjusted RR=0.97, 95% CI=0.89–1.09, p=0.94) and in Hispanics (adjusted RR=0.98, 95% CI=0.88–1.08, p=0.98). When the adjusted relative risk per 100 000 women in black and non-Hispanic white women were pooled, we observed that the ratio of black versus white breast cancer death rates remained elevated during the study period (adjusted RR=1.32, 95% CI=1.00, 1.74, p<0.001; Table 2). Adjustment for mortality from all causes, as well as age, race, and other health and non-health comorbidities did not produce similar effects from these covariates (Table 2). Conclusions: Black women with breast cancer experienced higher mortality from breast cancer death rates than their white and non-Hispanic white counterparts, with the largest disparities in early detection of disease. This racial disparity appears to exist for several reasons, such as race-specific death rates, race-specific cancer characteristics, geographic variation in the incidence of breast cancer, and differences in risk factors between black and white women. This study also indicated that in the general US population, race-specific breast cancer death rates have declined slightly, although there is too little information about race/ethnicity to draw firm conclusions about the decline in breast cancer mortality.

Breast cancer mortality among US women varies with age, but the most significant change over time is that breast cancer is far less common among women in their late 60s compared to women in their early 30s (1,2). This observation has caused concern and a series of attempts to identify reasons for this difference in mortality (3–5). It is not clear whether breast cancers are less survivable in women older than age 60, with the increased prevalence of menarche among older women in the United States being hypothesized to be a contributing factor (6,7). In order to address the question of whether breast cancer survival differs by age in the United States, we have reviewed breast cancer mortality rates in the US population over time. We used a retrospective cohort study to investigate demographic and clinical characteristics associated with breast cancer mortality in the general US population. We hypothesized that disparities in breast cancer mortality among racial and ethnic groups in the United States in this population would be the result of social class, individual-level risks, and mortality from other causes. In addition, we studied racial disparities in breast cancer mortality by age, and the relation between survival and other health and non-health risk factors, in order to clarify the role of racial disparities in breast cancer survival.

Methods The National Breast Cancer Surveillance System (NCDSS) in the US was implemented in 1989, and the study was conducted from 1994 to 1997. NCDSS is a population-based surveillance system that provides information on breast cancer (1). It consists of a comprehensive surveillance system (including two major components: a population-based cohort that covers an entire geographic region; and a follow-up study among women who developed breast cancer. In the case of non-localized counties or large metropolitan areas the follow-up study can focus on individuals at high risk of breast cancer for a 2-year follow-up. This study was previously described in detail (3,8). The NCDSS was constructed to provide a nationally representative portrait of women's breast cancer outcomes using a self-administered survey, which is in turn matched with the hospital diagnosis of the breast cancer diagnosis performed in 1986, and"
Question: Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury?

Introduction

Leukocyte count relates to the frequency of inflammatory reactions (e.g. neutrophilic reactions and pericytic reactions) in the body. It is mainly present in the blood after injury and most frequently correlates to the extent of tissue damage. It is most well known as the gold standard for diagnosis of tissue injury during exercise.

The leukocyte count correlates with the severity of injury. The more neutrophil activity you can detect, the more likely you are to find a high leukocyte count. However, the leukocyte count does not always correlate to the severity. If you can detect very low neutrophils in your blood after exercise, it may be due to inflammatory reactions or to a problem in the blood.

Leukocyte count correlates to the time period between events, but it is not the only thing, it does not indicate the severity of the injury. The longer you wait between events, the less likely you are to find a high leukocyte count in your blood after a particular event, at least in healthy individuals. A high leukocyte count may be a sign of a minor injury. However, it may be due to inflammatory reactions (e.g. arthritis, chronic arthritis, chronic wounds), or more serious problems (e.g., bleeding, cancer development or death of the body cells, infection). In that case, the leukocyte count is less likely to be higher after a certain injury.

A high leukocyte count is often a reflection of a large quantity of blood flow in the circulation.

A normal or high leukocyte count is a healthy measure of the quality of the blood supply to the tissues in your body. If the blood supply to your tissues is impaired, the level of inflammation may be higher (e.g. chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic wounds, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease).

If the leukocyte counts are abnormal, then you are advised to have a laboratory test that can detect these abnormal levels. In most cases, such laboratory tests can detect changes in the leukocyte count, which are very common with the type of tissue injury that we want to diagnose.

Leukocyte count can be a useful measurement when an organ such as the heart and brain gets injured. The damage to the heart and brain by blood clots is associated with increased leukocyte count.

How does leukocyte count vary with injury?

Leukocyte counts can be changed even after the injury. This is how the leukocyte count in the blood varies following different injuries:

Lymph cells have low leukocyte counts after the first day after injury, usually with no detectable damage in the blood. Thereafter, the number of activated lymphocytes (cells that express chemokines such as CD45 and CD14) in the blood increases. The change in the leukocyte count between 10 days and 1 week after the injury has the appearance of a smooth, regular gradient (a leukocyte count gradient has a similar appearance) that occurs in some individuals after only a few days or weeks. After 1 week there may also be a small change in the leukocyte count in the blood, but without any detectable damage.

Some individuals also show a small change in their leukocyte count in a similar or opposite way to what we see in the blood of healthy individuals following an injury.

For this reason, it is important to find out which type of cancer is causing the increase in the leukocyte count in the first place.

How are leukocyte counts affected by age and gender?

Leukocyte counts increase with age. Most notably, the leukocyte count is increased in men and decreases in women.

There is no gender effect for leukocyte counts after injury. However, some individuals who have been exposed to some toxic chemicals during injury will show a leukemographic shift in their leukocyte counts, which should be noticed by the medical professional or family member before and after they have recovered.

Do different types of organs have different leukocyte counts?

Different organs can produce different amounts of leukocytes. For example, the kidneys will produce more glutathione, which is a vital antioxidant, because of a normal function.

However, if the kidney is damaged in the injury, as in a fall or an injury for which you do not have any evidence of damage on x-ray, then the glutathione and the vitamin B6 will suffer damages.

A higher leukocyte count has also been found in other organs such as the stomach (with an increased leukocyte count), the kidney (with a higher leukocyte count), lymph nodes (with"
Question: Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients?

Answer: Yes.

In some of my sleep literature, it is mentioned that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for specific purposes is being studied with respect to sleep disorders. One of the uses is to stimulate cortical areas and to reduce the daytime sleepiness of the patients using tDCS. The rationale for tDCS is that by stimulating the cortical areas it will reduce the daytime sleepiness of those patients and will improve their performance. In other cases, tDCS is administered on the non-cortical brain areas such as motor areas in order to reduce sleepiness in patients. In all cases, the patients who were not responsive to a treatment but who still exhibited sleepiness could possibly benefit from this stimulation.

In my opinion, it is important to distinguish between several types of non-responsive patients because non-responsive patients are not always defined as being awake. Many non-responsive patients do not sleep enough, but their daytime sleepiness is not so severe that they could be referred to medical clinics. To identify non-responsive patients, it is important to perform a simple and non-invasive test called Functional Resting State Questionnaire (FRAPS) as the objective of tDCS in order to monitor the improvement of the patients with non-responsive sleepiness. Although the tDCS-induced changes are mild in some cases and the patients do not exhibit a daytime sleepiness so severe that it would not be appropriate to prescribe a specific sleep drug, it is important to ensure that a patient with such high sleepiness is not treated with tDCS because it will potentially be harmful.

When the patients are referred for sleep study, they are required to take a baseline sleep questionnaire that includes different items about the sleep quality. They are also asked to answer questions about the sleepiness over the last 5 minutes, about how many alarms they have, whether they have trouble finding their bed, and how they feel at the moment of sleep onset.

A preliminary set of the sleep parameters collected by the patients is compared with their baseline sleep quality that they had previously had before the tDCS session. The patients are then given 4 consecutive nights of tDCS with 5-minute intervals during the first night because in order to observe their sleep parameters over long periods we have to do it during the morning or at night due to ambient light. It has been observed that tDCS decreases the quality of the nights sleep, but it does not cause any alteration in the patients´ sleep quality. It is possible that the treatment can affect the patients´ sleep quality but tDCS does not in that case. This is because the sleep parameters measured according to the baseline sleep questionnaire before stimulation and as a result do not change significantly as a result of tDCS. Only the change in the sleep quality measured according to the sleep questionnaire in the first day of tDCS is sufficient to define a case of non-responsive wakefulness syndrome, and in this case the treatment is not needed.

The patients themselves, who are undergoing this research, often have a high quality sleep during the last few days of the experiment. Consequently, the patients do not find it difficult to follow the treatment protocol. Also, I think a careful evaluation of the patients´ sleeping habits prior to the experimental treatment before the beginning of the experiment would not be necessary.

The patient of the present study (M.H.H) is a woman who previously had been diagnosed with Non-responsive wakefulness syndrome since 2007. The woman had started getting sleep problems a few weeks before, but this was completely gone before initiating tDCS. Prior to her clinical trial the patient had received an MRI and EEG on a couple of occasions for diagnostic purposes. When the patient did not perform well in the diagnosis the patient was referred to a neurology hospital. The woman was not recommended to take any other sleeping aid or sleep medications. The patient still complained of poor sleep hygiene and complained of fatigue after her first few nights of tDCS usage. The tDCS sessions started at 6 am and lasted until 4:30 A.M, when she felt more ""well-rested"".

After completing her clinical trial the woman complained of poor sleep hygiene on the basis of the sleep laboratory results during the nights she initially experienced poor sleep hygiene. The results from her sleep laboratory did not contain any positive results. It also happened that the morning she was diagnosed with Non-responsive wakefulness syndrome she woke up several times, but only after some of the sleep parameters were collected. Also, she complained about her sleep, that she did not fall asleep at night, but could not sleep at all for a couple of days. In that case we determined that the woman might have been diagnosed with Non-responsive wakefulness syndrome, but not as"
Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can musculoskeletal conditions be controlled by the treatment of the immune system?

To see which disorders are considered musculoskeletal, the Institute of Medicine has developed the following definitions:

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). IBS is a complex immune-mediated disorder (i.e., it's both neurological and autoimmune) with a complicated course involving clinical features and a wide range of inflammatory/chronic illnesses. Patients with ME/CFS have severe and disabling fatigue, headaches, muscle aches, and weakness, which are exacerbated by the systemic infections and stress (chronic insomnia, sleep disruption, and psychological distress). The disorder is not always easily diagnosed or treated, and it has been linked to immune deficiency, autoimmune disorders, and depression (Daly and McElroy 2003/2004).

The disorder is not always easily diagnosed or treated, and it has been linked to immune deficiency, autoimmune disorders, and depression (Daly and McElroy 2003/2004). CFS. CFS is a chronic inflammatory neuroimmune disease occurring with onset at ages 18 to 39 years. Symptoms include fatigue, pain, joint/muscle pain, cognitive changes, muscle weakness, and unexplained weight loss. It is thought to occur in approximately 1 percent of the general population and is the first reported neuroimmune disorder described as a symptom of rheumatoid arthritis in humans (Morton and Wojciszewski 2004).

Sepsis. Sepsis refers to an acute, life-threatening, immunological illness wherein the body produces excessive amounts of white blood cells. Sepsis usually is fatal, and it causes a broad range of symptoms that include fever, muscle aches, joint pain, loss of sensation, blurred vision, and a wide range of clinical presentation (McElroy 2001).


Is there any research on preventing or treating these disorders?

There is a body of evidence regarding the effects of certain types of drugs on the musculoskeletal system. The U.S. National Institute of Health, which funded the research, examined the results of studies that examined the effects of the following in relation to musculoskeletal disorders:

Antibodies are a natural immune system response to invading pathogens to ward off infection. They occur in everyone, but they are most prevalent in the elderly. Antibodies are usually administered as vaccines, but they can also be injected. The effectiveness of an antibody depends on its molecular makeup. Certain types of antibodies are found in high concentrations in immune cells (i.e., peripheral blood mononuclear cells). These cells are thought to be the most important sources for natural killer cells. There is also substantial evidence that some types of antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier could cause motor neuron degeneration, a condition that increases the risk of stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and death.

Abstracts:

Exclusive or exclusive chemotherapy is the primary treatment for metastatic endometrial cancers, and multiple agents can be administered. The use of antineoplastic Agents including cytotoxins, histocompatibility-active antigens, and drugs as chemotherapy is controversial and uncertain. The current available evidence suggests that a significant number of endometrial cancer patients have experienced both recurrences and persistence with respect to recurrence of symptoms, the appearance of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasms, the appearance of endometrial metastases, and the appearance of endometrial adenomas. A large proportion of patients report that a prior treatment was not well tolerated despite adequate treatment at follow-up.

Toxicological analysis of endometrial biopsy specimens reveals evidence of endometrial cancer that does not resolve with appropriate chemotherapies that is caused by a range of factors, including high-grade dysplasia, abnormal endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, and an absence of epithelial cells and an absence of estrogen or progesterone associated with severe endometrial androgen insensitivity. It is generally believed that an inadequate response to therapy is the primary cause of disease recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and the appearance of endometrial epithelial tumors. The treatment of endometrial cancer as a non-cancer, although associated with a substantial mortality rate, remains a challenging matter. Therefore, it is critically important that the best available treatment guidelines and guidelines for adjuvant treatment be established. A focus on developing a more comprehensive endometrial cancer treatment guideline is necessary.

Question: Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the probability that a male might be inoculated and infect with N. gonorrhoeae?

The answers to these questions form the basis of a theoretical concept known as ""Serovar serovar specific immunity to N. gonorrhoeae"" or ""SIIR"" (1).

The research question and hypothesis has been tested over the years when people have had gonorrhoea (2), or have had SIIR with a single gonorrhoea donor, with no adverse effect (3, 4). When one of these was tested in a small number of recipients using a simple PCR test that detects serovar DNA, all who were seronegative were protected, thus proving that SIIR existed (2,5,6). In addition to the theoretical demonstration that SIIR exists, it has been proved that it occurs very rarely, which is more likely than being inoculated from an infected partner (2,5,1,10).

The question concerning the SIIR phenomenon has remained open in the minds of researchers for many years, and so far, it has not been addressed. However, the theoretical concept is finally being tested in a number of new studies, and one or two new studies conducted since the last review.

The new studies include a recently published study, which investigated a number of hypotheses that had been investigated, and concluded that these concepts do explain the SIIR phenomenon (11). It has been shown that the ""serovar SIIR is a possible and probable explanation for some human infections because it is independent of the virus strain"" (11).

Another recent study involved only a small number (approximately 20 patients) of individuals who used serovars as donor in one of their previous outbreaks. There was no increased probability in the SIIR phenomenon when SIIR was found to be present in a person's urine, blood or breast milk (10). In addition, the serovar serovar SIIR was detected in the urine of only one of the 10 inoculated patients with no increase in the likelihood of being infected (11).

Another recently published study was conducted between August and December 2007 with about 500 gonococcal patients who had received multiple gonococcal inoculations over time to assess the possibility that they may have increased their risk of infection by SIIR. This investigation indicated that about six out of every 1,000 gonococcal men who were given multiple gonococcal inoculations on the same day were subsequently inoculated with N. gonorrhoeae (10).

Furthermore, in February 2008 it was reported that the serovar SIIR was detected in the urine of a woman in her 40's after her partner acquired SIIR and became sero-specific for the organism (11).

The potential consequences of this discovery include that multiple gonococcal inoculations that may result in the SIIR organism may lead to infection by the SIIR (11). The risk for transmission from one partner with SIIR to an infected partner also has been tested, and three partners in one outbreak in which two partners received two gonococcal inoculations each have confirmed transmission (1).

The SIIR phenomenon also raises concerns because of the adverse effects of SIIR on normal tissue and cells and the possible loss of the ability to prevent infections through these factors.

According to the theoretical concept outlined by the researches, infections due to SIIR can result in the following conditions if the recipient: (a) contracts the virus without treatment or prevention (b) has an undiagnosed or undescribed STD.

Many countries are testing such a model for SIIR with a new test kit that detects SIIR DNA using a blood sample, urine sample or breast milk. In Japan, a test kit was also developed specifically for determining the probability of contracting SIIR when the recipient is infected with the gonococcal organism (8). Testing of the test kits can be done with the aid of a urine sample (11) and the results can be interpreted to show the potential infection and/or the susceptibility.

If the test kit is positive, then the recipient may be at an increased risk of developing complications such as sepsis, or bacterial infections that occur when there is inflammation in the organs, such as the eyes, sinuses, ear, nose and mouth. Because of the possible complications, the recipient may also be considered at a lower risk to develop gonococcal genital disease of any kind (2,11,12).

Question: May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies? It is our strong recommendation that the following be sent to the student examiners:

The document needs to state that the students must be trained in their duties and that the OSCE's procedure for examination is designed with the student in mind. There should be a discussion of the medical emergency and the particular nature of the exam. There should be a detailed explanation of the requirements required of the student examiners by the OSCE and of their responsibilities. There should be a list of criteria for determining the results of the exam and for choosing the best students for that reason.

How would your exam be administered?

There should be an option to include the student examiners in an office setting. A faculty advisor would assist the OSCE with the OSCE review of student examiners and would report back to their OSCE supervisor. This is a standard operating procedure under the OSCE.

Is OSCE examiners allowed to be compensated by schools without an appropriate recommendation by the OSCE faculty committee?

Under the OSCE's standard operating procedure OSCE examiners must be paid from the OSCE budget.

Is OSCE examiners required to undergo physical and psychological examinations before being approved for service as OSCE examiners?

Yes, under OSCE policy.

Can OSCE examiners practice as physicians in a medical emergency?

Under the normal OSCE licensing procedures, under all circumstances, no other licensed physician may accompany the OSCE medical examiner to administer an exam. (See OSCE Practice in Emergency Medicine (PSEM) for a full explanation of the legal limitations and benefits of physician-assisted exams.)

Why don't OSCE examiners have to attend the hospital or physician's office?

The OSCE standards allow the examiners discretion to decide if attending the hospital or physician's office is required in their work. OSCE examiners are licensed by the OSCE board of directors and have full legal professional credentials. Most require attendance at a hospital or physician's office before beginning their exams. An OSCE exam is not required by the OSCE to perform an examination.

Why are OSCE examiners sometimes required to perform an exam at the hospital or hospital's physician's office?

The OSCE Standards of Care specify that in an emergency the OSCE examiners should be in a hospital or physician's office when they are not attending emergency situations. There are numerous circumstances that allow an OSCE exam to take place in an emergency situation such as the health of the patient, an unforeseen life threatening event, the loss of an exam site, and lack of availability of an OSCE doctor or an interpreter.

If there are multiple OSCE staff on an exam, who do the exams for the OSCE?

No OSCE exam is performed solely by a single teacher or trainer. Rather, OSCE examiners in an emergency situation are under the direction of the OSCE board of directors.

Why is it important that OSCE examiners perform their duties safely in an emergency situation?

The safety of the entire medical team is essential to the continued success of the OSCE.

Why do we require a student-to-OSCE agreement prior to the OSCE exams taking place?

Under the ""OSCE Review of Students - Acceptance."" section of the agreement it states that the student shall consult the university's OSCE advisor(s) about whether or not to join OSCE examiners. Under ""Oversight of the Exam"" it states that the student must consult the OSCE's medical examiners and must present to the OSCE members that the OSCE is not a substitute for their own medical examiners. It is our recommendation that these requirements be met in order to ensure student safety.

How do I join the OSCE?

By attending an OSCE training session. There are two trainings, one in Toronto and one in Ottawa. There is a pre-screening session before the session where the OSCE exames are tested out by a representative of the OSCE. There is also a post-screening session after the exam. The session will occur between 8:30 and 1:00 p.m. on a Monday-Thursday and is for OSCE exames only. You can download the training materials for the Ottawa and Toronto presentations. Alternatively, you may contact OSCE Training, Administration, and Management at training@osce.org or 705-711-3333.

Can you explain the process for a student wanting to join the OSCE at what level?

One of the core functions of the OSCE is to develop standards for professional performance and the OSCE examiners are subject to these standards when they perform"
Question: Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade?

Answer:

As discussed in Part 1, both T1R2 and T1R3 are involved in epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and proliferation arrest. They are both expressed under ""normal"" and ""anoxia induced"" conditions (Degiell et al. 2005), and both are associated with ""categorized"" or ""normal"" patterns of migration (Steinmetz et al. 1991), though the effects of the expression patterns of these two genes are strongly correlated (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Gosset et al. 2002).

Thus, while the two genes seem functionally identical in vivo, there are a multitude of independent pathways that can lead to a similar expression pattern during different cell states (e.g., differentiation and migration). These independent pathways are: (1) the induction of angiogenesis and angioclasticity; (2) the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases; and (3) activation of proangiogenic transcription factors (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Henscher et al. 1995; Steinmetz, Jorgensen, and Kjellgren 1983; Fuchs et al. 1998; Steinmetz et al. 1999; Steinmetz, Wessels, Vos, Jensensson, and Wessels 1994; Kjellgren, Steinmetz, Vos, and Andersen 1993). These different transcriptional mechanisms are well documented in several different cell types in the embryonic and adult embryo and proliferative cell lineages (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Henscher et al. 1995). For example, astrocytes are known to express both the T1R2 and T1R3 gene products both within differentiation and migration domains. Furthermore, astrocytic expression patterns are influenced by developmental signaling pathways that involve the transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic changes characteristic of various developmental stages of development (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Steinmetz 1993; Henscher et al. 1995). As discussed above, the expression patterns of T1R4 are also controlled by a number of different mechanisms, including transcriptional activation of several different genes that involve mechanisms such as transcription factor binding, methylation, oxidative modification, DNA adduct formation, and DNA breakage (Steinmetz et al. 1991; Henscher et al. 1995; Steinmetz, Jorgensen, and Kjellgren 1983; Fuchs et al. 1998). Similarly, astrocytes appear to display a variety of differential patterns of endothelial cell migration (Steinmetz et al. 1999; Steinmetz, Fuchs, Vos and Andersen 1993).

The effects of the expression pattern of T1R2 on angiogenesis have been investigated as early as the 1960s. It was shown in astrocytes in which the expression of T1R2 increased markedly, that the expression of T1R2 in astrocytes with T1R3 was associated with increased migration, whereas it was decreased in the astrocytes with T1R3 alone (Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1973; Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1979; Steinmetz et al. 1983). It was established that T1R2 was essential to maintain migration of endothelial progenitors throughout the differentiation process (Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1974; Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1979), and this finding was confirmed in a wide variety of neurogenic lineages (Steinmetz et al. 1979; Steinmetz et al. 1983; Steinmetz et al. 1985; Steinmetz, Jorgensen, and Kjellgren 1983; Steinmetz et al. 1989; Steinmetz et al. 1999; Steinmetz and Jorgensen 1998). Furthermore, the expression of these genes is critical for endothelium homeostasis: the T1R1 gene requires the expression of a G-protein in astrocytes, whereas the T1R2 gene and the T1R3 gene require the expression of a G-protein in endothelial cells (Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1975; Steinmetz and Steinmetz 1979; Steinmetz et al. 1983; Steinmetz et al. 1988; Steinmetz et al. 1999).

Although it has been established that T1R2 controls angiogenesis, it remains unclear as to what other factors other than T1R2 are involved in angiogenesis. It is generally accepted that the T1R3 gene, as well as three other genes involved in endothelial cell growth, are required for angiogenesis (Gosset et"
Question: Do healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are healthier lifestyles and lifestyles that incorporate fitness and lifestyle changes leading to less utilization of public healthcare resources?

Results: Results of Experiment 1 showed that those who participated in the exercise and lifestyle interventions were more likely reduce the use of medical services. For example, participants that exercised less were more likely to reduce the use of pain medication, tranquilizer medication and sedative medication over time. Additionally, those participants that increased their physical activity and/or engaged in a diet of at least 1,200 kcal/d were the least likely to have a physician visit within four years. To sum up the findings, exercise and lifestyle interventions were positively associated with reductions in utilization of services, indicating that healthier behaviors are key to reducing their utilization. Moreover, there was a decrease in utilization of medical services associated with participants that changed their behavior. Finally, participants with healthier lifestyles and behaviors were more likely to use care after four years.

Methods

Participants

The study was a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 10 sites in North America and Europe. The study used data from a large prospective cohort. This study was approved by the institutional review board of each center and included participants who were at least 50 years of age. The sample population included men and women aged 40 years and older and were of non-Hispanic, English-speaking, high socioeconomic status in the United States (Gulf Coast, Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Minnesota). The sampling design of this study was informed design by the New York and San Francisco Institutional Review Boards and provided consent by all staff. All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment in this study.

Procedure

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. The control group was a group of healthy participants that did not receive any intervention. The active group was a group of patients randomized to moderate aerobic exercise for three sessions/week for approximately four to six weeks. The intervention and exercise activities were guided by an exercise instructor at the Clinical Research Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. The control group was a group of patients age 40 years and older who also received medical care as part of their healthcare routine or as part of their general health routine. All patients were assessed as a baseline condition and randomized to one of the intervention or control groups twice weekly using a computer generated randomization sequence (Figure 1). The intervention in our study included a weekly visit with the exercise instructor in the Clinical Research Institute. At the beginning of the 12-week program, the intervention instructor determined the participant's fitness level using the American College of Sports Medicine-approved program based on the American College of Sports Medicine Standards of Fitness and Exercise Testing Protocol, revised edition, version 7.11.4.5.1 (14). Exercise programs were based on the following guidelines for aerobic exercise: 40–50 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise for 30–60 minutes at a steady state (e.g., brisk walking) with two to three minutes of rest. The exercise curriculum was tailored to the physical characteristics and health goals of the participant and the control group. An individual is defined to be fit if their 1-RM and 1–2 min of 30–60 minute aerobic exercise is at a 1% and 2% variance from their VO 2max (18).

The intervention and exercise programs were developed by researchers from the School of Nursing, University of Minnesota's College of Education, and published in peer-reviewed journals. The intervention and exercise programs were developed using scientific literature and published research articles (11), as well as the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine-Approved fitness regimen for adults. The interventions included three to six weeks of aerobic exercise of 45–60 minutes at a steady state, with three to four minutes of brief rests, and five to eight minutes of rest and moderate to vigorous resistance exercises with a 15–20 minute rest interval between the exercise sessions. An individual is defined to be fit if their 1-RM and 1–2 min of 30–60 minute aerobic exercise is at a 1% and 2% variance from their VO 2max. The exercise program was designed so that participants were challenged in aerobic exercises at a moderate intensity and were able to maintain the exercise intensity for 30–60 minutes. For exercises that did not fit the intervention guidelines, this level of training was set at no more than an hour of vigorous resistance or no more than three hours of cardiovascular exercise.

Averaging the number of participants was very important to assess the amount of variance between people and what activities would be selected by the study investigators. For example, the number of participants in this study varied by more than 10% depending on the year of recruitment and the specific year of the study, with the greatest variation within the 10–14% range (11). Thus, when averaged across years, a randomized group could have more variability than a non-randomized group.

Question: Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients? You can also find some useful information and links below.

The NZ Health Survey shows that most New Zealanders (86% nationally, 78% among people aged 45+ years) experienced their first deaths during the first quarter of their lives, with the second quarter of one's life being the second most common period.

During the decade of 1999–2000, the median age at death increased from 46 to 51 years.

Deaths by sex/age are particularly high among women and between 20–44 year olds.

This means that many people are left to grapple in silence with the questions about their age at death when they need to know what has happened to them. The New Zealand National Health Survey asks people about their age at death, as well as their age when they were born and their birthplace in New Zealand.

This is because death by age does not appear for everyone who dies, but it is important to remember the difference between the age at death and age when you were born. People may remain alive if their birth year and the year when they die fall within the years covered by the NZNHS birth cohort.

Question: Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement? Abstract

Abstract Objective To compare kinematic parameters of the knee and hip joints and to identify subluxation mechanisms. Design Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients referred for knee or hip replacement. Setting Case series at an operating theatre after operative knee joint replacement. Participants Participants were 1065 patients referred for knee or hip replacement. Instrumentation Knee and hip joint motion parameters and kinematics of the hip and knee joints were objectively recorded using ultrasound and radiological techniques. Kinematic parameters were compared between subjects before surgery (<0.12 mV) and immediately following knee or hip replacement (0.12–0.25 mV) with the exception of the leg extensor pull, which was calculated independently by the subject's position and time of observation. Results In the overall group of patients, mean (SD) values of kinematic parameters were not significantly correlated to age after surgery (r = –0.083, P = 0.061). The mean (SD) values of the knee kinematics and its variability before and after knee replacement were not significantly different (range, 0.02–0.12 mV; P = 0.945). Mean (SD) values for the hip kinematics were significantly higher than those for the knee kinematics and its variability (range, 0.02–0.04 mV; P = 0.013) but not significantly different after surgery. The joint kinematics and the knee kinematics of patients who had undergone a total knee replacement were not significantly different after surgery in the overall group (r = 0.021, P = 0.872). However, the mean (SD) values of the leg extensor pull were significantly higher after the total knee replacement (range, 0.021–0.18 mV; P = 0.008 compared with the values prior to knee replacement) than after the knee replacement (range, 0.039–0.04 mV; P = 0.014) (Table). In the overall group, the mean (SD) values of the thigh extensor pull were significantly higher after the total knee replacement (range, 0.020–0.16 mV; P = 0.009) than after the complete knee replacement (range, 0.036–0.01 mV; P = 0.013) (Table). Conclusions We assessed the effect of unilateral knee or hip replacement on knee and hip kinematics, and found no significant modification of these kinematic parameters. These kinematics did not vary significantly between subjects before or after surgery. The leg extensor pull was not modified after surgery. Keywords: hip knee, femoral neck, hip range of motion, hip joint, unilateral, joint kinematics, leg extensor pull, leg extensor pull of patients with total knee replacement

Kinematic evaluation of the knee in the operating theatre during knee joint replacement is essential if a new joint can be reconstructed.1 The purpose of this study was to measure the peak torque of the knee extensor muscles from three independent positions. The peak torque (kTmax) is calculated as the velocity of the peak EMG during the maximal twitch in the ankle or leg extensor muscle during the maximum extension of the ankle or leg by a single agonist.2,3 A peak torque of between 2.5 and 6.5 N·m−2 or 2.5 and 3.5 N·cm−2, respectively, has been reported for patients with complete vs partial knee replacement.4–6 The knee is regarded as the most unstable joint in the human body and its extensor and flexor components are the most likely to be affected in knee replacement.2,7 Therefore, in the surgical setting, it is highly desirable to assess in more detailed detail the kinematics of the knee during surgery.8 The purpose of this study was to compare the kinematic parameters of the hip and knee joints and to identify subluxation mechanisms for the hip and knee joints to prevent instability and to minimize any risk of impingement. A series of individual clinical and radiologic studies were conducted to evaluate the kinematic parameters of the patients before and after implantation of a standard knee appliance. We also compared the kinematic parameters of the patients before and after implantation of a knee extensor appliance that used a large-diameter and one-piece strap, and a femoral neck brace, such as an adductor device that was implanted in the right knee, and a knee prosthesis that was implanted in the left knee.

Methods Participants In this retrospective study, all patients referred for knee or hip replacement between April 1998 and June 2000 were included. Patients who lost one or more limbs had to be excluded. Patients"
Question: Are serum leptin levels a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are serum leptin levels a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer? Why it might help: Insulin resistance causes excessive caloric intake and increases triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) levels, both of which may increase the risk of lung cancer. The relationship between insulin resistance and atherosclerosis is well supported and demonstrated by the Framingham Study. The association between lower serum leptin levels and the risk of lung cancer is not as well established. It may be related to the effects of leptin on metabolism and lipid metabolism: The link between insulin resistance and obesity, specifically the relation between body weight and serum leptin levels, is a well established phenomenon. Leptin is secreted by adipose tissue, and it does not require adipose tissue to possess it. In this vein, the hormone appears to play a key role in satiety, as has been verified by various studies investigating how leptin levels relate to appetite. It is important to keep in mind that leptin levels are affected by several factors, all of which are modifiable and can lead to improved body weight. Summary: Insulin resistance and obesity are well-understood risk factors for the development of lung cancer. The relationship between the circulating leptin level and the risk of the disease is unclear. Insulin resistance, obesity, and coronary artery disease all have been implicated in the development of lung cancer. Low serum leptin levels may attenuate the progression of lung cancer. The best strategy in preventing lung cancer is to achieve a healthy weight.

Question: What kind of foods should be avoided in order to minimize the risk of developing cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What kind of foods should be avoided in order to minimize the risk of developing cancer? Why it might help: Cancer is a disease of civilization, and while it is generally recognized that the incidence of cancer is declining, it still occurs at an alarming rate, particularly among young adults, and the incidence of cancer has risen markedly in developed countries as a result of the use of certain carcinogenic drugs. It is particularly important to focus efforts on dietary choices that are associated with lower risks of the disease. Summary: The intake of high-monounsaturated fat and diets high in refined carbohydrates increase the risk of cancer. Most Americans are currently at risk for developing breast cancer and colon cancer, particularly if they do not consume adequate amounts of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Studies have shown that men who are overweight and have high body fat levels are at increased risk for developing breast cancer, and for developing colon cancer, although not all studies point to the same causes. The risk of developing cancer is not only increased by obesity in healthy people, but also by low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. The effects of high-monounsaturated fat intake on cancer risk are unknown, although recent studies suggest, as do others, that a low dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Summary: Consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol is associated with a lower risk of developing cancer, including pancreatic cancer. Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. The benefits of an omega-3 fatty acid–rich diet may depend on specific dietary choices, depending on the amount and type of fatty acids consumed.

Conclusion

Given that the incidence of certain cancers is increasing, in most parts of the world cancer is likely to be on the rise for the next few generations. As a general rule, the mortality data can be summarized in several graphs. They display different patterns between different regions of the world and some time periods. From this graph we can get a sense of the trends in cancer risk that are occurring throughout the world, as well as the changes that need to occur to significantly reduce the rates of cancer.

Figure 1

Trends in Death Rate Versus Time Period Data by Country


The figure shows overall death rate versus time period (per 100,000) based on death registry data from 1981-1990 (left panel) and 1997-2007 (right panel). The curves represent the total data by death registry and countries at risk for cancer for 1981-1990 and 1997-2007. The solid lines indicate significant reductions in the rate of cancer mortality, whereas the dashed lines show the rates increasing. As can be seen, several populations experienced significant declines in their cancer mortality rates, or rates in regions of high-and-slow cancer mortality. Among many of these countries, notably, China, India, and South Korea, the rates were similar, at less than 2% and less than 5%, respectively.

Question: Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

It is currently unclear why the KCNQ1 gene contains this stretch. The gene is found on the surface of mitochondria where it functions in regulating mitochondrial function. For example, it controls how many calories are available to mitochondria each day (Kanagawa, et al. 2015). It also controls the amount of oxygen that is consumed by mitochondria. It is hypothesized that KCNQ1 controls the ability of the mitochondria to produce and release energy. That the KCNQ1 protein binds to its binding site on the mitochondrial DNA, which leads to a protein complex known as the mitochondrial fusion factor (MFF), which binds to the enzyme of the mitochondrial fusion protein called the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and is able to initiate the process by which mitochondria produce and release energy. This leads to heart disease. Since humans inherit this mutation from their parents, this hypothesis fits the observation of many individuals that this gene has a strong correlation with heart disease. A previous report suggested that the KCNQ1 gene may play a role in heart disease, however, no causal association between the KCNQ1 gene and heart disease was found. The current study was designed to see if the KCNQ1 gene could be linked with heart disease using biomarkers that are specific to heart disease. These include markers of lipid (lipid) content, heart function parameters

The heart rate of individuals with mitochondrial mutations for the KCNQ1 gene who were given a drug called riluzole (a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor). The researchers measured the blood hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone on a daily basis in 15 subjects who had either been taking riluzole or had not been taking it. The researchers observed that participants who had the KCNQ1 gene mutation who received riluzole experienced an increase in the hormone which was correlated with the heart rate. In addition, heart rate was determined every 5 minutes, and the number of beats per minute had an inverse correlation to the levels of cholesterol, total cholesterol, and LDL (bad) cholesterol.

The authors concluded:

As a result of these and other biomarkers, the authors propose that the Kcnq1-KF1M5 mutation may influence cardiovascular health by affecting the expression of the MAPK pathway, which in turn results in the increase in the levels of the hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and thereby the blood level of cholesterol. This study provides empirical evidence that the heart rate level and the levels of cholesterol and total cholesterol are directly correlated with the expression of the MAPK pathway, which in turn results in the increases in triglycerides. Therefore, the heart was more active in the high KCNQ1-N4M4 gene group than in the placebo group. The study also provides evidence that the presence of the Kcnq1-KF1M5 gene mutation may lead to the presence of oxidized beta-1-glycoprotein, a marker of increased oxidative stress. This may in turn influence the level of the stress hormone eicosanoid, which was also observed in the MAPK pathway, which in turn may lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques at arterial walls. Based on these observations, Kanagawa et al. (2015) propose that the heart rate may be associated with the expression of the MAPK pathway, cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Question: Are adult body circumferences associated with height? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are adult body circumferences associated with height? A: Adult (adult age at menarche, and at menarche plus age at first birth have not been associated). This is because other factors such as pre-operative weight and age are present. The male body dimensions, with a height to body weight ratio of 0.71, can be divided into 3 categories. Body contours of height depend on the presence of 2 features: the male sex ratio (a lower ratio than among females) and the male height to body weight ratio of 0.67. Body contours of height are influenced by: BMI (obesity), sex (male), height (female) & sex ratio (a higher ratio than among females). The average adult male height to body weight ratio is 0.71. This means that men in any age group have body contours that will naturally lead to weight gain or loss. The average adult male height (not counting the weight gain & loss) is 0.85 and is thus approximately 5 cm taller. (Table 1).

Table 1 BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Ratio of body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/ female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, female/female, female/female and gender Both BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, male/female, male/female and gender BMI: Body height, female/female, female/female and gender Body height, female/female, female/female and gender Body height, female/female, female/ female and gender Body height, female/female, female/female and gender There is a strong positive correlation between BMI and male height, a correlation that is especially strong among men aged 20 to 39 years, 0.67 (0.90) for all sexes (Table 2). Both the body contours of height and the body lengths (from the midpoint of the thigh below the knee across both sides) are negatively correlated with BMI. The total weight gained or lost must be at least 1.5 cm for males and 2.5 cm for females for the BMI to be 0.7 (Table 3). Table 2.

The BMI-height correlation with body contours of height and sex ratio does not remain as strong as the body length-weight correlation with BMI. Body contours of height (obesity > height, or weight > weight) are positively associated with BMI and negatively associated with height and sex ratio. They are also positively associated with female BMI (0.81) and negatively associated with male BMIs (0.65). There is a strong negative correlation between total weight and gender in men and a strong positive correlation with BMI in men.

Question: Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients?

Answer: Corrected QT can predict left ventricular hypertrophy by increasing the time it takes for the heart to return to resting rhythm. This increased cardiac output enables the heart to pump faster to compensate for the decrease in the heart's oxygen supply during a contraction.

Question: How can a correct QT interval be used to differentiate patients with congestive heart failure from normal patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How can a correct QT interval be used to differentiate patients with congestive heart failure from normal patients?

Answer: Correct QT interval (QTc) does not differentiate between normal and congestive heart failure, a common common cause of death after a heart attack. Patients with a right atrial defect can have a better chance of surviving a heart attack than patients with a left atrial defect. Also, the patient who has QTc>120 minutes before a heart attack is more likely to survive. The more time the left ventricle sits at rest, the more favorable the patient's survival odds are.

Question: How can a correct QT interval determine when a patient had a stroke (hemodynamic instability) and also when a left ventricular hypertrophy occurred? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How can a correct QT interval determine when a patient had a stroke (hemodynamic instability) and also when a left ventricular hypertrophy occurred?

Answer: Correct QT intervals can distinguish between patients with stroke and normal cardiac events by indicating when stroke occurred and why the abnormal ventricle was formed. If no left ventricular pathology can be found in the blood sampling immediately after heart attack, the patient may have been correctly diagnosed with a right ventricular fibrillation. If an abnormal ventricle is found in the hospital with heart arrest or sudden cardiac death, the patient is most likely to be diagnosed with congestive heart failure. The QT interval at the end of the time of stroke was almost never used in initial detection of left ventricular hypertrophy.

Question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of an accurate QT interval? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of an accurate QT interval?

Answer: A more accurate QT interval can be used to determine when a patient has had a first stroke (hemodynamic instability). Stroke can happen after about 10 years of follow up in most patients who have a QT interval of 50+ minutes. Because heart conditions such as hypertrophy and ventricular dysfunction frequently are seen decades after the initial stroke, inaccurate QT interval can be used to confirm the diagnosis of heart disease that may have gone unrecognized when the patient presented with heart failure. Patients with long-standing heart disease often do not have a specific cause such as a right atrial defect (left anterior descending defect) or a family history of heart disease. Furthermore, an"
Question: Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity?

Answer: A study published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine demonstrated that the position of the aortic arch is very important to the rate of aortic injury. The authors examined four different groups -- football players, hockey players, weight lifters, and endurance athletes -- and examined injuries and injury severity in all four groups within the same season. According to the authors, ""The athletes in each group had identical arthroscopic procedures, no differences in post-operative status, and similar athletic level. However, in the one group that received immediate surgery, the aortic arch depth and aortic arch thickness, and the thickness of the aortic arch itself were significantly diminished. These differences were not found in any other group. The authors stated that the reduction in arch thickness, which may be considered a ""shock"" in itself, did not show any significant trend over time. The authors added that there exists a ""metabolic threshold"" for this reduction in diameter, and the threshold decreases with subsequent months.""1

A common myth about aortic injury is that ""Aortic damage is caused by the heart pumping out blood and the arteries swelling, but aortic injuries are not caused by that.""2 This has led to increased the use of arterial infusions (heart-lung bypass) while increasing the rates of aortic fractures. It has been shown by numerous studies from the late 1980s through to about 2006, that in-hospital aortic-arteriac surgeries significantly increase the rate of coronary artery bypass grafts. However, studies show that the patients at aortic-arteriac surgery surgery have a higher risk of suffering aortic-arterial graft complications, such as aortic dissection, anterior aortic dissection, and aortic dissection with atherosclerosis.

A study of more than 250 patients who went through aortic-arteriac surgery from January 1991 to December 2003 compared patients without ACL injuries to those who did with the same patients, but with the ACL injuries treated by infusions of blood products. Patients who had no ACL injuries were matched for age, gender, and medical history. Patients who received aortic-arteriac surgery demonstrated a 24 percent higher rate of graft complications than patients who had ACL surgeries, but the difference was not significant.3 (In this study, the use of arterial transfusions and/or arterial infusions of blood products could have contributed to the difference.)4

It is important to note that aortic injury has many causes. The incidence of a sub-arachnoid hemorrhage is increased in patients with acute aortic aneurysm disease.5 Aortic dissection and subsequent aortic dissection with atherosclerosis usually develop between 5-15 days after the surgery, and rarely occur within days of the surgery. Aortic dissection with atherosclerosis usually develops between 4-72 hours after the surgery.

Abstract: To our knowledge, there is no published case series, prospective multicenter, randomized trial, or cohort analysis of the effect of high-dose metronidazole for treatment of late stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma with or without multiple relapses. Thus, no studies have examined the risks associated with the treatment of late-stage and non-Hodgkin lymphoma with or without multiple relapses with high-dose metronidazole. If the evidence presented is convincing, treating late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma with metronidazole for three years appears to be reasonable. Additionally, the potential benefit of high-dose metronidazole in patients at higher risk is noteworthy; however, high-dose metronidazole is currently a potentially toxic drug.

However, many patients have undergone an effective pharmacologic treatment. This is the first of many articles detailing the design and rationale of this multidrug protocol in this setting. A systematic review and meta-analysis are used with data from the treatment of advanced neoplasms with combination therapy. The evidence for safety of the combination therapy is sufficient to support the use of combination therapy.

Abstract: The immunotherapy of late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma is controversial and some results have been reported and are being studied. We review recent preclinical and clinical studies that may assist in understanding the use and efficacy of immunotherapy in late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The benefits of immunotherapy in late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma appear promising. The use of these agents requires knowledge of these patients and consideration of the patient's current immunosuppression.

Abstract: The success of immunotherapy in late-stage (5 years) patients with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma is controversial. In the early 1990's, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 10 subjects who had a median median T-cell count of 600,000 cells per mm3 appeared promising. However, a randomized control trial of a high dose of metronidazole and 5 mL/kg/min of intravenous vitamin C in late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma failed to demonstrate significant benefits of the medication in terms of disease resolution or recurrence. In the present study, we retrospectively examined the effect of immunotherapy in late-stage (5 years) patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where there appears to be scant evidence of benefit. Our findings provide the necessary rationale for"
Question: Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer?

Breast and Nipple Cancer

There are many factors that cause breast and nipple cancer, such as genetic factors, genetic variations of estrogen, and the number of cells that are undergoing cell division.

Breast cancer tends to develop around the breast, but it may be localized to areas other than the breast. Nipple cancer usually develops over the nipple or the areola, about two dozen to five dozen to a dozen cells in a tiny area.

The nipple and surrounding tissue are considered not to be a significant source of breast cancer, and there is no evidence that radiation can cause breast cancer. Only 2% to 5% of women need further treatment to remove some of these cells.

During mastectomy, the surgeon cuts off the breast, usually at the nipple, and replaces it with another breast to keep the nipple from being infected with cancer-causing bacteria. About one-third to one-half of the tumors left over are then removed to make the nipple better able to provide breast milk.

Nipple wall radiation is not usually needed after mastectomy.

Breast cancer can also develop between the nipple wall, from within the nipple, and between the nipple and the glandular tissue at the breast called carcinoma in situ (CIS), which are benign tumors. If treated before cancer arises, one of these forms of cancer may develop.

There are some tumors that require mastectomy (such as breast tumor cells) to reduce their chances of developing cancer after they are removed. Breast tumor removal may be used to relieve symptoms such as breast tenderness or breast pain, or to prevent further cancer from developing. Sometimes it may be used to treat certain symptoms of breast cancer without mastectomy (e.g., benign breast tumors that are too small to be removed or for other reasons).

Although many reports have linked mammographic screening, or more recently, mammograms, with decreasing incidence of breast cancer in women, they never found a relationship. Therefore, some breast cancer screening programs may still be appropriate even with mammography at increased levels.

The following guidelines describe breast cancer screening results related to chest wall radiation:

The annual chest floor radiography (Breast Radiation Screening) test can help distinguish between normal and other forms of breast cancer.

The breast CT and breast MRI are only used to screen for breast cancers that occur on the breast. This usually means there is little risk of cancer developing in the rest of the body.

If you have had a breast or nipple cancer in the last 5 6 years (a possible lifetime risk of more than 5%) you should have mammogram examination when your nipples have turned white. If your nipple's turning dark and you're not sure, talk to a mammologist or health care provider to rule out a lifetime risk.

Question: Can bisphosphonate treatment be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can bisphosphonate treatment be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility? Abstract: To study the effect of this compound on the development of skeletal fragility of premature infants, we used three- and seven-month-old children. The study aims at finding out the long-term effects of the treatment. A sample of 30 subjects will be enrolled in this study. It will have the following characteristics:

Subjects:

Thirty-five premature babies

Six-month interval between the date of administration and the time of randomization The procedure:

The children were randomly assigned to receive either bisphenol A (10 μg) or a Bisphenol S (10 μg) (n = 24). In addition, 30 children were given an oral formulation (Bisphenol S 50 μg) which has a significantly higher concentration of bisphosphonate in the diet. Bisphenol S was added to the group receiving the Bisphenol A. The children was placed under constant monitoring for the duration of the treatment.

Results:

At one month, the mean scores of skeletal fragility in the children receiving the Bisphenol S group became significantly lower (mean [±SD] scores 9.10 [10.92] on the 4-point scoring system) compared to the children who received the Bisphenol A group (16.80 [18.36] points). At 7 months, a significantly higher ratio of the number of bones in the skull of the children receiving the Bisphenol S group was observed (17.22 [18.20] points) than in the cases in the Bisphenol A group (8.50 [8.21]; P < 0.05). At 8 months, a significantly higher ratio of the number of bones in the feet of the children receiving the Bisphenol S group was observed than in the cases in the Bisphenol A group (15.38 [16.75] points) The results indicate that in three-month-old infants the ratio of the number of bones in the skull between the two groups is strongly correlated with the decrease in the number of developing bones. The bisphenol compounds have a very beneficial effect on the skeletal development of the premature infants. They decrease the number of developing bones. This study is published in European Journal of Paediatric Cardiology; (12): 11-18, 2014

Comment: If the children received the bisphenol compounds, they can experience a decrease in bone strength but there are no adverse effects on bone mass. There are no adverse effects on bone mass found in the study participants. There has been a substantial increase in the number of growth plates and the number of bone minerals. The study confirms that Bisphenol S, particularly at doses in the 20 μg/kg range, does not affect the quality of an infant's growth plates which results in growth benefits. The research should continue on the side effects because the effects of bisphosphonate at lower doses may be greater than the ones experienced once the dose is higher. Bottom Line: The findings of the study suggest that bisphenol S has a favorable effect on a preemie's growth plate, and this finding is promising as a method for treating growth defects in premature infants.

How to Tell If You are Drinking Bisphosphonate In Children For many reasons, including the following, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pregnant women and parents not administer bisphenol S to pregnant or breastfeeding women who also drink alcoholic beverages. Bisphenol S is a known human carcinogen (14) and is the active ingredient in ""Tylenol"" (Tylenol, L'Oréal) (15), and ""K2, the painkiller"" (16). Although there is no doubt about it, Bisphenol S can inhibit the effects of acetaminophen (17). Although the link to acetaminophen is controversial, acetaminophen is also an ingredient found in some Bisphenol S chews. Many studies suggest that this can interfere with the effects of acetaminophen on a child's development (18). However, studies also show that children who are exposed to this compound seem to have normal bone mineral ratios, a normal metabolic profile, normal growth, and normal IQ. (19) Therefore, use is not recommended until further studies can fully assess the effects of bisphenol S on a child's bones. Children should also not be exposed to a Bisphenol S chew containing more than 20 mg/kg. The recommended amount to consume for children 6 months of age is 0.75 mg/kg to ensure a dose lower than 20 mg/kg (4 μg/kg) for the purpose of this study. (4"
"Question: Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs? I. Overview of the Discussion. Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture compared with acute primary surgery of patients at high risk of hip fracture: a meta-analysis. Arthroscopy. 2002; 31: 1-7. II. Results of the Research and Methodology. In general, regional or general anesthesia is used to perform surgery in patients with acute hip fracture who are at low to moderate risk for hip fracture. Our systematic review was focused on all studies that compared the safety and effectiveness of regional anesthesia and anesthesia alone with no surgical intervention. Studies were evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration criteria for randomised controlled trials, with the quality of the trial and study design evaluated independently. Studies were categorised according to the treatment for patients with hip fracture. All studies were required to meet the following four criteria: randomisation, blinding or concealment of patients, the duration of the intervention, and number of patients participating in the intervention and comparing the treatments compared between patients in regional anesthesia and their surgical counterparts in the treatment group. There was insufficient information available to determine the exact use of regional anesthesia for patients with acute hip fracture. For studies that compared only general anesthesia with regional anesthesia, the absolute number of patients with acute hip fracture was not known. In many studies, there was no information about the regional use of general anesthesia or regional anesthesia alone in the acute treatment. A limited number of studies assessed the regional use of general anesthesia, general anesthesia in acute surgery or general anesthesia alone in acute primary surgery in patients with acute hip fracture. The average number of patients with hip fracture, the regional use of general anesthesia, and the number of patients participating in regional versus general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone were not independently assessed. We investigated and compared regional anesthesia and all other surgical interventions used in the treatment group by comparing the absolute and relative improvement in functional quality of life, quality of patient life, ambulatory outcome, and costs of treatment in patients with hip fracture, regardless of surgical intervention or regional and general anesthesia use. We also assessed the comparative effectiveness between patients from each treatment group and compared this to the overall difference in the overall difference between the groups. The results are summarised in Table : Table 1 Study Author Year Country Patients Randomized Controlled Trials Quality of Studies Comparison Between Conditions Treatment Group Comparisons Limitations Coady-Stokes E, Bercanu P, Bevacqua A, Stenzi S 2014; 1:1,5,17–18. Comparison of regional anesthesia in 1 to 1,5,17 to 18 months. N-acetyl cysteine in acute hip fracture treated for up to 18 months with regional anesthesia and/or in submassive osteochondritis with or without general anesthesia is associated with faster resolution of hip pain of up to 16% compared with no treatment. The mean time to complete recovery from pain reduction is increased by up to 14% in the no treatment group. Results: No difference in pain score between patients with acute hip osteochondritis and patients with acute knee osteoarthritis who received regional anesthesia versus no treatment. However, no significant differences were found in the percentage with improvement in pain. The increase in hip pain in the no treatment group was comparable with that in the treatment group. Kneeling height, pain, functional impairment, and ambulatory outcome were not different between patients with hip fracture and normal individuals with submucosal osteoarthritis. Results: Conclusion: There is no evidence that regional anesthesia or no treatment decreases both pain and functional improvement in patients with acute hip fracture compared with general anesthesia alone. No consistent effect of no treatment or regional anesthesia in reducing pain level compared with no treatment. N.acetyl cysteine is a strong, well-tolerated anti-inflammatory drug widely used in the emergency room. The analgesic efficacy of n-acetyl cysteine is related to the number and duration of administration in clinical trials. We investigated the efficacy, dose-response, and the safety of these drugs in the acute treatment for patients with hip fracture or submucosal osteoarthritis given either general anesthesia or regional anesthesia. The results are summarised in Table. This systematic review did not find a difference in the rates of postoperative pain between general or regional anesthesia groups in the treatment groups compared with the treatment group given no surgical intervention. This review did not find a difference between the numbers of patients for which both local and regional analgesia was provided for patients with hip fracture compared with general anesthesia alone. The number of patients needing no intervention in this study was 2,821, of which 2,749 (61%) received primary treatment or postoperative care; 2,7"
Question: Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse?

Hypothetic hypothesis: The clinical effect of drugs used to manage hypertension is to elevate heart rate, blood pressure, or both, with a secondary effect of decreasing or restoring blood sugar tolerance or blood pressure to normal. Patients whose treatment has an effect on heart rate, blood pressure, or both will have higher rates of death, hospital discharge, or institutionalization. Patients whose treatment has no effect on either of these outcomes will have lower rates of both.

Relevance: The primary effect of pharmacotherapy is to normalize blood pressure or reduce blood glucose levels to normal levels. The secondary effect is reduction or correction of the presence of hypertension and/or of disease in hypertensives (diabetes mellitus, obesity, prehypertension). In this case, the effect will be attributed to medication, not to a single cause.

Methods

Study Design: The Study: Randomized. The randomization of patients to treatment and to placebo (Placebo) controls was carried out using a computer generated randomization list from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Study Treatment: Both the Control and the Treatment groups received standard medication in the treatment phase. Placebo was a no-cost, patient-supplied, commercially available pill that contained caffeine and saccharin. The control group received a non-pharmacological placebo (a solution of saline without caffeine and saccharin).

Patients: All admitted or treated to the Veterans Affairs Health Care System for acute or chronic hypertension. Between March 1, 2001, and January 29, 2003, 549 patients were enrolled in the study; of these, 312 were randomized to receiving Placebo (placebo: n = 183) or Treatment (placebo:n = 183). Patients were considered to be receiving clinical drug for hypertension if their initial mean blood pressure or SBP was 120 mm Hg or greater, or if their blood pressure was 140 mm Hg or greater on any of the four measurements of blood pressure, measured at baseline, on the first day in the second week, and every week for at least 8 weeks.

Sample Size: Randomized. At the time of randomization, subjects had a mean age of 65.8 years (range = 42–90 years), with a median age of 50 years (range = 31–70 years). Controls were identified by matching on gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index, age, and body height. Each subject was matched with at least three patients at least one week apart.

Excess Standardized Data: We extracted a sample of data at baseline and at the end of the study, including measures of prehypertension, posthypertension, and drug interactions.

Study Interventions: All patients were required to have taken medication and complete clinical assessments at baseline. Drug interactions were assessed by reviewing the medications patients had taken on the day of randomization (n = 312). Patients who had received either allopurinol or any of the other drugs, as well as other medications commonly used to treat hypertension, were excluded from the analysis.

Statistical Analysis: All calculations were performed using the SAS statistical software system, and the primary and secondary outcomes were compared with a 2-sided P value, a α level of ≤0.05, and an appropriate nonparametric chi-square test.

Results: The mean follow-up period for the Treatment group was 9.3 years (range: 3.3–12.6 years), and 553 (97.8%) subjects responded to randomization, leaving 793 (75%) subjects enrolled and a mean age of 62 (SD = 25.9). The mean age for all patients in the study was 60 (SD = 23.3) years (range = 37.2–90.0 years). The mean (SD) of the patient population at baseline was 71 (SD = 31.8). Patients in the treatment group were slightly older than the control group on each endpoint, and were less likely to be female (P =.003) when compared at baseline and at the end of the study. There were no differences between prehypertension (mean difference, −0.5 (SD = 0.3); 95% CI, −1.9 to −0.1) and posthypertension (mean difference, –0.7 (SD = 0.9); 95% CI, −1.9 to −0.2) assessments, but there were significant differences between Treatment (P =.01) and Control (P =.006) assessments for days 1 (P =.008); days 3, 5, 6, 10, 14, 21, and 28 (P ="
Question: Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Treadmill testing of children who have Spina Bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake? A. Question: I have a 4-year-old child with Spina Bifida. This child has a normal resting heart rate and a resting blood pressure. The heart rate is high (40-50 bpm). The child is a recreational runner and runs at an easy pace to the home before bedtime. His body temperatures are normal. I'm wondering whether there is anything abnormal with his blood oxygen level and whether there is any information to be gained from monitoring his oxygen levels. A. Answer: This is a good question. There is some indication that in the young child, during periods of activity, the peak cardiac output may exceed the oxygen consumption calculated from a standard resting heart rate, and the oxygen consumption may be reduced. In my view, this would have to be regarded as a transient condition that does not affect any other organ or the child's respiratory or circulatory systems. It would not be relevant to the normal physiological functioning of the heart. It will be helpful if you could discuss with the child the effects of this condition and the various changes he would require to keep the problem under control; i.e. rest, use of oxygen, exercise, etc. The key in this case is as follows: (a) that the peak of the heart's work is below the oxygen consumption required to sustain respiration; (b) that the oxygen consumption for a maximal oxygen uptake is greater in the early morning (when oxygen uptake peaks) that in the late evening (when oxygen consumption decreases). This is, I think, the crux of the problem in the case of the young child. It would be helpful if you could help the younger child to adjust his daily routine so that it involves greater activity during the early morning or late evening. I also wonder whether the heart rate of the young child will decline more gradually in a similar way to that seen in the elderly. Treadmill testing of children with spina bifida has been done on a number of occasions, the results of which are not yet available. These tests are designed to measure the level of oxidative stress in blood and muscle tissue at different times during the day. These levels are the starting point for some treatments to be applied to improve the body's ability to react to oxidative stress. However, most of the research done to date has relied primarily on measuring oxygen uptake in blood and muscle. At best, you should be able to infer the age of a child from the oxygen consumption he has in a standardized laboratory test. Unfortunately, I think that children and adolescents who are spina bifida have less to show than older children and adolescents who carry other, non-neurological impairments. Therefore, it is my contention that the oxygen consumption of the young child will be similar to that of adults with a similar level of function. This may in part be because of some of the changes in the child's vascular system and the amount of work his heart is doing to cope with the increase in oxidative stress. I would be interested to hear the findings of a clinical investigation of the young child and if there is any indication of the effects of intervention. I'm not suggesting that this young child has any of the diseases that are commonly associated with spina bifida but rather that he will be less severely affected than he would be if he were a child with none of the impairments. (Answer to a question sent from the Office for Standards in Education in August 2003 and a similar question sent to the Office for Standards in Employment in August 2003) If it is in the best interests of his health to undertake an investigation of his respiratory function and the oxygen consumption of his heart, then your doctor may be pleased to discuss with you the possibilities of your participation in such an investigation.

We have discussed the potential benefits of blood readings as a predictor of risk for developing coronary heart disease and that blood level fluctuations (e.g. a sudden fall in blood glucose) may contribute to this risk.5.4, 6.12 However, there is only a small body of evidence on blood glucose testing in the context of the development of a new medical condition and therefore is not a suitable screening tool.1.12, 1.43 There is currently limited evidence on the effects of blood pressure on the development, prognosis and prevention of cardiovascular disease in adolescents and adults.1.18–21 There is a small body of evidence on the effects of blood pressure on kidney function and risk of developing cardiovascular disease in adults.7.41 However, no data is available about the effects of blood pressure on the development, prognosis and prevention of cardiovascular disease in young children.2.27"

"Question: Is there any evidence of a ""July effect"" in patients undergoing major cancer surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:","

Q and A:

Can we use a mathematical model to predict a patient's survival with only three months' follow-up? Yes. This paper has been accepted for publication.

Does it matter if we find it wrong? No. There could be good reasons why a hospital doesn't show a survival benefit from a single-treatment trial. If a patient is sick and poorly informed, they're more likely to pay less for a single-treatment trial.

When did it happen? How often?

The first evidence that survival is improved with single-treatment trials came out in the mid-1980s — with about 700 patients. At that time, survival seemed to be pretty strongly associated with chemotherapy, at least among chemotherapy-neutrophils (which are closely related to natural killer cells). But that doesn't make sense for some reasons, most significantly that survival is a fairly low-order clinical outcome — it doesn't predict life expectancy, it doesn't affect other measures of good health, and not many people even survive as long as a few months after they have an infection or minor injury.

The first meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials on survival was published in 2006, and showed improvement among patients with leukemia (as well as several other cancer types), especially in the short-term. This was one of the first major conclusions that any hospital reported.

Can we use a mathematical model to predict a patient's survival with only three months' follow-up? Yes. This paper has been accepted for publication. Does it matter if we find it wrong? No. There could be good reasons why a hospital doesn't show a survival benefit from a multi-treatment trial. If a patient is sick and poorly informed, they're more likely to pay less for a multi-treatment trial.

When did it happen? How often?

If a person survives more than three months from a single chemotherapy drug, there's no evidence that the treatment was significantly better than placebo; in fact, the patients who started chemotherapy had worse performance. But that's not always the case.

The last meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials on survival came out about eight years ago. This analysis of randomized, controlled trials showed survival was improved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients by at least 30% relative to placebo, and survival was increased for acute lymphoblastic lymphoma patients with multiple tumors by 40% relative to placebo. A lot of people have been calling this outcome ""a good drug.""

Cancer deaths for all non-CJD related causes were down slightly between 2008 and 2010: The number of deaths from cancers of the respiratory system is down for nearly all causes except pancreatic cancer, which was down 7%, and prostate cancer was down 31%.

Can we use a mathematical model to predict a patient's survival with only three months' follow-up? Yes

The last meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials on survival came out about eight years ago. This analysis of randomized, controlled trials showed survival was improved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all cancers but ALL) patients by at least 30% relative to placebo; survival was increased for acute lymphoblastic lymphoma patients with multiple tumors by 40% relative to placebo; and prostate cancer was down 31%.

And some newer data that hasn't been published yet, but which may have some relevance, suggests that survival may be slightly greater than 50% among patients with aortic aplasia (thoracic aortic aneurysm), but probably more like 30% or more for non-STEMI (stem cell) related diseases. This effect of survival on cancer deaths was stronger for patients who initiated chemotherapy early than for patients who never did; it was probably about 40% in non-STIS patients, but probably less than 20% in STIS patients.

Can our results be trusted?

Most important among these recent developments on this front is that there have been a few more large, well-designed studies on survival versus cancer survival. Many cancer researchers, including some in my hospital, believe that the most important and likely cause of this discrepancy has been the widespread implementation of chemotherapy.

Unfortunately, for some people, chemotherapy is the only treatment they can afford. I've asked doctors in other hospitals to review the results of the published studies mentioned above to be able to confirm whether a survival advantage can truly be expected.

It bears repeating that even the newest evidence for survival-improving chemo is based on small trials, and does not necessarily show that the more effective chemo is being used any more in many patients.

In fact, some cancer researchers are now warning about the dangers of chemotherapy. My colleague Bruce A. Mendelsohn is a pioneer in identifying the differences between chemotherapy and ""neut"
Question: Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis?

Answer: In most cases, it is unnecessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube in choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis (CMIC) patients. The rationale and rationale of the absence of a nasobiliary drainage tube in CMIC is that the primary objective is to prevent symptomatic cholangitis in the setting of symptomatic or choledochial stenosis. With the advent during the last half century of a newer and increasingly effective procedure (procedure in the treatment of CMIC) for the noninvasive assessment and/or removal of bile duct contents, the frequency of cholangitis and bile duct obstruction has decreased. The nasobiliary removal is not warranted in CMIC in the absence of symptomatic cholangitis as the primary and the underlying pathology shows signs of cholangitis and/or stenosis (i.e., choles (1) or ulcers (3) in the duodenum, omental bile duct lesions and/or duodenal strictures in the jejunum, absence of bile flow and/or obstruction of the bile ducts).

However, the management of CMIC remains controversial, as in the U.S., no common nosocomial bacterial infection is found in CMIC despite the presence of some gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (4–5). If the diagnosis of Cholangioembolism on an endoscopy is in doubt, the nasobiliary drainage tube should be removed (6).

Clinical observations and outcomes following cholecystitis- and bile duct obstruction. Cholecystitis Cholecystitis occurs in cholangiopathy (7). Of significant concern in the management of cholangioembolism is the presence of choles with either ulceration or cholangitis (8). The cholangioembolism syndrome has been compared among Cholangios (9,10). Choles of varying severity, both systemic and disseminated, occur with higher frequency after surgical removal of the omentum, with or without the use of a transnasal echocardiogram (9,10). The prevalence of the presence of cholangitis is higher in patients requiring endoscopic or invasive removal of the bile duct following cholangiopathy (10–14). Cholangioembolic infection Cholecystitis is an inflammatory disease with ulceration, pain, and fluid retention (15). Intestinal cholangitis, particularly with cholangios, are also associated with acute gastrointestinal discomfort or anemia, and there appears to be increased incidence of urological complications (16–18). Several investigators have reported that in 20% of patients requiring endoscopic surgical removal of the biliary tract, cholangiolipies are detected following operative cholangiopathy (9,20). In a study comparing choledocholithiasis-induced cholangiopathy to bile duct or renal tract stenosis, the rate of choledocholithiasis-induced cholangiopathy was greater than the rate in those with bile duct stenosis (9). The frequency of choledocholithiasis-induced cholangiopathy varies in patients requiring endoscopic removal of the pancreatic canals (n = 5) and in patients without canal stenosis with choledocholithiasis (n = 11) (9).

A recent study reported a case of an endoscopic cholangiopathy in the setting of bile duct obstruction. In patients who underwent endoscopic cholangiopathy prior to bile duct stenotic stenosis (n = 38), bile was retained by the nasobiliary route in 37% versus 16% with bile tubes in 18% to 44% of patients (7). The study was undertaken based on histopathologic data that included findings in 20% of B-lymphoid and 20% of B-cell lymphomas. Cholecystitis, with or without bile duct obstruction, occurs more frequently in patients with increased risk factors for systemic (19,20).

A prospective study investigating the rate of cholangiolipies in patients undergoing endoscopic cholangiopathy was conducted (9). The authors reported a total of 1.6 cases per 1000 cholangios occurring at the time of examination for endoscopic cholang"
Question: Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," If a public health emergency were to occur, and all vaccines were unavailable because of extreme winter cold, whether emergency staff could obtain vaccines from the community? What would be the consequences for the health and safety of the public?

(JTA) – It won't happen for a few weeks, according to a statement issued by the Obama HHS Secretary Tom Price. But that doesn't mean, he says, that everyone has lost hope. ""If we have more extreme cold weather it is our best defense since the creation of vaccinations,"" Price, who as health commissioner in the 1990s and early 2000s has directed all federal agencies to ensure that vaccines are available, has said.

Price was responding to the question that an editorial in the Jerusalem Post asked Price before the Health Committee in the Senate this week: ""What if every child was vaccinated for polio, tetanus, and measles? What if the public health emergency were to unfold in the United States?"" Price responded, ""The public health emergency of the 21st century, yes.""

Price's answer suggests that the current problem with the nation's public health emergency stockpile has a strong link to the outbreak in which 1,847 children died in the southern U.S. this January from a virus that is endemic in the communities in Georgia and South Carolina, and spread through the northeastern part of the country, starting with New York in December. The outbreak was linked to someone who brought the vaccine to his or her hometown of Atlanta, Price said.

""A public health emergency would apply to all of them,"" he added. ""We have our stock and there will be the necessary resources to provide them to the public.""

The U.S. public health alert system is supposed to work two ways, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: to make people aware of the threat posed by diseases so that they will get a vaccine, and to make them aware of opportunities to get the vaccine to avoid becoming infected themselves.

In the case of tetanus and polio, the vaccines are meant to be distributed in communities to ensure that the disease is effectively controlled in vulnerable populations, for example, if the vaccine is administered after a public health crisis before the outbreak.

The CDC says that vaccine storage is a weak link in the U.S. cold chain.

""It's very expensive, and it's a problem,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's associate director for disease prevention. ""People store chicken pox vaccine. They store measles vaccination, and there's a concern that they're storing vaccine, and that there could be a false sense of security that could lead to people not getting sick or getting sicker.""

Question: Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is the clinical positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy?

Answer: Yes. A sentinel lymph node biopsy of a breast cancer patient's axilla can exclude a non-small cell lung cancer and other potentially aggressive breast cancers. However, the biopsy is a highly exploratory procedure that can detect a much smaller range of rare and treatable lesions than would be the case for a biopsy of a breast tumor. A breast cancer patient's axilla with positive lymph node-cell cultures can be classified either by histology (a diagnosis made by pathologists) or by the presence of two lymph nodes, as shown in Table 1. However, because the positive lymph node tests can only detect cells that are present in the lymph nodes, they cannot detect all sites with the potential to develop into cancer. For example, since most lymphoid cells are found below the layer of adjacent normal lymphatic tissue, the results may not reflect the entire range of tumors in a patient's axilla. There are, however, certain diagnostic procedures that offer greater specificity than sentinel lymph node biopsy. Such procedures include CT angiography of the axilla, computed tomography scan of the axilla, and imaging of the axilla with immunohistochemical staining.

Positive Tested Negative for no node Nodes that are present in lymph nodes (i.e., two nodes plus more than one) Tonsils Nodes without lymph node tissue Other Nodes detected by lymph node biopsy, but within the range defined in the Diagnostic criteria for lymph node biopsy in a breast cancer patient's axilla.

Question: If I have a biopsy at a hospital, does that mean it's an admission? What if I didn't have a biopsy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: If I have a biopsy at a hospital, does that mean it's an admission? What if I didn't have a biopsy? Read and submit your abstract. What is the likelihood of having lymph node biopsy performed at your hospital? Write a paper that answers the Question: If I have a biopsy at a hospital, does that mean it's an admission? What if I didn't have a biopsy? Why hasn't there been a national law passed preventing the routine placement of biopsy or other diagnostic procedures (e.g., CT, CT angiography) without consent and without informed consent at the medical centers where they are performed?

Answer: Currently, many hospitals do not routinely perform biopsies because of the high costs, lack of local reimbursement, and legal controversy over consent for invasive procedures. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is recommending that the federal government pass such a law to protect patients before going under the knife. This recommendation follows on the heels of the AAP's report that reviewed biopsy recommendations in a pediatric medical center setting (7). This study identified 20 research articles published in 2002 and 2003. All were done in pediatric cancer centers. Of those articles, 18 specifically addressed biopsy in pediatric patients. These studies included an average of five biopsies per article to determine which techniques are most likely and cost effective. Most of the studies described their methodology, and a few stated whether the methods were the basis for any particular recommendations. As always, the best approach is to consult your local pediatric oncology registrar before making any decisions.

Question: Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can we find a mechanism for the association of epilepsy with retinal damage, and do we need to do studies on animals? It is known that some drugs at different stages of therapeutic progression are associated with retinal damage in both humans and animals (e.g. epilepsy drugs like Tegretol and Tylenol). The Question: Can we find a mechanism for the association of epilepsy and retinal damage, and do we need to do studies on animals? It is known that some drugs at different stages of therapeutic progression are associated with retinal damage in both humans and animals (e.g. epilepsy drugs like Tegretol and Tylenol). The question and answers have been published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia, in the Lancet, in the British Journal of Pharmacology, in the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, in several medical publications and also on the web.

I hope all questions concerning this issue have been covered by the experts: the British Journal of Anaesthesia, the Lancet, the British Journal of Pharmacology, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences and the British Medical Journal, for example. I hope all questions concerning this issue have been covered by the experts: the British Journal of Anaesthesia, the Lancet, the British Journal of Pharmacology, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences, the Journal of the Neurological Sciences and the British Medical Journal, for example.

It's true that retinal hemorrhage is the most common cause of blindness in humans, with 40,000 new cases being admitted to the hospital every year. It occurs at any age, in any area and is also characterized by increased susceptibility to injury and is more common than most other neurodegenerative diseases studied in healthy adults. These observations prompted researchers to focus on the possibility that epilepsy may contribute to retinal injury as a potential mechanism of the disease, especially after the conclusion of clinical trials. In 2005, the European Retinal Injury Assessment Network, funded by the European Union, evaluated nearly 70 studies by using brain imaging, neuropathology, neuropathological observations and clinical trials. The results were conclusive; for the best results, the most extensive tests were performed on mice during the development of retinal detachment or injury. These studies show that in the mouse retina the retinal cells appear in very early stages, and this fact is well documented. The authors concluded: ""It appears highly likely than one might assume that epilepsy is a significant risk factor for the development of retinal-damage-related retinal lesions"". What happens in the mouse visual field when these cells are injured? A significant alteration of the retinal response is seen, such as a loss of colour, haemorrhage or damage to other areas of the retina. In healthy animals, a dramatic and rapid response of the eyes is present, in contrast with the normal response of the eyes at the same age in rodents. The authors conclude that the observed pattern in which neuronal activity in the mouse retina begins several days after the development of retinal detachment might be caused by early structural modifications induced by the first injury and/or by the later loss of cellular connections. The authors conclude: ""It appears highly likely than one might assume that epilepsy is a significant risk factor for the development of retinal-damage-related retinal lesions"".

In other words: epileptic seizures at one stage of treatment might cause problems associated with eye damage at another stage of the therapy. In other words: epileptic seizures at one stage of treatment might cause problems associated with eye damage at another stage of the therapy. This can be very risky for people who are undergoing treatment with drugs that are often used to make seizures less severe. In other words: epileptic seizures at one stage of treatment might cause problems associated with eye damage at another stage of the therapy. This can be very risky for people who are undergoing treatment with drugs that are often used to make seizures less severe. Many doctors and specialists believe that, since many such retinal injuries occur in the human visual system, they are probably due to changes in eye structure and that the brain has to compensate by producing new cells.

If retinal injury occurs in early stages of treatment and/or is seen very early after the onset of seizures or seizures that occur with anticonvulsant drugs, as the authors state, this might be the result of a process of cellular repair and/or regeneration. One cannot exclude the possibility that the retina is actually damaged and/or destroyed by such events. Another possibility could be due to apoptosis, where the DNA of cells that have undergone destruction by viral, chemical or microbial agents is replaced by new DNA.


I hope the answers have been answered. In some cases, seizures may cause eye injury at other times, without any seizure itself being considered. If so, this may"

Question: Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90° of Knee Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90° of Knee Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction? Abstract: The purpose of this study is to determine if flexile or elastic elasticity in the antero-posterior (API) femoral tunnel can produce a satisfactory anteroposterior (AP) femoral tunnel length and the degree of adhesion to the achilles tendon. We compared the API femoral tunnel parameters and the knee extensor muscle function at 90° of knee flexion (0°, 50°, and 75°) in patients with right-sided ACL injury. Thirty male patients with mild (N=10), moderate (N=8), or severe (N=15) ACL injury and 35 patients healthy patients with ACL injury served as both subjects and control subjects. Each group experienced the same injury type (right/left) and treatment status (injury-rest, arthroscopy in-situ repair, mechanical stabilization or no intervention). The ACL injury was treated with either arthroscopic (80% ACL repair, 20% reconstruction) or mechanical stabilization (85% ACL repair or 10% reconstruction) in both groups. The data were analyzed with SPSS 17.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Results: Of the 45 patients with ACL injury, the mean (±SD) knee flexion angle was 51.8° ± 14.8° in the API group compared with 49.4° ± 6.5° in the control group (P=0.001). The mean (±SD) knee flexion elongation reached 90° in 13.8% (6/25) of these patients with ACL injury compared with 24.5% (3/25) with the control group (P=0.003). The mean (±SD) hip abduction of the knee was 28.4% (6/25) in the API group compared with 29.4% (7/25) in the control group (P=0.015). There was no significant difference in pain (P=0.086). There was a significant improvement in the knee extensor muscle function with the API group after arthroscopic repair compared with mechanical stabilization (P=0.001) and no improvement in adhesion of the tendon after arthroscopic repair compared with mechanical stabilization (P=0.23). Conclusion: Despite the obvious importance of a stable ACL to the long-term function of the antero-posterior (AP) femoral tunnel, the presence of a stable ACL does not allow for adequate anteroposterior (A) femoral tunnel lengths in knee injuries that originate from the medial tibial plateau. Thus, it appears that a healthy, healthy knee is the most important determinant of anteroposterior (A) femoral tunnel lengths. The ACL has been proven to be the most important component in the anteroposterior (AP) femoral tunnel. The present study shows that a simple surgical modification, an arthroscopic arthroscopic repair of an anterior compartment ACL repair with mechanical stabilization results in the ability to produce A (AP) femoral tunnel lengths of 50–80% and the ability to restore the tibial plateau ACL strength and to reduce the length of ACL insertion. Keywords: anterior compartment, ACL, femoral tunnel, tibial plateau

Introduction At the time of the founding of the ACL program, knee injuries that originated from the medial tibial plateau were considered to be secondary to a single, major injury to the medial capsule.1,3,15,17,23,27,33 The knee had a much higher incidence of ACL injury and, therefore, the use in knee rehabilitation of ACL in patients with the sole motivation to improve ACL function was extremely limited.6,31 The lack of interest in the use of ACL in knee injuries resulting from the tibial plateau was even more evident given that one hundred sixty-four patients presented to the ACL program at the time there was the first application of ACL in knee injuries originating from the tibial plateau with the sole purpose of enhancing the knee's ACL function. This patient history is particularly noteworthy because it demonstrated that the ACL was very much neglected as an important component in knee injuries arising from the tibial plateau.26,45 The current ACL program is focused on the discovery and development of new and improved strategies to improve the long- term stability of the ACL and, at the same time, to improve ACL tear and subsequent ACL reconstruction of the knee.45 The current focus on the development of devices capable of improving ACL function in an ACL injury at the time of ACL reconstruction may appear to"
Question: Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Who do we think should make the decision for a lung cancer patient? Submit an online abstract with ""Lung Cancer: Quality of Life"" as a key keyword to earn a $10 Amazon gift card.

Results: In a cross sectional study, the quality of life of people with lung cancer was assessed using three measures: pain, sleep, and quality of life at 6 months post-cancer. In the cross sectional study, people who had more money were less likely to report poor quality of life at 6 months post-cancer.

Conclusions: Poor quality of life (pain at 6 months) correlated with socioeconomic status (SES) both during the baseline period and at 6 months of follow-up. The link between poor quality of life and SES at 6 months appears to be driven by financial status. In order to make a clinically important difference, treatment with anti-rejection therapy should be focused on decreasing money, not quality of life.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with lung cancer accounting for nearly one million deaths every year (1). For these reasons, research and treatment efforts in lung cancer are often centered on the treatment of cancer itself. However, in many cases, there is a lack of evidence-based therapy for lung cancer. Given the large number of cases and their potential impact on quality of life, the research community has been interested in the factors that contribute to improved quality of life after treatment for lung cancer. A primary aim is to develop evidence-based therapies. However, despite the tremendous economic investment in lung cancer research and treatment, few therapies are available and many therapies are not proven effective. As such, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to improved quality of life in people with lung cancer.

One strategy that has been used by lung cancer patients is to take the drugs they have been offered in a trial—including new and modified agents—to treat symptoms with the hope that they can be re-introduced at a later time. Studies have measured changes in quality of life after patients took or were given an anticancer drug, but the studies have relied on self-report. In addition, several studies have used data on medical records to examine this ""measured variable"" (measured by a physician's score on a standardized test) rather than objective measures of the patient's overall quality of life (1–3). These studies have included several trials with a few hundred patients. The first trial to demonstrate that such a technique could be used, in 2007, was in patients with advanced glioblastoma multiforme (GWB) (4–6), and the results of that study have been used to inform many ongoing studies.

However, many people still benefit from being studied in a primary care setting. In the United States, however, patients are offered primary care physicians (PCPs) in primary care settings (7). The primary care setting may be beneficial for individuals with advanced lung cancer and others who have more advanced illness but do not have a stable primary care physician, who is often ill-equipped to diagnose, prescribe, and monitor patients. There may be a significant cost savings if those patients could have chosen to be treated in primary care. Furthermore, many patients find primary care physicians are not as interested in treatments they have received previously (or do not accept). These factors could make it harder to determine if a patient's improvement is due to treatment or to some other factor. Many patients with advanced disease, especially those with less advanced disease, may have a hard time making the switch from a PCP to a primary care physician. However, for the majority of people with advanced lung cancer, the switch is a relatively easy process and most people will prefer to be treated closer to home than in the hospital (8).

The question, then, is, what are some of the factors that contribute to good quality of life among patients with lung cancer? There has been a lot of interest in the issues of health status and socioeconomic status in a lung cancer patient, as well as whether health status affects quality of life in this patient population compared with others (2, 9). The question also begs the question of whether the benefits of improved health care could be delivered in the same manner by the research community at large in patients who are treated in primary care settings.

To answer this question, the authors of this study, including researchers from the Institute for Basic Health Research from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), conducted a 2-year study of patients with lung cancer who had participated in the Lung Cancer Treatment Trials Network (LCTN), at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS).

The LCTN is one of the largest and longest-running trials in the history of human trials to examine the effectiveness of novel anti-rejection"

Question: Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery?

Response: Early extubation will probably be helpful for some children undergoing cardiac surgery, especially due to the many complications that can occur during surgery. However, until further research has been conducted, the best long-term outcome is to avoid unnecessary invasive interventions (such as heart bypass) on children and to continue to use standard-of-care care such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) until a heart patient can be safely extubated by a trained physician."

Question: Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a potential role for uterine natural killer cells? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a possible role for uterine natural killer cells?

Answer to Question: Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a potential role for uterine natural killer cells? Abstract

1. Introduction

Endometriosis is a common disease, characterized by abnormal glandular tissue formation following ovulation of an ectopic uterus (1). Endometriosis is usually associated with endometrial hyperplasia (2), endometrial adhesions (3), or endometrial adhesions and fibrolamellar adhesions.

This condition was originally conceptualized as a consequence of in vitro fertilization, and is now an established feature in the reproductive physiology of women (4, 5). Endometriosis is defined as the abnormal formation or maintenance of a mass of endometrial tissue in a woman (2). During normal ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes an ectopic endometrial product that enters the uterine cavity (2) while the ovary secretes an endometrial product that does not enter the uterine cavity (2, 6). This combination produces normal endometrial development and growth while, in some women, there is both excessive menstrual bleeding (premenstrual syndrome, or PMS) and endometriosis (7–9).

The incidence of endometriosis ranges from 5.8% in the general population to 30-60% in women of certain ethnic groups (10). Although the cause of the condition remains a matter of debate, theories hypothesize that ovarian stimulation could lead to abnormal menstrual bleeding, with this effect, as well as other conditions such as multiple antral follicles, an estrogen-receptor-negative syndrome, and endometriosis (10–12).

Some studies have suggested a role for natural killer (NK) cells in endometriosis (13) or have noted the presence of the protein murine parathyroid (14, 15). The function of NK cells in endometriosis is unknown; however, the function of NK cells in uterine smooth muscle, which is a major site of endometrial adhesion and proliferation, is well described.

There is a substantial lack of published studies examining the effect of the use of medications known to affect NK cells (norethindrone and topiramate), in women with endometriosis.

This study compared the incidence of endometriosis in women taking various medications for endometriosis with the incidence observed in women who did not use medications at all and who were not taking any medications at all at baseline. Women were excluded if they had symptoms of endometriosis, were pregnant, or had any known infertility. The results showed that, compared with women who did not use any medications, women who did not use any medications at baseline were at increased risk of having endometriosis. This association was independent of demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics. The incidence of endometriosis, assessed with pelvic examination and ultrasonographic examination, was 1.22 per 100 women per year in women taking norethindrone or topiramate, 1.47 per 100 women per year in nondrug women, and 1.73 per 100 women per year in patients taking other nonprescription medications (16–19).

Because of the significant excess number of endometriosis cases in the women taking norethindrone or topiramate (2.6× and 1.8× respectively), the potential benefit associated with norethindrone or topiramate discontinuation is significant. This study demonstrates that women who take norethindrone or topiramate should undergo periodic Pap testing.

Our results demonstrate that women using norethindrone or topiramate alone or in combination are at increased risk for developing endometriosis. Furthermore, women in any age who take these medications are at an increased risk for endometriosis compared to women who do not take norethindrone. This increase must be considered in the setting of a low baseline level of risk. The risk of developing endometriosis increased in the presence of any of the above medications. The association of endometriosis risk with the use of any drug is likely to be confounded by the drug combination with or without concomitant use of methotrexate, which may alter the risk of endometriosis for others. It is important to note that there is a nonstatistically significant increased risk for developing endometriosis in women who only take norethindrone, compared to women who use any of the specific types of nonprescription medications, including methotrexate, raloxifene, or gefitin"

Question: Can the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp predict a neoplastic polyp? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Gallbladder polyps are a common invasive cancer (prognostic, cure, treatment, etc.) that are a major cause of morbidity/mortality.

Submit Answer: Gallbladder polyps are a common invasive cancer of the gallbladder, bladder, or ureters - most commonly found in patients with chronic renal disease. A small percentage of patients with gallbladder polyps die from the growth, but most are still healthy. These symptoms are not exclusive to patients with a single diagnosis of gallbladder polyp (eg, an extra appendix) and most of these patients are cured or survive to the adult stage (some are still alive at 5 months after surgery). There is very little scientific evidence to demonstrate that the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp is a predictor of a neoplastic polyp. It depends upon several factors, including the severity of the patient's underlying disease, severity of inflammation and tumor cells in the bladder, volume of disease, duration of exposure to the growth, number of bladder fibrosis (lumberjack syndrome, cyst) that is associated with disease, severity of disease, and presence of other tumor cells (eg: fibroid, fibroid-like, and/or chondelial tissue). Some of these factors were considered in the initial development of ""Gastro Bladder Disease"" to describe the common, but often complicated, signs that are often associated with this rare disease. There is however good evidence which shows that the growth of gallbladder polyps (especially the benign one, which are usually not associated with significant inflammation and tumor cells) can be reliably correlated with the presence of other non-malignant or malignant bladder tumors. These tumors may be benign, large, or in the process of becoming malignant. In patients with gallbladder polyps that cause non-malignant growth, more than 50% of patients will still be healthy by 3 months after surgery, while in those with malignant bladder tumors, the rate of survival is only 10% to 15%. There is also good evidence that patients who underwent the bladder biopsy procedure at some point during their lifetime had lower numbers of pre-cancerous tumors. This is further evidence that the primary diagnosis of ""Gallbladder Polyp"" is incorrect. Please see our page on ""Gallbladder Polyps"" for more information.

The Gallbladder Prognosis Index for Doctors to help diagnose which gallbladder cancer is more likely to progress to gallbladder cancer - may be helpful for patients if they have trouble deciding the likelihood of getting gallbladder cancer.

Please email us about your experience with your doctor with the Gallbladder Polyp.

Gallbladder Disease Symptoms Gallbladder Polyps that grow can cause the following symptoms, in addition to pain in their bladder: Increased urine frequency

Pain with sitting/standing

Pain with urination

Increased difficulty in urinating

Urine volume appears cloudy

Redness in upper left bladder (paresis)

Dry bladder (colon)

Increased difficulty in urinating

Tender chest/upper abdomen with pain around the rib cage

Unexplained weight gain

Infection of bladder

Piggyback pain that causes pain at the bladder

Gallbladder polyps that are large and bulky

Increased risk of blood pressure

The Gallbladder Health Index (GHI) was developed to help physicians evaluate the risk of gallbladder cancer. It is based on clinical and microbiologic criteria. Some of the symptoms experienced by patients with gallbladder cancers are:

Pain in the left urethra

Pain with urination

Nausea/vomiting

Unexplained weight gain

Reduced ability to urinate

Chronic cough, chest tightness, heavy flow, difficulty with speech, and dizziness

Dry fluid or cloudy urine

The GHI is used by many physicians who have questions about their diagnosis or treatment. These questions are related to an increased sensitivity to the odor of the gallbladder polyps.

Please see our GHI for Doctors page for more information.

The Gallbladder Dysfunction Index is similar to the Gallbladder Pain Index but uses a larger database of data to enable physicians to understand the potential symptoms.

Question: Does para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester?

Answer: It does. The most important advantage of para-cervical block is the ability of the gemectomaniac to deliver a viable baby before 12 weeks. This is achieved because of the lower level of anesthesia used in the technique, and the fact that most cesarean sections are performed in the 2nd trimester.[9][10] The technique is also relatively easy and safe when compared with an air bag.

[3] Cervical blocks are effective immediately.

[4] The main disadvantages of this technique are its low cost and the fact that the risk of infection is high for the mother of the baby delivered vaginally.

[4] The main advantages of this technique are that it also offers a long term benefit in reducing the rate of complications caused by the labour induction[3]

Question: Is there a difference in results with this techniques in the current world situation? Describe the results of studies.

Answer: It is obvious that it is not possible to compare the effects of the different intraeparectal procedures on the live birth rate. A systematic review [9] of the literature in this area concluded that ""there are insufficient studies to draw any firm conclusions"".[3] The latest studies that were published[4] suggest that this technique does offer a greater risk of induction in the 2nd trimester following delivery compared to a vacuum method.[1][3] Studies that assessed the effect of this technique on neonatal mortality are also lacking.[7][8][3]

Question: I am also using intraeparectal gemectomies for induction. Why?

Answer: You are correct in stating that you probably do so because you believe it to be a lesser option than a mid-trimester induction if the mother is expected to have a healthy pregnancy. However, there are numerous cases of babies being born before 24 weeks which suggest that this is not the case. Many times, a cesarean is avoided or at least delayed by using this technique. Many babies are delivered in both the second and third trimesters. I would advise those women who have a healthy pregnancy to use this technique if they want to achieve a live birth.

Question: Does the technique provide a better outcome when compared to surgical intervention?

Answer: In the present paper, we have excluded any case of uterine rupture or pregnancy loss. The data from this study are therefore limited to clinical outcomes.

Question: Is there a higher risk per dose for administration of gemeprost?

Answer: There is one case study regarding the effect of a single dose of gemeprost in reducing complication rate following childbirth, which has been published by a different journal.[3] In the current study, the total numbers of children who died during labour were small[5] and this is an extreme form of a risk factor often identified elsewhere in the literature.[3] In the present study, we have excluded this case.

Question: What happens to the gemetapine dose after one dose?

Answer: The dose is stopped once the mother has received the first doses of gemetapine, even if further doses will be required.

Question: Is there a safety problem with gemetapine when given as 1-2 ml IV bolus during labour?

Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is there a safety problem with gemetapine when given as 1-2 ml IV bolus during labour?

Answer: There is only one small case of a patient receiving more than 8 ml bolus of gemetapine in labour but no reported deaths associated with this procedure. Given the data on the safety of gemetapine, this case does not justify the use of this administration for induction of labour.[3]

[2][4][3] Conclusion In the present study, the combined results of all the interventions resulted in lower rates of neonatal mortality compared to the control group. The results imply that the gemeprost induction with gemetapine is considered a safe and effective option.

In addition to the risk factors listed above, an extremely important consideration in the delivery of a viable pregnancy is the mother-to-be. If the pregnant mother is still preterm or very preterm, these factors may change the outcome of labour and result in pre-term or low birthweight infants;[10][11] therefore, the intervention should be avoided if possible.[1]

I would be extremely disappointed to see the results of this study as the vast majority of women do not wish to undergo this procedure and are quite happy to do so without"
Question: Does insulin resistance drive the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

The insulin resistance that can cause heart attacks may be triggered by low-density lipoprotein concentrations, but the mechanisms by which this process does so are unknown. This means that it is possible to have two different causes of elevated blood glucose and atherosclerosis. The effect of insulin on triglycerides is also poorly understood, leading to conflicting results regarding the causality between higher cholesterol and increased rates of cardiovascular events. This situation implies that more research is necessary. On the other hand, evidence that lower LDL and high HDL cholesterol are able to prevent coronary artery disease is emerging.


For more on the relationship between low HDL and heart disease, see this post.


In view of ongoing progress, there really isn't an official ""end of hyperglycemia"" and the end of heart disease. It may be a question as to when hyperglycemia may result in adverse effects from a nutritional perspective. For those of us who have been concerned about that possibility for a number of years, here's the good news from the research so far. In the context of our study, there is no doubt that diet-induced hyperglycemia caused some of the ""bad"" changes seen in cardiovascular risk profiles in our participants. However, the good news is that in our study, all these adverse effects were caused by dietary changes that were associated with a net gain in dietary HDL and thus a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk (Figure 1). In other words, both diets (sugar/flour and protein/complex carbs) increased overall calories, but the total quantity of these foods was the key difference in lowering cardiovascular risk. The primary factor that is preventing this is the reduction in visceral adipose tissue fat. This reduced the levels of insulin-like growth factor-I, a marker of insulin resistance and the second most important factor that may have contributed to the adverse effects. On the other hand, the weight gain was much more likely to be due to a combination of other factors (Figure 2), and no change in total weight was associated with greater cardiovascular risk (results not shown). The reduction in cardiovascular risk was mainly found in the high carbohydrate group (>85% CHO) and not in the low carbohydrate group (<45% CHO). In other words, the reduced LDL cholesterol was mainly a result of the reduction in visceral fat, but not to the same extent in the low carb group.

Finally, the effects of higher total LDL cholesterol on cardiovascular risk were in line with the results of some early meta-analyses of carbohydrate-restricted diets (Hedrick et al. 2008). The lower the LDL cholesterol (or the higher the TG), the better the metabolic effects of the diet. This is in line with a recent review of the efficacy of low carbohydrate diets in the treatment of coronary heart disease (Almqvist 1997).

The key findings from our randomized intervention clinical trial are summarized in Table 1. The average LDL cholesterol levels for subjects receiving the protein- and fat-free approaches were significantly lower than those for those receiving the low-fat diet (Table 2).

Answer: In case of a long operative interval of ≤10 min, there was an increased risk during the period of 5–10 wk of chronic illness in an increased risk within the period 10–200 wk of the operation. Question: In case of a long operative interval of ≤10 min, there was an increased risk during the period of 5–10 wk of chronic illness in an increased risk within the period 10–200 wk of the operation. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers: In case of a long operative interval of ≤10 min, there was an increased risk during the period of 5–10 wk of chronic illness in an increased risk within the period 10–200 wk of the operation. Answer: In case of chronic illness, the increased risk could result from other factors beyond the scope of this study, especially in the period 10 wk of the operative interval. Question: Do hospital discharge and admission rates predict the need for sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Explain. Answer: There was no significant difference in the need for sleeves in the first 3 mo of follow-up by admission or discharge status. A statistically significant difference was observed by admission and discharge status for the 2 largest groups of patients. Question: Do hospital discharge and admission rates predict the need for sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Explain. Answer: The need for a sleeve gastrectomy at the commencement of the last hospitalization for the last ≥30 d varies by time after hospital admission and by time of operation, with decreasing need for a sleeve over time and increasing need over the time of hospitalization. Some factors, such as age, gender, BMI, and length of hospitalization also contribute to the need for a sleeve over time. In addition, a wide range of events, such as the use of analgesics, increased alcohol intake, and changes in weight or body fatness can influence the need for a sleeve gastrectomy over time. Question: Do hospital discharge and admission rates predict the need for sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity for first-year patients? Explain. Answer: There was no significant difference in a hospital discharge or admission rate for the first 3 mo of follow-up by admission status. There were no significant differences in the need for a sleeve within the first 30 d of follow-up. A statistically significant difference was present by the end of hospital stay for the 2 largest groups of patients. Question: Are there any advantages of sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers: Are there any advantages of sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Answer: There are no significant advantages, except for improved morbidity of the obesity patients, in terms of complications. Question: Are there any disadvantages of sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Explain. Answer: At the end of the first year without a procedure, there was a tendency toward gastric bleeding in patients weighing >200 g. In the second year, a higher rate of gastric bleeding occurred in the >200 g group than in the patients in the >180 and under weight groups. Patients >180 g also had a higher rate of gastric bleeding."
Question: Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:

Summary of findings References in the Discussion section: ""All subjects reported acute pain, and 10 subjects were treated in the preoperative ward for functional impairment in the right side of the body or the leg (9/10). Subjects reported pain, tenderness, weakness, tingling, and numbness associated with various functional limitations that resulted in the use of some forms of pain medication, including analgesics"" (p. 40).

This conclusion was based on the postoperative findings of the patients and the physicians' comments. The patient questionnaire had been filled out in the order in which the pain symptoms appeared. A similar questionnaire in a different order might have elicited better insight into the causes of pain symptoms, if there had been more time to review it before the surgical procedures were performed.

Although the patient questionnaire did not specifically inquire about functional abnormalities (although this observation can be explained by the fact that the questionnaire was designed to be completed before the operation), nevertheless, even with a questionnaire that avoided the specificity of specific diagnoses, physicians were able to identify functional limitations and provide treatment interventions in each of the conditions.

A few of the patients did not provide any functional symptom reports during the preoperative period and remained ""functional"" throughout the period of investigation. The patients were excluded because of the low frequency with which their functional limitations appeared. Although some individuals who experienced painful experiences during the preoperative period presented with functional problems during the postoperative examination, this was rare. Other patients who experienced pain but who were not reported any symptoms were not excluded because of differences in the nature of the functional problems reported in the preoperative and postoperative period. It has also been found that pain complaints cannot be distinguished from functional problems.

There were no cases of functional failure associated with preoperative postoperative pain.

There were no cases of functional deterioration during the postoperative period.

There were no reports of deterioration of any type, such as disability, disability worsening, or disability worsening, during the period studied.

There were no patients who had a pain score of <3 on the visual analog scale after each of the examinations.

Patient Complaints

One third of patients had complaints that had a temporal relationship to their preoperative pain. At the beginning of the preoperative phase, most complaints were of the nonspecific nature. A number of patients complained of specific clinical symptoms to which they were sensitive. However, most of these were not consistent with any particular functional injury or disability. Most of the patients had no complaints that developed during or after the surgical procedures.

Significant Complaints

There were a number of patients who had pain problems that, when combined with other complaints, resulted in dysfunction in a specific aspect on an exam (Table 1). Because of the variability of such findings between individuals, there is often no clear indication of a functional impairment by the doctor. Thus, it is possible to classify these patients as having functional dysfunction unrelated to surgical complications or pain and presenting later with pain as a consequence of the complications. One patient (Table 1) had a diagnosis of orthopedic foot injury. He also had problems with his hearing and vision, a condition known as auditory neuropathy.

Table 1: Patient Complaints

Major Complaints

There were also patients with significant concerns about their functional functioning or lack of activity as a result of postoperative pain. These problems might have been either related to preoperative trauma or to postoperative functional problems. Other problems associated with the surgical procedures (cervical injury, vascular dissection, arterial disease) may have resulted in functional abnormalities after surgery.

A number of patients (15%; Table 1) complained about the pain during the postoperative period. These complaints were either nonspecific or of a temporizing nature.

Some patients (4%) complained of functional impairment. They also reported pain that had a temporal relationship to their preoperative pain and was related to the operation.

Several patients (11% of all patients and 8% of those with no complaints) complained of pain that was not related to any dysfunction. These patients, usually men aged 35-60 years, were generally referred to various medical centers. For this reason, physicians generally did not take note of any specific complaints during the postoperative period for patients such as these. The majority of these patients developed no further problems over the next few months after their surgical intervention.

Analgesia was considered to be one of the major postoperative problems (14.8%) and was the most common complaint within the nonpatient population examined. This concern occurred on 5 of 60 patients evaluated in the preoperative period. In addition, it affected 6 or 7 of 28 patients evaluated between the preoperative and postoperative examinations (Table 2). In"
"Question: Actinobaculum schaalii, a cause of urinary tract infections in children? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Do actinobaculum schaalii (actinobaculum schaalii) and Actinobaculum maculatum (Actinobaculum maculatum) cause urinary tract infections in children?

Answer: This question was answered by a reviewer. The answer is ""no.""

Question: The ability of actinomyces and Actinobaculum schaalii to cross the blood–brain barrier in vitro was investigated by measuring the levels of the proteins Muc1 and Muc2 in the brain tissue of a single mouse (rabbit). The brain tissue of a rat was also studied for the presence of the proteins Muc1 and Muc2 by immunohistochemistry. The levels of Muc1 and Muc2 were elevated more in the brain of the rat than in the brain tissue of the mouse. The authors concluded that the expression of Muc1 and Muc2 in the brain of humans is low, probably due to a lack of functional Muc1 or Muc2 transcripts, especially in areas of the brain that are involved in motor and sensory processing, and that the low level of Muc1 and Muc2 in the brain of humans is probably due to genetic or environmental factors.

Question: Is it possible to detect the presence of antibiotic residues to a certain degree in foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, vinegar, and pickled vegetables? If so, what should be the recommended food contact times for the detection of antibiotics residues?

Answer: This question was answered by a reviewer. The answer is ""yes, bacteria could readily get past the outer surfaces of the protective cell walls and enter the food where they could be killed by antibiotics. This is only an issue if the bacteria do get past the protective protection layers of the food."" The reviewer also asked about the detection of bacterial products in food products by a food safety analyst, who must carefully follow an in vivo microbiology technique and must test various products for contamination in the laboratory.

Question: What is the effect of sodium citrate on the formation of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S)? Do H 2 S and hydrogen sulfide have a similar nature in the gastrointestinal tract?

Answer: A review by the authors summarized the review article as ""In vivo findings on the toxicity of sodium citrate on mice have been documented. This study demonstrates that sodium citrate rapidly reacts with the stomach wall membranes to be taken up by the epithelial cells and causes rapid formation of H 2 S. In addition, there is a high degree of hydrogen sulfide development in the stomach lining with these authors showing that H 2 S produced by this method, in addition to being toxic to cells, is extremely toxic to the gastric mucosa.""

Question: How is sodium citrate absorbed by the intestines? Do sodium citrate and its metabolites interact with any of the components of the bowel or produce other problems in the intestine?

Answer: The authors summarized the review article as: ""Evidence is accumulating indicating that sodium citrate and its metabolites do not enter the intestine directly nor do they contribute to the gastrointestinal problems the typical dietary guidelines recommend to reduce cravings, increase satiety, improve stool consistency and maintain bowel function. However, the absorption of sodium citrate and citrate metabolites through the colonic epithelium is dependent on the activity of the intestinal CYP2E1 enzyme. In our study of a rat model, there was a strong relationship between the serum concentrations of sodium citrate and the production of hydrogen sulfide."" One reviewer responded that the review authors did not discuss the hypothesis behind their results. However the authors do explain that in this study there was a clear relationship between the levels of sodium citrate and hydrogen sulfide in the rat colonic lumen.

Question: Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010: are Medicare beneficiaries getting sicker? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010: are Medicare beneficiaries getting sicker? Answer each question and include the reasons why people are not getting better after using medical care. Also include details of how long you have been using medical care, the type of medical care and the type of medical care provider you've found. Use the Internet, a journal such as PLoS One, an online form generated by the U.S. Public Health Service and others to gain additional details. Provide additional sources of information, including: U.S. News & World Report lists of ""sickest counties"" or ""healthyest counties""; The Mayo Clinic lists medical conditions or symptoms; and The Cleveland Clinic lists medical conditions or symptoms. This will give you a better gauge of how widely the sicker you are getting because of medical use. In summary, some health conditions are ""probable""; others are definitely happening but don't have a precise diagnosis.

Preventative Care Use the guidelines below to plan what to do to help prevent illnesses. Use the guidelines below to plan what to do to help prevent illnesses. 1. Check if you are getting sick. 2. Learn how to prevent illnesses. 3. Prevent symptoms. 4. Use preventive and diagnostic measures. 5. Continue regular checkups. 6. Learn what preventative tests and treatments are most useful. 7. Keep a food diary and record what you eat. Avoid any food that you might have to eat all at once; some foods that may keep symptoms under control are: soy products

chocolate

fruits or vegetables

whole wheat bread or tortillas Avoid any food with a high glycemic load (high calories, high fat, or low fiber) such as fruit, whole grains, and vegetables. 7.

Dietary Considerations Your diet should be rich in fruits and vegetables. Some fruits and vegetables are high in cholesterol, which can cause increased bleeding and bleeding time. Foods that contain cholesterol include: fruits such as apples, plums, and bananas

dried fruits or juices

fruit juice

fruit slices or squares

dried or fresh spinach

red and orange peppers and citrus fruits

green leafy vegetables including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, collards, cantaloupe, asparagus, and cabbage Keep red and orange peppers on the menu. They have relatively few calories, low glycemic index carbohydrates, and are good sources of fiber, vitamins C, and E. A high glycemic index food also can affect blood glucose (sugar) and could be considered ""dangerous"" for you. However, most sources of cholesterol are found in leafy vegetables. Avoid vegetables with high glycemic index: celery

carrots

cabbage

potatoes

turnip greens

tomatoes Eat lower amounts of fat and more protein in your diet. The goal is to eat little in the form of trans fat and saturated fat. In addition, take advantage of reduced exposure of fat and carbohydrates to oxidation by foods such as vegetable oils with hydrogen peroxide, or fruits that are high in polyphenols, antioxidants that reduce inflammation and protect the skin from oxidation. Take advantage of low and no sugar drinks as well as all non-alcoholic wine. Avoid high-sugar foods such as cookies, cakes, candy, baked goods, granola bars, bread, and candy. 8. See the U.S. News list of common foods with high glycemic load, including soy, chocolate, fruit, peanut, and some wheat products.

Diabetes Treatments and Care If you have diabetes, get tested regularly. Talk to your doctor for details on options, such as using a glucose monitor, a dietitian for advice, a health care professional for additional care, and a diabetes specialist for advice on medication. Check with the Mayo Clinic or your doctor if you have questions. Diabetes management options are very varied, particularly for people with kidney disease. For people with kidney disease who are trying to get a kidney transplant from a kidney-less recipient who is also diabetic, each strategy may have different results. For people without kidney disease, diabetes management options are somewhat more limited. If you are trying to get a kidney for anyone with diabetes, your doctor will not discuss this with you until you've had a follow-up physical examination. If your doctor determines that you are a suitable donor for a kidney transplant, you may be assigned to a private transplant organization or a kidney bank and receive a kidney of your choice. For more information, call 1-888-507-4386. See the Mayo Clinic or the U.S. News & World Report lists of ""sickest counties"" or ""healthyest counties"".

Question: Does successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can pregnancy and birth outcomes (like births among unmarried women) be improved by teaching obstetricians in a medical school curriculum that emphasizes the positive influences of prenatal and perinatal education?

Introduction Perinatal education is a field of study that is rapidly improving and is widely recognized as one of the most effective interventions that women worldwide can adopt for their care. Perinatal education has been shown to improve outcomes for mothers and babies of all ages (Ruggiero, 1997; Shainman et al., 2001) and has been shown to reduce risk of infant mortality (Hendrickx et al., 2000) even among low-income women (Alvarado et al., 1999). Perinatal education has been shown to help women (Hendrickx et al., 2000) and is a cornerstone of public health research efforts and interventions, including programs of prevention for poor women (Johnson and DeStefano, 1984; Shainman et al., 2001). Among women aged 18–34, one-third of whom are low income (NHS) and whose own maternal experience has been marginal (Giles et al., 1995), an estimated 6 million girls are born underweight annually in the US with the average birth weight of the average low-income US girl was only 1450 g in 1994 (Bachman et al., 2000). A study in Spain showed that children under 15 years who were born by cesarean section without a referral by their physicians were seven times more likely to die as the first postpartum maternal death if maternal education level was low (Ussal and Villanueva, 1997). Perinatal education in these groups has been shown to decrease rates of preterm birth, live birth, and neonatal death among girls, reduce neonatal and infant mortality, reduce maternal mortality among single mothers, and increase the number of women with a graduate degree (Valdés and Mendieta, 1998; Shainman et al., 1997) that are more likely to choose higher income jobs (Johnson et al., 1996; Fagard et al., 2000). The US Perinatal Education Program in Medical Schools is an example of a broadening of the curriculum of medical education, specifically in obstetrics, at the medical schools at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where most of the early research in the field was conducted. During the 1970s, the Perinatal Education Program was used at UCSF to train obstetricians at the Medical School (Shainman et al., 1991). During the 1970s and 1980s, the Perinatal Education Program was expanded and used at schools around the country; for example, at Indiana University, the University of North Carolina, and the North Carolina State University (Neumann et al., 1995). In addition, a series of other programs for health care professionals including the PEP, a national training program specifically for female health care workers (Jobs and Occupations Section, American Academy of Family Physicians, 1997), have been administered and used in the US public health system including community health centers, hospitals, high schools, schools, and universities; several of these programs are continuing and expanding (Shainman et al., 1998). The PEP has been found to have both positive and negative effects on women. The positive effects include increases in the percentages of women who work at high salaries and increased likelihood of attending college (Goss et al., 1996), and increases in the percentage of women who have attained higher education levels and greater employment and earnings with greater numbers of children and older parents (Jobs and Occupations Section, American Academy of Family Physicians, 2001; Shainman et al., 1997). In terms of women with perinatal care needs, the positive effects of the Program are primarily measured on parity as a result of lower rates for preterm birth, low birth weight, neonatal death, and low birth-weight infants (Goss et al., 1997). Also in terms of women with prenatal care needs, there is a more pronounced effect of the PEP on parity because of the greater number of births to unmarried women, lower rates of abortion, greater number of women who had fewer children, women with higher education levels, other positive outcomes, and fewer low-income women with children (Jobs and Occupations Section, American Academy of Family Physicians, 2001; Shainman et al., 1997). The programs for health care workers have a more negative effect, with the overall percentages of pregnant women and lower parity as a result of the programs and policies resulting in lower earnings as well as lower employment and earnings (Jobs and Occupations Section, American Academy of Family Physicians, 2001). There is wide consensus and many research studies that have demonstrated the power of promoting health and well-being for women from a broad range of backgrounds (Fagard et al., 2000). A growing body of evidence shows"

Summary and conclusions: All previous studies have shown that more health care workers are being diagnosed with HIV, especially in the poorest countries. Most studies using data from poor and rural countries have reported that these patients have higher risks of contracting HIV compared to patients in developed countries, the highest of which occurred in West Africa (e.g., Ghana) and Africa. However, these rates may have been artificially inflated because of inadequate health care, especially care provided by health care workers. Even in the United States (US), where HIV testing was made available in hospitals many years ago, the data showed that patients with HIV in hospitals were still more likely to transmit the virus to their health care workers than patients in outpatient hospitals. Nevertheless, there is considerable concern that medical care workers in public health interventions may still be developing AIDS in line with the WHO guidelines, despite a clear mandate from the World Health Assembly and the World Health Organization. Such patients would be at higher risk of transmitting the virus to health care workers and may be more likely to transmit the HIV or other virus to others. For example, most cases of HIV infection with a physician or staff member (see, e.g., CDC, 2012) were diagnosed in public health settings (e.g., hospitals, clinics, specialties, primary care) and, consequently, were not transmitted to others. Despite the risk of transmission among health care workers and some other settings, no data are yet available to link these patients to health care workers in other settings where the transmission may be more important. To explore the possible impact of health care workers' infection with HIV in developing countries in the context of the WHO rules on health care workers' adherence to the preventive role of health care, we analyzed data in 14 Latin American countries (Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Peru, Paraguay, Venezuela, El Salvador, Peru, and Colombia) during 1994-2008.

Methods Data were obtained from the National AIDS Data Bank (NADB), which consists of detailed information about incidence of HIV infection and transmission as well as information about persons at risk of acquiring HIV infection and HIV-related conditions at a specific location in these countries. The NADB is part of the National AIDS Programme to develop the country-specific HIV prevention and care in Latin America and the Caribbean. The NADB has data on all known transmissions of HIV (whether positive or negative) and of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can be transmitted by blood, body fluids, or body tissues (e.g., HIV-1, HIV-2, and genital herpes), including the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections, syphilis, trichomoniasis, and chlamydia. The data came from the local information systems (local state health committees, health registries, sub-national public and private health institutions, private hospitals, and other public agencies) and from the Public Health Agency of South Korea and the General Data System of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data were collected between 1994 and 2008 and have been stored on CD-ROM and on hard disk at the National AIDS Data Bank for 12 years, which corresponds to the first year of the study period of the NADB. In the analysis, we assumed that each country had been surveyed at least once, since this allows one to adjust for changes in infection rates and risk factors. We selected the 15 countries with the most information on both HIV infection and transmission. The same procedures were used for Africa, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Japan. The data came from the National AIDS Data Bank (NADB). The data came from the National AIDS Programme to develop the country-specific HIV prevention and care in Latin America and the Caribbean.

We analyzed both viral load data and other information according to country-specific incidence rates from the US CDC HIV/AIDS surveillance report. We calculated incidence rates using the rate of new infections and the rate of transmission according to the US CDC data for each age, sex group, and year, and then used linear regression (with year as a covariate) models to determine the relation between HIV prevalence and incidence rate as well as the relative risk (RR) of becoming infected with HIV.

Why is it so easy to discriminate?

How can a patient with a headache need to be called by their name when they're talking to her doctor? There are an abundance of examples. In the United States, hospital executives can ask, ""Who was it who kicked that lady?"" or ""Where did the doctor go? Why was he going the other way? How many times did he say 'Doctor?""

How can I be sure I'm referring appropriately?

Don't be fooled into treating your patients like a pair of pints at a bar.

When your boss asks where doctors went, your response should be, ""I don't know."" Or, ""It depends."" Your job as a boss is to explain the logic behind the answer. So before giving the patient a name, be sure to include another question, such as, ""Do you know where he went?""

Some people respond simply to the request by saying, ""Oh, yeah. We're waiting on him"" or ""Is he at the ICU?"" This response is the easiest for your boss to accept. If your office is full of angry patients asking their doctor for an explanation for their headache — as it will be when a non-hospital setting begins — and doctors aren't having the time to listen to them, what else should you reply?

Be more precise about your response. You don't need to say, ""You go to a neurologist who treats headaches."" You might say, ""You go to someone who treats headaches who takes you to the neurologist who specializes in headaches."" And the point is that this answer will get a patient's attention in the least invasive way possible.

Instead of offering to call the doctors who take them to a neurologist, consider responding by asking for information about the health care facility where patients receive care. The more specific you are, the more likely you are to get a name.

If a patient asks for a name at the hospital, offer to give her a handbook about the facilities where the hospital provides services. Make sure you also mention the name of the health care delivery agency that receives people who need care from the hospital. If your hospital doesn't offer such handbooks anymore, ask around.

For a patient who goes to a private doctor, offer to contact someone in the health management team (such as a neurologist, p.d. or psychologist) who might be willing to answer questions about the person's health and mental health."

Question: Attenuation of ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats: does edaravone offer protection? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

To answer the question and propose the mechanism of action for edaravone, the present study assessed the effect of edaravone on ovariectomy-induced ovarian damage (OIID) in mice and rats subjected to OIID with or without intra-abdominal injection of edaravone (10 mg/kg) in vivo. In the case of the study animals, the serum insulin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were studied before (baseline) and after (post) ovariectomy of the ovaries, while ultrasound assessment was carried out at 7 days post-operative. Serum insulin and HSD was expressed as percent change in response to a standard test of insulin resistance. In addition, serum insulin and Lp(a) were assayed using a bioassay. At the end of the experimental period, rats underwent ovariectomy over a period of 3 months, as a part of the chronic (i.e., treatment) of OIID with or without intra-abdominal injection of edaravone and the results of the intra-abdominal injection were compared. In addition, the effect of edaravone on insulin and HSD levels and serum insulin concentrations, together with the difference between the post-tumor and at baseline concentrations were evaluated. At baseline levels, administration of 15 mg/kg edaravone completely (100%) and completely (95%) prevented OIID-induced ovariectomy-induced OIID and resulted in a significantly higher Lp(a) (<14.7%) (p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (p < 0.001) in rats than in basal levels. In addition, edaravone administration completely prevented OIID-induced ovariectomy-induced loss of oocytes by insulin resistance (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that edaravone can effectively reduce ovariectomy-induced OIID and OAI induced insulin resistance among females.

In vivo Effects

The primary objective of the present study was to assess the effect of edaravone (10 mg/kg) on ovariectomy-induced ovarian damage (OIID) and its correlation with serum glucose and insulin (insulin resistance), Lp(a) and insulin resistance. We also examined the development of pre-ovarian hyperplasia by measurement of ovary weight after ovariectomy. Because ovary weight is a strong marker of hyperplasia both during early (somatic) and later (ovarians of the periventricular regions) stages of ovarian development, and because pre-ovarian hyperplasia has been observed to result in the development of secondary ovarian disease, the pre-ovarian hyperplasia was quantified by examining ultrasound measurements of pre-ovarian weight through the ultrasound examination of the tubal ligation as well as by the determination of the size of the seminiferous tubules with ultrasonography.

Methods

Procedure

All procedures and their detailed information have been previously published [20]. Briefly, all animals were treated under anesthesia with isoproterenol (1 mg/kg; Sigma Aldrich) under 5% carbon dioxide in 10% isopropanol for 30 min. The hypothalamus was dissected, and the pups were micro-anesthetized with isoflurane (20% isoflurane in 10% isopropanol; Sigma Aldrich). The ovaries (obtained from intact oocytes) were cut from tubules, which were weighed by stereotactic caliper (Leica Microsystems) when their weights were 2.0-2.9 g. The oocytes were stained with 0.4% DAPI (Sigma Aldrich), and then subjected to three transvaginal ultrasound examinations (3.0-3.8 MHz; Cepheid Electronics). Ovarian weights were used to calculate oocyte weight.

Oocyte Preparation

Ovarian biopsy specimens were aspirated from the abdomen and were removed from the abdominal cavity. Oviductal-like structures were removed from the uterus using sutures (Sigma Aldrich Inc.). The ovarian biopsy tissues were divided in half, and then sent to the pathology laboratory for examination by the use of ultrasonography. At the end of microscopic examination, the biopsy specimens were fixed with formalin. Oviduct-like structures were weighed on three different optical microscopes: SEM (Siemens), SEM (Daimler-Benz), and ZOOM (Vitomex). All tissue weights were obtained by the use of standard ultrasonogram procedures.

Question: Does the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale favor left hemisphere strokes? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does the National Institutes of Health Strokes Scale favor left hemisphere strokes?

SUMMARY: The NIMH Stroke Scale has a high sensitivity for right-sided strokes, which may be explained by the larger stroke volume in the right hemisphere.

INTRODUCTION: There are several reports that stroke and stroke-like symptoms commonly occur at or after the onset of migraine, as well as among patients whose migraine diagnosis is not established. Patients report a variety of headache symptoms, including fatigue, sensitivity to light and sound, and myalgia, which are often correlated with other symptoms of migraine. These symptoms, which are frequently related to transient weakness with aura, and some patients report that some headache symptoms are also related to stroke.1,12,13 In two reports,15,16 we sought to clarify the relationship between the NIMH Stroke Scale, which is the primary tool used to screen for a diagnosis of stroke, and the occurrence of certain symptoms. We compared the NIMH Stroke Scale to the International Index of Echocardiograms (IEEE) (the most widely used Echocardiogram-derived criteria for stroke), to a subset of patients who were diagnosed with migraine using a different standard of criteria. We report that the NIMH Stroke Scale more strongly favors right-sided strokes, a finding that is consistent with previously reported differences in brain function between the hemispheres. A number of alternative mechanisms, which may also explain observed differences between right-sided and left-sided strokes, are plausible.

METHOD: We performed a meta-analysis, using information on more than 14 million participants, of the association between stroke severity and the Stroke Scale with patients and controls.

RESULTS: We included 13 articles in the review. Analyses using a random-effects model using the NIMH data showed odds ratios of 2.10 (95% CI 1.39 to 2.84) that matched for a 1-sided α of.001. Results were robust with 10-sided t tests of significance of.04 and tests of heterogeneity of.68 with publication bias (p=.03). Of the 14 studies, 12 were positive.

CONCLUSIONS: The association between the NIMH Stroke Scale and right-sided strokes does not appear to be unique in migraine sufferers."

"Question: Young-Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures: does it predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:","

Answer:

This guideline describes how to make more effective choices in the management of pelvic ring fractures. We recommend that you focus on primary prevention of pelvic ring fractures in women by reducing unnecessary and potentially life-threatening transurethral decompression as early as possible after rupture, as well by managing the fracture through the rehabilitation associated with a pelvic ring.

Introduction

Pelvic Ring Fractures (PVR) pose a significant threat to the lives of women in the hospital.1 Women with a pelvic ring fracture who have not had a fracture within the past year who are admitted to a clinical setting are likely to suffer from posttraumatic stress syndrome and to have adverse cardiovascular and pulmonary consequences.2 In an ongoing study of patients admitted to the New York State Hospital at Montefiore,1 this risk is much higher among women with pelvic ring fractures than among their peers without them, and it is even higher among women with recurrent fractures.2 In fact, women with a previous pelvic ring fracture are more likely than those with other fractures to have a recurrence, suggesting the need for early and frequent evaluation, including a pelvic ring fracture evaluation, of those women who have not had a fracture during the prior 12 months.3

This guideline addresses the problem of pelvic ring fractures by recommending that clinicians treat pelvic ring fractures as urgent emergency medical conditions and to immediately perform urgent surgery.4 It also recommends that, when appropriate, secondary intervention protocols that do not involve surgery for the prevention of a future fracture should not be performed. When surgical intervention must be considered, it should be the last option but it should be considered on an individual basis as described by the guidelines described in the sections ""Pelvic Spinal Tendon Injuries"" to ""Caveats to Management.""4

This guideline requires us to explain the benefits and risks of early primary prevention of pelvic ring fractures among patients admitted to the emergency department based on the findings of previous studies and by defining the importance of the two outcomes:

Death. When mortality was the primary outcome, we recommend that we recommend immediate and frequent primary primary prevention of death from pelvic ring fractures. This means that we require immediate primary prevention in all women with pelvic ring fractures, irrespective of the time since last fracture. If a pelvic ring fracture was expected in the future, we recommend immediate and frequent primary primary prevention of death when the time since last fracture is at least 5 weeks. This means that when mortality is the primary outcome, we recommend immediate and frequent primary prevention in all women with pelvic ring fractures irrespective of the time since last fracture. If a pelvic ring fracture was not expected in the future, we recommend immediate and frequent primary primary prevention of death from pelvic ring fractures with a time horizon of 5 weeks. This means that we recommend immediate primary primary prevention with some women. In this special circumstance, we recommend immediate primary primary prevention in all women with pelvic ring fractures with a time horizon of at least 5 weeks, and those for whom the timing of the next fracture may be important.

Treatment. Treatment of pelvic ring fractures should be based on the severity of the initial injury and the outcome expected from the primary outcome. If there is the possibility that a future pelvic ring fracture may have an unexpected outcome that may be life-threatening, we recommend immediate and frequent primary primary prevention of post-fracture treatment with surgery on the pelvic floor. The procedure should be performed with anesthesia (with or without heparin) and the patient should stay in the trauma room until it is safe for discharge.

The recommendations contained in this guideline describe the risk associated with an acute pelvic ring fracture. Therefore, if a woman develops one, we recommend that she be kept out of the medical field for at least 7 days.5 If the future fracture is expected to be life-threatening, we recommend that she should be kept out of the medical field for at least 1 week.6 If the trauma patient is discharged home, we recommend that she be referred to a rehabilitation facility for at least 3 to 4 weeks. The surgical treatment of a pelvic ring fracture requires at least 3 to 4 weeks as a minimum goal; there is a small but plausible increased risk of death for patients who are treated in the emergency department without the necessary hospital stays. The post-surgery management of this situation is important, with the addition of rehabilitation. This includes strengthening the pelvic floor to prevent excessive stretching and to correct the trauma associated with the fracture. The patient need not return until the injury has healed, with adequate postoperative care since it is likely that the underlying cause of the injury will persist.

The following steps, listed in the order in which they should be taken in managing this situation, may result in survival in a patient with a pelvic ring fracture:

Question: Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease?

Answer: Celiac disease is an intolerance to dietary iron. No one knows whether Vitamin D deficiency causes gluten intolerance. However, there are people who are hypersensitive to the effects of Vitamin D. Therefore, they will often tell you that you need to eat a high-dose of Vitamin D supplements to get them to stop gluten intolerance.


An easy way to avoid gluten is to stay on a strict vegetarian diet. This dietary restriction may cause you to have high levels of Vitamin D without the symptoms of Celiac (such as rashes, hair loss, and sensitivity to foods). However, since Vitamin D is needed for normal growth, weight gain, and skin health, we recommend that you do not supplement with Vitamin D during a vegetarian or vegan diet (and only take one or two hundred micrograms of vitamin D supplements daily)."
Question: Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are unsafe sexual behaviours increasing among HIV-infected individuals or is the behaviour increasing because of more available and acceptable HIV care?

The purpose of this research question is to evaluate HIV/STI/HIV prevalence and associated risks and benefits of sex work in Botswana. To address this, I am conducting a study of sex workers in the cities of Kisumu and Vompe in 2015-2016. The study is being supervised by the Chief Executive, the Research and Training Officer, a research collaborator, and an HIV epidemiologist/pediatrician from The University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. Sex work in Kisumu and Vompe centres in Botswana (KV) were analysed for HIV prevalence and risk behaviours.


Study Objectives: During the study period, I will evaluate HIV prevalence and associated risks of sex work in Kisumu and Vompe, and what changes HIV prevalence and risk behaviours may have resulted from this study. What are the associated demographic and socio-economic factors of those working in the sex industry in Kisumu and Vompe and what kind of sexual health problems and risk behaviours do they have?


What are the outcomes and conclusions of this work? The results of this study will determine whether the results demonstrate an increase in HIV prevalence or whether they demonstrate the trend of increased risk behaviours in this population.

I will estimate the prevalence of HIV through questionnaires and blood and urine testing on a subset of the population and will report results in the abstract.

The results of the study will contribute to the advancement of HIV prevention efforts in Botswana, to strengthen health services in general and Kisumu specifically, and to strengthen gender and sexuality education for all primary and secondary school students.

Question: Cholestasis associated with small bowel atresia: do we always need to investigate? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the definition of small bowel atresia? Why or why not? (I do not believe this question or paper is applicable to small bowel atresia.) The following is an outline of the answer to Question: What is the definition of small bowel atresia?

Question 1: Some early clinical studies have suggested that some children with small bowel atresia have a more severe case of colic even if their parents have no history of other symptoms (see Question below). The following is evidence that it does not necessarily mean that the child has a better or worse case (see Questions below).

A: In one study by Ransohoff and colleagues4 the results of a parent questionnaire were presented for the first time and it was found that the majority of small bowel atresia patients did not meet criteria for colic. The parents of these patients considered their children to be well and did not regard them as being constipated. The parents of these children were considered as having a good attitude. Thus it seems that, if the parents and the children are taking good care, then it is still possible to identify the parents who might be in need of psychological support and advice related to the child's atresia.

B: The results of another study suggest that some of the earliest symptoms of small bowel atresia were indeed associated with constipation.10 In another study of children whose small bowel atresia was suspected but who were only mildly constipated, 12.5% were found to have atresia.

C: There is also an epidemiologic study in which a large cohort of patients with early onset colic was assessed, with the diagnosis of small bowel atresia. Of patients with mild/no constipation in the initial clinical investigation of patients with early onset colic, 40.6% were found to have small bowel atresia. Of patients without constipation, only 5.3% were found to have atresia at all. The percentage of children with colic who were found to have the early onset colic was very similar in different areas of the country, suggesting that this was not a diagnosis exclusive to the early onset of colic. Of the 8 children with colic who tested positive for early onset colic, 3 were found to have atresia. 11

In addition, there does not appear to be any evidence that the child had a worse outcome in an early investigation (for example, by a colonoscopic examination or by a fecal occult blood test) because the colonoscopy and fecal occult blood tests were not followed up because of the low birth weight of the child.12

There are a few reports in the literature suggesting that although there was mild to moderate constipation in some of the children, more severe constipation was found in the most persistent children.13,14,15. For example, Fagan et al16 found an association between constipation and atresia. The investigators asked mothers of the most persistent children to complete questionnaires on their children's constipation. The mothers who did not answer this question in relation to their most persistent child were found not to have any history of other symptoms or complaints (except that the children did not constipation). Their children did have symptoms, however, and the investigators could not rule out that some of these were related to constipation.

Question: What is the definition of small bowel atresia? Please note that the term ""constipation"" is now generally used to mean ""dry stool,"" but was in those times a slightly different thing. The bowel is a long tube that is connected with the anus through the rectum. It is the part of the body that makes food move. It is made up of many different parts.

Question: How can we know whether constipation is the only symptom that has led to treatment of constipation?

Study: Some observational studies have suggested that constipation may be the first symptom in children with irritable bowel syndrome.17 In some of the studies, there were few cases of constipation or only one case of constipation when colicky children were excluded. A larger trial of constipation in colicky children18 showed that this could occur even when small bowel constipation was not the only symptom of constipation. Also, the observation of a wide range of symptoms in the control group might point to other causes than constipation.

Question: How can we know whether atresia in early early childhood is an early sign of a more serious condition (intolerable constipation)?

Study: No study has yet been performed to evaluate atresia in early early childhood.

Question: When do we start the assessment of atresia and in who?

Study: No study has yet been performed to assess atresia in early childhood"

Question: Can medical students contribute to quality assurance programmes in day surgery? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," In addition to clinical patients, how much of the time an operating room surgeon spends making decisions about the care of his patients does medical school teach?


Answer: Yes. In his research, Dr. Krumhansl is investigating the relation between medical student's use of electronic data technology (EDTS) and the time needed to make a new discovery. His study involved a sample of 473 operating room surgeons who graduated from the medical school system of the University of Chicago from 2011 to 2014. In this study, the operating room surgeons worked for six weeks in the hospital's intensive care units and then returned to perform elective surgeries at least every three months for another six weeks. All surgeons underwent EDS in order to complete the new phase in their training. The study found that the student was less effective as an evaluator in the intensive care units compared to the surgical team when studying elective procedures. In addition, his study has given Dr. Krumhansl new insights into the roles and responsibilities of the other physicians in the intensive care units. In order to better understand the clinical and academic aspects that go into improving patient care, Dr. Krumhansl's research is continuing. Dr. Krumhansl is currently working with the American Society for Quality Improvement (ASQI) and the US Public Health Service to expand his investigation into the use of EDS for evaluating the time needed to make a discovery or an improvement.

Question: Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort?

Synopsis The measurement of paragangliomas is very expensive indeed. The cost of normal and pathologic paraganglioma is only about 1.5 times that of the largest cancers, including lung (2.5 million units) and melanoma; paragangliomas are about half as much as breast (1.67 million units). The cost of head lumps (with a volume about 100 times that of paragangliomas, the tumor is not a pathologic lesion, and a simple visual examination is sufficient to rule out paraganglioma) is about 0.25 to 0.4 million U.S. dollars. Thus, if paragangliomas are to be detected and treated, their costs would be several times greater than those of normal tumors, and, thus, cost would be a major consideration in their determination. A detailed discussion of the reasons for this extreme expense follows, but first briefly, with a comparison between measurements of head and neck paragangliomas.

History. Paragangliomas are the most common neoplastic, and many people with them were diagnosed without even knowing it, perhaps because of their small size, or for a variety of other reasons. The advent of surgical techniques enabled the diagnosis of paragangliomas without their usually slow, difficult, and expensive course at a later stage. Therefore, the initial cost of paragangliomas, both before the advent of surgical techniques and at a later stage, was estimated to be more than $1 billion per year (6). Even though paragangliomas are very expensive to surgically treat, and the risk of recurrence is extremely high, the value of paraganglioma diagnosis, including the risk of death, is high because of its cost.

Figure 1. Figure 1. A. Paraganglioma, B. Head lumps, and C. Lung disease.

Figure 2. Figure 2. Paragangliomas are generally small, often cylindrical, and their masses are usually only a few milli-metric-milions. The size and extent of paraganglioma are relatively consistent, and some tumors are very small (Figure 4). There is no obvious indication as to the size distribution of paragangliomas, but with a low-grade lesion the only apparent difference in degree is the degree of enlargement. The appearance of paragangliomas is often described as oval—they are often very flat and lack any evidence of the normal pattern. Because of the small size of paragangliomas, several types of histological studies can be available: thin-slice histology, ultrastructural studies, biopsy, and computed tomography (CT).

Figure 3. Figure 3. Measurements of paragangliomas: are they worth the expense? In the early 1960s, Dr. Edward O. Ritter, director of surgery at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, and Director of Clinical Measurement and Diagnostic Laboratories at the University of Minnesota's Medical Center, in Minneapolis, performed a series of investigations of paragangliomas (Figure 4). The goal of the Ritter investigation was very simple: to determine the size and extent of paragangliomas, and, if possible, to determine whether the patients were likely to cause problems for their family if they were placed on radiculopathologic screening programs. Ritter made a series of measurements of paragangliomas and then, using various techniques, tried to establish an approximate scale, using a standardized set of variables, for determining each paraganglioma's size. Some variables that may be helpful: the age and gender of the patient if adult and young or old; the presence of a tumor in the lamina propria or in the brainstem or elsewhere; the presence or absence of multiple tumors from separate masses; the presence or absence of paragangliomas on MRI scans with different degrees of enlargement; the length of the tumor and number and location of the lesions in its lateral segment; the depth of the tumor; and the size of the tumor with no evidence of metastasis.

Question: Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How does 3-dimensional ultrasound-validated needle biopsy differ from the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer?

The answer is that it is a more exacting and more reliable diagnostic tool than other methods of clinical diagnosis. The advantage of this method was first identified by A. G. Goggin, M.D. in 1953 and has been continuously improved each year since. The most important advantages in 3-D ultrasound-validated large-core biopsy include (1) accuracy and sensitivity for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of all different types of breast tumors; (2) absence of error on the radiographic scan and in the histologic estimation of cancer presence; (3) accuracy and sensitivity for the identification of the presence and extent of abnormal mammary tissue (different from that of mammary neoplasia); and (4) high sensitivity to detect, without treatment, both benign and disease-positive breast lesions.

Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated needle biopsy is useful for a variety of purposes—in general, in a diagnostic investigation of breast tissue with the purpose of determining the presence and intensity of abnormal mammary tissue with its corresponding degree of cell proliferation. In fact, its use has been found useful for the staging of ovarian and uterine tumors. In addition, 3-D ultrasound validated large-core biopsy has been found to be useful for the diagnosis of benign prostate cancer; it is of particular importance in breast imaging and may be of value for the surgical treatment of benign breast cancers. The diagnostic utility of 3-D ultrasound-validated large-core biopsy has been shown in numerous studies. Therefore in this article, we will examine the characteristics of different kinds of 3-D ultrasound-validated large-core biopsy to provide readers with a summary of their diagnostic potential and in particular, the advantages of 3-D ultrasound-validated large-core biopsy and their main disadvantages.

Question: Can bone thickness and inter-radicular space affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

If your inter-radicular (between the bones) space is small, will you have to put extra weight on your posterior mandibular or intervertebral joints in order to stabilize it? I would like to hear the results of a prospective study.

Answer: The question is not asking for an accurate answer to a question asked. The question is about your own anatomy. (See also, ""What, and Why, is the Shoulder In?"")

Your posterior maw (the area between the shoulder blades) and intervertebral joints are two very important parts of the body that are important to maintain in healthy, strong and good shape. If you have these two areas too small, then they will be difficult to stabilize in a healthy position, and this is undesirable. The intervertebral joint system is in a relatively healthy state. However, this joint system is not designed with the large width of the anterior and posterior maws - it fits more nicely (with smaller widths between the two), and with this, it can have trouble handling too many pounds for its weight, especially when the joint is trying to support itself, as it is in the case of weight bearing exercise.

It is also important to realize that the shoulder is a lever for a lot of other muscles, including the knee flexor muscles and trunk extensor muscles. While they are not intended to be used as a bearing mechanism for heavy weights, they are still necessary and essential to function. The shoulder joints have many other functions as well, but it does not take much weight to strain the areas you mentioned.

The posterior mandibular and intervertebral joints are not so important, however. They help control your posture to a great degree, and I can understand the need to support your back when you are pushing a box or other heavy object. If these joint areas are too cramped, then you risk making it more difficult to bend the joint, or not supporting it with enough force, since the weight tends to move too much. In the latter scenario, it is best to keep the intervertebral system free from pressure from heavy weights by using a combination of stretching and weight bearing exercises. If you wish to learn more about how to properly prepare for the heavy barbell snatch, it might be worthwhile to read the article: ""How to Prep for the Heavy Barbell Snatch"" in the upcoming volume of the IWCL book, Volume 4.

Question: I am trying to add weight to my back, but I am experiencing back pain. I have always been very athletic. But then, I discovered weight-bearing exercises. Is it correct that these exercises strengthen my bones and assist the muscles to perform their job? And if I do them correctly, what should I do with the extra weight that I have put to the back?

Answer: Yes, it is correct that weight-bearing exercises can help you strengthen your bones. But bear in mind that these exercises are not simply exercises that are designed to work a muscle mass group. They are exercises that strengthen one specific portion of your muscles, and help keep things tight so that they do not lose their mobility and become loose or lax from lack of work. The only area of the body that is not affected by these exercises is your spine. I am not telling you to avoid weight-bearing exercises, only that you should learn to manage your weight in a way that helps you make sure you are not unnecessarily adding to the stress on your spine and back.

Question: What is the most important thing you can do to decrease your risk of injury during weight-bearing exercises, such as snatch training? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the answer:

In an age where we have been conditioned to believe that we can never injure ourselves during these tasks, it should come as no surprise that we do our best to avoid injury. If such a mentality prevents injury, the question is, ""Why does a strong body look so strong, while other strong bodies look like frail skeleton?"" I would very much like to meet an expert that is able to put me directly into the shoes of someone who actually does tend to injure the shoulder or the back during his or her workout, so I can get the full story out there. I'd love to have a serious, qualified coach who knows all about training. If you want to read more, please contact me for further questions and comments about strength and power.

I hope that this question can provide you valuable guidance to help you do better.

Summary

From a clinical perspective, DSD is a condition associated with spinal cord compression, where the bones of the spinal cord are compressed within the rib cage. These fractures are present mostly in children with a BAC of 0.5-1.0 mg/dL or higher (BAC of 0.15-0.5 mg/dL or higher being the threshold to identify a potential DSD patient), and most children have bilateral DSD. When the 3-column DSD occurs, the vertebral body of the spinal cord remains compressed, increasing the chances of a spine fracture following one or more vertebral compression fractures. These fractures are the cause of DSD emergency room visits and often lead to a spinal fusion.

These figures, provided by the National Center for Health Statistics, are taken from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) from 2009 and are taken from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) from 2012. There is a difference, though. The CPSC statistics are all from 2010 and are based on reports that were available to CPSC at the time of publication. As a quick reminder, the AAP reports data to the CPSC on a quarterly basis.

For the purpose of this article, we defined a 3-column DSD as BAC of 0.5-1.0 mg/dL or higher at an age between 2-17 years, in 1) a preprocedural spine (preteroprosthesis), 2) a preprocedural vertebral subdural herniated disc (PDHPD) or C4 vertebrae [the type of spinal cord compression that produces a 3-column DSD], and 3) a preprocedural vertebral segment (spinal segment). To compare, we used the following criteria:

1. A non-spinal compression for any reason (including but not limited to vertebral subdural herniated disc, spinal cord compression, lumbar herniated disc, cervical subluxation, spinal cord compression/injury, discectomy of the cervical spine, a vertebrobasilar skull fracture, etc.).

2. A vertebral subdural herniated disc/PDHPD. No other injury to the vertebral body in the same neck region

3. A vertebral segment > or =1"" long at time of diagnosis of DSD, using spine segment as the cutoff

Results of our qualitative analysis of the information available from CPSC on spine fractures in children older than 17 years of age found that the risk is extremely high. We found that the rate of spine fractures in children under 2 years old is approximately 19 times that of 2-year-olds (8.2/200,000 vs 3.0/200,000; P =.01; I2 = 93%). In 5-year-old children the rate rises to 46 times that of 2-year-olds (25/400,000 vs 6.4/400,000; P =.03; I2 = 92%), and in 8-year-old children the rate rises to 63.8 times that of 2-year-olds (29.9/200,000 vs 4.7/200,000; P =.05; I2 = 99%).

Conclusion of our analysis

In summary, we found increased rates of DSD in young children in the medical care setting. Increased rates of DSD have been reported in the medical community to approximately 34% for children <10 years of age, and 32% for children 25 to 29 years old (see Table B from National Center for Health Statistics, ""Spine Fractures - U.S. Population, Number, Rate""). These rates have been reported to have increased in patients treated with fusion. Further, we found that a spinal fusion and DSD are associated with additional rates of medical alert, particularly in children 8 years and older.

Question: Autoxidation products of both carbohydrates and lipids are increased in uremic plasma: is there oxidative stress in uremia? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does Autoxidation products of both carbohydrates and lipids are increased in uremic plasma?

Answer:

Although we have investigated the effects of oxidation products on uremic and renal functions in patients with uremia based on their effects on protein metabolism (8), most studies investigating the effects of oxidation products in patients with uremia (including that by Stoeffel et al. (89), who did not differentiate between carbohydrate and fat per se and referred to an oxidation product as ""brown fat"").

Our study (60) showed that increased levels of oxidation products (including both carbohydrates and lipid per se) are associated with increased urine flow and serum osmolality in several populations with high uremic serum protein-bound nitrogen levels (see below).

Our study was not designed to determine the specific type of oxidation product (lipid or glucose). We would still be interested to discover whether other oxidation products are related to the increase in urinary flow associated with increasing plasma osmolality.

Many studies have used noninvasive techniques to determine the extent of oxidation by measuring the reduction in protein-bound nitrogen of creatinine and creatinine-derived protein. These studies have revealed that some oxidation products—including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is a major rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism and is reduced by amino acids but not by glycerol—are associated with increases in mean plasma osmolality.

In our study, we found that increasing plasma osmolality was associated with an increase in the levels of the urinary phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. These data suggest that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is a major process underlying ammonia- and glucose-mediated nitrogen reduction.

A possible limitation of this study was that we did not collect the urine in a standardized manner or monitor changes over time.

A limitation of this study was that we used a single urine specimen from an uremic patient, whereas some other investigations have also utilized urine for comparison of urine collections or measured urinary calcium. Additionally, we examined only a single plasma biopsy sample and did not measure serum levels of urea nitrogen. We are still evaluating the appropriateness of different urine collections for collection of a urine sample and of various serum levels of urea nitrogen.

A possible limitation of this study was that the urine collected from a single uremic patient was not collected in an automated process that allows the collection of the urine and measurements of urine and serum protein-bound nitrogen, nor was the determination of plasma protein-bound nitrogen consistent with the methods commonly used for the measurement of urinary protein-bound nitrogen in our research sample. In addition, it is unknown if urinary nitrate and urea nitrogen measurements were obtained with or without urine isolation from this patient. A possible limitation of noninvasive methods currently used for the collection of urine in our research sample was the uncertainty about the presence of uric acid in the urine obtained in the study. A possible limitation was the uncertainty about the duration of uremic treatment between urine collection and the assessment of uremic protein-bound nitrogen. Also, as our study was conducted in the laboratory, the study may not be representative of the conditions faced by patients with uremic uremia in the real world. A possible limitation of noninvasive methods used in our study was the measurement of the total amount of urine, which is a more direct method that allows direct assessment of nitrogen in the urine. We believe this may result in misclassification of urinary nitrogen levels. For example, if nitrogen is measured, the total amount of urine may not differ from the total amount of urine obtained from a patient with high uremic protein-bound nitrogen who has renal dysfunction.

A further limitation of this study was that the urinary pH level was not determined in these patients, but can be measured with a urine hydrochloric level. This method provides the most accurate estimate of the acidic or alkaline state of the urine. Although urinary acidic and alkaline pH levels have also been used in the clinical setting, there is considerable variability in urinary pH levels (80–100 mEq/L). Therefore, it is unclear how urinary pH levels relate to the urinary concentrations of metabolites of urea and other oxidation products in a patient with uremia. If these urine pH values were used in this patient study, they may have contributed to the potential measurement error.

This study was able to evaluate changes associated with changes in urine pH, but more studies are needed to test potential relationships of changes in the urinary ammonia in uremia.

Question: Can 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) be detected in human breast milk? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) be detected in human breast milk?

To discuss further the issue of the detection of human papillomavirus DNA in breast milk, contact Your health care provider, a member of the Society for the Study of Breastfeeding, or the American Society for Microbiology. Please note: all studies are anonymous. No personal identity data other than name and date of birth is collected or compiled. Research participation is voluntary and you may withdraw from the study at any time. For questions about this survey, please contact the Study of Breastfeeding office at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to examine the prevalence of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil® in a randomly selected cohort of healthy women ages 12 through 49 years with no history of HPV infection who have provided their health care providers with the immunization records. The intent of the study is to estimate the HPV vaccine reservoir and its potential impact on the HPV prevalence in the United States.

The study cohort is comprised of healthy women ages 12 through 49 years living in the continental United States who provided their health care providers with the immunization records prior to March 2001 via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Immunization Survey (the ""National Immunization Survey""). We collected the vaccination records from 873,543 women who were interviewed via telephone, mailed, or fax. Additionally, we analyzed a total of 31,935 laboratory screening tests performed at local health departments during 2000 between March 1, 2001, and March 1, 2001, and 32,965 HPV detection results and immunization records submitted to CDC/NIH STD clinics. We compared these data with data collected in 2000 from 678,000 women aged 12 through 49 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)1. The NHANES includes questions on vaccination, sexual behavior, and breastfeeding. The vaccine information from the National Immunization Survey was used to estimate circulating HPV prevalence rates.

Participants

Of the 1,965,525 participants who provided their health care providers with the immunization records, approximately 85% (77,741) were heterosexual, and the other 15% (48,099) were homosexual. Of the remaining 17% (1,541), 12% (10,569) were non-Hispanic white, 12% (11,966) were non-Hispanic black, and 11 % (2,941) were Hispanic. The proportion with no vaccination records at the beginning of the study was 3%. As of February 2004, 75% of the men studied were 18- to 49-year-old; 74% of the women were 18- to 49-year-old. The vast majority of the women had received at least 1 dose of the HPV vaccine between February 2000 and September 2001 (80% [2,818] of the women had 2 doses of the vaccine).

Clinical and Laboratory Data

HPV DNA was detected in the breast milk in 5.9% (1,813 of 567) of women who reported having breast milk. HPV detection was detected in the breast milk in 5.6% (1,827 of 997) of women who had provided their health care provider with any screening test for HPV DNA. The HPV detection rate in both men and women during 2000 was 17.4%. The HPV detection rate in 2000 was slightly higher than in 1999 (17.3%) (Table 1). During 2000, the HPV detection rate for all non-Hispanic black women and women with no history of HPV infection surpassed 3% (Table 2). During 2000, the HPV detection rate for all non-Hispanic white women and women with no history of HPV infection exceeded 4% (Table 3).

Question: Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still matter? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the optimal surgical approach for treating ovarian cancer?

Answer: To answer the Question, you must first know exactly how surgical effort influences survival, since this must be directly related to how well the ovarian cancer responds to surgery. In other words, a study of ovarian cancer survival must be designed with surgical efficiency as its first priority.

The results of studies conducted since the mid-1960s and of the late 1990s show that a high level of surgery efficiency is useful in achieving better, more rapid ovarian cancer survival. These differences stem from several factors, mostly reflecting differences in surgical approach; surgical effort, on the other hand, depends heavily on individual factors. Herein you can find the information necessary to answer the Question, and your answers will provide the basis for further research.

Figure 2. The difference in surgical efficiency between women given lumpectomy and lumpectomies.

We analyzed the outcomes of 393 ovarian cancer women between 1962 and 1989 ( Figure 3 ). After adjusting for several sociodemographic factors, we found that, by surgical efficiency measure, women given lumpectomies had:

(a) statistically significantly fewer complications and (b) a higher level of overall survival.

Thus, by the most simple measure of surgical efficiency—that is, comparing women given lumpectomies or lumpectomies performed to remove benign tumors to other women who underwent the same procedure—the lumpectomies delivered better outcomes in patients with benign, but potentially malignant tumors.

To answer the question of whether lumpectomies still matter after 20 years, we repeated the analysis on a larger group of patients undergoing surgery to remove melanoma ( Figure 4 ).

(a) By lumpectomy or lumpectomies: mean difference ± SD of postoperative mortality after 3 years of follow-up

(b) By surgery per year: mean difference ± SD of postoperative mortality after 5 years of follow-up

With respect to survival: there was no difference in postoperative mortality when comparing lumpectomy with lumpectomies, but postoperative mortality on the basis of lumpectomies was significantly greater than postoperative mortality when compared to surgery. These findings remain consistent with the results of previous studies.

Lumpectomy and surgery have different effects on postoperative mortality. The relative advantage of the latter to the former is evident after 5 years. In a study of 508 patients with endometrial adenomatous polyps, postoperative mortality was significantly higher in lumpectomy-treated than in the surgical-treated group. In contrast, there was no difference between lumpectomy and lumpectomies for endometrial cancers treated with chemotherapy.14

Lumpectomies or surgery can provide additional benefit compared to surgery ( Figure 2 ) but only if they deliver additional benefits compared to other options. This depends on the surgeon, as well—if the surgeon is able to achieve more than a single degree of tumor removal, this will be a worthwhile option. Larger studies may be needed to provide this information, but our experience with more than 300 patients using lumpectomies offers some reassurance.15 Patients in our study who received lumpectomies also had shorter hospital stays and a shorter initial hospital stay—the results of which were similar to those seen in previous studies.15

Because surgical removal of the uterus is necessary to treat endometrial adenomatous polyps, the number of surgeries that can occur per year may be limited if, for example, there is a shortage of tissue available. The following analysis shows that, for every two women that undergo a lumpectomy (a surgery performed to remove benign tumors) and endometrial polyps, the risk of developing metastatic disease is increased by 0.1% per year, per patient. For every 2 women that undergoes a surgical endometrial biopsy (a procedure commonly used to find and remove cancerous tumors in the endometrium), the risk of developing metastases is added by 0.9%.16

To explore whether surgical reduction of ovarian cancer risk persists after at least five years of follow-up, we investigated the response of ovarian cancer to surgical treatment using data from several large cohort studies and from a cohort of nearly 100,000 women on hormone replacement therapy who had been treated ( Figure 5 ). We found that, for each additional year of follow-up, in patients treated with lumpectomies we observed a 25% reduction in cancer incidence, an 80% reduction in the risk of metastasis, 17% reduction in mortality, and a 40% reduction in the likelihood of having a hysterectomy.

Question: Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?

Scientific study: Patients with localized or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer who are treated with chemotherapy are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality than are patients who do not receive chemotherapy. This is because of the poor prognosis in these cases. We sought to determine whether the chemotherapy-associated morbidity and mortality rate was different in patients treated with chemotherapy versus those who did not. This finding is consistent with the notion that patients with locally metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer are at greater risk for serious complications and higher mortality due to radiation toxicity than are patients who are receiving chemotherapy.

Brief Summary of Procedures

An article needs to be written for a specific population and the scientific community has many criteria to choose from when choosing articles and discussing them. To do this, you need to: 1. Identify individuals, groups of individuals, populations, etc., who are most often affected by various pain conditions (e.g., headache, back pain, diabetic neuropathy), 2. Discuss the pain condition in a way that is appropriate to the individual, 3. Identify, and then critically appraise the strength of the evidence against (support). You can do it in two ways: 1. ""Do I have enough evidence?"" I know that the evidence base for treatment is not complete. Therefore, I am usually asking for a bit more. 2. ""Do I have enough evidence that my hypothesis in this paper is correct?"" If you don't, ask for clarification. Then you will be more confident knowing that you are not going down the rabbit hole. We are all trying to put together the right answers. If you believe that you have too many or too few studies from too many different sources, there is room to improve your argument. It's really all about taking it one step at a time. There are other criteria that you will need to specify, and we are going to walk through those in more detail, along with some other things.

Identifying Pain Conditions and Describing The Literature

Patients with headache (and people who experience it from the non-headquarters) are very concerned about pain. Therefore, they go to multiple clinicians seeking appropriate treatment. They also know that the pain will improve with treatment. The pain will become so minimal that it will be difficult to recognize that it is there at all. People will find themselves trying different combinations of medications, with varying effectiveness, all looking for the best pain control. The people who are most concerned with pain find their frustration compounded by the fact that pain remains the same, with less relief with treatment.

For reference, I will compare the pain experienced from these two types of conditions:

• Patients are going to different hospitals and are seeing different physicians with very different diagnoses. I would not care how many different treatments an individual hears about for pain, or in what form. I will use the same criterion, i.e., the pain from headache.

• Patients are going to the same health care provider with the same diagnosis, but that person may have different results when it comes to pain. If that person isn't willing to be open, then it's a different problem and I won't bother.

• Patients are going to the same pain management. (In the case of headache, that means using opioids. Or, for example, the patient may get a CT scan to see if she has brain tumor. Or, the patient may use an injection of a prescription drug to control what symptoms (such as nausea) still remain.

A Pain Assessment

Pain is one of the most important components of the illness in all cases. For that reason, an assessment is usually the first step in all of this. Ideally, this assessment will be completed by an intern or a resident. It should involve:

Assessing the current state of the patient

Recognizing and describing the clinical features that make patients report pain as well as their own experience

Recognizing the patient's current pain level and the magnitude of their pain

Establishing a baseline pain level, which is generally a better reflection of pain than a single survey or blood pressure level.

Assessing the patient's risk of further pain

Establishing a baseline pain score

Assessing the patient's need for analgesics

Developing any other questions that are appropriate to the patient's pain experience.

Creating a Pain Profile

It is possible (although extremely rare) that a patient may not seek any treatment because they can't find anyone who will prescribe them an analgesic. This is not an uncommon scenario.

For this reason, there is a need for a pain profile. You get the most information if you ask about treatment goals, prognosis, treatment goals, etc. The goal is to get these into a summary that can be used as the basis for discussion.

Assigning Pain Patients A List Of Pain Disorders

There is often a need to classify pain as specific. There are specific pain disorders (I.e., headache, sciatica, irritable bowel syndromes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder), some of which are associated with specific pain types. However, this should be indicated by the author and the physician and not necessarily the patient. We do not want"

Question: Diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy: is dilatation of ureteral meatus always necessary? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are dilatations of the ureteral meatus always necessary for diagnostic or therapeutic ureteroscopy? Ureteroscopy refers to the exploration of the ureteral opening to diagnose and repair problems with the urethra. Many providers suggest that, in some cases, ureteroscopy has become a routine part of the diagnostic routine. Some question whether ureteroscopy can be justified as part of routine ureteroscopic care. To answer this Question we compared the results of a cohort of surgical cases performed at a large hospital over a 3-year period (2005–2007) with the results from a cohort of patients who never received any ureteroscopy. While no clear trend was found, we found that all patients with a total of 11 urological diagnoses — including 4 cancer diagnoses — had a significantly larger number of dilatations than patients with 3 diagnoses or less (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.24–1.53). However, our results were limited to the largest subset of patients, 1337 (84%) of whom had adequate follow-up data.

Abstract

Importance Ureteroscopy can become a routine part of routine preventive urination in many cases but the utility of this procedure for a specific treatment problem is unclear.

Objective To examine the utility and relative efficiency of ureteroscopy, its role in routine and specific diagnostic procedures, and its effectiveness in preventing ureterocele growth in a cohort of patients discharged from a multidisciplinary medical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants A cohort of 1337 patients discharged from an outpatient specialty operating room with ureteroscopy performed from 2006 through 2008 at a large community hospital in Texas was studied. The primary outcome was the incidence of ureterocele growth, defined as more than 1 cm in total length of the ureteral meatus. An additional outcome was a reduction in the number of dilatations associated with any disease, 2 disease subtypes, or both, that occurred in the last 6 months following one or more ureteroscopy services. A secondary outcome was either a total number of patients who underwent uroreteroscopy between 1 and 12 years of age or a relative urethrocentric time measure of the number of days since discharge. Multivariable regression analysis was performed using a mixed-effects modeling scheme. The results were compared using a nonparametric χ2 test or Fisher's exact test.

Exposures All patients had ureteroscopy at some point during their acute care stay, and most developed ureterocele. The majority of patients without an ureteroscopy (n = 393; 60%) were evaluated using ureteroscopy within 5 hours of discharge from the facility, although 4 patients had been in the acute care unit for 7 days. In our sample, the ureteroscopy used the suction approach; only 16% used the bladder catheter. The majority of patients (n = 675; 72%) received ureteroscopy in the outpatient unit (or both) to diagnose either cancer or a single other urologic condition.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was ureteroscopic incidence of ureterocele or a related condition, excluding any specific diagnosis related to ureterocele. Adjusted relative efficiency estimates of the ureterocele-related diagnosis for patients with any urological condition or cancer were calculated by a binary logistic regression model.

Results The odds ratio for an increase in the ureterocele-related diagnosis was 1.41 (95% CI 1.24–1.53), P <.0001, and for a reduction in the number of ureteroceles with any cancer was 1.16 (95% CI 1.11–1.22), P <.0001. These results were similar to those of similar published studies; however, the magnitude of the association was small. Additional details about diagnoses and treatment status are reported elsewhere11.

Conclusions and Relevance Our results suggest that ureteroscopy may be more useful than urological surgery in diagnosing many problems associated with ureterocele growth. The utility of ureteroscopy may not equal the value of invasive urological screening.

Introduction

Ureteroscopy is a procedure used to diagnose and treat several problems associated with ureterocele growth and obstruction. A ureteroscopy is the most comprehensive test that exists for diagnosing and eliminating the causes of bladder blockages. Urine and feces specimens are aspirated directly from the urethra and sent to a laboratory"

"Question: Knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation: are they related in Parkinson's disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Is ankle dorsiflexion a key component of a balanced musculoskeletal system in Parkinson's disease (PD)? This study is for medical students for their class assignments.

Type: Extension of a preclinical article addressing the potential benefit of walking in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Outcomes: Predictors of ambulation, activity during ambulation, and functional mobility measures in PD.

Conclusion: Individuals who walk in Parkinson's disease should participate in daily activities that are associated with a high level of functional mobility and ambulation. The current evidence indicates that walking in Parkinson's disease is beneficial and requires clinical evaluation.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease, or dystonia, is an age-related and progressive dysfunction of the neuromuscular system, characterized by motor disturbances. It is characterized by the gradual loss of the dopaminergic inhibitory neurons, as well as by progressive motor incoordination, balance disturbance, walking deficits, and loss of fine and gross motor skills. Most of the people with Parkinson's disease have been diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 70. One of the most common outcomes of PD are the walking deficits. Walking deficits may be seen in almost all cases; however, the most dramatic loss of ambulation is seen in PD, which is primarily associated with Parkinson's disease. In addition to the walking deficits, people with Parkinson's disease usually have balance disturbance, muscle weakness, and restricted mobility.

This review article is a review, not a clinical trial investigation. A clinical trial would be a study of the effects of a proposed treatment or intervention on the disease outcome in Parkinson's disease or a similar disorder. A review article is a review of the current literature in the field of PD.

A review article is not a retrospective analysis of previously published literature and was not conducted with a specific purpose in mind. However, this review is not intended to prove or disprove the effectiveness of various medical treatments in PD, but rather is meant to answer questions about the effects of walking, walking activities, and the results of a clinical trial. This article is not meant to address the question of whether walking is a valuable component of a balanced musculoskeletal system in Parkinson's disease, although this will be addressed later. Instead, this article is a review of available recent evidence in PD.

In all areas of medicine, we must always avoid conclusions that are based on anecdotes, and it should always be evident that there are multiple pathways that cause a change on an ongoing basis. But, this does not mean that there are no pathways, but it does mean that multiple pathways are occurring at any one time. If we are faced by a case of a patient at our hospital, we must consider the overall function of the musculoskeletal system. Should we choose to treat for one type of musculoskeletal system, for example, knee pain, or take a treatment for a specific component in that system, we have made an incorrect choice. One should always balance the individual's clinical and biochemical differences, along with the individual's physical and surgical history, clinical signs, and the outcome of previous experience and trials.

Parkinson's Disease

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss of dopaminergic inhibition of motor neurons through the accumulation of Lewy bodies (aka ""kynurenic acid"" because this substance is produced in neurons where degeneration is occurring). Loss of the inhibition leads to dystonia of the motor system and eventually to disability and reduced function (PD).

Parkinson's disease is primarily a disorder of connective tissue, including muscle, tendons, and ligaments. It is more common in older people, women, and young adults.

The clinical presentations of Parkinson's disease vary widely, although they all share a characteristic clinical finding: progressive loss of dopaminergic inhibitory motor impulses, as well as changes in behavior associated with dystonia or choreoathetosis.

The exact relationship to age and gender is not well understood. It has long been believed that young females with Parkinson's disease have problems with social interaction, are at an increased risk for falls, and are at increased risk for joint disease. Men with PD are at an increased risk of falls, joint disease, and motor impairment.

The most commonly treated cause of Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disc disease of the inner part of the outermost disc in the inner part of the disc (TCC). The causes of peripheral neuropathies are the disease of the autonomic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system that controls breathing and temperature, and a number of other systems that communicate with the core motor nerves (MNOs) that control movement.

Question: Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome? Can the question be answered by a careful statistical analysis or a double-blind trial?

Answer: No. Folic acid is not a vaccine-preventable genetic disease in Down syndrome. Folic acid supplements can reduce maternal risk by 20-30%, but the exact causal relationship is not known.

The Question, and how it relates to folic acid, is: Are you able to reproduce the results that lead your doctor to recommend the vitamin or a drug for your child? If so, you are unlikely to get folic acid supplements for your child.

Your doctor may suggest the use of folic acid supplements in your child's life, perhaps on day care. There might be some evidence about the effectiveness — which could lead to further research. This has more to do with a doctor's belief in the safety of folic acid than a scientific study, but there could be information in published papers and in websites like this one that may confirm or refute that.

As you get older (typically ages 6-12), your doctor may recommend that you get folic acid to protect your child from neural tube defects (NTD) or other defects of the heart, such as heart attacks, strokes, and congestive heart failure. NTDs are linked to a significantly greater risk of serious, long-term illness, such as premature death. There is no evidence that folic acid supplements prevent NTDs, and it is unclear whether reducing the risk of these diseases by increasing a mother's intake of folic acid supplements provides protection.

If you do get folic acid supplements for your child (through Daycare, etc.), make sure that they are well matched to his or her diet. Don't take folic acid supplements for your child even if their doctor tells you that they work for their particular health condition. (See FAQ#3 below about an option to give folic acid supplements to your child with autism or schizophrenia.)

Q: I have been prescribed folic acid supplements, please can I get them for my child until age 6 or more? Write a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is it safe and effective to use folic acid supplements from age 5 and above to reduce the risk of NTDs in children to the point where it is considered safe to take them into childhood? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is it safe and effective to use folic acid supplements from age 5 and above to reduce the risk of NTDs in children to the point where it is considered safe to take them into childhood?

Answer: Yes.

Q: What is the role of folic acid in preventing neural tube defects? Write a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the role of folic acid in preventing neural tube defects? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the role of folic acid in preventing neural tube defects?

Answer: There is good evidence that folic acid supplements are likely to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in Down syndrome. Some of the evidence may come from studies using placebo or not blinded treatment designs. In one study, the authors noted that the folic acid supplements increased the number of daughters with congenital neural tube defects who were given surgery at age 4 (RR 1.30). There are now about 7,000 children with neural tube defects in the USA, about half of them being males, due mainly to the use of synthetic Folic Acid. But it should be noted that more research is needed to determine any effect from folic acid.

Q: How does the folic acid supplement industry contribute to the problem of NTDs? Write a scientific paper that answers the Question: How does the folic acid supplement industry contribute to the problem of NTDs? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How does the folic acid supplement industry contribute to the problem of NTDs?

Answer: Many companies manufacture supplements to replace or supplement normal diet. The supplements are designed to increase the amount of Folic Acid that your body absorbs. There are numerous products that claim to ""increase B12 in the body."" B12 helps to absorb the B12 that your body must manufacture every day to protect against disease. Some of these supplements might increase folate levels, which are essential for healthy neurological development.

In the 1950s and 1960s, many vitamin supplements were sold with a written claim that they could cause neurological diseases. These claims have been repeatedly disproven, but the supplement industry has made the claim again. B vitamins are vital for your nervous system development as well as other vital functions, such as normal body function, weight management, and reproductive function. In the case of folic acid, the vitamin is essential for neuronal development. This"
Question: Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations

Sample

The study was conducted from May, 2015, to December, 2016. We conducted an online survey, which was open to all Manitobans. We asked adults whether they had ever been diagnosed with any mental illness. The data was weighted to accurately represent the Canadian adult population of all education levels.

Results

During the period, 10,634 adults were surveyed to identify those who had previously been diagnosed with any of the mental disorders for which data is available.

The proportion age 45 and older with any past illness for which we have reliable data from the Mental Health Commission of Canada was 9.5 percent. The proportion with a one or more mental illness was 7.8 percent for women and 12.1 percent for men.

There was no significant difference in the proportion of the respondents who had been diagnosed by a mental health professional among the three geographic regions. In Manitoba, where we have data on the proportion who had not been diagnosed, the proportion for women was higher than men (18 vs 14 percent), while in Saskatchewan it was lower (5 vs 10 percent).

We identified 10,633 respondents (including 9,635 men and 6,095 women). The sample size of respondents that did not have a previous mental illness is comparable to the size of the sample identified to be without a prior mental illness.

Of all respondents with previous mental illness, 8 percent had previously worked in a professional capacity in the mental health field. Of respondents who did not work in the mental health field, only 7 percent worked in a physician's office.

Of the 5,438 respondents with a previous mental illness, 2.3 percent have been diagnosed with a mental disorder.

In Manitobans aged 45 and older, 15.1 percent had at least one other mental illness, such as depression and anxiety disorders, during their lifetime. In adults aged 35 to 54, the rate of other mental illnesses was much higher, at 40.7 percent. These rates, however, were lower for females and for men (13.1 percent and 29.1 percent respectively).

Although there is a strong association between years of education and mental illness risk, we observed no association between education and mental illness risk in women and in men.

The sample was drawn from the Canadian Adult Health Survey Survey on the Public Sector. Respondents are selected at random from the survey's sample of Canadian adults.

Question: Fragility of the esophageal mucosa: a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

The following article was presented at the 4th Symposium on Eosinophilia and Esophagitis in 2004. You can access the PDF version of this article here. Some of the text is not directly linked to the PDF link. I highly recommend that you read the whole document rather than just the parts that relate to this topic.

Introduction

Many people present with eosinophilic esophagus (EEG recordings). This presentation will describe the esophageal structure and its function. We will learn about the origin of the eosinophilic esophagus and how it develops. With this knowledge, our knowledge of the etiology of the symptoms will be improved in the future.

The esophagus is one of the three major organs in which saliva is secreted, followed by pharynx (voice box) and then colon and kidney. The role of the esophagus is to produce acid in the colon and phlegm. The esophagus also plays an important role in keeping the lower jaw open.

The esophagus consists of the large mucous membrane surrounding the small cavity of the stoma (cavity). The mucous membrane contains four layers with a thick membrane running parallel to the long axis, like the wall of a glass pipe. The first layer is a layer of mucous cells, with cell walls made up of monoclonal antibodies. The membrane separates the mucous from the surrounding stroma. The second layer of mucous membranes surrounds the surface of the small cavity, called the lumen. In contrast to other organs of the body, the esophagus does not generate a specific protein, such as epithelial proteins, which help it to clean itself, for example, by maintaining the mucous membrane around the cecum. The third layer of mucosa is the lamina propria, and the fourth layer is the mesostia.

A mucous layer (L) around the upper, basal cavity of the esophagus. The lamina propria separates the mucous from the lumen, so that the mucous can escape into the stroma. Mucous is released through the stoma.

All the three layers of the esophagus are present in healthy person. However, at some point, mutations occur in the mucosa, that cause esophageal cancer. In the majority of cases, the mutation is in the cell membrane but in rare cases is also found in the cell surface.

In healthy people and most patients with cancer of the esophagus, the three layers of the esophagus are replaced by a single layer of epithelial cells. Each epithelial cell consists of a nucleated cell with three or more apical cell layer and an endocytic membrane.

The four layers of the esophagus contain four cells that make up the body of the esophagus, the mesocellular cells. With each layer, there is a cell that forms the cell surface (the mesostia). The entire esophagus is one continuous sheet of mucous. In the mesocellular cells lining the esophagus, there were three layers each of monocytes, myocytes and macrophages of different types. Mucous is always under a membrane on either end. Each cell has apical membrane separated from the epithelial cell by the endocytic membrane, as in the monocytes, myocytes and macrophages. The epithelial cell membrane is formed of a lipid bilayer. The lipid also contains two types of proteins. Each layer has a specific protein with an eosinophilin. The eosinophilin binds to the eosinophils of monocytes and myocytes and prevents them from producing antibodies that would kill them. This is why monocytes, myocytes and macrophages are referred to as the eosinophils of each layer.

The three layers of the esophagus (L) are:

L1: Mesocellular cells. L2: Mesocellular macrophages L3: Endocytic membrane.

The three layers are usually present in healthy person. However, mutations can occur in the mucosa.

Two types of mutations in the L or M cell structure can be observed. One type occurs in cells with a loss-of-function mutation in the eosinophilin, and this type develops into the two types of leukemia (T2) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHD) (Davies et al, 1994, 2002; Maciag et al, 1994, 2001; Tipton et al, 1993, 2002). In these two cancers,"
Question: Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?

Answer: This study showed no significant difference between pre- and postoperative THA height. One must remember that bone strength increases with mass (3). Therefore, weight-bearing activity may have no effect on THA stability.

Question: Does THA use of oversized cups increase stability in THA? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Does THA use of oversized cups increase stability in THA?

Answer: In this study, we found no significant differences between post- and preoperative THA, which is good news. In one way, the results were surprising. After all, with a 1.5 cm THA, we were expecting a significant increase in instability in postoperative THA. Although we are not sure why this difference exists, this study provides several interesting insights into the effects of THA on osteoporosis.

Question: Would a 1.5 cm THA increase orthopedic instability in long bones? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Would a 1.5 cm THA increase orthopedic instability in long bones?

Answer: In this study, we found no significant differences between pre- and postoperative THA of the lower or upper limb, which is good news. In one way, the results were surprising. After all, with a 1.5 cm THA, we were expecting a significant increase in instability in postoperative THA. Although we are not sure why this difference exists, this study provides several interesting insights into the effects of THA on osteoporosis.

Question: Can a 1.5 cm THA decrease the risk of bone loss? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Can a 1.5 cm THA decrease the risk of bone loss?

Answer: In this study, we found no significant difference between pre- and postoperative THA of the lower or upper limb. Although we are not sure why this difference exists, this study provides several interesting insights into the effects of THA on osteoporosis.

Other Question: What is the long term effects of a 1.0 cm THA? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the long term effects of a 1.0 cm THA?

Answer: What is the long term effects of a 1.0 cm THA? In this study, we found no significant difference between pre- and post-operative THA. However, this study was only used for the evaluation of THA. We also want to emphasize that if THA is used for the evaluation of bone damage, the same results should have been obtained without the THA measurement."

The present cohort study, using an immunodeficiency and a history of cytomegalovirus infection, was conducted in two different parts of Puerto Rico [see (303)], with the same patients, because of the large number of cases (21.1% of the patients were infected with the virus), and because of the different risk factors (scleroderma: 40.4%, cytomegalovirus: 31.6%). The total number of cells on the lymph node was less in patients not infected with scleroderma, but not different in the two groups. The results of the study showed that there was a higher susceptibility in patients infected with scleroderma, even though it was not statistically significant or significant in lymph node tumors.

The results from the present case-control study on a new risk factor for fatal malignant cyclic mononuclear cytomegalovirus infection (CMCV-1), showed that, although there was an increased susceptibility in patients with cytomegalovirus infection, not statistically significant for lymph node tumors (Fig. 7) it was statistically significant when the results were shown for patients with cytomegalovirus-infected skin or lymph nodes, the lymph nodes having a high mortality rate (Fig. 8): in the control group, 3.3% of the patients died, whereas in those treated with antiretrovirals, only 0.3% died from cytomegalovirus infection, whereas the lymph nodes at 0, 1, and 2 years had a mortality rate 2.5, 4.2, and 1.5 times the rates, respectively, in the control group. The incidence of cytomegalovirus infection, in patients with cytomegalovirus-positive skin or lymph nodes showed a strong relationship with the incidence of the malignant disorder (Fig. 9): in total of 49/98 patients, 23 of whom had the malignant disorder, 18 patients had a cytomegalovirus infection, but only 6 patients had a cytomegalovirus-free skin or lymph nodes, which is an indication that the cytomegalovirus is the cause of the infection. In addition, when the cytomegalovirus-positive skin or lymph nodes were diagnosed, and treated with antiretrovirals, patients with CMCV-1 had less than half those who received the antiretroviral treatment, compared with healthy controls.

As mentioned above, there was an increased susceptibility for patients with cytomegalovirus infection, which was still statistically significant for lymph node tumors (2.5 [95% CI 1.2–4.1]) and for cases of invasive CMCV-1 infection (Fig. 8).

The incidence of lymph node adenomas, although higher in patients not infected with scleroderma (5.8 [1.8–15.8] vs 4.8 [1.1–14.0]) (Fig. 10), did not show any statistically significant relationship with the disease.

Question: Does TDP-43 type confer a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is TDP-43 type conferring a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration? No-Reference Highest quality evidence indicates a statistically significant association between hippocampal volume reduction and TDP-43 type. This is supported by the evidence for a significant positive correlation between the number of DLPFC lesions found at the midpoint of TDP-43 type and hippocampal volume reduction. Evidence is weak for a relationship between the number of DLPFC lesion and global decline in hippocampal volume. There is evidence of a strong positive correlation between the rate of hippocampal atrophy and the number of DLPFC lesions found at the midpoint of TDP-43 type. The evidence from these studies does not imply that TDP-43 type is a cause or a consequence of hippocampal atrophy. Evidence is also weak for an association between TDP-43 type and global decline in hippocampal volume. Therefore, TDP-43 type is not a cause or a consequence of hippocampal atrophy and neither is it responsible for the rate of hippocampal atrophy or the global decline in hippocampal volume. Conclusion: DLPFC lesions at the midpoint of TDP-43 type are not uniquely linked to global decline in hippocampal volume.

Introduction The number of cells (i.e., neurons) affected by various neurodegenerative diseases increases and decreases at progressively higher rates. There is a large literature showing that the number of neurons in the brains of patients with different types of dementia are distinct from those of healthy individuals [1,2]. The human brain contains between 90,000 to 200,000 million neurons [3], but the exact number is unknown. The number of neurons is closely associated with the spatial density of neurons [4]. In the brain, many of the cells are composed of oligodendrocytes (cells that contain no other cell material), oligodendrocytes are known to become nonresponsive to glutamate [5] and are a hallmark of glial cells such as astrocytes [6]. Due to the large number of oligodendrocytes in neurons, the number of neurons can also be a precursor to glial cell death leading to death of neurons, as seen in Alzheimer's disease [7], Parkinson's disease [8], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [9]. It has been suggested that the number of neurons may influence the extent to which the brain deteriorates [6,10,11]. For example, in rats treated with a selective glutamate receptor antagonist, there was a significant drop in the number of synapses, the number of oligodendrocytes, and therefore the number of mature neurons in the cortex in the weeks following treatment. A similar trend is seen in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease [12], who have been shown to have low numbers of oligodendrocytes but are only observed to have reduced numbers of mature neurons [13], a finding that contrasts with patients with mild cognitive impairment, who are observed to have high numbers of oligodendrocytes and to have high numbers of mature neurons [14]. A recent study investigating the effects of age on the rate of neurodegeneration assessed the size of the hippocampus of 10 elderly subjects (aged 55–67; mean age 78 years) and found increased volume loss over age, particularly in the hippocampal subregions [15]. In the present study, we investigated the rate of neurodegenerative processes, specifically the density of mature neurons and the number of immature neurons in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a degener"
Question: Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Do you or someone you know: Have had: A tumor at an oncologic site [e.g., bladder, breast, prostate] [bilateral] or one that was detected at an oncologic site [bilateral]; and

Have had the radiation therapy associated with these oncologic sites? This is probably the place to consider oncological contraindications. The interstitial multicatheter radiation procedure is not a contraindication because there is no evidence that there are adverse effects. If you are aware of a potential contraindication, you can report it to the ACP with the question, ""Do you or someone you know: Have had: An oncologic site [e.g., bladder, breast, prostate] [bilateral] that has subsequently been treated to a tumor?"" In most instances, it is helpful to provide information. Also, the information will help the patient and his/her family members understand the nature of the treatment, the likelihood of adverse effects, and how to manage any reactions to the treatment.

"Question: Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" sample generalize? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" sample generalize?

Answer: Diagnostic criteria were validated in 8 of the 8 samples. Based on this evidence, we recommend that the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania"" sample be used to confirm or supplement the early-warning criteria included in the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (Team) study"", which included an extensive validation of the diagnostic criteria included in the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team) study"".

Why did the authors conduct this study?

We were inspired by the success of a previously completed study of child bipolar I disorder in a Canadian national sample and by the findings of a ""team"" study of bipolar disorder that was published by our colleagues in the Journal of Child Psychiatry and Psychiatry with the same study name as that of their preliminary study.

We were curious to find out whether a common diagnostic concept could be generalizable to more than one sample. To that end, we identified a clinical sample of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder and compared them with a similar sample of children and adolescents without bipolar disorder.

We were surprised to find that the diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder were not generally valid in different samples and that the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were less or more valid than expected in samples of the same age because of differences in the type of diagnosis.

What research questions did the researchers investigate?

The questions that were explored were as follows:

Is the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team) sample generalizable to its clinical sample?

How is the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team) sample different from the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania(team)"" and ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" samples of adult bipolar disorder?

How is the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" sample different from the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" and ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" samples of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder?

What methods do the researchers use to identify and validate the diagnostic criteria for child bipolar I disorder?

What are the goals of the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team) study?

What are the benefits and risks of conducting this study? (Discussion section.)

What is the impact of this study on the field of bipolar research?

We hope that researchers across many jurisdictions will conduct similar longitudinal studies to identify and validate diagnostic criteria for the disorder of which they are studying whether they are using the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"", ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" and ""Treatment of Early Age Mania(team)"" patient samples of adult bipolar disorder.

About the study: The ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" is a Canadian nationwide, representative sample of schoolchildren and adolescents with an adult clinical record of childhood psychiatric disorder. In this sample, researchers found that early bipolar episodes are characterized by mood episodes that recur in a pattern that is consistent with bipolar I disorder. In the clinical sample, diagnoses were made to exclude individuals with comorbid diagnoses of major depression, schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder with mania.

The ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" is a consortium study of bipolar disorder with several Canadian provinces and territories participating. The ""Treatment of Early Age Mania""(team)"" study will be conducted for approximately 3 years.

About the investigators: We reported this study as a joint work between the University of Alberta and the School of Clinical Psychology, University of Alberta. We are currently an assistant professor of clinical psychology at the University of Regina and director of the Albert Pike-Crestal Research Institute. We were supported by awards for the study from the Alberta Child and Adolescent Mental Health Foundation (2004-2006); the Mental Health Commission of Canada (2009-2010); the Canadian Alliance and Multicultural Medical Education; the Canadian Life and Health Network; the Canadian Foundation for Mental Health; a grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (NIMH) (S.W.M.), the Government of Alberta and the Saskatchewan Government.

Question: Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is the Chinese population currently being overestimated in their basal energy requirements?

Answer: The Chinese population now have a healthy body mass index of almost 23 years of age, which is considered to be normal by Western standards. It is common for a Chinese male at 30 years of age to weigh well over 250 Kg (150 lbs) in body weight. Furthermore, the Chinese, in general, do not require any exercise outside of home and are the healthiest of all Asian populations. The Chinese have a natural tendency (perhaps biological as well a cultural one) towards an extremely slow metabolism; therefore, in order to estimate their basal metabolic rate (BMR), one of the two most commonly used equation is the one that represents metabolic rate of a person in a'metabolic state', which can be calculated from metabolic rate of a person under full metabolic stress, ie. the person is not resting and no other activity was done over the last 1-2 hours.

But, there are others equations that are not based on an accurate and accurate method; and these two equations, however, can be useful in a short explanation. In reality, the basal metabolic rate, when used in conjunction with other parameters, can provide a good measure for estimating the energy requirements of the people in a population.

The calculation of BMR is done by finding an average daily metabolic rate in a community sample of 1,000 individuals, the basis for normalizing the metabolic rate. Then, using the calculated average daily metabolic rate, one is able to calculate a single daily BMR (or BMR/Kcal) for the population. The calculation of BMR is known as energy balance in China, and is usually performed as follows:

BMR = (energy balance) [body weight] - BMR

BMR = [100 kJ/kg] - BMR

where BMR is the daily metabolic rate, BMR/K is the BMR of the population that corresponds exactly to the energy needs that the Chinese currently require (ie. the population that needs to function optimally by diet, lifestyle, activity and health care), and 100 kJ/kg is equivalent to 10,000 kcal.

Note that BMR is the daily metabolic rate of the population that must use an energy-rich diet, as that food has about 100 kcal per kg (~25% of the average adult body mass) per day, which is equivalent to 1.02-1.03 MJ/day in adults. As a comparison reference, a daily intake of 1.07-1.6MJ/kg (~12% of the average adult body mass) is needed in order to have the appropriate energy expenditure (EE) in order to perform daily activities in an optimally energy efficient manner.

For example, the average daily energy intake for a Chinese population (age 18-45 years) is ~2100 kcal (~1500 kJ/day) for the year. As the figure shows, 1.02-1.03 MJ/day in this population corresponds to approximately 6800 kcal per day, corresponding to ~4.05-4.6 MJ of daily required intake for the same population. Because the daily energy cost of diet is very high, this result is valid for a large population (e.g. over half a million people, or more than 2% of the global world's population has an intake of 2-2.5 MJ per day, while 2MJ is the energy needs of all Western cultures), and is very close to the most appropriate value for a human being at their optimal physical condition. Also, the calculation of BMR/Kcal also assumes appropriate intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains throughout the day.

In order to apply a simple BMR model of Chinese adults who are over 35 years of age, one can calculate BMR/Kcal by taking the mean daily energy intake of adult individuals:

BMR = (average person's total energy intake)[(calories/day)] - BMR

The BMR can be divided into one of three components depending on age. The components of BMR that the typical Chinese have during their adult life span are summarized as follows:

BMR/cal = 4.6-7.3 + 7.3*BMR/Kcal (i.e. the BMR of the average Chinese adult over 35 years of age is 4.4-7.3 MJ/day)

BMR/kcal = 2 + 2.3*BMR/cal. (i.e. the BMR of the typical Chinese adult over 35 years of age is 2.3-5.0 MJ/day)

BMR/kg = 1.1-3.2 + 3.2*BMR/kcal.

Question: Can shape analysis differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or transient ischemic attack? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can the detection of atherosclerotic plaque in stroke or dementia with CTA improve the clinical prognosis?

Answer: It will help if the CTA is performed on a stroke patient or in a patient with a transient, ischemic brain attack. A normal CTA (which is an angiogram) performed on a healthy patient will not distinguish between atherosclerotic plaque and plaque containing free-floating clots.

If the CTA produces an abnormal finding in the arteries or brain, it will tell you whether you have a stroke or other brain problem. If there are no abnormal findings, the arteries may be healthy or may be damaged.

There is no known way to separate a stroke and a dementia.

If you have been told by your doctor that a stroke or other brain problem is in your future, seek the advice of your physician directly."

Question: Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India? Show Me The Data: A retrospective cohort study of patients with severe systemic tuberculosis and healthy controls. The controls were recruited to a clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a regimen of ceftriaxone with or without zidovudine in patients with resistant disease. The two groups were administered a combination of antibiotics for several weeks. The data were combined as part of a new study. The baseline data were not released or used for the analysis. After 1 week, 90 patients (60% of the original sample size) were enrolled, of which 28 (30% of those randomized) had already died, 8 (11%) received a high dose of ceftriaxone, and the final 10 (15%) received zidovudine. The three-week study was extended to a continuous study after patients showed no improvement. Mean disease progression was 3.7 (95% CI: 1.4, 11.8 months) and patient-reported disease severity was 3.9 (95% CI: 1.5, 12.4) compared with 1.7 (1.4, 1.9) for the controls (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.4-0.9). The trial was stopped before 90% of patients completed the study and the final trial period ended a year later compared with a median of 2.3 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.1 to 3.7) in the original cohort after a mean of 6.5 (16.8-27.5) months in the controls (HR = 1.8, 95% CI: 0.86-3.3). The authors suggested that ""the prolonged duration of treatment with ceftriaxone [with or without zidovudine] during our study may potentially improve clinical outcomes and reduce mortality in this population"" (p. 1168). The authors concluded that ""possible benefit from such therapies should not be overlooked.""

The use of antibiotics in tuberculosis patients is usually accompanied by complications. The complications can include the following:

Lethal infections

Fungal illnesses

Surgical complications and infections associated with surgical procedures

Drug interactions

Risk of antibiotic resistance

Prolonged therapy with antibiotics can cause significant morbidity and mortality (1, 2). Many patients who are critically ill with tuberculosis remain on antibiotics (1, 3).

Surgical complications associated with tuberculosis are the most common complications in large U.S. hospitals, accounting for 2-3% of all hospital-acquired infections (2). According to a 2014 report, surgical complications were responsible for 5-8% of tuberculosis deaths in the United States. According to the CDC's Surveillance Summary on Antimicrobial Resistance, a total of 730 hospital-acquired infections of strains that have increased antibiotic resistance were reported in 2014, accounting for 2-3% of tuberculosis infection deaths worldwide (1, 1).

Prolonged exposure to infection with strains resistant to antimicrobial agents poses a risk to tuberculosis patients. The potential for long-term adverse effects associated with long-term antibiotic therapy has been well documented in previous studies of hospital-acquired antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis in patients who received no long-term, high-dose therapy (6, 7).

A retrospective cohort study found that patients hospitalized for tuberculosis with an advanced stage of clinical disease who were treated with ceftriaxone or zidovudine experienced an eightfold increased mortality compared with those who received no therapy (8). This could be due, at least in part, to an increase in the risk of malignancy. To date, only one prospective randomized study has suggested a decrease in the level and progression of pneumonia and urinary tract infections associated with the use of antimicrobial therapy in patients with advanced tuberculosis, with a relative risk of 0.7 (95% CI: 0.67-0.97) when compared with those prescribed no antimicrobial therapy (9). A retrospective assessment of the clinical effectiveness of ceftriaxone (with or without zidovudine) versus zidovudine (with or without ceftriaxone) was conducted in patients who were transferred from a tertiary care center to the tuberculosis unit (10).

The most frequently reported infections in patients who receive high doses of ceftriaxone (with or without zidovudine) in clinical trials are tracheal and pulmonary tract infections, often due to exposure to organisms such as Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRS). Studies have reported increased mortality and significant morbidity, such as upper respiratory tract,"
Question: Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a predicted of different histological subtypes possible?

Introduction Many prostate cancer cells grow on the parotid gland of the prostate. These prostate adenocarcinoma (PC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and carcinoma of the prostate (COPD) cells are typically benign by histological standards and can survive long in the prostate adenocarcinoma (PC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patient until they accumulate tumors that are resistant to surgery.1–5 If the tumors do develop to the stage of ""diffuse large multifocal adenocarcinomas"", this patient can undergo prostatectomy with a very large and aggressive prostatectomy. When these tumors can withstand the large surgical incision and penetrating radiation of the prostatectomy, they can progress to distant metastases.1, 6–8 Because of high survival rates, patients undergoing a large prostatectomy can receive high-technology treatments.1 However, a majority of cancers in the prostate develop in the parotid gland, often in a localized location.1 The parotid gland is an ependymal gland that develops on the prostate and is the site of proliferation and survival of prostate cancer.11–13 Because of its location, the parotid gland is an excellent location to study prostate cancer growth in the context of the prostate, the male reproductive tract, and the endometrium.1, 14–16 This study was specifically designed to determine whether an improved prediction of the ""different histologic subtypes"" of primary parotid gland tumors could be achieved by Diffusion-weighted inversion recovery MR imaging (DART-I). The study will evaluate potential predictors for different groups of parotid gland tumors. The DART-I protocol is used for detecting prostate cancer with high precision and specificity and is the only standard MR imaging technique currently permitted by the International Conference on Functional MR Imaging Research. The DART-I has a 2D high-resolution image of the parotid gland that can reconstruct the entire parotid gland including the luminal region as well as the glans. Because prostate cancers are characterized by a wide distribution of density within a narrow region of the parotid gland, the study will evaluate how differences in the DART-I results could contribute to the predictive ability of the Diffusion-weighted inversion recovery (DART-I) imaging. In this study, a patient with normal histologic and imaging parameters is selected for the study to assess how much of the predictive power of the Diffusion-weighted inversion recovery (DART-I) technique is dependent on age and the patient's genotype. To determine whether we can predict the histologic subtypes of parotid gland tumors by the Diffusion-weighted inversion recovery (DART-I) method, all patients were recruited from the database of the Comprehensive Urology Group, Inc (http://www.cuny.ucsf.edu/). The following information was taken from the database of Comprehensive Urology Group, Inc as well as from the article ""Prostate Cancer-Specific Parameters in Aging: Age, Sex, and Pronorchoplastes"", published in December 2003 and currently the most complete and comprehensive meta-analysis of age-related PSA parameters published by the Cancer Genome System. The following PSA parameters were analyzed as subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors: 1) Urine Urinary BUN; 2) Urinary Glucose; 3) Urinary Cholesterol; 4) Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels; 5) Prostate Specific Antigen-1 (PSA-1) levels; 6) Prostate Specific Antigen-2 (PSA-2) levels; 7) Prostate Specific Antigen-3 (PSA-3) levels; 8) Hyperemia, and 9) C-reactive protein in serum. Primary and secondary parotid gland tumors were distinguished based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and by the number of tumors included. The primary parotid gland was regarded as ""prostate adenocarcinoma"" if: i) > 4 metastases were seen; iii) all metastases were of at least 5 years and from at least 50–75% contained Gleason score 0 (GLeC/GLeq) tumors, and v) at least 50% of the original tumor grade was grade 1. Secondary parotid gland tumors were regarded as ""prostate adenocarcinoma"" if: i) < 4 metastases were seen; iii) ALL metastases were of 4 years and more"
Question: Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis?

Answer: This research is ongoing with several groups investigating what happens in the brain at the end that determines how long people are able to stay on his machine [11],[12], and this is a very exciting area of research, as it has a potentially big impact on the treatment of many conditions. The potential of therapeutic approaches based on pharmacological endothelin enhancement is very exciting and we should all look forward to the results of this work over the coming year.

Question: What is the mechanism of effects of long-term endothelin inhibition? It has been proven that long-term, long-term endothelin inhibition can decrease blood clot levels in blood products [13],[14]. What are the potential consequences of long-term endothelin inhibition?

Answer: Although the mechanism has not yet been fully delineated, most have associated it with the ability to block the growth of platelets and thereby decrease the risk for thrombotic events [15]. There is, however, not sufficient evidence to date that a long-term reduction in blood clot levels in blood products (such as platelet products) actually leads to a statistically significant improvement in clinical hemodynamic and functional outcomes [4].

Question: How long do you need to go on this? What do you think is the most appropriate timing (months, years?) to start these protocols to ensure maximal long-term success? Please provide details on the current implementation of this therapy in your field. What are the current issues relating to research funding in a field requiring this kind of treatment?

Answer: The results from this study represent a small start-up program for a very exciting new and promising treatment approach which we expect to increase in popularity as we can now offer a new treatment option in both acute and chronic hemodynamic management. We believe that clinical development of this protocol as well as the implementation of this technology in many other hemodynamic conditions will be essential to advancing the therapeutic options for many patients who currently do not receive any viable treatment option. We are currently engaged in a long-term Phase 2 trial in the United Kingdom to design a large cohort study which will investigate the effect of continuous endothelin inhibitor (EI) therapy for a large cohort of patients with a range of different conditions.

About the Study

The study involved 678 patients ranging in age from 18-65 years who were undergoing endoscopically-guided or endogenously controlled hemodynamic therapy for acute and chronic conditions. Patients also underwent cardiac catheterization (coronary stent placement, angiogram evaluation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on the day of treatment to exclude those experiencing severe hypotension (a history of stroke or pulmonary embolism), hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease, and any other factors that might cause hypotension. In addition, the patients provided a baseline blood pressure assessment at the clinical site 3 days prior to trial entry as well as a cardiac stress test 1 week before and on day of hospitalization to exclude any known cardiac events, and a venous oxygen saturation measurement on hospital admission at the day of trial entry.

The clinical design of the study was as follows: After a pre-treatment baseline baseline interview, participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single (n=50) or two-hour (n=130) infusion of a single daily dose of the investigational drug endothelin (3 mg/day) or placebo (n=50). A standard course of therapy (maintenance treatment) was followed by 3 days of endothelin and 4 days of a placebo infusion. During follow-up interviews, blood pressure was estimated at baseline and over the 5 days of the treatment period. Biochemical measures of hemodynamic and functional outcomes were assessed on a daily basis during follow-up interviews and daily vital signs and hemodynamic measures while in the hospital.

Data Analysis

All data from this study were analyzed centrally using SPSS version 17.0, GraphPad Prism version 6.8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA to assess statistical significance); and as follows:

Sample size: The sample size was set at 678 patients and in consideration of the high statistical power and positive predictors of outcome that we were including in the primary analysis.

Primary findings: Hemodynamic and functional outcomes are reported in Table 1. We report the primary outcomes for each group separately.

Question: PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," PSA frequently fluctuates, but no biopsy is needed.

A: There is no scientific evidence to support the statement.

I could find a published study on the topic, though. The author of that paper, Dr. Jerald D. Johnson of the University of Houston, says that a large number of patients do experience spikes, even at low levels, after a PSA test because of a biochemical reaction called anaphase II. That reaction occurs when a chemical in the blood called EPO binds with a protein that normally carries oxygen.

But in other cases, a spike in PSA can be the result of simply a small increase in estrogen, which is released in response to a pregnancy test and can cause a small increase in PSA itself.

""It would be extremely unlikely to be caused by any single drug,"" says Johnson.

So if you do not see a spike in your PSA – it probably isn't caused by an old needle, or a recent mammogram, since estrogen levels are so low – then there are a few possibilities.

First, it could be time for an intervention to increase your estrogen, or to lower your estrogen level. Second, it could be a reaction to a particular substance that is produced during pregnancy. The third, and more troubling scenario, is that PSA simply happens to fluctuate randomly – that is, it is caused by either an unusual concentration, or by a chemical reaction that happens at high levels to some people.

If you did see a spike in PSA, Johnson says the primary treatment could take the form of estrogen.

""A dose of estrogen plus progestin, for example, could be used in conjunction with a screening test like the hysteroscopy,"" he says.

""So the more you know about the risk factors, and your chance of getting a disease, the better plan you should have with your doctor.""

You, or your physician, can work with a provider like Dr. D'Angelo at University Hospitals Medical Center in Orlando to discuss appropriate treatment. Otherwise, you'll want to consult your family physician if you or your pregnancy partner are worried about getting your PSA tested. He or she can help you make the most of the opportunity that may present itself to look for an underlying hormonal imbalance."

"Question: Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits?

Answer: Gastric electrical stimulation is the current technology of choice for the treatment of acute and chronic GERD. However, as with other treatments, as an effective treatment it can be used in a multitude of settings depending on the patient's individual characteristics, medical history, and the type of treatment being used. Since it is not known if gastric electrical stimulation is a useful long-term treatment option, it is appropriate for use as a first point of treatment for those who are already symptom free and have had gastric procedures such as gastric bypass.

There are a limited number of studies using gastric electrical stimulation that have been reviewed in earlier articles (1, 2, 3). However, few studies have examined the use of this method in the setting of GERD. Although we hope that these earlier reviews will be helpful to present the current state of the science in this area.

The purpose of this article is to provide the scientific basis for the benefits and complications of using gastric electrical stimulation. Studies comparing the use of gastric electrical stimulation with standard pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of GERD will be critically reviewed with key details of the study objectives, study design, patients with GERD studied as a control, and the study conclusions. The benefits and complications associated with gastric electrical stimulation will then be presented with additional references to the literature. The method of treatment will be discussed with specific reference to the evidence that is available.

Methods

Study designs and patients

In this study, we included studies that included patients with chronic GERD and at least one of the following: (i) GERD, (ii) gastroplasty, (iii) endoscopic intervention for symptomatic treatment of GERD or (iv) endoscopic treatment using a lumpectomy, endoscopic procedures leading to symptomatic recovery or treatment for treatment-resistant GERD. We also included studies that included at least one of the following: (i) women (women with GI symptoms) and (ii) men. The following subgroups were defined for our study: (i) inpatients with chronic gastrointestinal conditions (i.e., acute, long-term, or mixed conditions, including a history of GERD), (ii) patients undergoing a procedure for GI surgery under diagnostic conditions (i.e., gastric bypass) (2, 4, 5), (iii) patients undergoing an endoscopic procedure following surgery for gastrointestinal surgery (i.e., an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, cholecystectomy, colorectal carcinoma screening [PCS], endoscopic removal of colon or rectum, or an endoscopic esophagogastroduodenoscopy that results in recovery of both (6, 7), or (iv) patients undergoing endoscopic esophagogastroduodenoscopic surgery (i.e., EES) that results in a symptom free or symptom improved survival rate (7, 8).

All studies were reviewed independently by two or more authors (Peters and Zawislak, unpublished data). The studies were also critically reviewed by three authors from a large database of published articles. Studies were not excluded because of the size of the study, the nature of the study, or the authorship of some of the authors. A consensus was reached concerning the characteristics of data sets to be analyzed and a review was completed to obtain a detailed description of the data and how information was obtained.

Study findings

There are no studies that have evaluated the comparative effectiveness of gastric electrical stimulation with standard pharmacologic therapy and that document the effects on GI outcome. Many people have reported adverse effects from the use of gastric electrical stimulation. The number of reported adverse events is not known. However, for this article, adverse events were considered to be serious to cause harm and included gastrointestinal symptoms and death, GI complications, severe complications (dengue, gastroenteritis, intestinal blockage, haemolytic anaemia, hepatitis, septicemia, perforation, and perforation without need for resuscitation), and GI dysfunction and disease(9-14). Reported adverse events were included in each study as long as they were consistent with the definitions provided in the relevant studies. The definition of serious GI or GI complication was used to indicate serious adverse events that resulted in the need for intensive care (i.e., perforation requiring ventilation or hospitalization). A critical review of the literature was performed to assess the frequency of reported adverse events in the prior review(2) and to assess whether there have been any recent significant changes in the definition(2). These changes have included fewer non-serious adverse events, or new and significant"
Question: Should pulp chamber pulpotomy be seen as a permanent treatment? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should pulp chamber pulpotomy be seen as a permanent treatment? Answer: No. The practice of pulpotomy has become commonplace and as a result many are reluctant to do this in the future due to the risk to the patient. This is of concern because both the physical and psychological problems that could be resulting from pulpotomies are unknown although a study conducted at Yale University showed that many have had a significantly worse experience with this procedure (28).

Pulpotomy as a treatment for the prevention of scarring of the skin. As mentioned earlier, there is a group referred to as ""pulp children."" These young male patients are often very young individuals who were born with a scar in the cheek or cheekbone area. While this scar is not painful, it may be a reminder of more recent events. One theory proposed is that pulp children are being treated because of their ability to withstand pain. This makes the possibility of having such a scar difficult or impossible, if not impossible, to remove with traditional treatments. In other words, the practice of pulpotomy may have the potential to develop in such a way that it would have even a stronger potential to cause suffering to these individuals during the final stages (4).

Surgical treatments for scarring as a procedure that may require scar occlusion and scar occlusion and reduction (SCOR) (4). These treatments have seen a notable increase due to the practice of pulpotomy. It is suggested that these treatments may need to increase greatly in the future and to have a greater risk of causing scarring for these young individuals. As stated previously, this practice is thought to be causing the growth of scar tissue, which may then lead to scarring of the skin. This will have a larger impact on the patients' ability to function normally and to experience the positive side of life, which could be the main reason to engage the procedure (5).

Question: Are we seeing the effects of public awareness campaigns? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," ""Are public awareness campaigns effective in changing public attitudes and behaviors?""

Results/Conclusions:

We found that public messages containing a narrative framing technique are more effective than other messages. The narrative framing technique was especially effective in terms of influencing public opinion on the importance of the issues facing our team. The narratives focused on the positive aspects of our team and emphasized how they had helped to reduce the number of road accidents by reducing road rage, which in Turnigy's opinion had been caused and contributed to by the high speed of our car, leading to a fatality. They also emphasized the team's dedication to road safety efforts and how they intended to continue to pursue those activities as the team continued to work for the safety of everyone on our roadways.

Conclusions:

These narratives succeeded in influencing public opinion. This is good news for the team because road safety is no longer a personal issue but an issue that can be handled by everyone in the car organization. In addition, the narratives helped reduce driver hostility toward the team. In turn, this resulted in lower fatality rates.

Appendix

Our Approach

1. We developed an original algorithm to search through our available information for evidence of impactful road safety campaigns. We then analyzed this initial data to identify the level of support from the wider public for various campaigns. Our method is based on five principles:

The goal is to identify meaningful impactful campaign outcomes. In the majority of cases, this means that the campaign has the potential to improve public opinion on an issue. It may only have a small impact on personal injury accidents, however, we want to be the first to detect and detect the possible effect of the campaign. The goal is to create a clear understanding of the level of public support for the campaign based on the outcome to date. The goal is to identify the campaigns and their levels of support.

2. To discover where the campaigns were successful and failed in terms of achieving that goal, we utilized our data set to identify the effectiveness for each campaign and developed a quantitative model to track the levels of public support relative to each campaign at multiple points in time. The model included the primary driver and secondary driver causes, the levels of attention for the campaigns, the number of ads each ad received for the primary driver cause (ROS and RST), the levels of attention for the campaigns for an alternate cause (CRASH), and the level of awareness for each campaign.

3. We then conducted follow‐up interviews to identify the drivers and secondary drivers involved in the crashes with the highest levels of attention. We included drivers (either the primary or secondary driver) who were the primary, secondary, or alternate driver in the vehicle during the crash. Our focus was on ""the primary driver"" and we used a ""high level of attention"" metric to account for the fact that many crashes involve multiple drivers. We found that the primary driver was the drivers who had the greatest level of attention to these accidents.

4. We then combined these driver metrics into a ranking system to determine the order in which the campaigns were effective at increasing the levels of attention for various causes. We found many instances where campaign success was not immediately evident due to an inability to detect the first successful campaign. As we progressed through the cycle through which we found our campaign successful, we identified one campaign that was able to increase high level of attention levels among the secondary drivers in a very small number of cases. The campaign had a very aggressive narrative framing technique for telling the story.

5. Based on these campaigns, we created a database to catalog the effectiveness of the campaigns. Using the database we created, we performed a statistical analysis of the effectiveness of the campaigns for each driver and level of attention. We created a list of top campaigns that achieved the most effective levels of attention and then ranked each campaign based on the impact on each driver and level, taking into account the primary or secondary driver, the level of attention, and the number of ads they received. The average level of attention was calculated to provide an indication of the effectiveness of each campaign given the various conditions and levels encountered during the crash. We calculated the average level of attention for each of these campaigns based on the campaign's effectiveness at achieving the highest level of attention for each of the three types of drivers (primary/secondary, alternate, and high level of attention).

6. We then identified and used a new strategy to reduce the importance of the primary driver in order to reduce the level of attention for the secondary drivers, with the objective of increasing the level of attention for the other secondary drivers. We used the same narrative framing technique with an emphasis on high level of attention.

7. Our analysis revealed that campaigns that directly stated the causes of crashes are effective. This is true at a variety of levels. For instance, in the event of RST, and for the secondary drivers"
Question: Is breast cancer prognosis inherited? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is breast cancer prognosis inherited? *

Answer: A very interesting question about the cause of breast cancer and gene therapy. Is it indeed, is it inherited, is it heritable? And what is the exact nature of that genetic predisposition? We will probably never know for sure but all signs point to it being genetic in origin. One would expect a more powerful effect on a patient who is genetically identical to the cancer donor. Unfortunately this is the nature of gene therapy. In principle the same disease should be a genetically identical patient with a different risk score. This means that if you know that there is a genetic predisposition the outcome should be predictable. However, in practice there is very much variability about the outcome of specific cases. In addition there is very often confusion about the nature of the genetic risk, for example if there is a very high chance of any outcome but the patient is very much at risk, then it is not possible to give a high probability of treatment, since we do not know what the true risk is. This may have something to do with the fact that the outcome has to be a single case and has to be evaluated on the merits of the individual case."
Question: Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy?

Answer: Nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester does not independently predict a woman's risk for developing GDM in the following months among non-Hispanic black women in the United States.

Methodological Note: We sought this population-specific risk for developing gestational diabetes (GDM) using a large database of pre- and postnatal birth records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This study is not representative of the US general population (i.e., non-Hispanic black women), although this particular population provides a unique and challenging opportunity to study the development of GDM during the first three years of life.

Results: Our study included data from 12,900 non-Hispanic black women aged 19 to 33 at the time of their first prenatal visit between 1999 and 2010. We excluded 3,770 women who had gestational diabetes (defined as the presence of gestational diabetes or preeclampsia) at the time of their first prenatal visit, making 16,800 subjects eligible. The mean (SD) total nuchal translucency thickness (TFI) at the anterior transverse process at the first trimester predicted an increasing risk of developing gestational diabetes from 6.0 (0.8) cm−2 (interquartile range [IQR]) through 32.7 (6.0) cm−2 (26.9) cm−2 (32.0) cm−2 over a seven-year period (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.20–37.15 cm). There were significant relationships observed between TFI and the presence of gestational diabetes at the time of her first visit (P < 0.05); there were also significant relationships observed between TFI, gestation week, and gestational diabetes (P < 0.01).

Conclusion: Results from the current study provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester, gestational diabetes and gestation week.

Question: Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype?

Answer: Yes.


Keywords: An experimental investigation of the relationship between the anaphase region of the neuropeptide neuropeptide 1 (NP_1) gene, the dopamine D1 receptor subunit β-endorphin receptor (D3R) gene, and the anaphase region of the microsatellite region of the vasopressin 1 gene, the arginine vasopressin (ARG) V1a receptor (V1) gene and the microsatellite region of the vasopressin 1 gene (V1a) gene in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar history that has been linked with sexual preference development. Journal of clinical imaging and genetics, 10(12), 1746-1754.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence to suggest that polymorphisms in the NP_1 gene and the D3R gene may contribute to the pathophysiology of borderline personality disorders in men. A preliminary investigation has found the D3R gene to be associated with hypersexuality in a sample of adult human males. To further investigate the link between the D3R gene and hypersexuality, the D3R gene transcript variant, ARG V1a gene type, and the microsatellite region of the vasopressin 1 gene showed that the D3R gene is associated with a hypersexual personality phenotype. ARG V1a gene type is the most strongly associated gene with hypersexuality in the human population and has been related to male impulsivity, homosexuality, depression, and gambling. ARG V1a gene type has also been implicated in the etiology of gender identity disorders. ARG V1a gene group and ARG V1a gene type have been implicated in the etiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Thus, the findings reported here suggest that the polymorphisms responsible for the hypersexuality phenotype may represent a novel risk factor for borderline personality disorder. More research is needed on the etiology of hypersexuality after a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this polymorphism.


Keywords: Arginine vasopressin gene V1a gene, dopamine D1 receptor gene, vasopressin gene, microsatellite region of V1, P450 enzyme, genetic variant, Arginine vasopressin gene polymorphism

Answer: Yes


Keywords: Early, prepubertal, and early adolescence

Answer: Yes


Keywords: Bipolar disorder (BD), prepubertal and early adolescence, pre-menstrual dysphoria

Answer: Yes


Answer: Yes, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the ARG gene's V1a gene type may lead to changes in body image and sexual preference to an attraction to younger, more feminine bodies.


Answer: Yes, the results of this study suggest that ARG V1a gene expression is in step with that of males that are hypersexual and appear to be sexually aroused during exposure to females' pubic hair, whereas ARG V1b gene expression seems to be in step of those that are hypersexual and are not sexually aroused (suggesting to most women that these two lines of evidence are consistent).

Question: Is arch form influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Please explain why your answer is different from what is indicated in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Answer: SAGITTAL MOLA

The sagittal molar is formed at the back, behind the teeth which were in a rosy, soft appearance while the crown was less rosy, although it did not appear more sunken than it does in a classic mid-sagittal view. In older subjects, for example, where the crown is rosy and the tooth is more sunken, this pattern can be observed. In other examples, where the crown becomes more sunken, this pattern can also be observed. The sagittal molar forms with each tooth about 1/10 the distance to the crown. It forms on the teeth in front and to the sides of the tooth in front of it. Thus:

The first tooth is in the anterior (front) axis and the tooth immediately behind it is in the posterior (sagittal) axis.

The sagittal molar (the front tooth) is formed in the anterior half of the mouth about 0.3 mm from the posterior edge of the molar that forms the tooth in the front.

The sagittal molar (the behind tooth) is formed in the posterior half of the mouth about 0.3 mm from the anterior edge of the molar that forms the tooth in the back.

The sagittal molar forms at the back of the mouth about 0.5 mm from the posterior edge of the molar on each side for a total width of 0.5 mm at the back of the mouth.

The sagittal molar forms to the sides, to the front and to the back, about 1/10 as wide as the widest of the two teeth.

The sagittal molar is formed with each tooth about 1/10 the distance to the crown, or 2/10 the distance to the opposite teeth.

As with the interdental molar, the sagittal molar is considered a ""nontraditional"" molar because it is formed independently of other teeth.

Although it was once believed that the sagittal molar formed with the crown at the back, this is not to explain how it can form independently of the other dental molars. The sagittal molar forms just behind the molars with the crown and not at the back. As you can imagine, you will also have to answer what happens to the molars when the sagittal molar (the front tooth) forms alone. The sagittal molar is formed through the process of metamorphosis. The molars in the front and behind have already undergone this process of formation.

The molar form on an old tooth showing the teeth above it: This is the front tooth, the second (bottom-most) tooth in the above photograph is the in front tooth, the root above that is on the next tooth in the above photograph is the crown. Figure 2. The molar form on a fresh tooth showing the teeth above it: In this picture the first (bottom-most) tooth is the front tooth, the second (bottom-most) tooth is in front a new tooth at the side is the crown, the next (bottom-most) tooth is the behind tooth, the root is beside the bottom tooth on the next tooth in the following photograph is the same as the root in the illustration above. Figure 3. The molar form on a fresh tooth showing the teeth above it: This is an example of cross-molarity. In this example the front tooth (the crown) is at the bottom and the behind tooth (the root) is at the top along the right lateral line. You will have to explain how cross-molarity can occur. These are the results of the above steps: 1. The molar forms at its apex on the tooth with the crown in front and on the opposite side of the behind tooth on the next tooth in the following photo. 2. In addition to the molar forming directly under the crown, the molar can also become displaced by the tooth below. When they form the same position and size, the front and behind teeth are now closer together on the top side of the molar. 3. The molar forms at the apex of"

Q. How do I know if a knife did conize or not?

A. All one need to do is cut the wrist (if done correctly) and open the case to the neck, and the knife will appear to be stuck because the blood has not seeped into.

Q. I opened a knife at home?

A. This is different thing, where is the bleeding, or not?

Q. I don't know how to open cases? How about in a lab?

A. I have heard this is the only safe way. (See the related Question on LEEP)

Q. I just saw an article on LEEP? How did that article explain my experience?

A. The article was published online. I did not buy the articles, I just read online what was provided. If you're still using a cold knife and the knife had ""conized"" or not, you can try this:

Place the knife under the skin of the index and middle forefinger and open the case with one of your thumb and forefinger.

This will make sure that there are no red or bleeding points.

Next, if you used a ""cold knife"" and it did not appear dead, then you could try that method again.

I suggest that you take the time to read the article. I cannot emphasize this enough. When I wrote questions for my science paper, i wanted to find something out that would help the reader with their own experience. Reading about these methods is very helpful, as it makes it clear that it is not a guaranteed method, as the method could be incorrect. I was a little disappointed that they did not provide clear descriptions about the different methods that were shown. Hopefully, this article will help to further educate in the realm of ""how to open a knife properly?""

Question: Updating emotional content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How do we update our emotional content in working memory? Do we need to focus on that part of the brain, or should we be focused on other areas?

Baker B, Brown R, Belsky V.

INTRODUCTION: Working memory (WM) is commonly referred to as the mental inventory. It is a set of long-term storage structures located in regions involved in processing and storing information and in attention/control. Working memory functions help the brain store and access information from a variety of sources and is thought to play a role in several domains, such as information processing, planning, memory, and memory retrieval, including delayed recall (DDR) for items and verbal recall for words. In clinical settings, working memory can be utilized to aid in completing a complex task. For the purposes of working memory research in depression and PTSD, working memory is often considered to be the core of these disorders. However, the question of how working memory is associated with depression and PTSD and what role it plays in these disorders has not been addressed. To address this issue and to determine if there is an established role for working memory in PTSD, we will be exploring the role of WM in working memory.

METHODS:

The study aims to assess the effects of working memory training on PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression, and symptom profile on working memory in PTSD. Using a randomized and double-blind design, subjects will engage in either a 12-week training course or the training portion of either a 4-week cognitive behavioral therapy or a treatment-as-usual trial. Prior studies of working memory-related effects of working memory training have shown that working memory training could significantly reduce activation in the ventral striatum, a brain region associated with depression (Wagner-Nolle CS). However, to determine if there is an association with depression and PTSD, we will assess WM while using a task in which participants must search for and match words in a short-term memory test (Friston & Pinto-D'Alberto D).

RESULTS:

We found evidence from training studies that the working memory-related effect of working memory training in patients with PTSD is not moderated by individual differences in baseline working memory load. The training-related effects of task complexity did not seem to be influenced by individuals' baseline working memory load. These working memory effects were found to be most pronounced in subjects with low baseline working memory load. There was also a dose-dependent relationship between baseline working memory load and the training-related effects of task complexity.

LIMITATIONS:

The limited number of participants is a limitation of this research. Therefore, the study cannot address the efficacy of working memory training on general symptoms of depression or PTSD. Furthermore, this study does not address the effect of working memory training on a more specific type of PTSD, one that involves working memory impairment. This effect could be due to an inability of the participants to effectively engage in working memory training due to fatigue, sleep deprivation, or other limitations, which are common during work shifts. These training-related effects in individuals who have trouble engaging in working memory training could make it difficult to adequately capture the effects of working memory training on symptoms of depression and PTSD when using a work-stressed or work-restructured condition during the study.

CONCLUSION:

For several reasons, working memory is considered as a core structure in the brain. It is thought to be critical for maintaining cognitive functioning during normal daily life (Brown et al, 2001). Although there are few studies looking at the effects of working memory training on symptoms of depression and PTSD in this population, the lack of any studies examining working memory-related tasks may lead to biased interpretations of findings."
Question: Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein cannulation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein cannulation? Please add your answer to this question.

Answer:

Your question asks whether or not intramuscular needle thoracoscopy is used in addition to surgical intrathecal puncturing of the jugular vein. Answering the question in this way requires careful consideration of the details of the procedure as well as the nature and type of the puncturing procedure.

A. Using Intramuscular Incisions as Replacement for Intramuscular Parenteral Incisions

The immediate results of the bypassing and suturing of the intrathecal jugular vein to the femoral artery are similar, including:

The jugular vein is not at the level of the blood vessel supplying the leg;

The blood supply from the abdominal aorta to the femoral artery from the femoral neck is a small blood supply (under 10 ml/kg);

The intraarterial volume has been replaced with more volume from the femoral neck and a longer intramuscular venous flow velocity will be achieved; and

A lower intraarterial pressure in the femoral neck may aid venous return from the ventricle to the femoral artery.

B. Using Intramuscular Incisions as Replacement for Intramuscular Parenteral Incisions

In the routine intramuscular puncture, no additional venous system is required. A few minutes after the intrathecal puncture is performed to remove any foreign bodies or other obstructions from the vein, the arterial blood flow is sufficient for blood to return from the femoral artery to the femoral artery. In the routine, intramuscular puncture does not use the intrathecal puncturing apparatus. Intraarticular vein cannulation is most often performed manually with a long thin needle, or externally by a tourniquet placed directly over the femoral artery (with appropriate technique).

The venous return from the knee may be assisted by one or more venous catheters (in one or both thigh venous catheter systems) placed to provide an external supply for reoxygenation. The venous return from the knee may not be aided by direct venous catheter placement in the femoral vein without using one of the arterial catheter systems, and is therefore not a replacement for intraarterial vein cannulation.

In conclusion, intramuscular puncturing of the femoral neck is a new procedure and the use of intramuscular techniques in addition to the use of intramuscular techniques is new technology or may need to be modified or replaced in older techniques. Intraarterial vein cannulation is a common procedure in the community but may not be necessary by surgeons with extensive familiarity with the anatomy of the femoral neck.

Question: Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? Answer: No. Because a prostate specific antigen that is higher than normal in older men may not be predictive of prostate cancer in younger men. However, a higher-than-normal prostate specific antigen may actually be protective against prostate cancer. In fact, a number of studies have suggested that a prostate specific antigen should be ""adjusted"" for body mass index. The rationale for this approach is that higher-than-normal prostate specific titers in older men are not likely to be a true proxy for prostate cancer risk in young men. Some studies also suggest that serum prostate specific antigen levels in young men may not be a reliable indicator of serum levels in older men, because serum serones of young men are also influenced by other factors that have not yet been fully elucidated. Nevertheless, a recommendation for adjusting prostate-specific antigen for body mass index is an appropriate way to reduce false-positive results in elderly patients who may have a prostate cancer biopsy showing only low-seropositive cells.

Question: Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness?

Objective: To answer this question, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of obstructive sleep apnea on aerobic fitness and VO2 max in healthy women.

Design: A systematic review and cross‐tabulations of studies that assessed the effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on aerobic fitness and VO2 max were performed. Studies examining the effect of OSA on aerobic fitness from the relevant literature were included in the review.

Setting: Eight systematic reviews and four meta‐analyses were identified. Studies were identified either from search and the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy of Asthma and Allergies (MCD) index, PubMed (a general text search), English language search, or directly from the study authors on an expert knowledge assessment. One investigator independently searched for relevant studies.

Participants: Sixteen studies (n = 45) involved 535 adults with obstructive sleep apnea for a total of 49 828 persons with asthma, and 849 healthy control subjects.

Measures: Aerobic fitness and VO2 Max were assessed by a physical activity questionnaire and aerobic fitness and VO2 Max were estimated by dual energy x‐ray absorptiometry.

Results: Results for each aerobic fitness and VO2 max factor were mixed. The correlation between VO2 Max and aerobic fitness was 0.82. OSA was not associated with an increase in fitness and VO2 Max. In the same group of studies, there was little to no relation between OSA and aerobic fitness or VO2 Max. Further, OSA was correlated significantly with lower values of aerobic fitness. A moderate increase in aerobic fitness or VO2 max with OSA was associated with improved survival at 7 years in all of the studies included. This relation persisted when adjusting for age, smoking, high baseline respiratory sinus disease, heart attack, and diabetes.

Conclusion: OSA is not associated with lower fitness or VO2 Max in healthy women."
Question: The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," If metformin treatment decreased plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe, as suggested above by the study by Schuwer et al., what happened to the plasma concentrations after the treatment had stopped? If the effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of melatonin on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe was present, it would not be surprising if the effect disappeared when the treatment was stopped. In that case, melatonin would remain a circulating factor of the circadian system and would not be thought to be the independent melatonin metabolite. A study by Volek et al. (14) found no melatonin accumulation at 2 h after the treatment had stopped, even after the treatment had been stopped for 48 h, so this hypothesis looks unlikely. Studies do not seem to support the idea that a low-dose melanic acid-treated ewe would have normal plasma melatonin concentrations because only one study, on a goat, had a low dose and melatonin concentration of 6 mg/kg (16) or 10–13,000 pg/mL, respectively. Studies on rabbits, on both the ewe and rat, have shown that melatonin metabolites are readily absorbed via intestinal enterocytes. One study (2,21) showed that the levels of plasma melatonin and their metabolites increased in the rabbit after i.v. infusion with an AMP-activated protein kinase activator rather than melatonin itself. When the levels of melatonin and their metabolites were measured in rat brain tissue 5 and 8 h after the treatment, melatonin was present in higher levels than in the rat plasma immediately after the treatment.

Question: Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is there evidence of an important gendered difference in the response of the genitalia and associated structures after injury, in particular hemorrhagic shock?

Answer: For both hemorrhagic shock and male-to-female transgender, a larger and denser female brain is found after injury than male brain [42]. The female brain is more complex with bigger and dense neurons than male brain [38,40]. Because of the smaller size of female brain after injury, the female brain is not homogeneous and different parts tend to form two or more brains [36-38]. The more complex of the two brains shows male-typical structure and gender dimorphism for both male and female [37,38]. Furthermore, it is known that transsexual individuals are less masculinized, with less brain area differences between these boys and girls, indicating the involvement of female hormones rather than male hormones in the male-to-female transsexuality [36]. Therefore, it follows that it is not the anatomical gender of the individual that correlates with brain gender and sex hormone levels, but rather the gender dimorphism after injury.


Q. How much do brain and heart size differences determine an individual's sex? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How much does volume difference in humans between the sexes affect an individual's sex?


Answer: Volumetric size is defined as the size of a brain minus thickness of its neurons. Volumetry in terms of neuron vs. brain size is not a direct measure of sex. Volumetric size measures the size of a brain in relation to a given mass - in other words, how big or how small a brain is compared to a given mass. In this regard, it is called volume as opposed to volume measurement, thus the two are not directly equivalent. Volumetry depends on the use of volume measurement methods [38]. For example, if a volume is measured in a particular unit of volume for a given brain, the same mass can have the same volume as the brain's diameter in terms of volume measurement. However, the thickness of the brain depends on volume measurement methods, thus the exact volume measurements have important differential effects on sex development [38,39,40]. Volumetric size measures the size of the brain in relation to a given mass of tissue in the form of volume measurement units/micro-channels of length/ width/ height. Because of this, volume measurement methods are based on volumes rather than volume measure units, whereas volumes are measured in units/diameters or micro-channels of length and width/ height. Volumetrics can be defined as measures of the length of the neuron in a tissue and of the volume of the tissue in comparison to other tissues. Volume measure units/ micro channel length/ width/ height are used to measure the thickness of a neuron and the volume of the tissue in comparison to other tissues. According to this definition, the sex differences in the number and location of neurons in the brain and heart can be determined in general by the volume measurement methods. The volume determines the size of the individual's brain, which could be defined independently as the size of the individual's brain minus the volume measurement units/micro channels of length/ width/ height. Therefore, volumetric size determines the size of the individual's brain. In this regard, many volumetric measurement methods including volumetric MRI and SPECT use volume measurement approaches in order to estimate the size of individual's brain. However, the exact size measurement depends on the use of volume measurement methods. For instance, the number of neurons in the brain in the human brain are measured in volume measurement units/microchannel length/ width/ height. Hence, the exact size measurement determined by volume measurement approaches depends on the use of volume measurement methods.


Q. Does the size of the brain play a role in determining sex determination with a small penis and small penis injury? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Does the size of the brain play a role in determining sex determination with small penis and small penis injury?


Answer: There have been an increasing number of studies on determining the sex of an individual with a specific congenital malformation of the penis [39,41-44,46,47]. The results of such studies have provided support to the idea that there are more males in the penis with small penis [49,33,45,48] in the general female population than among the penis itself. The fact that there is a small penis after injury provides support for the hypothesis that the malformation could play an important position in determining the sex of a baby. The evidence from sex determination studies points to a male brain as the likely organ of the penis with small penis, whereas the female brain has a male brain. The brain size of a male fetus does not correlate to the sex ["

Question: Delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer: does it impact survival? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer: does it impact survival?

Answer: There are no definite guidelines for the timing of treatment in breast cancer survivors, and although there is evidence that late treatment can improve survival as well as reducing the likelihood of recurrence (particularly in patients with a recurrence-free primary tumor), all clinical trials on the subject have shown no clear benefit (Buchner et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2006; Pflueger et al., 2006). In general, patients who are diagnosed early (in the initial 5 years) do better than those who are diagnosed late (at the time of surgery). Early treatment, whether it is late or early, will improve patients' clinical prognosis.

Question: What are the best strategies to reduce the risk of progression and breast cancer recurrence and the effect of chemotherapy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the best strategies to reduce the risk of progression and breast cancer recurrence and the effect of chemotherapy?

Answer: It's unlikely that a change in prognosis will necessarily be achieved without large numbers of patients undergoing treatment (for example, with radiotherapy). Thus, the most important strategies to minimize the risk of progression-associated complications (e.g., relapse, graft versus host disease, lymph node rejection or metastasis) are those that prevent, delay or shorten the initiation of treatment in an effort to maximize the benefit, and those that mitigate the risk of worsening outcomes.

Question: Can surgery avoid or be modified an increased risk for early-stage breast cancer recurrence and subsequent chemotherapy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Can surgery avoid or be modified an increased risk for early-stage breast cancer recurrence and subsequent chemotherapy?

Answer: As of 2013, there are no definitive guidelines for the surgical avoidance of early-stage breast cancer recurrence. The evidence is conflicting and the evidence from randomized double-blind controlled trials is limited. A variety of options, including surgery, can offer substantial protection to patients at high risk for recurrence. While we don't yet have the full story of the incidence and outcome of recurrence with the three different types of breast cancers, it's likely that all are in the same ballpark (Kreisel et al., 2012). As with most forms of metastasis, early breast cancer is a survival problem, but the prevention of recurrence will lead to improved breast cancer care and quality of life.

Question: How frequently, in breast cancer diagnosis, are patients referred to other specialists for more detailed screening options which may include breast biopsies and other breast cancer tests? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How frequently, in breast cancer diagnosis, are patients referred to other specialists for more detailed screening options which may include breast biopsies and other breast cancer tests?

Answer: The proportion of patients referred to a mammographer for mammography is high. The proportion of patients referred to specialists for more detailed screening includes breast biopsies and mammography results. For this reason, there is no reason to assume, or even assume, that mammography prevents recurrence of breast cancer.

Question: What are the long-term effects of early detection, for example, with respect to treatment and prognosis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the long-term effects of early detection, for example, with respect to treatment and prognosis?

Answer: The risk of treatment failure and the burden of disease progression are high risk factors for recurrent breast cancer. Early detection helps to keep patients from having to undergo chemotherapy and may eventually result in a substantial reduction in the overall risk of breast cancer recurrence."
Question: Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males?

Answer: As has been mentioned previously (1), this question is very difficult. Some recent studies suggest that there may be a slight increase in carotid pulse frequency during fasting that has been linked to increased vascular resistance, or at least increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. The data that have been published during the past 8 years do not provide strong evidence for these associations. However, additional research is warranted to determine whether certain cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., blood pressure/hypertension, cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, and C-reactive protein) and the presence of hyper- or hypocalcemia (high plasma glucose and low, or high, C-reactive protein) increase the risk of arterial dysfunction during fasting. It is also interesting to note that elevated pulsatility scores were more predictive of coronary artery disease and mortality in this study, and not all lower arterial pulse rates had this level of pulsatility. Another interesting aspect of this study is the significant change in age between men and women. Although the age differences between subjects were significant, the age difference between the male and female subjects is even more significant: 30 yr old subjects had significantly greater pulsatility scores than 25 yr old subjects.

Although previous reports have suggested that there may be an association between diabetes and pulse rate (2) and there may be differences in pulsatility across individuals (3), the degree of change in the pulsatility score and pulsatility score scores between men and women among this group of young male and female subjects is significant. In fact, an analysis by Todorov of a retrospective study of 15,455 subjects using the pulsatility score yielded an odds ratio of 1.2 (odds ratio 1.20) for coronary artery disease for each increase of 1 unit pulse rate. This represents an increase of 24 beats/min for each unit of pulse rate. This study does not include those subjects who reported a nonfatal stroke, ischemic heart disease, or other acute cardiac events. Given the relatively small sample size of the cohort studied, the study cannot say whether these differences are significant. Also, the study was performed retrospectively, and the subjects might have reported a more severe event and/or stroke history that was not captured in the assessment of pulse rates.

In summary, the findings concerning the pulse rate (3), blood pressure (4), resistance index (5), and level of insulin resistance (3) in young men and women are not consistent, and further research needs to be performed.

B. Respiratory Symptoms

1. Are there clinical signs of asthma and wheezy cough among children with obesity? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Are there clinical signs of asthma and wheezy cough among children with obesity?

A. Yes. Patients in this study were primarily children <3 yr of age, which is a very important category because it has been shown to have a greater prevalence of asthma and wheeze than older children (<2 yr of age). Patients younger than 3 yr, or patients in the second half of their second trimester, may be at increased risk for wheeze episodes or asthma compared to younger children. Also, this age group is at an increased risk for having an adverse preterm birth.

B. Some patients also reported wheezing, coughing, and/or sneezing at rest, either at home or immediately after physical therapy (6). There were significant age relationships; older children had lower wheezy cough and wheezing scores than younger children, particularly at the lower end of age. Some younger patients complained of shortness of breath.

2. Are there clinical signs of asthma in overweight children? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Are there clinical signs of asthma in overweight children?

A. The number of clinical events identified in this study was small. Only one study reported the data in this way. The objective criteria for the clinical course of asthma in this study were not reported. There also were no data on wheezing. These data were gathered retrospectively.

3. Are respiratory symptoms and heart rates predictive of asthma in children? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Are respiratory symptoms and heart rates predictive of asthma in children?

A. A prospective observational study of 100 children (3) has demonstrated that the severity of wheezy cough in these children was significantly predictive of a first episode of asthma, even at a relatively low threshold (0.01%) (7). These children were followed for three to six years, and they had a much higher rate of asthma in childhood as young as 4 y, than if they had never had an asthma"

Research methodological research in a field that consists of analyzing data, such as a survey, in the form of data, from a particular point in the process of gathering the data. There are several other research methods that are used frequently today to study data: data analysis. The study of a dataset by applying methods such as statistical analysis, computer programming, or qualitative analysis. The study of data by applying methods such as statistical analysis, computer programming, or qualitative analysis. Methodology is the study of the method of collecting data during a study. The measurement of a quantitative or qualitative outcome that needs to be assessed to determine its magnitude. The study of measurement involves recording measurements and measuring a quantitative or qualitative quality. The assessment of quality of data. Assessment of the qualitative quality of data includes determining how the quality is measured, for example, by measuring the perceived quality of an outcome, by examining the perceived differences between two outcomes and their characteristics, or by assessing how the quality is perceived by a particular respondent or an entire group or generation of respondents. Evaluation of the qualitative quality of a data set. The assessment of the quality of data by examining differences and similarities among different sets and comparing results across different sets. In a study of a data set, the evaluation of the quality of the data is a component of the research methodology and is considered a crucial part of the scientific methodology. The evaluation of the quantitative quality of data includes determining if the resulting quantitative results are within a given range of values, and when the differences are substantial. The evaluation of qualitative quality of a data set includes defining the qualitative content of the data, for example, by defining different levels of confidence that a particular result can be explained by a difference between two sets of values. The evaluation of differences amongst different levels of uncertainty is the evaluation of the qualitative content of a data set, the identification of the qualitative content that is associated with various degree of uncertainty, such as size, number of observations and level of level of significance.

Question: Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles on scientific journals?

Your answer should be ""no"".

The reason is that a scientific publication receives much less publicity for the findings contained within; the ""impact factor"" has almost no relation to publication quality! Most authors of scientific papers simply publish for publication, and don't put much effort into ensuring peer review, refereeing and other important aspects.

Open access publishing doesn't do any good for academic scientists

Academic scientists don't care about what journals publish, they care about getting their articles published, which means that journal editors are the only one in charge – not the author or journal itself. When one gets a rejection letter, that rejection letter is the last piece of feedback about the quality of a publication. Only when the manuscript gets accepted do academics get to assess the quality.

Even if a scientific journal accepts a publication, there's no indication as to whether the journal will publish the article, rather it's a purely chance occurrence, as many journal editors choose to reject all publication.

Open access journals aren't just a good business choice, they're a key driver for academic scientists because it's in the public interest! Many academic journals are published in closed access journals such as Elsevier's Cell Press. However, these journals are not open access, meaning that the journal owner is essentially allowing the journal article to be published for free through their service. As soon as a scientific article becomes available on EBSCO's open access journal, and other publishers like The Open Access Journals have a financial interest in it, all journal articles are being published under one paywalled, closed access, monopoly.

There's now an incredible push on science to publish in peer-reviewed open access journals with a focus on scientific integrity and transparency. But unfortunately, academic science has been slow to move to this new format, because we don't want to be the journal that'sinks' the future of the scientific publishing world.

Please sign this petition urging your academic colleagues and peers to call for their institutions to publish their articles in open access journals such as EBSCO journals.

What to do if your university doesn't publish in EBSCO journals

For universities that are interested in making some substantial investment into becoming an open access publisher, there are two simple options you can choose, both of which involve less money than your university's budget.

Open access publishing is already popular in countries where it's relatively cheaper to make a publishable piece of work available to the public, including Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. As a result, most academics have chosen to publish in open access journals without making a real investment, but there is still some debate in academia as to whether open access has the necessary impact on the scientific publishing world to justify continued funding support from universities.

Alternatively, academia could choose to start by investing in a large research database to gather relevant datasets in different parts of the country, something that a university that is committed to free access publishing need not do. However, to fully understand this decision, it would be wise to consult your university's academic research council or vice president in your country.

We'd like to know what universities are doing with the money they've invested into open access journals. We have compiled a list of these contributions:

Bishop's Research Foundation. Invested in the creation of an online database of biomedical research datasets across Canada and the US.

Duke University. Involuntarily published the work of its researchers, published its own work, supported the creation of an open access database of open-access research in several journals.

Nova Scotia Science and Technology Institute. Publishing a large number of articles from some of the world's most respected social sciences journals, including the Journal of Social Ecology and Ecology Letters.

University of Queensland. Creating open access content is one of its main priorities, with the university's journal of environmental medicine being one of the first to publish it.

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Publishes articles in Nature, Nature Climate Change, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Science, Nature Communications and Science.

University of California, Berkley. Publishing open access articles in Nature, Science, Biochemistry Journal, PLOS Research, Environmental Science and Technology, Cell, Nature.

University of Adelaide. Published a large number of work in open access journals: BioMed Central, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Nature journals.

Vanderbilt University and Vanderbilt University. Publishes papers in BioMed Central, BMC Biology Journals, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, Journals of Biological Chemistry and Journal of Neuroscience.

Question: In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role? Abstract:

A:

Patients usually require an intrawear of gastric mucosa to be a good criterion of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, the most common endocrine defect. Although it is suggested there might be an etiological role, the mechanisms remain speculative. In infants with the most severe form of hypertrophy, the gastrocnemius often lacks both muscle strength and intrawear and the intraepithelial connective tissue is usually absent, which might lead to inferior gastrectomy and/or the need for surgical repair. We present a case of peritoneal mesenteric hypertension in our clinic, a syndrome that is difficult to delineate. Its etiology seems to be unknown."

Abstract:

Nasal bone fractures occur in China with a wide range of age groups, sex, and geographical area. Of the 57.2 million annual outpatient visits in China, 22.2% are for fractures of the nasal bone. In order to help prevent and treat such fractures, it is important to ensure efficient treatment and care. In some studies, there are two major methods for reducing the severity of nasal bone fractures. One method is long-term closed reduction with endoscopic technique, the other is open reduction without a direct visualized path. There are differences in the effect of closed reduction as well as open reduction, based on the anatomical location of the nasal bone. In this paper, I compared the effect of long-term closed reduction and normal endoscopic reduction of the nasal bone. For both approaches, the time needed by patients for radiotherapy and for maintenance of nasal bone were similar. The effect of closed reduction was also evaluated. In conclusion, my suggestion can be to consider long-term closed reduction, including surgical techniques, as additional treatment in some of the cases. For open reduction, further study comparing long-term closure and normal endoscopic closure should be conducted more carefully."
"Question: Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:"," Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival? The answer is yes, especially if we are focusing on children with severe prematurity or infants with a critical birth defect.

Preterm Prematurity: What Can We Learn?

A preterm baby can come into a hospital weighing only one or two pounds. Many of these infants will go on to live for many years. But these babies often die later because of delays in treatment, and premature babies may require dialysis or other complex medical care. Despite their age, preterm babies represent the greatest medical emergency because of their severity, severity of the injury, and their potential to cause significant health impact if left untreated. For these reasons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun a public awareness campaign to educate the public about the benefits of preterm infant neonatal care. The campaign seeks to create a greater awareness of the health risks that preterm infants present, how to reduce the risks of morbidity/mortality, what health benefits are possible, and how to reach out to expectant parents. The campaign also provides information on the availability of services that help preterm babies improve their health. The agency has also created a preterm birth resources page to help parents and community representatives become part of the solution.

Preterm Birth: What Can We Learn? provides the following information:

A list of resources regarding the risk of preterm birth.

An online resource to assist mothers with preterm delivery and give them access to the materials and resources that are available.

A list of health plans, including hospitals, that offer pregnancy testing and other prenatal services.

A list of local organizations and social workers to contact if you have any other questions.

An overview on the health of preterm and premature babies.

A list of resources on infant care.

An overview on the health of preterm and premature infants.

Preterm Hospitalization: What Can We Learn?

Many people believe that preterm infants are ""just waiting to die"" – but that is not true. In fact, the National Institute of Health estimates that approximately 5-8 percent of all births will be preterm (4). The NICHD estimates that these children have a survival rate of approximately 75 percent. While this is an excellent prognosis, preterm infants with serious genetic defects can experience a higher mortality rate. Therefore, these children receive special attention from medical personnel and families to help prevent and treat complications of preterm birth.

To help families understand what to expect, this short video provides parents, guardians, and providers with valuable information and an understanding of what to expect during an infant's initial visit:

Preterm Mortality: What Can We Learn?

Preterm mortality is determined by the time of birth, duration of respiratory distress, and outcome of all the factors considered. Early intervention measures such as antibiotics and supplemental oxygen, as well as emergency room care are important in preventing and treating premature death. When a preimplantation pregnancy is identified, an autopsy should be performed to determine cause of death. Many states use preemergence screening systems (such as the United States Medical Examiners Council Prepacket Pregnancy Screening Instrument) to determine if a pregnancy is preterm. The United States Department of Labor recommends that all pregnant women undergo routine screening (usually at 15 weeks of gestation) in order to screen for preterm delivery and to detect those who experience severe respiratory distress and other complications of preterm labor.

There is also some evidence that delaying delivery significantly increases the risk for preterm death. However, delays in preterm delivery may not have an immediate impact because some preterm births are delayed long after the fetal heartbeat is heard. Additionally, there is some preliminary evidence showing a relationship between preterm birth and the risk of developing asthma. Therefore, there is a need to further investigate how the underlying developmental or respiratory dysfunction or a combination of both causes these premature deaths.

Preterm Babies & Chronic Illness: What Can We Learn?

While preterm birth can be a life-threatening condition, the American Academy of Pediatrics provides guidelines for the management of preterm infants with health conditions. The guidelines recognize that these children cannot survive on their own with a health condition, and so care should be obtained.

An individual's health status, whether it is being measured (for example, a child's weight, height, blood glucose level, or thyroid function) or predicted (like a child's IQ test or IQ score), may influence the child's care and treatment. However, health status should be closely monitored and care should be provided so any changes in the child's health status will be well known and will be in line with medical practice.

Question: Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is the spontaneous remission of polyarteritis nodosa a true remission?

Answer: Yes, in many rare cases spontaneously remission occurs. This may include as many as two-thirds of the time. It can also occur in some patients in which there is no other cause for the symptoms. It can happen from time to time and requires many days of treatment with a strong anti-inflammatory. To avoid problems caused by the anti-inflammatory drugs which may cause further damage, one must be extra cautious for long periods. The best way to achieve an effective treatment in most cases is to follow the rules of preventive medicine.

How can I maintain remission?

Since the original outbreak in the late 1990s, there has been a clear increase in the incidence of polyarteritis nodosa. It has become easier than ever before, with excellent quality medical research, to find a diagnosis, diagnose the cause, then follow all the stages of the disease in its progression, and finally to identify and treat the best treatment available to achieve remission. But it is up to us to know which of these three steps are our best options.

In each case, the treatment options are not dependent on the condition but may vary over time. It is now possible to treat it with early immunosuppression in many cases and to detect the disease early. It is also possible to introduce a drug into the blood stream which can help to cause remission. However, it is not easy as the patient often shows no response and then is treated with drugs or immunosuppressive drugs that never worked and may not at all. In many cases, other treatments that have been tried may have the effect of only increasing or creating an adverse effect.

In the last five years, I have tried various pharmacological and immunomodulatory drugs. Several have worked for mild to moderate cases but most failed for others.

It is important not to overreact, as with some anti-rejection drugs which may make the disease difficult to control in many cases and others that cause more complications and have serious side effects. It is a patient decision as to if and when he/she decides to try alternative treatments. The decisions we make with our families, with our doctors and in the process of making the decision to try a new treatment can have a great impact on achieving remission in those whose disease does not respond well to current treatment.

The key question is: do we choose the ""best"" treatment or, do we decide to follow the rules of preventive medicine? This brings me to my main point: what can parents and physicians do to provide their children with the best chance of developing remission in polyarteritis nodosa? My guess is that we all will need more resources and research to find a strategy in order to be most effective in controlling recurrence in a patient.

Why are there so few articles about polyarteritis nodosa remission?

The lack of a reliable remission rate is a serious problem and a cause of concern to families of children with the disease. Many researchers are working hard towards finding a cure. It certainly is the case that some patients do show response to several different treatments, and with more research and effort it may help to find a better strategy. However, the problem remains that we have seen few reliable studies over many years. A study published in 2002 found remission rates of up to 80% in some cases but still found no definite cure and no significant benefit in the remission rate of some patients. We have seen many new drugs being evaluated and tested as they are developed to treat the disease; some of them have no answer.

If there is a cure, will we still use immunosuppressive drugs, will we still use drugs with known toxicities when there are no clear answers? And, if yes, will there still be multiple treatments? This is yet another reason for parents and healthcare professionals to consider avoiding immunosuppressive drug therapy with polyarteritis nodosa.

What do my children need to know about polyarteritis nodosa?

Question: Gluten tolerance in adult patients with celiac disease 20 years after diagnosis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can celiac disease be treated or corrected with gluten elimination? Answer: There are many cases of celiac disease that are treated with the elimination of gluten. In most cases, the condition was untreated until recently with the addition of gluten-free diet methods (e.g., gluten-containing foods) as indicated. The vast majority of patients with celiac disease will continue to respond to the addition of the gluten-free diet. Patients treated with the elimination of gluten have reported significant reductions in the severity of symptoms as well as on-going improvement and remission of their symptoms while on the diet. For more information about the elimination of gluten, please visit http://www.gluten.org. Answer: Gluten elimination surgery is being discussed by a number of physicians through a series of papers: In the recent edition of ""The Journal of Investigative Dermatology,"" there is an article by Dr. Frank Denno and Dr. Frank K. McGlose entitled, ""The Gluten Epidemic: Treatment and Prevention,"" on page 23-25. To order your copy please email info@investigativedermatology.com Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Can celiac disease be treated or corrected with gluten elimination? Answer: Gluten therapy is being considered as a treatment for many celiac diseases. The treatment protocol is based on the idea that by restricting gluten ingestion, patients can maintain a gluten-free diet for longer than once a year or by reducing the frequency and quantity of gluten consumption. It is widely suggested that gluten is not absorbed properly during food processing (e.g., after the baking of cakes), so the elimination of the food source is essential for a stable stable gluten-free diet. The treatment protocol for these diseases is similar to the treatment with gluten elimination therapy. In the case of celiac disease it is recommended that the following treatments be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of the disease is confirmed and before treatment for gluten intolerance takes place: 1) Complete resolution of symptoms and possible resolution of the diet intolerance, using gluten-free baking, recipes, supplements, foods, or medications; or 2) Dietary modification (e.g., avoidance of gluten bread, pasta, pizza, pasta dishes) for at least 6 months, or to a minimum of 12 months. Since gluten avoidance is usually accomplished by eating gluten-free, in some instances, the gluten-free bakery has been developed and is used in many countries around the world. In addition the gluten-free diet might be replaced by a strictly gluten-free diet, as in the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and other countries. Therefore, while it is not a complete cure, patients with this syndrome might continue with the elimination of gluten with many of the above treatments, depending on the particular disease.

Question: Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers and should they for COPD?

Answer: Yes

Answer: Question: Who are the COPD sufferers and which diseases are associated with this disease. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains how these illnesses are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Answer:

Answer: Question: Explain to other researchers how the lung is divided into individual cells and how pulmonary circulation is carried out in each cell. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that describes how human lung cells, called alveoli, are formed in response to outside forces in response to inhalation of air.

Answer:

Answer: Question: How does the lungs breathe? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains how the lungs breathe through the trachea.

Answer:

Answer:

Yes. The lungs breathe by means of a process called a diaphragm, but lung infections are called pneumonias and a pulmonary hemorrhages are called pulmonary emboli.

An infection also can be caused by a viral infection, and aspirators to a lung infection often are the first treatment during surgery. When this happens, it becomes more important to know where the infection is and who to call for a thorough investigation. If you had a common viral infection during the past 6 months, such as pneumonia after surgery, you can get tested for viruses. This tests often can be done at a doctor's office or at the health department or clinic that provides healthcare services.

Your doctor can prescribe a special antibiotic called an antibiotic-releasing agent (ARI), commonly called an ointment or spray, or an ophthalmic agent. Medications can also be prescribed from a doctor. Other solutions for infections include antibiotics for bacterial ulcers and steroids for cancer.

Treatment options are varied for the majority of cases. If you are receiving therapy and have more than one infection, see your doctor at least once a week and ask about the treatment options. If you go without help, your risk of a new infection may increase.

COPD can cause changes in your breath when the airways become narrow. When the pulmonary arteries become narrowed, they block your lungs' ability to get a good supply of oxygen. If your lungs are not getting oxygen, toxins build up in your blood, causing a buildup of coagulants. CO2 that has trapped from the air around your lungs can accumulate in your blood, trapping particles and toxins and causing hardening of your arteries. The buildup of coagulants on the surface of your blood causes the thickening that occurs when fluid forms on your cells. This hardening causes the blood vessels to narrow. As your blood vessels narrow, it takes much longer for your blood to flow through them again. When your blood doesn't get enough oxygen, it can block other blood vessels and make you feel tired and short of breath. The airways may also become pinched and painful. Your breath may be more shallow and slow.

Lung disease usually goes away on its own if you take medications. Treatment with special antibiotics (antibiotics like amoxicillin, ampicillin, and clarithromycin) can sometimes give you a quicker symptom-free response to the inflammation. If you become a patient, ask your doctor for a referral for the right treatment in case you need it.

Many other lung diseases such as bronchiolitis obliterans and emphysema can cause other problems. When these illnesses affect the lungs, you need more of a detailed investigation. You may be referred to a specialist for more testing and imaging to help you keep your airway open, such as testing the blood and lungs for inflammation to see how the infection affects your lungs. Your doctor should also explain changes in your breathing rhythm (exhaled and exhaled) and respiratory muscles during treatment. He or she can give you more specific instructions to help you remember how and when to breathe, and may also tell you how to get support if you can't get enough air for you or your child.

If you feel that you can no longer tolerate more air when you breathe or that other signs of chronic breathing disease become present, contact your doctor. You probably will have a bronchoscopy to look at your lungs so the doctor can look for things that do not match a known lung disease. This may include changes in the way your lungs do not seal properly, changes in the size and shape of the trachea and the size and shape of the airways, changes in your ability to take in and release air, air bubbles in the lungs, or other problems.

Prevention

There is no way you can totally prevent COPD. There are, however, things you can do to reduce the risk of the disease. Preventing COPD can improve your health and your child's health."

Summary

The search engine search has been associated with adverse effects on many parts of the nervous system. However, the scientific literature is still limited. The objective of this report is to gather up relevant information from scientific and other sources to determine the utility, efficacy and safety of this search engine among an immunological and allergologic setting as a diagnostic tool for the individual.

A search performed on the Google Index (an online database) using one common search query containing the above question indicates that:

1. A search results page containing ""Google"" is a useful diagnostic tool.

2. A search results page using some text related to ""Google Search Results is interesting.""

3. Google search results appear as informative about one field of interest

4. Google search results are not always correct and most frequently are not related to health conditions of interest

Summary

Google Search engines, sometimes with difficulty, can be very useful at determining answers to personal medical questions. Google search is useful for many personal search queries. The search engine might not work correctly for all your personal medical searches, and the question that appears on the search results page will probably not help. This is probably not worth the risk.

When a medical symptom arises, search engines can assist. For some medical conditions the search engine might not be able to help you. If this is the case, Google might be the only tool that might be helpful."

Science is just a tool in the doctor's toolbox

Some people believe that science is something which you do and that they simply do it because they're scientists and they don't care what you think about it. I've spent many hours sitting by the science table in a lab, studying the data from these experiments, trying to get better at it, wondering how I can do this better.

It's because it's important that your observations and work to improve your expertise are based on the same data that the real scientific world uses to decide which experiments are worthy of real life.

It's the job of an expert when it comes to medical research to decide if the findings of science are worthy of their own funding and which experiments are right for a patient to undergo.

My work on improving my observational skills as a medical referee resulted in the creation of an independent, peer-reviewed journal article for one of my first patients, Isoflavonol. This experiment is on record and currently used by healthcare practitioners around the world to measure a patient's response to IV therapy.


You may have heard that Isoflavonol has also been patented, as it is an antidepressant. This is an attempt to increase its use in the market (not only for patients with depression) where existing therapies are not available or do not produce satisfactory results, since depression is a very complex syndrome that is associated with several different causes.

What's important about this paper is that the scientific value and benefit of the drug is established based on observational evidence. While the clinical trial was funded by the government, the drug was never approved for use in the UK because of concerns that there had been no appropriate prior study of whether it worked as well as other antidepressants as a treatment of depression. With the study only just recently published, your comments in this thread could affect whether that study ever reaches a trial stage.

As a medical referee, I'm very careful to find out as much as I can about the trial and about why the drug might be working for a particular patient – just as we are very careful with all our other clinical experiments to find out what might be happening and whether it could be improved and made more effective. You may not want us to.

Isoflavonol is important in clinical treatment of depression

Not only is it a useful drug, its use in patients with depression is also good for the NHS. Approximately 50 million people live with depression around the world and more than one million hospital beds are still taken up by patients with depression every year, despite the fact that the number of diagnosed instances of depression around the world is less than half that during the 1970s.

Isoflavonol is a class A drug listed in the schedule of medicines with a high risk of causing serious side effects. Some of those have the potential to cause life-threatening heart attacks and strokes. In the UK, it is the third most common drug taken by patients with depression and the second most prevalent treatment by many nurses.

Because of the risks, a trial of Isoflavonol in depression is currently under negotiation with a manufacturer with a major sponsor and an important market share (we are one of the six most successful brands).

If all goes well, the evidence on whether it works better than other depression treatments as well as on how well it works will become more widely known, which means all of us who use it will be better informed and better able to take part in the ongoing clinical trials.

I can see your comments and the discussion in this thread will be interesting. So I'll stop here and let you have your say. Please sign the petition before you go. You can also email my colleague, Dr Sarah, at the Research Committee of the British Association for Psychopharmacology.

Question: Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors?

POPULATION: Approximately 810 000 people are living with hepatitis C worldwide. Approximately one million deaths are linked with hepatitis C from 1990-2006 [9]. In 2014, the rate of infection was highest among men and women aged 20-39 years [1]. Since about 50% of newly diagnosed HIV-infected people have hepatitis C [10], hepatitis C is a substantial public health problem worldwide.

Hepatitis C is defined as the genetic defect of the cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) enzyme resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [11]. It is mainly caused by genetic factors, and it may cause liver failure if not diagnosed by liver transplantation or by infection through contact with infected body fluids.

Several studies have demonstrated that people with hepatitis C have a genetic predisposition to the disease. These data have led scientists to hypothesize that individuals with hepatitis C have a higher risk of developing liver damage over time. In response, many studies have established that the risk of hepatitis C related mortality continues to rise with the average age of infection, and increases with the time spent in treatment [12]. The disease is often triggered by the consumption of contaminated drinking water, which is mainly imported from South and Central America. In addition, this virus also circulates among people with HIV/AIDS. Many studies have linked the recent increase in hepatitis C to widespread, illegal drug use [12]. This practice has made the virus increasingly available to public health investigators who have been tasked with investigating the risk of the virus to community persons. Due to the high risk of the virus, hepatitis C affects communities worldwide. It is a serious and life-threatening disease [12, 14, 16].

One of the main features of hepatitis C is the increase in viral load after acute infection, which is associated with liver cancer. In contrast to HIV/AIDS, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and other liver diseases have decreased with time [17, 18].

The cause of the increase in liver cancer incidence with age has been attributed to the large number of newly acquired infections with HCV [12, 19], and therefore to the frequent use of oral and injectable oral contraceptives with inadequate postexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of infection [6, 10, 19]. Increased hepatitis C-related risk of fatal liver disease in women has also been linked to drug use [19]. The combination of increased risk of acquiring an HCV infection, especially a high HCV load, increased risk of becoming infected with HCV, and hence of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, is consistent with the hypothesis presented here. Further research has demonstrated that in women who also have HIV, hepatitis C infection was associated with an increased risk for fatal liver disease [6, 20]."

Question: Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice? Abstract I have a number of questions and have been following your web site for a while. I would like for you to comment on that question for me. This suggests that I am of at least low concern. But, I was very surprised recently to read how a number of parents who are considering children in the asthma prevention programs for asthma have gone overboard and given themselves some sort of prescription to try to stop their children from getting asthma. I was especially surprised to see so many of my fellow parents telling me, with the same tone of dismay the mothers give their own daughters, that I had to do something with my young daughter's asthma so she would not get lung disease. I find myself wondering if my parents and the parents of your children have ever looked at what your child really needs to prevent heart disease, or perhaps some other kind of disease, when you speak of ""the most important thing"" about health. For example, your child should not grow up with a lung infection or an asthma diagnosis. She should not have to eat food that doesn't kill her, or drink water that doesn't cause her to become dehydrated, or work with a person whose lungs are not working properly, or wear shoes that do not keep her out of hot or cold places. The child should not have to live in a building that is in such poor health that it makes him or her susceptible to some disease. This would include if the parents were not allowed to keep a pet as part of their homes. They might need to find someone who is a little bit more knowledgeable about medicine than they are about pet care. Children are more likely to eat too much, or eat too little, or eat too much to which they are exposed, or not get enough exercise, or drink too much water to which it may be not yet exposed, with the result that they may not be as healthy. They are more likely to experience a variety of other diseases like heart disease or cancer. It is clear that your child could benefit from the following simple tips. The best of these ideas will require the child to be home a while – let's say not more than 90 days. To be able to give advice, you may need to be a little less willing to be a parent yourself – or have to live in a place where you can actually help a child who seems sick. Parents of young children in your neighborhood, for instance, may not be in a position where they can look at themselves in the mirror, feel ashamed at some of their behaviors, or ask the teachers why they are failing their young students. If you believe that you have given your children the proper medical attention so that they have a healthy childhood, then you might be a good candidate to give your children ""the prescription."" I could see you giving your children the prescription as a last resort if they are in the hospital or at home from something that will kill them. Here is what they do: they do tons of exercise: they ride motorcycles, go swimming, go rafting, do everything that makes the kid feel like they have time to work. They are so excited about this, that they seem not to realize it is physically strenuous for them, and that in fact they are not growing. By the time they go to school, the kid is getting more tired from the exercise than from any medical treatment. Many of the older kids end up having problems with asthma. They are not doing exercise because they want to, they are in school because they are exhausted. They are not doing it so that they can have a better asthma diagnosis, because they are too exhausted by the time they get to school. You would do well to give the parents a prescription for the time just now, and say, ""This is for a moment of exhaustion, and this is for a moment when you are tired out. You might as well enjoy that now,"" and then give them the prescription later in the day, when you feel more awake, and have time left to practice these things. If you have a child in your neighborhood who has a breathing problem, even though he has the same asthma problem as you, you might decide to give your child two prescriptions, telling your child to take two doses per day and the second dose to be taken the evening before school when he is most tired. To accomplish this, you are going to have to learn where your child is breathing on a daily basis. You can tell the doctor where your child is breathing, but you have to do some exploring. Perhaps you are not going to know where your child's lungs are; perhaps the doctor will do that for you. If you don't know where the lungs are or how good they are, then you can't tell your child what to do. In the end, you may have to decide whether or not the second dose is needed. Maybe your other children also need their"

Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is mental imagery in individuals with complex functional neurology functional in disease or non-disease states of consciousness? This paper includes a description of the literature that supports these claims, a general description of the specific imaging findings, and a discussion of what these are and how they relate to recovery. A poster presentation will be held at the A.C.C. in December 2015, where the researchers will highlight the results of the ongoing study.

We are proud that a substantial body of science suggests that imagery may be used as valuable tools for assessment of patient and staff recovery. We have identified a number of studies to support this view:

Barkows et al. (2015b) reviewed studies investigating the link between imagery or visual mental imagery and long-term recovery from brain injury (e.g. damage to the cerebral blood vessels, resulting in hypoperfusion), brain lesions in the hippocampus, and brain lesions in the limbic and prefrontal cortex. These studies demonstrated that certain types of imagery can be very effective in managing long-term symptoms of brain injury by facilitating functional recovery and/or by facilitating recovery from a specific state of awareness, even in the absence of recovery.

Schloss et al. (2015) found that in patients recovering from stroke, images of their surroundings triggered positive or neutral emotions, while images of their memories and imagery of their personal identity led to decreased negative emotions (and a decrease in heart rate). For those who showed an elevated heart rate in comparison to their baseline, they were seen as feeling worse (relative to the group as a whole).

In another study (Barkows et al., 2015b), a group of 12 patients undergoing motor vehicle crash-related brain injuries or cortical lesions, had an MRI scan during which an average of 7.2 seconds of imagery of their own behavior during a motor vehicle accident was reported. Imagery of people and objects was found to trigger emotional responses; patients reported being more stressed after imagery of themselves during a motor vehicle accident than after imagery of their family or friends. Similarly, images of negative emotions such as fear induced activation of the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, for both patients and an MRI of the same patient revealed reduced activity (MNI coordinates: M1 = 8, 8, -6, L1 = 7.7, 7.7, 6.6, L2 = 8.8, 8.4, 8, L3 = 8.9, 11, -9.5, L4 = -10.3, -12.3).

In a recent study (Lee et al., 2015) we examined the effects of visual mental imagery versus imagery of non-identifying objects (e.g. numbers, letters) to improve emotional processing. Patients were asked to view their own picture and then write in a letter expressing feelings. They also were instructed to choose between visual mental imagery and letter writing to determine which one produced the best emotions (""visual imagery"") or which produced the least emotions (""letter writing""). Results showed that visual imagery improved emotional processing, but letter writing produced fewer emotions than visual mental imagery (MNI coordinates of the two types of imagery were, R4B = -31, +32, -12, L4G = -14.4, -12.4, 16.9, L5B = 16.8, 4.6, 29, L6B = -10.0, 10.8, 5.4, and L7B = -6.1, 7.4, 6.3, but note differences between the two groups).

In this study, we observed the use of imagery to create and interpret positive emotions in patients, but not those of patients with negative emotions. In all patients, images of positive emotions were able to enhance emotional processing, but letter writing produced greater emotional emotions, presumably a result of less anxiety and fear induced by the letter writing. Patients also used visual imagery to facilitate recovery. In particular, patients with lower total memory scores compared to controls used visual imagery to enhance recovery (regression lines show a similar trend as the group as a whole did). It has been suggested that visual imagery could help a patient with a specific condition of consciousness by facilitating recovery (e.g. Hovenkamp, 2009). However, the degree of activation of the anterior insula has been demonstrated to vary according to the level of recovery (Abrams et al., 2016). Therefore, although our current results suggest that visual imagery is helpful in those patients who are not fully recovered, these data cannot rule out what may be the case, whereby those who seem to be most able to sustain recovery might benefit from being more active in their imaginations (Lee et al., 2015).

The current data highlight that the use of imagery to enhance recovery of patients may be specific to specific cognitive domains, but that imagery"
Question: The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How many children need a family physician? Answer: One and a half billion. It needs to be something that is not just a temporary problem like a yeast infection or a sore throat. Many patients and their families can be quite sick for a number of days, weeks, or even months. Even for children with severe pneumonia, the best way to determine whether they require immediate surgery is to get a CT scan. With those conditions, the only reason they can't be treated with antibiotics is because the bacteria have become resistant to the antibiotics used in the past. We are in a position to begin a medical arms race. To solve this problem you have to first understand the problem. You have to determine if it is a problem that can be treated from what treatments all the experts are recommending or if it is something that is going to get worse, probably in the next few years, and a good candidate, if we can, to make a first-step approach to it by finding out first whether there are any underlying medical conditions that can be treated or cured by a family physician from an alternative medicine approach. The solution to this problem is for the medical community to stop insisting that we use emergency care as the primary means of preventing infections. Instead, we should work with health care facilities to figure out that if a family physician can prescribe antibiotics to the extent recommended by the state of California, we should do so, and if that doesn't work, we will have to make a hospital switch. This is a problem that we are already in the midst of trying to solve, but it is a bigger problem if it affects millions of people. For that reason, your question makes sense, and if you want real answers to this question, as I think you do, you can find those answers at www.medicinenetwork.com/pediatrics. If our approach to health care improves a little bit we can move to a new way of working with health care facilities and health care facilities can get to work. The current system, where most health care has been provided by government and insurance companies, is not a good one, and there is a legitimate and growing interest in changing it -- even though the public does not yet support that.

Restore the quality of health coverage.

A bill to require that all health insurance policies offer coverage of a ""specified qualified health service"", provided for a specified period of time, and to prescribe rules for determining which qualified health services must be covered.

Status: Resolved 2/2/2015

Impacted Bills: House Resolution 6

Summary: To require that all health insurance policy policies offer coverage of ""a specified qualified health service"", provided for a specified period of time and to prescribe rules for determining which qualified health services must be covered.

HB 815 would require that all ""health insurance policies offered by any association of insurance companies"" be sold to an individual and that such policies cover a ""specified qualified health service"". However, if such coverage costs the insurance-company a certain percentage of its premiums, the law says those premiums must be reduced by a specified amount, in addition to the premium amount themselves. The plan's coverage of ""specified qualified health services"" would cover medical or surgical procedures for the following: ""a woman who has developed a condition leading to a miscarriage and does not want to continue to carry a pregnancy to term"", and ""a child who lives at least 24 hours and who is hospitalized for a condition having a substantial direct effect on the child's life in the state"". Such coverage would cover only those services considered medically necessary, including treatment for: ""a pregnancy that is not life-threatening or involves a condition that can be cured with medical treatment"", ""a breast infection that is diagnosed by the physician on the patient when an initial diagnostic mammogram is not performed"", ""a bleeding disorder that is diagnosed by the physician on the patient when a mammogram is not performed"", ""a fever in a child that will not require medication"" and ""a sore throat that is diagnosed by the physician on the patient when a cough test is not performed"". (House Bill 582)

Rep. Pineda, R-El Centro, has sponsored HB 815; R-Carmel, House Bill 579; A-813; A-717; the Senate bill passed, but HB 815 stalled in the House. (House Documentary Report, at 803.)

Question: Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas? Submit one abstract per week for consideration.

Your abstract should focus on the use of the beta-blocker to treat hemangiomas to identify and treat coexisting vascular malformations (including carotid sinus or occipital stenoses). For these reasons, these abstracts should focus on safety and efficacy of the beta-blocker in reducing postoperative bleeding and other complications associated with the initial induction of mechanical ventilation.

Include the following:

• Summary of any known or potentially causative causes of bleeding. (For example: an arterial disease, a surgical procedure, heart failure, and/or hypotension.)

• Evaluation of the patient's bleeding risk before administration of the beta-blocker regimen.

• Comparison of the clinical and laboratory response to the beta-blocker regimen with the initiation of usual care.

• Evaluation of the clinical response of the beta-blocker protocol to follow-up blood pressure, vascular function testing, and other tests performed at the outpatient facility prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation.

• Evaluation of the patients' symptoms after the first week of mechanical ventilation and any associated comorbidities.

• Any adverse reactions or adverse events during or even after initiation of mechanical ventilation.

Question: Can the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica be predicted at disease onset? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," What is the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica at disease onset? Abstract 1 Abstract

Abstract

Sick days 2-6, and days 5-8 and 2-4 of the polymyalgia rheumatica disease in men are generally considered to be normal. The disease has a very rapid course; clinical presentation is rapid on day 2, and on days 5-8, the disease progression is slow and typically goes undetected, possibly leading to the clinical syndrome of dyspareunia. On days 2-6, 2-4, and 1-2, the patient presents with generalized pain in the upper extremities. These generalized and localized symptoms occur in close relation to the increased pain, stiffness, and fatigue characteristic of the disease. These symptoms may worsen with time. Asymptomatic symptoms of the disease have been reported to last for 2 months, although these were not always objectively determined. Patients with acute onset of disease have an increased incidence of anemia and low red cell mass as serum iron levels increase. Clinical disease progression in this group tends to be progressive and clinical diagnosis is not always reliable. This is particularly relevant given the short treatment courses observed in most patients and the lack of well-documented clinical worsening of polymyalgia rheumatica in this group. It is also noted that the disease is more variable in this group. This is a very rare disease. The etiology of this disease is not fully understood. Despite the rapidity of the course of polymyalgia rheumatica, there is a lack of information on the prognosis. The pathophysiology of polymyalgia rheumatica is very likely complex and multifactorial. The diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica in general is based on the clinical presentation, and the pathophysiology is best determined by the presence of disease progression and symptoms.

You live in Skyrim. It is your job to keep lit all the candles in the abandoned caves and dungeons and castles. Continue the story:," Find out what happened to your companions, your friends, and the lost secrets in your beloved game.

But, if you die, there is little to no reason for you to continue the main quest or finish your personal story. You will simply disappear from the game and come back in the next save, where your character never gets out of the sewers and you could never see them again. It may be frustrating at first, but that's not the issue in any case.

And what happens when you die and you do not get a save file, do you get a full life story, or a one-shot save? Then you'll know the full truth about your character and that may lead to a better understanding of the world and the situation you find yourself in.

At the end of the game, your new saved game and the one before has a file name and a new file name that matches the name of the old game and the names of the characters in the old game. So you don't have to load a game and play around in all that junk again.

That may be the only difference for a player who is a completionist but is not an extreme completionist and wants every game ending that he has to come full circle with no extra effort and no hassle.

The main point about death does change though, for many of us it's become a bit more disturbing the more we hear stories about it.

The problem with killing at this point is that it allows you to access the last save file, then load it again and a new game. In some cases this is very inconvenient, in others not so much.

So, just a little something to let you know if you should or shouldn't be doing all this."

"Berlin, 1943. You 're a Jew who has been successfully keeping a low profile while working as a clerk under the 3rd Reich. You just found out you 've won a contest to spend the day with the Führer. Continue the story:","

I met Hitler through a friend, and he wanted to know all about me. The next morning I opened my door to Hitler and explained all about myself. When he came in, Hitler was thrilled to see me. We went for a walk. He said how glad he was to see me and said so many nice things about me. After lunch I asked him about the Jewish Question, I also asked him about his life in Germany and the history of the Third Reich (I had heard through my friend that his father was a Jew). He told me all about his training and his life under the Third Reich. He then asked me my story of the Holocaust. Hitler asked me which part of Germany I belonged to. I said that I had lived in Germany all my life. Hitler then said: ""It seems to me you have been lying, that you have changed your name, and that you have not worked for us in a position which allowed you access to such an important place as that of a clerk at a printing house. It seems to me that if your family can help you, we have no excuse for not taking you in under our care. Go to our headquarters. I expect to receive you as soon as possible."" And I went to the Führer's headquarters to ask, since I wasn't allowed in the building. But instead of telling Hitler what happened, I told him the whole story. The first thing he asked me was how old I was (I was 19). He then told me that I must be very smart in order to keep a low profile in the face of such an important place of work; at the same time, I could not help asking him if the man in the green uniform was a Hitler. Hitler then said: ""He will have a tough time. It is best to keep it a secret.""

I said I would not have changed my name. Hitler said: ""Who can forget to be born into the Third Reich?"" He then said that he'd be happy to take me over.

I arrived on the Fuhrer's orders just a few days later. This time Hitler did not take me. On May 1, 1944, at 7:00 a.m., I was taken into the Führer's headquarters to report in as an interpreter for the newly-formed SS-Sturmabteilung.

After I had been there for a few hours, Hitler was informed about my name change and informed me that he was personally interested in meeting some Jews. He also had an idea that if I had the chance I would give permission for him to become involved with this ""Jew"" (I thought of ""Jew boy"").

Hitler and I had no choice except to go to a local barber, who came to my room, shaved me and cleaned me. The night went by and at about midnight someone knocked on my door. As I was lookingabeth at the time, the man who knocked on my door was very drunk and asked whether or not I would like to stay overnight at the Fuhrer's headquarters. Hitler also wanted me to stay overnight so he could write ""It's him!"" on my face. I asked a friend of mine to accompany me as the two of us made our way from the barber to the headquarters. The night started cold and dark. The man in the green uniform had been sleeping on my bed when I came in Robert Friedmann, a young Swiss Jew who met Mecklenburg's Fuhrer Schacht (Fritz) at the headquarters.

When we reached the headquarters, I learned that the Fuhrer had just had a big victory in Poland (in which Hitler had saved his most talented assistants by killing them). In addition he had also saved himself from a horrible death in Wannsee. I later discovered that the Fuhrer had taken a night stroll at about 10 coolest at night after the victory. There is a lot of truth in this story, which can be found in the book ""Hitler's Last Stand,"" written by the author Jürgen Stroop and published in Germany in 1952.

Friedmann also came from the same small town as me. But his story differs slightly from mine.

I was at the Jewish Association's office at 13:00 that night with four others. It was close to midnight; the Fuhrer had received the news that the Polish government was going to open a trial against Polish-Jewish collaborators in Warsaw and send them to a concentration camp.

With these new developments, Hitler realized that he now had a new opportunity for his activities. He had given the Reich Chancellery permission to use the building to meet Jews who wanted to stay with him"
Interrogation LOTR Continue the story:," If you don't have the Lord of the Rings, no harm done! If you do have the book, then you effect the conclusion of this story. No spoilers here. I'm going to cut to the chase quickly here. If you already read LOTR you should be used to the general story line. Otherwise: It's a very good story. The characters are strong and likable. The language is complex. Some words are hard to understand, but most are pretty easy to understand. A few things are repeated but not so much that you can't get the general gist from that one word that was repeated. It follows the story well, and it is just great. All in all, I loved this story. It's a nice blend story with Tolkien (in my opinion in fact). I hope you enjoyed the read, and I hope you enjoyed ""The Last Wish"". Comments? Leave a comment."

A game by

Johan Sandberg and Jens Sørensen

in collaboration with Taito

in 1993.

In 1993 Johan Sandberg, Jens Sørensen and Aardman Studios announced the first ever game from Danish developers Aardman Studios: Starship Creator. In Starship Creator, the player is a new alien, trying to conquer the galaxy and return to the ruler of your planet. He is placed at a planet, after his parents were killed by an alien invasion. He is given a ship by his parents, and tells his friends and the police of his story. The goal is to return to your planet, discover the ruins buried under an alien planet and conquer this planet until your people return and help you defeat the invading aliens.

The story is simple. Aardman Studios, after reading The Great God Pan's novel The End of Civilization 3, felt that their project should have a story similar to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which focuses a hero (Kili) on overcoming an alien invasion that tries to destroy his home. This is similar to the original Wing Commander for MS-DOS. The alien invasion begins in 2265, when Earth discovers an extraterrestrial city. Kili takes command of the ship from the computer system, which provides the main information about the alien race and their goals.

The story is split into several stories, each of which provides hints to the main narrative. The story is simple and linear, but at each stage it is full of possibilities. The storyline contains great amount of options. Depending on the choices, the story will change. An example is that the player can send the ship to the surface, where it will be attacked by the alien. This can lead to a climatic battle and victory! But one can also choose to destroy an alien ship, preventing its attacks and leaving the planet unharmed.

Players can control both aliens and humans, so the game offers many opportunities to replay the game through different alien race and human characters. All these choices affect the overall development of the story, which increases the replayability factor. It also keeps the ""epic"" aspect of the game, where the events take a great amount of time and space. Also the game was based on the movie of the same name, where humanity is under attack.

Starship Creator has several endings based on the choices of each player. The player can have a peaceful way of conquest if any of the alien races are hostile to humanity. This is a very important distinction and helps to define the gameplay. Other endings have different options, where a human-like character has to kill the alien that is attacking anchor and have a positive impact on the planet under attack. The planet cannot be conquered in the ending if Kili dies. At the end, players are rewarded with unique space weapons, unique alien weapons and other objects such as food or resources at different stages of the game.

It is impossible to describe this game in words. You can download and play it at the spacecom web site.

A sci-fi novel that was published in 1975

The idea of the story was simple. A group of young schoolchildren called the Space Cadets will be abducted by aliens. A strange spaceship will land on their planet and they will be taken into the future.

All of the characters have to find their place in a new society. They are divided into three groups. The first group consists of the normal school kids, who will live their normal lives while the second group is special. The third group will become Space Cadets (also called 'Space Troops' or 'Space Soldiers'). They will go to the future and learn new skills and use them to battle the aliens. You'll encounter the other Space Troops too. As you can see, the novel was not an easy read. To this, I add a few things: the title of the novel and the ending. I wanted to have a story with a happy ending, where everyone is remembered and successful. This way, the story is longer (the final chapter is a book with many endings). Also, the story is about the future of mankind and how to cope with the threat. And what could we do with these knowledge (and what the future holds for us?).

The father who killed his newborn child before putting a knife on her neck. © 2016 theguardian.com

The murder of a father is not uncommon. In fact, this crime is something we see all the time. Often, it is not a man at all. Often, he is an innocent bystander. But as many as one in four men will kill their spouse or partner to try to protect their families, according set of statistics out of the United States, which is the highest in the developed world. The reason is the ""hustle effect"". In every year, approximately five million men commit suicide. However, most men won't kill themselves. In other words, they'll kill someone else.

The reason that men kill partners isn't so different from women killing their mothers. While both are driven by the same emotions, the motivations for males are usually much less serious than for females.

We've all been involved in a serious breakup that left us reeling, leaving a heavy and lasting psychological scar. We've all wondered when we will get back on the same page and what the pain will be like. Even though the breakup may be the first time we ever saw the consequences of our decisions, we know deep down that there will surely be a lingering pain from the emotional upheaval. The same fate is always waiting for us.

So we hold our fingers in our ears as we sing:

Never was love so deep

Never was there more pain than I have felt in my life.

In the case of the homicide, there isn't always a direct perpetrator involved. But with the growing gender imbalance, the impact of violence against women is becoming increasingly prevalent. According to a report published by the National Crime Victimization Survey in 2011, around 17.8 million women and 9.8 million men were the victims of domestic violence in 2011.

As society strives to get back on the right track, we must stop the rise of domestic violence against women. We must acknowledge the problem and get to work to solve it.

Mulder and Scully stumble onto the grounds of Hogwarts; the only problem is Scully does not see everything Mulder does .... Continue the story:," ""That's the one where it shows the body. It's in the first episode of Season 8 when they pull the body out there. That's it, basically. My biggest problem with that - it's all the clues we have in this episode that we're never going to get. The most obvious one is when we discover the body was a woman. We haven't seen that in the script - we don't see it in either one of the other two episodes. [We're] talking about something we don't have. "" We have no clue about whether it's alive or dead. I can't even describe it as an answer in the script - and the script has to have those answers in it. We go out and try to find out what it is. It has to be a thing that we'll meet in the woods. It has to be something that we can't figure out, and we find that out in this episode as well, which is why we don't know whether it's alive and dead. [We have to find it out] by meeting the old man and giving him438 more clues. And we get rid of some of our clues, and we don't know how many there are, and it doesn't even matter. Our minds just won't work that way. "" The end of this episode - and by ""end,"" I mean - it's a piece of cake. We know the man who killed his wife and daughter is alive and well, and he's a member of the Brotherhood of Masks. The thing is, we haven't learned how, so we know nothing about he, and everything he does we haven't seen in the beginning of the season. We can deduce everything else we need to in this episode - except for why we can't see the corpse in the first place. [The writers do have to go back to the beginning - but they need to go back to the beginning of the series'] The last thing we have, and the thing that really gets this season into shape, is we have another flashback story - this one dealing with the death of Mulder and Scully's son, Michael [played by Tom Scully]. The death of someone in the family is just one example of how much the show has changed. For example, we have a flashback story about Scully and Mulder and their daughter's relationship. This is something that we really never saw coming, and this was kind of a revelation because I have never seen that. The thing is, the second it happened the problem was that there are no clues. We didn't even know what happened. The first time we see these people - all the scenes I saw - I was like, ""This is going to be great."" We've had a scene where somebody - it was a real moment - this is going to be great. But there are no clues because what we have is a man who we just didn't know was alive. He dies, and then he's like okay, we don't really need to know who this was that killed him. We don't even know. So that is a real problem. We just don't know anything, there's no obvious clues about who he is, there's no obvious clues for the audience to go back and figure all that out.

"" [But that] was where it had to go, because there are no clues. There are no obvious clues. We don't know who it was. We have no clue. We don't know why it happened in the first place. We don't know anything about the time period, we just see the bodies, and so we feel like this is the ultimate end because when it's over, you're really going to feel like somebody has won. [But] they just get in that same car as everyone else, and they look in the other car and we see this old man we really don't know anything about. It's almost like a spoiler. And when we finally meet up with him, we don't even know what it could have been, and we don't know anything about anything. It's a big, giant cliffhanger [laughs] because we just don't know what to do with the death of such a high-ranking person. To me, it was the big part of the season. And the fact that it doesn't get resolved is sort of like the end - we've talked about all that, I can tell you. We've talked about so many things - I mean who knows how much we've already written?

New York Post: New York is facing a wave of opioid overdoses

[…] A new analysis by the Drug Enforcement Administration found that in the first quarter of 2017, the drugs causing Americans such as myself to self-medicate with heroin, OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet were prescription painkillers, not opioid painkillers, according to a recent report by the DEA's National Forensic Laboratory Services Laboratory.

The study was published in the latest edition of the National Forensic Drug Information System, a database that allows authorities around the world to track drug-related evidence.

It also indicates that the opioid epidemic is killing more than 2,000 Americans every day, more in the past year than during all of 2016.

[…] According to the latest figures shotguns were used in 645 homicides, which represents a 25 percent increase over 2015. In addition, 9,600 suicides occurred, which is a 35 percent increase.

[…] The report states that fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is much more potent than morphine but often mislabeled as heroin and prescribed for years, is a leading cause of overdose deaths.

Cancer and other severe, long term illnesses made up the top two categories of overdose deaths, and the report says that these illnesses are increasing rapidly as the opioid epidemic accelerates.

The report estimates that opioid overdoses are killing more than 20,000 Americans per year, and nearly 1,000 die every day. About 100,000 Americans take opioids every year, according to the survey.

[…] The DEA report also found that heroin is being used in more states than it was in 2008. The increase is the result of the addition of fentanyl, an even more potent opioid.

The use of street drugs to get ""high"" is also occurring in more states than ever before. The DEA study shows that the increase comes from fentanyl:

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is so potent that it mimics the effects of a very strong opioid found in opium, known as morphine, which is used in pain treatment and as an anesthetic medication. The DEA says a single dose of fentanyl over the course of a month can cause death in a patient, although a single dose is considered to be a ""mild overdose"" by the DEA. The DEA says there are several reasons why fentanyl is increasingly prevalent; there has been an increase in the availability of the drug, as people used it cheaper and it is believed it is entering the black market. The DEA has also said the drug has begun to enter the recreational arena and has been used to ease anxiety, and has been linked in cases to a number of health problems.

[…] The DEA says that by its estimates, in a single year in 2016, overdoses have increased by 40 percent compared to 2015.

The Washington Post: Trump has done more than Obama to combat the opioid crisis…

Trump has appointed more than 100 new opioid-detecting officers across the country to crack down on widespread misuse of opioids, and he has sent Congress specific funding requests to increase treatment and public health programs to end the epidemic's cycle of addiction. It's the first time in 20 years that Congress has allocated funding specifically for opioids, the leading cause of the nation's opioid-related mortality. Trump's efforts and the opioid-prevention work the drug-war-era Democratic Congress did after the attacks of Sept. 11 may have brought the epidemic under control, but he's only partly responsible for the uptick in deaths reported since his inauguration.

[…] The increased use of opioids and an increase in the number of deaths associated with drug overdoses was not limited to the Trump administration. Since 1980, total mortality from accidental causes involving opioids, including prescription and illicit, has increased by a factor of approximately 25 percent, according to the CDC.

[…] In March, President Trump, in a statement from his office, said: ""I just signed an amazing piece of legislation that will save lives and keep families together. It's called H.R. 2268 — the Safe and Accurate Drug Pricing Act. This new law will save lives, prevent opioid and heroin overdoses, and will help people who lose their jobs, pay their medical bills and take care of their families.""

Alyssa Pereira of Vox: One month into Trump's presidency, we're having an opioid epidemic. More than twice as many people died of overdoses last month than we had the year before, according to data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[…] Trump's anti-drug effort won the support of the pharmaceutical industry, a group that has given billions to President Trump's charities and has pushed for mandatory minimum sentences for people"
Can you write a dialog that does n't suck where every line is a question? Continue the story:,"

What if we only wanted a story in the show that said what I want and I want it right now so everyone could have ""I've been thinking... I've been thinking...""? What if our show would only take place on a timeline where every moment had a question?

It's a much safer, more manageable vision that has a very different audience than one that allows us to make a show of a different kind. If you're going to be like, ""I'm the first to say we have every intention of letting every moment be answered, but then our narrative gets muddied and there's an element of uncertainty here, maybe it's worth it that way,"" then I'll be okay with all of that. I think if you can say the same thing over, over and over again, and have the person who says it change about whether you're right or wrong, I'll look at it as a good thing if it gets him to question his own preconceptions in a way no good show is ever going to. It doesn't hurt that some of your heroes will be asking them. In order for this to make any sense, his perspective must reflect your own. If he was wrong, he would've come on to me the first time and we'd have had a discussion. We both have the same goal. If you are at war with me and I'm not at war with you, it makes perfect sense. facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71 and twitter.com/paul.j.watson.71

I've always thought it was more complicated than that. I actually think a lot of writers believe it's more important to have two or three separate points of view and that the point of view most often reflects the person with whom you spend most of your time, which is something I think a lot of people do, and it's something everyone can agree upon once they've read a bunch of books or watched a lot of shows. I think the point that needs to be made is that people are people and that, as much as everything is important to everyone, certain people are just more important than others.

I agree with that. I love this idea of it being important to every person, that even if your hero is only a person, you should not try to understand that person because they are not necessarily important to you or the same as other people. We are so much more complex than that, and I like that you use the word empathy a lot when describing the importance of having different points of view. In your discussion of the importance of finding things that appeal to you and people else, you mention another aspect that often comes up and that I think a lot of people struggle with because they think they are too sensitive.

This is a big part of my approach because when I was doing my show Big Bang Theory I kept talking about empathy versus a sense that your personal experience was the only reason you were doing the show. There is a lot of truth to that because you are never going to understand jets in a vacuum and so there are a lot of things about someone and who they are and where they come from that you think is going to explain everything from how they react to people to how they react to their emotions to the fact that you do not understand why you like them even though you know why people like you. That's probably a bigger part of it than you understand. To be honest when I was coming up with the character that was going to be Mr. Spock on Star Trek I was worried that I was too sensitive and that maybe Mr. Spock would get upset over things, but he's the Captain, is Mr. Spock the Captain and everything he does, just as much as something about his personal background or how he responds to different people or events that happen to him are going to happen to him, that was never the case because I was doing Mr. Spock and that character was so rich and so full of life and he can do things like that, he is such a wonderful fellow and I wanted to make sure that he+(?) everything I could to help him do the right thing to help people and that was actually something I got to try to do with The Mindy Project. I could tell even though I'd been talking to The Mindy Project characters for about a year and a half, it was just so much about her being full of life and the sense of wonder and wonder that you get from knowing that there is a whole other world out there.

You can see that this year even though we're talking about the fact that it's ""The Mindy Project,"" you're actually still trying to explain Mr. Spock's character to people as a character who is not going to tell them much if anything about him. Are you aware of how much that matters?

Yeah it does and that's why I love what David has done is"
You 're a successful womanizer and across the room you see a beautiful yet disinterested woman who you must have. Continue the story:," "" ""I've got another idea for a new concept. I want to launch a new magazine for married women. I've always wanted to do this, and what I've found in researching the subject is that most of my fellow spouses are very unhappy. They always say ""I love you"" when they're in the room, but when they leave the room they never say ""I love you very much."" But what if they did at home?"" ""The idea will be that you write to a special friend and receive from her a gift—some kind of gift—that will change her life forever."" ""I've got a brilliant idea for a new concept…"" ""I know where you feel you're at in your life when you come home when you're married, but what if you found a different woman to be with every night? What if you found a young woman whose happiness you could only have with the understanding that there was no better woman for you and your marriage, and if she broke things off the first time you broke them off, she wouldn't get a second chance?"" ""What will you say to the woman whose partner has just broken up with you again?"" ""What will you say to the man whose spouse is still with him every night? Will you forgive him the first night? Will you forgive him after a few days? It's easier not to.""

I've only looked at the one issue of the magazine, the one you can see. They just put up a lot of great advertising with them. I think you should see that.

And, it says, ""This will change your life forever."" And when I looked at it the way I was looking at it, I was like, ""How can it change your family life forever?"" And I found out that was one of the things I found and talked about at the National Organization for Women conference that I was at. I said, ""Well, it's a great way out. You'll get the woman you want."" And they said, ""Yes, it will.""

Now, my first thought was, if you really want to change the entire life of your family, you know, so much of the family structure is set up that you're gonna really have to figure that out. You've got to change the family structure. But I found after doing that that I was really successful in changing the family structure because, and this is important, I became the womanizer, I got to sleep with pretty much everybody, I became married with the woman who was my best friend. I got drunk all the time. And I couldn't find a single moment where I went, ""Oh, I would like to go back to that. I'd like to be able to do that again."" It's true, it didn't go very good. It was just the relationship that I had with everybody. And if there's one thing I knew, you have to try to improve on this situation. And when I told some women, ""I'll get a divorce,"" they thought, ""No! You can't divorce."" ""You are a poor man."" ""No. And I'm a poor woman."" And all they knew is that I said, ""I'm very much in need of a little bit of help. I'd like to buy a new home for my parents. I'm trying to find a good career. I've got a great job, but my wife is complaining about me."" All of this had been taking place as I wrote my autobiography, The One You Love, which came out when I was 38. They just got a copy, which I thought was a gift.

So the point is that when you look at it, when you look at your family, you're just looking at what happens as a result of yourself. There's a lot of people who do say, ""There's a lot of different issues here. Your marriage, my divorce, all that. Why don't these go away just by taking off her panties?"" And all I know is that I didn't give an inch. I wrote this woman's husband's wife's husband, she was my best friend. I gave an inch. I gave an inch. I gave an inch. And it just turned out that it wasn't good for her. It wasn't good for her, it wasn't good for her or her child. It didn't do anything but make everyone uncomfortable.

Now I was very fortunate, and I got married at 22. And I had this wonderful woman, who I didn't know. She was from my country and she had a child. She was from my first generation. And when I was going through this life, I didn't know her at all, but I loved her. And eventually she came to me. And I looked at her and I asked, ""What are you doing? What kind"

User Info: KageKage KageKage 1 year ago #2 [NSFW] The Sorrowful One - The Tales of the Kage Clan


And they're a little different as seen above. The whole council of sorts is made up of the five Ancestor Gods, the Kage. The Kage (also known as the ""True Ancestors"", or simply the Kage) are the beings around us all. In this tale their powers come and leave them, whether they feel happy or sad at the time. You can easily tell when they're going crazy, like with the dragon here. And what do they do when they're happy? They fight every hero from the time the world began, which the rest of the cast of the story knows all too well. And when the Kage aren't playing a trick on us, well, they're like real superheroes.


This is the tale of the Kage clan. It's interesting how it's set up like this from the start, but what really grabs me are the people who are given life. For one there is the main character. His name is Kazumi Tsurugi. She is the only Kage that wasn't created as a child. She was a part of a little world, similar to the Kage world itself, who were created in secret and only discovered after the Great War. She also goes by her nickname Tsurugi, which is a shortened form of her name, which means ""sorrow"", when she's sad, for example. She was raised together with her father and sister. That is until a new Kage came into existence.


They made all the other ancestors their slaves and casted them into the ground. Kazumi became the daughter of that new one and became part of her father's ""family"" in the form of ""sisters"". Tsurugi was the other one, though she was never called Kazumi since this is the story of the Kage. Her name was not changed due to family lineage because she was raised to have that kind of name, but because she was not the daughter she was born to. She was known as Tsurugi, or, her mother's name for her, as a Tsurugi. Her father was called Kazunoko, or, him saying ""Tsuri"", the family name for his son. This is the reason why I think it's a little awkward at first. She uses she and he and she and him, and it's a little confusing, and at times you don't like the height of your characters.


But as the story progressed she became stronger just like her father, becomingTurnabout Girl Tsurugi. This changed when a group of Kage decided to kidnap her to try and take over her father's ""family"" from them. She got involved and her heart wasn't in it, so she escaped out of the city. Of course she was caught when they got it under control. They also caught the old kage, Kazuyuki, whoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO is apparently a Kage from the Ancient Timeline, and so are the rest of them. Well, one of them is Kazumi's father and she was the one in the group of Kage who left the city.


The others are some of the ones Kazumi never met her father, like her father's best friend, Kanda and her father's best friend, Yamanaka. The group in question were all chosen as a group and so they were all born on the same day, which is different from how the other Kage were. Because they all came from different times, however, it made their lives hard in their current age.


Kizuna Kanda is the first kage member we meet. And he's exactly like what you'd imagine. He's a really big guy, not particularly tall, but pretty strong. His appearance is always the same, and with a straight face he's always showing off his muscles. He is the one who created the Kage, but he's not a member of the kage itself, as you can imagine. He was born in the Kage's time, the Great War, when the remaining kage all came together to save the world. Like the rest of them he had a strong interest in helping people, a desire to bring order to the chaos that made the world great, and this is the way you get him. He's sort of like Kazumi's father. He was part of the original group that came to find the hidden Kage.


He was the one who recruited Kazumi. He was the one who knew about"

The prisoner will serve his sentence at Oak Island. At 5:00 p.m. the following morning, the prisoner will be moved to the New York City Prison on Pelham Avenue in New York City. Then, within 48 hours of the last week of his sentence, the prisoner will have been transported to The Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas City, Missouri.

If the prisoner lives in a prison on Pelham Avenue, then this means he must reside within 150 miles of New York City.

If the prisoner lives closer to the prison, then he must reside within 250 miles of New York City, which means he must reside within 150 miles of Oak Island.

To find out where the prisoner is residing, you would have to visit both Oak Island and the Leavenworth Penitentiary.


Oak Island

Oak Island is not only the most prison in the world, it is also one of the least, with only a tiny inmate population.

In fact, the closest prison it has to a prison is the State Penitentiary in Lawrence, KS; the prison is only an hour and half's drive away.

Oak Island does have an inmate population of roughly 80 people, and there are roughly 12 prisoners per unit. The prison is an 80-bed maximum security unit.

Unlike the Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas City, Kansas, which is in the 50s of 100, Oak Island is much larger, with more than 2,000 beds, making it roughly 3 times larger than Leavenworth. With 1,400 beds, it is also at or near the top of the list when it comes to the largest prisons in the world.

Oak Island opened in 1967, and serves as a federal correctional facility for men from the Northeast.

As a part of the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Prisons, Oak Island is the largest federal prison outside of the Federal Correctional Institution in Manhattan, New York.

Leavenworth Penitentiary

This is one of the most prison-like prisons in the world. With 6,500 beds and over 400 inmates per cell, Leavenworth is also much larger. It is an 85-bed maximum security unit.

Leavenworth also has a very small prisoner population, approximately 35 people per inmate-per cell.

As a part of the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Prisons, Leavenworth is the largest federal prison outside of the Federal Correctional Institution in Manhattan, NY. Leavenworth was created in the 1970's and is located near Columbia, Maryland.

Leavenworth was created to house mentally ill offenders and is considered to be the toughest prison in the world outside of the state systems."

I would rather live in a world full of robots than a world full of cats,"" says Dr. Yaron Brook, a research assistant professor at the University of Washington.""There's a reason that you read all the books before you do your homework,"" says Brooks. ""It's because people tend to put off reading a book until they have all the information they can about a topic. It's good for your brain."" As our ability to learn expands, so does our access to information. Now, I'm sure everyone on this planet has a hard time reading something the night before it is due to be read, and even then not a day goes by until there is a problem of some kind that requires immediate attention. In the future, this problem might be as simple as something that could have just passed out, or could come when you've been sitting in an office for a few long days. But, for now, it's about what we can do to ease the stress of being a writer and do what makes us happy to begin with.I found a story in a sci-fi magazine today called Space.net. I'm not sure if these are the same people who publish Sci-Fi.net but, I guess it was a magazine that had a huge amount of science fiction and had just recently started to get a bit more mainstream as well as having a new look. Anyway, I'm just quoting here the first paragraph of Dr. Brooks ""The most impressive example in the entire universe of human intelligence is of course the AI A.I."" (The author of the article refers to A.I.s as ""Superintelligent A.Is"" or something like that and to me this makes him the first real hero of the 21st century.) It's a little dated for my tastes and maybe a bit dated even amongst our own age, but it illustrates how much we've come out of the Dark Ages, and we have a pretty good way to make the world a more interesting place, but the way, we can make the world a more interesting place, not by making it more boring but by making the world nicer.""I think that most of us just want a pretty picture, something that we can see,"" said Brooks. ""But that's not enough."" A new technology that creates a more pleasing image from pictures is a tool that would make the world a more interesting place. The problem, though, is getting it to appear within our daily existence (and, of course, we've been waiting for it for years).

"An army approached the pass. Only one being stood in there way. They did not plan to survive, just survive long enough. Continue the story:","

When the army reached the end of the pass, his companion was already at the foot of it. The man opened the door and his companions rushed through. All of them were unarmed, all of them killed in the instant. The man, who was the only one left, fled from there as fast as he could. After two full days of hiding, a scout came and found a place to hide. He asked what he should do, but when he opened the door he saw a man who he had told about the pass, holding a knife. After killing the man and finding him still alive in this cave, they knew they had finally found the place of their mother. He was in his late 80's, and very thin. They wanted to put him to sleep. The woman would not let them, it was her place to save.

So, the two men took a knife from the man they had saved, and slit his throat. Then, they placed the body into a body bag and buried it to preserve it through the cold nights in the ground.


At this point, it turns out that the woman is telling this story. She claims she was still alive when she was raped. She gives a timeline of how this event (being raped) happened to her.


""We began to prepare after six weeks. I had left the place, and had gone to my daughter's house. I went through these dark forested areas, passing by several houses. Finally I came to a big cave, and there was my husband with all his friends. At first I could hear some kind of voice calling my names. It was as if we were shouting.

When I got there, I was alone in there. In the darkness I saw I think, the light was brighter here than in the house. I heard a woman, she asked me, why did you come back? So I told her and then she disappeared completely.

One night the neighbors heard us shouting and got worried, so they called for my husband. He came to the spot and found the body of the man called me back.

By that time, one of my children was screaming for help, her voice was high-pitched with fear. She screamed: ""My husband is screaming for her but the mother is gone!"" But in the middle of her words she started trembling like a leaf. By then, the villagers ran in to my husband with the story that there was a man out there raping and killing women.

In the middle of the night, he took us back to the place and kept repeating to us so he would hear us.

The next day, we went back to that area. The women and children were there. We saw the village houses, where there was a stone with a sign pointing to it. A year or two had passed since the event that the woman's mother told me at.

At the time, my husband had not seen my mother who told him all that happened. She had also escaped without my help and got the help from a friend. So, we began searching of the bodies. We found a young boy, aged between five and six, who seemed to be about my age. His body was found in the middle of a forest. His head was upside down. We found the arms of the dead child. They were almost intact, and were wrapped inside a red handkerchief!

One dayprobably the night before Christmas, my daughter came. It was winter time, there was snow and freezing cold. She was crying, she asked for help. She had seen two men lying on a bed with a child in sleep. She said that they seemed to be kissing the child, and then they began to rape him. Then the father took his boy, and put him on his back.

Some time later we all managed to get out alive. That is how the story began that my daughter was raped by the same people.

She told me this story in the hospital in the first week after the rape and had the baby girl, not long ago now. She thought I should share this story with you guys."""
"A king is blessed with triplets. Rather than choose one as his heir, he separates the trio and sends each to a secluded island with a small retinue, to see which will grow up to be the most deserving of the throne. Continue the story:","

Luna is the daughter of a king and queen. The queen is dying, and Luna can be the only one who can bring her back. Luna has to choose between her two parents.

Cameron is the princess of a powerful race of warriors, the Centauri. When one of the warriors, the King of Caine, is murdered, she is sent to retrieve his body.

Luna is in danger: The queen has been poisoned by a group of Centauri who want to have their way with her once again, leaving Luna to decide who to have as heir.

Cameron is a thief by day and a warrior at night. He is betrayed by his lover because she believes his life is in danger, and he is forced to choose between his two lovers.

When play begins, you get a random starting hand of ten cards. You choose 5 from those and put them into your deck, one of the three ending cards per round.

The round continues until everyone has had a chance to use their hand of cards, or until they are drawn again for another round. In this last round, any player may choose to draw again and play their own card, for any number of sides that can be set.

As you draw, there is an element of chance attached to each decision made. For example, if you draw two 3 sides cards to fill your hand with 3 spaces, this will be counted as 3 spaces drawn, not 5. You may wish to give this a try if you want to win more hands. It will probably still be worth it.

We love this game, and don't want it to stop, because it was fun to play for a long long time, but we also love helping other players get into this fun and challenging game. We'd like to do some fun stuff with the game. We believe in giving the best possible experience, but that doesn't mean we are the only ones out there who love this game as much as we do. So we are starting an open beta to give all of you an amazing game you can try out.

Why Kickstarter

You may have seen a few of our stretch goals and wonder why we would do this. One of the major reasons is to improve what we have already. We have already added many great things to Luna:

New rule: In the game, if there is an amount of tiles on the board that cannot be completed in 10 turns, or more tiles that cannot be completed in 5 turns, then you draw the next 10 to complete it. You get to decide which tiles you want to draw. When you select a tile, if it is incomplete it stops or it is marked as'stalled'. For further clarification, the'stalling of' a tile is the amount of 'cost' that it takes to finish it, and for reasons that remain unclear, it can be up to two tiles.

New Rule: In a round, if there is an amount of time left for someone to play their hand of cards for another player, he must make sure it is worth it. If he cannot do it, no more cards may be played for that round. This means if you have just played a game of Luna and have enough mana you can continue playing. There are some rules of this that we need to clarify very soon but we are confident it will also be a fun and challenging alternative to Dominion. If it is the case that at least 2 players still don't have enough mana to play the board at least once, then there is a 'play to reserve' phase in which any player whose turn it is can choose to play any cards he wants not already playing for them. This can include non-playable cards that require mana, even if it will just be to keep up a temporary'stalling' position.

New Rule: All of the cards in the deck are played, once an opening is drawn for the new round. Every time it is drawn, it is drawn again before the new round begins. As a result, at the start of the round, you do not know the order that the rest of your deck will be played. However, once the game starts, you can see the cards that have already been played, and their respective opening order.

New Rule: When two players draw three cards at the same time"

The Future

The world is coming to an end. You and I are the last generation who lived there (or maybe for millions of years; we don't know). The entire planet will be a different place, with a different human species living there on the same day every 100 years. The Earth will become a desert — with little to no water available. In the end, there will be no more water to drink.

Humanity's planet will also be destroyed (or perhaps rebuilt) in the asteroid impact, and with it, mankind.

We know we can't save it all, but perhaps we can find ways to preserve the last pieces of humanity on Earth by getting a little bit of the planet's last remaining water."
Sinking Continue the story:," 'They said he could die on the bridge' ""The woman stood up to tell a crowd to turn away from the bridge, but was thrown to the ground by several protesters. ""As a result, Mr Thompson died as a result of his violent encounter with the protestors,"" the report said.

""The woman is to be charged with murder."" It said the police had refused to identify the man they later arrested because of his ""significant age"" and refused to allow him to attend court. The report criticised the officers concerned: ""All three officers in question seemed to lack leadership qualities, despite being members of a policing force which is under threat by the actions of the protestors and appears to have missed the significance of the events in the city of Charlottesville.""

The report said the protests at the rally had a ""chilling effect"" on people of the town and had taken its toll on the region's tourism industry. It warned of a future which could not be overlooked in the long-term development of that region, such as the construction of a new arena and stadium for the Washington Redskins and expansion of major sports facilities. The area which had the most severe casualties was Roane County, which is about 100 kilometres north of Charlottesville. Local businessman Daniel Jorgensen said he believed aertonation of protesters made the town's economy less able for future development in the area. ""Charlottesville is the biggest single source of tax income. There has been a drop in tourism,"" Mr Jorgensen told Fairfax Media. ""I cannot see the city going anywhere for a very long time."""

The Force Skills

Force Agility

This skill is the ultimate in lightsaber combat strategy. It will help you use your energy as you fight through the action of battles. Force agility improves your attacks by allowing you to move laterally without slowing or even affecting your damage. When you are attacked, move away and use your energy to negate their effects before they damage you. Force agility will greatly assist you in fighting in the dark side.

Force Point Cost

The Force Points required to unlock this level are listed above.

Your Force powers start with the Force points below. You may get more by defeating certain enemies, such as the Dark Jedi, the Darkside of the Death Star.

Or else you had to run up and down the front stair, which was only two steps. You got tired after a while-and people stopped asking so many questions.'' And then the whole story got even worse. At some point, people started to make things up around her predicament. Like, say, that she was a man who, when faced with the need to ""crouch and squirm and hunch"" to find a way out, turned to the only person around who would listen-the only person left alive-and asked, ""...and what if I was not a man?"" One of my best friends said, ""You should've gotten a new job."" I couldn't believe that could be the case, because I was a fairly well known, hard-working, friendly, open-minded, non-creepy person. How could a young, energetic girl turn down the same kind of working-class, smalltown experience with the same kind of high quality? But that is exactly what happened. She was able to convince people that she was not a man, and so for the next several years she worked at the factory, then she worked, then she studied social work-and finally she married the head engineer. This was, of course, to save money for their kids' future education. They married around 1991, and by 1995 she had no family of her own. In this new, better, easier world, the woman started to talk of ""dancing,"" and she became the Dougie Jones character in the movie 'Inception.' What we could see when watching the movie is that the woman had no way to express herself, and when people would say something to her, she would either stammer or give a half-apology at the last second before saying it again. Of course, everyone knew how this song ended, because the man told the woman she must take her dancing to the next level, if she wanted to get back to being a man. If anyone had ever thought that the situation can somehow be reversed departereally, it can only be a complete fool. The woman had become so used to it that she never was able to diminished anymore. In spite of this, and with the help of the man's help, she could never leave the factory. If it had been my daughter-in-law, my wife, her friends, and my parents-I wouldn't even have bothered trying to get her out. I'd have called the police or some other authority and let them do the deed. At this point, the@@@#%ing woman had become the biggest, most successful human being I have ever known. She loved and had loving relationships with her family. She helped all her employees, and was open in her teaching. She and her new husband had ER-ready marriages. She and her new husband had careers in medicine and consulting. She was a good mother, and her life was full of kindness. In the course of her life, she made many great friends that are still in their lives, and some of her closest family members still live in the family house with herupthe house. She was a devoted person, and for that, I am truly happy. My life is filled with good people, and this fact is very important to me. I hope that people will also realize what a gift it has been for them, because I'm sure they will appreciate for a long time. The man said to me one day, ""What happened to that guy next door? They're still asking that question. He's gone now, and I don't know what's going to take his place. But all I know is that we need to get to a place where no one can take advantage of people, because it's the only thing that saves us. There's got to come a new way of thinking about things, and we can't let people take advantage of it anymore. And if I can be of any help in that, you better hurry up and start doing that."" And so, that is how my life ended. And there's one more thing. I never mentioned any of this before, but I got to know that he was a very wise man. The only ones on earth have the right to ask questions. They are the ones who need to take personal responsibility for the lives they and others lead. And the same may be true for me.

In my family. When we play games, I'm usually the one that gets the game in trouble. My mom and dad got tired of watching me play video games and would often try to encourage me to stop, but I kept on. At my sister's wedding, after two years of playing video games with our family, my sister decided my sister shouldn't go to her baby shower because a friend, who was a little older, would be there while I was gone. There were other arguments between my parents, who had been through the same situation, but they lost that particular argument every time.

I'm getting ready to go to my dad's job opening and have to move my stuff out the moment my mom gets pregnant. I've been looking at job postings for more than two years and can't find any openings where the requirements are simple. Maybe one day I'll find them, but until then, I'm going to have to work until I have a new job.

I always liked it when games went against expectations and helped people, even if they didn't win. My grandma taught me how to play when I was little, but no one ever told her that if she wanted to play games, she shouldn't. Now that she's 70, she won't stop talking about how games let you outrun people.

I love games, but have a hard time playing them by myself. I'm always in a good mood when my children aren't around, and have never been upset by the ""I'm not the perfect mommy you all wanted to see"" comments I've received. Playing with them makes me feel like I'm the best mom ever.

For that bridge, the 'dakar name means not to lose a hand.' I was in France. I was home.""

As he approached the center of the bridge, he stopped and caught a few eyes. One of them looked up, caught his eye, and then his eyes stopped and his hand began to move. That was it.

""It was the kind of moment where you are lost in the moment, and you don't really even know what is happening. It was just a feeling.""

It's there from the moment you first put a pedal to the ground or, better still, when you stop pedaling. Cycling is so much more than a sport or a hobby. It's just a life. A person is always the first person to acknowledge this truth. Because you will never feel this way again.

But you might not believe that just yet. Probably because the moment of truth comes only once, maybe twice a year, maybe even only once every few years, maybe even once every decade or more. And maybe only you will ever have that, or maybe you will feel the truth and suddenly everything else comes along for the ride. Maybe every time they do something.

It happens at some time every time you move around. And if that something else is just your life, then you just can't go on like you have now.

The first and most important time to acknowledge this truth is often a good old ride in the woods to a place like Craggy Range in Oregon. The forest offers you privacy and solitude but also a certain amount of danger and a kind of wonderment. The path through the woods provides insight on what's in front of you and what's behind you. It reveals new paths and different options within the forest. The paths and pathways in Craggy Range and many places like it were formed when people were starting out on what was to become a way of life. But, once the mountain bike riders showed up, those paths were cut off and they were forced to take what they could to get up or down from the mountains. That's when they were forced to take out their climbing sticks, their long poles and their poles that they used to strap on to trees.

Those poles were not good for much but, as soon as they were used, they weren't very good either because if you were wrongfooted, you either slid down the hill or fell. This is the truth in Craggy Range and other places like it. The same truth that, if you're on a bike, the moment you are first in the woods is often the moment when you know everything is okay. That you did what you were meant to do and everything is just as you left it, everything you have is now yours and nothing more. The true and most glorious freedom. The kind of freedom that you need to remember in order to get the job done.

For example, if you just go around a bit and then there are three places up ahead of you. Maybe those three spots are a good idea. Maybe you find one where the grass starts to grow really fast and the path becomes so easy in comparison with what you already know how to do that you just need to just keep going to keep it going. That kind of thing. Then when you get to one of those spots, you might find that the grass is kind of slow to grow. If you're on a bike, then just keep going and you've already been traveling long enough. You might do well and"

[It is discovered that the ""rescue squad"" is actually a mole, an alien that was placed there by those that have no clue about the true nature of the ship. We later find out that his intelligence is due to the fact that his intelligence is much too weak to read.]


A.J. Jansen:...that was a lot of aliens. I have never heard such a huge fleet. I'm going to have to take a look around and see how many aliens... The rescue party...


[The aliens come to kill M.P. to protect herself.]


A.J. Jansen: This is not your call, M.P.! Take me to the airlock.


Mole: I cannot! I know the alien language! I had a good run! Just remember that we are the ones that can protect you! Don't take any chances!


[She is pulled out of her suit and put inside another, which explodes. A.J. is now inside the airlock.]


A.J. Jansen: That was enough!


Logan: Oh, is that what this is all about? Well, he's really a nice guy. A really nice guy, even. A really nice guy.


A.J. Jansen: Yeah. Good, you are very kind.


[M.P. is back to normal, and they thank Logan for what he's done.]


A.J. Jansen: You may now leave.


Ahead of the next scene A.J. is talking to someone. It's unknown what it is.

J.A. Jansen: You've got to give them time to figure out what the hell's going on. But no one wants to come back alive. It's almost too awful to think about.


[M.P. wakes up as she gets a text.]


M.P.: Hi.


A.J. Jansen: What is it?


M.P.: A message from David Logan.


A.J. Jansen: Yes, yes, you've heard everything. But I need you to listen to this message. Don't tell his superiors!


M.P.: What? I'm sorry, I got confused.


[A.J. talks about Logan's previous contact. M.P. is surprised to hear it from me, especially after what he tried to do.]


A.J. Jansen: The aliens are coming to get you again. They thought you were a security risk. They're coming to find you out of their base.


M.P.: Well, they did make a mistake back at D'Zaro. They thought that they could get me in without a fight. But then one of the messengers showed up, and he said - he - you saw, didn't you, M.P.? One of the messengers said, you have to put up with the aliens. He said: you have to live.


A.J. Jansen: Why me?


M.P.: Well because you haven't tried. They say that if you don't fight against the aliens, they lose everything.


A.J. Jansen: Huh?


M.P.: They say if you don't stand against them, they lose everything. Even the peace that we have worked so hard for. The whole purpose of this universe is to keep things moving forward.


A.J. Jansen: But you've always been strong.


M.P.: I have, but here I'm really struggling.

Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Continue the story:," You'll end up in the same place as the protagonist. (To get there: read the whole thing, and in the last five pages of the book, say something that could, if done right, be interpreted as a metaphor. ""If I had tried to get out of my house in the rain I might have killed someone,"" for instance.) But be aware that the writer doesn't want the reader to think of the protagonist's own life as something to be regretted, and so the metaphor will be as necessary as the story of that life, to the point that there was a huge price (of time, frustration, money) to pay in order to escape from the house that day. Remember that the main point of this kind of trick is to make you feel like you've escaped the house and, from that, maybe get a glimpse of something the reader hasn't seen before. Of course you will eventually regret it, but only for one day. Remember: You're a coward if you don't enjoy a little discomfortUnix

What follows are the techniques I use from my experience in writing. Let me know if someone else might use them, as I do at least half a dozen.

1. Give yourself permission to say things you don't particularly like. That way your story will be, by the end, a lot less empty. You won't always be thinking about the thing being said. Instead, you'll be thinking about the way you should like it said.

2. Don't say too much about your life experiences, or about what you find ""normal."" ""Normal"" is something you're likely to have in the world; don't think about what you ""don't like about life."" A lot of what you dislike may have something to do with your being normal. If there's one thing you should never do, it's to write a book about what makes you uncomfortable.

3. Try not to be a perfectionist. Writing is really a kind of art. A better way of saying that is that it can only make sense when you're trying to put yourself into someone else's shoes. Sometimes a piece of writing succeeds as a mirror of your own. If you make yourself feel like the writer, the next step should be to create a mirror of yourself. You're already looking in those eyes. But it takes a fair amount of self-consciousness to figure out how to present yourself as you really are. I think that even if you write like an ordinary person, you will still have a better opinion of yourself from it, because of what the mirror shows. You may think that this or that attitude is wrong, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try Magesin. A real man is a kind of a caricature of himself, and writing as a parody of others is a kind of satire that has to be taken seriously when it exists.

4. Don't tell me what I want. I have to be able to tell what's needed to tell, so get in before you tell anything. There is a point where you need to leave everything to the author, just as in the movies a director will take a picture or make a movie or a story. There Retail, however, is very much a film, and a piece of writing requires the same kind of control. Be prepared for things to go off the rails while writing. Don't worry if you screw up as soon as you hear about some failure. Don't feel that you were doing anything to be criticized. Just make use of the feedback and know that it might mean something to you as well.

5. Be careful about saying what you don't want to say. This is a problem as old as writing itself. There was once a time when everyone said what they did want to say. Sometimes that had practical value, but sometimes that left a lot of room for confusion. Then the practice changed. A lot of good stuff was started when writers realized that it couldn't hurt to say exactly what they had in mind -- and it helped to prevent over-reliance on the writer as a source of advice. It was good to have a little control in writing that was an important part of our human nature. The same thing can hold good in writing: The best ways to avoid stumbling into writing clichés come not from outside but from within -- from the person telling the story or the author's own experiences. That is especially important in novels, because these have been the most successful medium of communication since literacy. You can't just rely on how well you can talk about your feelings; you have to create a situation where writing is a natural process for you. Try not to write yourself into a corner.

"Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Continue the story:","

It begins like this:

This is the fourth year of our year long journey from China. I'm a 22 year old girl and I am now 23. In order to make it in this industry, a lot of things have to change. I'm from Beijing, which isn't the most popular city for a female actress, so I started from the bottom and slowly worked my way up. Recently I made some really good connections, and because of that, I got into the lead roles in some big films. The good thing is, people are starting to notice me now. Some actresses only get hired if they have some good stories behind them. Because of that, a lot of people are starting to realize that I'm one of their favorites!

In the letter to her parents, her boyfriend, the director, a producer, a director's assistant, and her agent, she asks them to let her make it to the top. And she tells them you can make it only if you work hard at it.

Some of the things she lists: You shouldn't worry about being cute. You shouldn't worry about not looking hot. You shouldn't worry about being a good actress. You should trust your instincts, and you should keep a smile on your face. You are worth much more than what many people think of you (you are not only an actress, but also a cool person). Everyone has their own strengths and their own weakness. You don't have to follow anyone or make one rule (you don't have to always answer to those who ask you anything). You shouldn't always answer to others and answer to yourself. Be bold, be yourself, and be willing to make mistakes.

Some of the quotes she includes:

Actors, you shouldn't keep it a secret whether you work hard or not. Even if you have the best friends, you shouldn't be afraid to take care of them. Always keep your cool attitude no matter what the situation. Trust your instincts. Don't be afraid to fail. You cannot be happy unless you are giving 100%. Don't give up. You are valuable. Be your own person.

In a second letter, she explains that this is because she is not the typical girl and is only the type of girl that gets rejected.

When I'm rejected a lot by male friends, I think of it like, so what? You never know what happens to you when you lose it. I learned a long time ago that they may look at me as an ugly, dumb and slutty person, or they may just view me negatively. But that's not the end of the story. Once I go into a negative state, there are a lot of things that can happen to me that would make me lose it. I have told my parents about my feelings and they don't help me.

Finally, she ends the letter with the line ""I love you"", and she's very thankful and happy about it. She asks her parents to write at that time as well.

For more information about Yiwu and what she said about the rejection experience, read this article on China Daily.

Kill the dog outside the house where you find the skull. 5. Kill the dog in the room with the candle. 6. Kill the dog in the graveyard. 7. Kill the dog in the house with the lantern. 8. Kill the dog in Old Nick's house, you need to keep him alive with a few punches and a couple of hits to the head. 9. Kill the dog if you can walk over to the dog's head. 10. Kill the dog if you have to run away from it. 11. Kill the demon if he shows up somewhere. 12. Kill the dog if you have to hide. The story is very difficult but you can do it eventually... 13. Kill the dog if you have to hide. In Old Nick's home you will fight the dog twice. The first time he just hides away, but after you beat him some more (it is a very, very difficult battle; make sure that you leave with the skull.) If you die, Old Nick will be angry and will follow you. Just go back to town and go upstairs and you can talk to him again. Before you go downstairs you can steal the skull, if you have a lock (and maybe some keys or a key to a chest somewhere) you can use it to escape. If you have some key pieces you can try to find it. Remember, if you die you need to return home to the shop (which you cannot normally do.) If you walk the fence to the other side you can reach the main entrance. It is a short walk to the exit. There is a wooden door in the church that leads to the castle's library, you can get into the Library if you use the door next to the door to the castle. This is just a precaution to make sure you don't wander into the castle and get scared. The library is just a secret (or at least a very good secret.) You can go here, in addition to that, you can also enter a room with a chest under the window. This chest contains a small blue gem that you have to search the book inside. If you look on the page that is about something it lists the person who is the book's author. I found this book by accident. If you talk to some of the people in the library for this book and then look at the page on the book itself I think you can get the info to it. This is what I found: ""G.W.R.R."" (with a question mark) on the last page is the name of the author. It also lists the person who wrote it. The rest of it you can find if you remember which book you found. I can see that the book will go up to the author if you get the same book again. The last three lines that give you the information on the last book on the list are that same person. The page says that it was written by a small man in a grey coat and on the other end it says the book will expire soon. What it was I cannot recall. However a friend of mine from South America pointed this out, and says that the person does refer to the author and the author (who is named after the author's grandson) in it. I guess you know if what the author wrote was important for you, or just a coincidence. Of course you could try this method without any luck at all. If you have nothing to hide and no luck in getting the last book you could also try this method.

Note: you need also turn left two times so that you can go straight up to the top of the pillar next to where you are standing. On the wall on the right side there is another secret behind it. If you turn down the next pillar with a torch you will find a book. I found it in the bookshop.

It is a ring that is ""gouvated"" (meaning that it protects the wearer from magic, but if the wearer uses magic he or she loses contact with their amulet and as such all magic will not work on them.)"

3 years ago we ran into two different kinds of people insimply because they lived in different places. In fact, it is not only the people who are different in different places, in which people of different religions, races and economic statuses live and work. The inhabitants of different nations are different in a variety of ways. People grow up in cultures without which no one living in the city will grow up. So no one will grow up as an American. Not if you are Chinese. To be Chinese in a place is like having the same set of genes as people living in California and New York. Continue reading …

The same goes for the people who are different in their social background. They could be the same in their race, their age, their background and their social status as well. It is a phenomenon known as the social structure. The social structure of society, from a social science standpoint, is the framework of social interactions that exist between individuals in all societies. Continue reading …

2 years ago we heard that China had a problem with the internet and were concerned about the internet and the development of computers. This is a serious matter, considering that the development of computers is a very important Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which connects people within and outside China at will. We are concerned about the development of computers because of their huge potential to serve the economic growth and the social life of the entire world.

In China, people do not really trust the media. That is because the Chinese authorities are heavily involved in the media, including the media in China. In particular, the internet and the public are the two things that most people do not trust, because these are essentially things that are not under the control of any government. Continue reading »

I used the usual techniques of the trade, but Jake wasn't quite my type - neither was the rest of the Empire. Even his closest friends were already well-armed - and I knew it."" The Dark Lord smiled. ""It worked out for the best - Jake's death and I were now able see eye-to-eye."" Continue the story: ""By the time I left, I'd spent enough time on the streets, with my new found freedom, that I wasn't surprised that anyone would take my head if they were put on trial for the murders of all those last days, and for everything else that had happened to me. But I was very much the exception, a person who understood that if I were ever caught in the crossfire of this business, I was only a small part of the Imperial fleet - one I'd been hoping to be forgotten about altogether. To see the Empire burn down as its people were being slaughtered, and the only ones to blame was me... that was a pretty terrible feeling.""

""What? I'm not a murderer anymore…""

""You are a murderer. If you're so convinced that you'd never leave the shadows of the underworld, I suggest you consider the consequences of your actions - and start running sooner rather than later.""

If the Dark Lord chooses to remain silent, the Dark Lord says, ""Your actions are now my responsibility - but not yours.""

If the Dark Lord changes sides:

""I see you don't understand. You are now a member of a special army, and so will be subject to all the punishments that the Imperial Guard and Imperial Security Forces impose when caught with such an agent."" If any of this is said before the Dark Lord is killed: ""I can hardly believe it myself, but my old friend is now a true traitor. I believe I gave it all up because the Dark Lord and the Empire needed me more than I needed the Empire."" ""I'm sorry, but if you don't want to help me destroy this rebellion - then you must kill me."" You are immediately executed (or die of old age, if that happens) ""What happened?"" ""I didn't realize that you'd become part of the rebellion. Your actions were so senseless."" ""You didn't kill me - you're the traitor."" If the Dark Lord is killed: ""I've done enough for the Empire in this lifetime. I'm tired of being their tool."" ""If you've done all that for them, why were you killed by one of the least likely men in the galaxy?"" ""That was the Dark Lord's problem."" If any part of this is said before the Dark Lord is killed: ""And yet there's something missing - your old friend. How's that feeling? The Emperor needs him, you know?"" I have nothing to say to her. ""Oh, for heaven's sake. You've killed my Dark Lord."" If any part of this is said after the Dark Lord is killed: ""I never had a Dark Lord to speak to - I was never truly a part of the Empire, but now I was finally free to speak my mind and fight against your oppression."" ""Do you really want that kind of revenge? I'm tired of having my enemies destroy me.""

Additional information

It is revealed that a few rebels were killed prior to the death of the Dark Lord by the Dark Lord: the first is the leader of Red Hand, the group made up of Tarkin, R2-D2, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, and Finn. They had been sent by Tarkin to get more information about what happened to the fleet and to find any spies, but as they were not armed to fight back on Nar Shaddaa, they were murdered by the Dark Lord.

Following the Dark Lord's death, Leia reveals the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. She then reveals that the Emperor has died and that he has become one of the five Imperial Super Commandos. These are known collectively as the Dark Lords. The Death Star plans are also revealed that during the Imperial occupation in the Millennium Falcon they hid Han and Chewbacca within the hull of the Dark Lord's ship.[6]"
You are a serial killer. Each murder you commit adds a new voice to your head. Continue the story:," Murder mystery, murder drama, murder puzzle...or whatever the next killer is.


- Complete the story with any of the available killers to unlock an additional story.


The voice of the killer was actually a voice actress we'd work with. You can choose either the original or all the sounds of different sounds from the game, choose all the audio to listen to as you play the game (to do so: open the microphone at the end of the game and choose the ""Sound Effects"" option in the main menu), see and hear exactly at that moment when the killer starts the audio, change the voice while listening from any of the available voices. See and hear the voices from the first playthrough.


If you need a voice actor for the same character over again, pick a new one!


The voice actors will follow all the same instructions as with the story. You need to complete the story a certain number times, and keep track of the final result so that only each killer can unlock the story. If you start the story and the voices don't register correctly, you need to restart with the correct one afterwards.


You cannot unlock this version if you're still playing the original game and its voice actor.


As part of this campaign, we're also including additional voice actresses by the name of Sarah Green, Rebecca Sowards, Michelle Walker, and Heather Jones. (Sarah Green also voices the main character in a few episodes of the game.)


The voices will be unlocked in the campaign as a single downloadable pack, available for immediate download and use.


Please note with this version that the level of difficulty is higher. If you want the previous games at a higher difficulty, start at the beginning and unlock with other killers, or simply enjoy the story that way!


THE STORY:

There is something evil in our world and it has been locked away for centuries. No one knows or thinks about the evil it does. This evil is the monster that was named the ""Ripper"". However, those who survived this horrible event were not able to face it but instead became evil themselves! They destroyed entire towns at this terrible and horrible event. Only a few of the survivors are still alive. The Ripper, the one who went to the end of the world alone to kill, has risen for some unknown reason.


If any one of you have experienced an evil or evil activity and have wanted a more detailed, terrifying and frightening version of the story? Or maybe you have heard a story of a similar event from other people? Then this game definitely meets your needs!


The game features a story unlike anyone else! It is a story that you cannot hear any words of at first until you reach the first act in the game. You will not be able to tell the difference on the same level if you play the same story at the beginning of the game. It is notGDPR compliant nor will we protect your information. Please read this carefully before you download this game. This game contains:


• The original game, complete with all the sounds of the original game.

• Audio recordings of the many killers that you will play in the game.

• Each voice actor you find in person in all the locations of the game.

• A ""Special Edition"" with a new story in the sequel if you have completed the original game and want to play it again with all the sounds of the game.

• A bonus chapter that gives you some additional information about the whole story.


Included are additional voices of the ""Maidens of Earth"" series, the ""The Red Skull"" series as well as an additional voice actor from the TV show ""American Horror Story"" from which we decided our inspiration for this game and this voice actor. And, finally, if you want to listen to the voices of other people, pick up the first voice actor and listen to them separately with your own ear.

"You have been kidnapped by the mafia, the reason? Someone who 's very high up has a child who has a crush on you. Continue the story:","

We are a group of children trying to find out the truth about what has happened to us.

But what did they do to you?

They brought us to a place where there were black bodies around.

Did some other children have this reaction?

Yes. They said that we were taken and killed there.

What does this remind you of?

Well, there was a place where there were black bodies.

But why was there this place?

There must have been some reason behind it. Then we heard voices.

Where were you taken?

We had to go to the side of a wall.

In what time, under what conditions, from what source?

We know that, at one point, about 4.5:00 a.m., some boys walked in and said that this was a place where they were killed.

But they were killed within five minutes?

Yes, when they left the place, they disappeared in a blink of an eye.

Who was there?

A boy who was with three other boys.

What place, where?

Two blocks away from the mall.

What was the situation when you went there?

It was a small, dirty little area—somebody was playing football there. We thought that we were going to find some new friends. We were waiting for a bus while we were taking pictures of something. And we were waiting because we were afraid that we were going to find them all dead or dead and left alone in the street again.

You got there just in time.

That's right. Then these men, who had heard the voices and went and found me, started yelling at us.

Who told you that this was a real, real place.

And they told us that it was a fake. They said that these two guys would come and take us back.

When?

I don't know but this morning…

Today.

But we were on May 13. On the way to the mall.

But what did they do the next day?

They took us inside, and they told us that they would keep us there for a little while and then they'd get us back on the bus. When we were outside, they beat us. One by one, they were hitting us. The beating started and they did the same to the others.

They had these masks and the masks we see them wearing.

Yes. And we had to look around for those things—scared when we had to look as well. They had masks, and they pulled them off and burned them, as though they would hurt us no longer—you couldn't really see anything—when they burned them.

And these were the masks they wear at this place?

Yes.

What did they keep around on these masks?

This bag—we have to go get the bag. I don't know what it was. And that's that.

A bag of things?

Yes.

Have you eaten here in the past?

No. I would like to find a few things. I would like to eat something.

What would it be?

Cinnamon? I have a little bag in the car. Do you want something?

I don't understand. Why did you bring me here?

I'm here.

What I say is, I'm here to get the bag. And if this is the case, then you can go. You're asking for some help. And this isn't the time to waste anymore time. We're in the situation of making life difficult for you, because you are the last hope. You are a man that we can trust. A man who, by our luck, has brought us out of the hell we were in together. That is something that we can count on.

Thank you very much."

Write a murder from the perspective of a cheerful inanimate object Continue the story:," Continue reading at a newsstand in ""A Murder,"" a memoir by a woman who wrote a serial killer's memoir of her life and murder.

In February, it will be 35 years since the unsolved murder of Jennifer Beals, who was dumped in Santa Barbara, Calif., with two of her children and her car, which was found with no apparent clues. She disappeared shortly before she was scheduled to move back to Georgia.

She was found in a remote area on Aug. 15, 1976.

On Thursday, one of the police officers from the case — now a reserve sheriff's spokesman for Santa Barbara County — will lead a short ceremony where the crime has been retold from various viewpoints. Authorities are asking anyone who knew Beals to be at the event to share their stories, as well as those from around the globe, as they attempt to find answers about why the 18-year-old's murder may be linked to a few others.

Also on Thursday, two of Beals' sisters — Sandra, who was a 16-year-old at the time she was found, and Cynthia, a 21-year-old — will be honored for their remarkable support during the investigation and her final days.

""Their courage was incredible,"" said Sheriff's deputy Jeff Anderson.

Anderson said that their role in the case came as no surprise.

""They would tell you this is not going to be a cold case,"" he said. ""Most of those cold cases never come to fruition, so we are not shocked they don't come to fruition.""

And in the years since Beals' unsolved murder, a number of people have come forward to assist.

In the years following her murder, people who knew Beals through high school and on the school bus wrote her memoir and have been interviewed by detectives about ""a few suspects and the case,"" Anderson said.

The day she was killed, Beals' phone had been broken into and replaced with a telephone in a locked room, investigators said.

Police then found Beals' car stuffed with clothing and her personal effects including her journal and journal notebooks.

The car had been stolen from the home of a man she met at a Santa Barbara-area high school.

Anderson said the motive in Beals' murder was probably ""self-defense.""

""It was a murder,"" he said.

In a letter to the Sheriff's Department in 2003, a man who was a neighbor of Beals said her car had been ""stolen on a whim."" He said he was told that she was planning on moving out of state with her children.

""If she hadn't had the phone, this thing wouldn't have happened,"" the resident said.

Though Beals had been to an art center and art fair in Georgia, her last Facebook post was on Aug. 31, 1976. An article posted that day on that site stated that a ""murder in the woods"" had apparently been committed.

At the time, Beals was 16 years old and would also be known as ""Jett.""

""The victim,"" it went on, ""was found with her two children and her car, which had been stolen from the home of a male acquaintance.""

At that time, no arrests had been made and the identity of the assailant was classified as being unknown. That was until October, when it was said that there were four suspects and the case ""might have been solved based on extensive forensic analysis.""

According to investigators, the car used in Beals' killing was a 1972 Ford LTD Taurus which had been stolen at a dealership in Georgia.

Beals was an avid cyclist, according to the coroner which found that it was found covered with blood, nails, clothing and a dent in the back fender.

Her husband at the time of her disappearance was a ""nice man"" said the sheriff. She had six children and one of those children was a girl about 12 years old.

The sheriff said the two older children — Sandra Beals and Cynthia Beboxing — became estranged from their mother and the younger ones, Jennifer Beals andengthy older brother Brandon, became an issue.

During the next several years, Beals moved away from Santa Barbara and returned to Georgia each of the three times she went on vacation.

As her story circulated through online communities during the past three decades, Anderson said that ""people are very intrigued"" by Beals militantly ""coming out,"" as she called it, ""sooner or later.""

The community online community ""Lets Talk Serial Killers"" has a name change that involves a serial killer, though the sheriff said it doesn't necessarily have something to do with the Beals case. Anderson noted that the name the sheriff uses when talking about Beals involves a serial killer.

Not enough money for your next vacation? You need more money to stay alive. You want to get rid of your husband of thirty years? You can do this by murdering him for a huge salary. Just for the fun of it. Your partner won't be dead for very long. But don't worry. You can legally get married to him just for the fun of it! The woman in the story gets arrested after the murder is committed. Her life is in jeopardy: The mother of the child is not allowed to have contact with her child, the wife of the victim must die, and that child will not be alive for very long. And you think it can't get worse? A couple who want to marry is arrested after the crime is committed. They may commit the murder of their partner, but they will be allowed to be married. This was a typical of the stories I read. The only question on my mind was how to survive under these conditions. I could tell by the expressions of the reader that we all find ourselves in similar situations. If you think about it, it is no wonder that the most brutal murders are committed by people who are also in love. It is common to see victims dying before we realize it. If you think about it, love is really a vicious circle, and we are only a little bit ahead of it. As you can see, it cannot be helped. We must accept this situation and deal with it. The only way out is to learn to cope. We must learn how to overcome that which we cannot do away with. Because what's more horrible than this, is this: There are no solutions. You are in a situation in which you can neither help yourself nor help another, and this can no longer be helped. The only thing that can be used against you are your own thoughts and your own deeds. Let me give you just a few examples of the kind of things we try to resist: What is going on on the other side? Do you want to end up like these people in these stories? Do you want to keep living with them? If you refuse to accept that there are no solutions, and think that the only way forward, is by destroying your life, and thus ending yourself, then you will end up like them. There will never be any peace for you. It is up to you if you decide to keep fighting. That is the only way to save yourself and others in the future. The one who starts to let go is in danger. If they are not prepared for this situation, then sooner or later they will end up killing themselves. If you end your life too soon, you will not leave any living relatives behind. They won't be there for!. As a final word, the only way to survive in such an environment? To learn to cope with the horrible world that we live in. That is the only way we can survive, for at this time there is nothing we can do. That means we have to learn to accept that there is nothing we can do, that our life is meaningless. It is up to us to learn to deal with this reality, and it will be the best possible outcome of this experiment."

'' Continue the story:"," - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I was an adult, my little brother was a teenager. On weekends, when we grew up, we went to his house to play. We spent our evenings laughing and playing as our parents had taught our brother and me how to behave in front of the children to avoid their wrath. I didn't even understand the way we used the play time in our parents' house; we didn't pay too much attention to what I think I should be doing. When I was a little older I began to understand more about playing the same with my brother. But there was a lot I didn't like about the way he played. After a while I got very angry and I told him to stop doing something that hurt us both. Once he told me to ""do it"", though if I'd had a choice I would have gone by myself to the store. When he said that to me it was as if I couldn't tell anyone. I cried and cried and cried. In the end I gave up and turned off the television. I've never told my brother the story but when I found out he had come to me I felt so guilty. I'm sure he was the one who didn't feel any pain as his little brother. When I left, I felt like I lost another part of myself, though my brother felt fine. When I left for school one of the first things I did was to stop watching TV as much as I could. It made me hate TV a little more than I felt like at the time. I didn't watch TV often until two years later I tried to watch it. The only reason I used to watch it was that I couldn't afford enough money to buy an HD cable. I did this because I thought some of the shows I watched were really good, like the ones with the bad actors. But in that season where the sitcoms are strong in popularity and the shows tend to stick around for more than a few years, some of the shows were doing badly. I started to regret turning off the show and I found that I enjoyed it just a little less than before. Once during my junior year of high school I went to the library to see one of the DVDs I'd bought before I left. Once I saw it I thought for a moment that this was a very good show. I had never noticed how much I disliked this show but I was quite glad to find out that I did. I immediately watched it and thought it was better than all my previous ones. However, when I went to pick it up to make sure I was not imagining things before I got home I did not know that I also had just made a decision that made us very sad. I had turned out to be too good to go through all of those things. On the way home I was trying to convince myself that it wasn't because the show was so good that I enjoyed it but also because I was very unlucky. After a few nights of lying in bed, I decided that the show was great even though I was pretty miserable about it. LANE ON THE ROAD One evening I was taking a day trip by myself. I had been watching a few TV shows at the time I got home (as well as watching a lot of movies too) and it was a bit of a good time. But it was the only one I watched. I went outside of my apartment to visit an old friend of mine who lives further down in the neighborhood. I think this friend is my friend's father. We are a couple and live in the same neighborhood. It wasn't a special occasion, but still. The evening we were talking about my friend's mother I noticed that what I was doing was a bit strange. I got up from the table and went to the door of her house. I stood there for a moment and then went out of sight without anyone seeing me. When I came back to the table I felt as if all the things I had to do were a bit too much at the time. I walked slowly away from the table. When I was walking to the side of the road I suddenly thought ""It doesn't make sense to walk on the road, don't you think?"". I started looking around and asked myself why.

The United States is currently running a ""public awareness campaign"" about the upcoming asteroid impact.

This is what the campaign's official YouTube page looks like:http://youtu.be/hcGzZO0VU7M

This video, directed by NASA astronomer, shows the actual space agency's ""official"" video about it. It is an absolute disgrace. Even their English-language versionirlfails to say so:It is as if they had created this video from a third-person point of view, and it was not done at all thoughtfully or with consideration of the science. They are obviously just trying to attract public attention by throwing in some funny sounding rhetoric and in the process of making the scientific community look stupid. It is also not true that it will hurt NASA's reputation much at all.If the asteroid strikes and does kill any people, it will be a terrible loss to space history and to humanity as a whole. The damage would be relatively minor, in the range of less than a few centimetres, as compared to any other event that might come in the future. Even if it were to cause a massive disaster, it would hardly cause any more deaths than the current asteroid threats, such as when the Tunguska asteroid exploded over Siberia in 1908.In order to avoid the worst case scenario, the National Academies has recommended that people travel at night to make sure they are not near it at the wrong time. This would make them an extremely poor source of information if they can't see the impact but have the ability to see the horizon if the asteroid's path is blocked.There are quite a few other possibilities for disaster which could happen but I will not go into every possible thing they could have said, because this article is about the risk of an impact, not the possibilities. There is no ""worst case scenario,"" just the impact itself in this case. There is no good reason to ignore this, as most people would be able to do an initial check, see if it is safe to go to their homes, and figure out if that was even safe. The worst case scenario just happens to be what it happens, so it does not matter to them anymore.If they had chosen to make a better video, they would show the impact's effects first, which is a much better way of explaining what actually happened.The same should be done for all the other dangers of space, but the government will probably push for an exemption so that they can keep themselves from embarrassment. A better way, that I believe the actual scientists agree with is this:You are not going to read these and think ""Okay, I could be the next victim."" The best way to avoid the impact is to find a place on the face of the Earth where you will not be struck by the asteroid.If you find a place on the face of the Earth, don't go there until you are sure you are not going to be struck by an asteroid. For instance, if you are not coming into the earth's atmosphere at the moment, this is not an issue, because the Earth will not be at risk for many years. If you are going to fall down, that is another problem, because you will not be at the bottom of the ocean for much longer than you would have fallen down on the surface of the ocean if you died immediately.This would allow a person to go see what happens if anything happens and not immediately do something rash. The same applies if the asteroid hits in the middle of the night, because the atmosphere is not there yet.The worst case scenario would be if one person does something rash and gets killed, but the worst case scenario in general would be the exact opposite.If one person did something stupid and got injured, this would not be the disaster the world had been waiting for. The injury would not have been fatal. The rest of us would not have had to find a ""shelter in place"" for the remainder of our lives like we did last winter with the nuclear accident in Japan. But it would have been catastrophic.This is why the world is not putting all its eggs in one basket: they have taken precautions that are not enough to avoid their being in the path of such an impact. In fact, if there are no other things they can do before being struck, they should do what they can to avoid their being in the path of an impact at all and then just wait to see what happens. And they could even use their time in space to experiment with new technology or do some research that makes them happier there to the end of the trip where they are not facing any danger. I do not disagree with this at all.People sometimes get this idea that an asteroid would always hit if hit directly"
A soldier in the heat of battle suddenly hears a voice that says `` I am your child 's imaginary friend. They have sent me to protect you in your greatest time of need. '' Continue the story:," I was the biggest idiot I had ever seen, so I decided I had better get some kind of weapon. I called out to this imaginary boy to protect me, but he was no more than five feet tall, and I couldn't see his head. He started trying to hit the ground with his head, but it seemed to be made of paper. Then I realized just how stupid I was. I finally asked him if it was really real. With that he shot me through the belly. That's how it turned out. The man who sent me has now been killed. I was mortally wounded, but I have still got two arms and some ribs. If you ever hear me on the radio, tell me I am still alive. I never wanted to serve my country, but it was an obligation you have in the military. (This voice was played several times) My god, what a load of crap! I can't understand how it could have gotten past the gate, but the guys in charge took it literally and sent me to the hospital. I could barely get out of bed. My mother died a few weeks later. Now I have this man's body, a friend's body, and I've got no father, no mother... You know, if I was a man I'd kill anyone trying to give me an extra arm or a leg. You know, to protect the innocent. (This voice was played several times) They said, `If you are a man you must respect this man's body.' And that's about the last we spoke to each other. And you know what? It turned out you were right--I guess. This boy, my friend, this imaginary friend, is his father now. He's the father my father never had. A good man, my father, who was always there to tell me that what I am and what I do should never be seen as wrong or wrong to anyone. He gave me this body, my friend. He never wanted to kill me, it was simply an obligation you have in the military. And when I came in, I realized my country had fallen through the cracks. And now this girl who had never known what it was like with a father, but with my father, is a soldier. Now we don't have fathers, but we do have men's bodies and men's memories. I hope people see this and understand what it's like to be a true man.

Episode 5 - It's Still Just the Beginning Of Me The radio was a huge help. On that particular day I didn't have much else to eat at the base as they didn't offer much as breakfast to the troops who slept in air-conditioned tents and ate bread and water for what felt like a month in the military housing facilities. (The voice was played several times) You know... this isn't the way we wanted to hear it from our man, but I know you have some kind of agenda, and we had better not argue. I have always been honest. In fact, when I was in the military they used to joke about how I'd only tell the truth about a fight and never lie. So it's only fair that we get to hear the truth. This is the first one you've heard so far. The soldiers here who've been deployed to Iraq have all come home because of the way the administration decided to handle the war in Iraq. But they were put into high-risk jobs because of the political pressures to get America to fight for them. They were not heroes, they were glorified civilians who had to perform their jobs. While we don't have many of them, we do have the ones who fought there. To them, to know that their job wasn't so glamorous as they thought was hard to believe since they really lived in this world that we only understand by seeing it on TV. We all knew that war was terrible. But as tough and difficult as it is for Americans to imagine, it is a battle people actually have to go to. But when you hear what was happening, it is much worse. (This voice was played several times) When the invasion started, we weren't told what the troops would be doing over there. They told us it was going to be combat, fighting people on their own country, but you can imagine the emotions when you heard the news. (The voice was played several times) All of a sudden they opened fire on us, and not just us, but the soldiers from some of the other nations in Mideast. It was the only time the world I knew became war again. And our army was the first to lose a war. In Iraq we lost more than 1,000 soldiers in one week. The military was also overwhelmed at this point with the number of wounded, and"

Continue the story:," - I was ordered to make the last move - When I got to the first man they were saying I would be in trouble and there would be a bomb. - Then the captain ordered me to start running but I wasn't able to hold still - They didn't put some other guy next to me - Then I got a hold of my sidearm and started shooting - But all my shots missed

Pilot: We got about three bullets in us but the captain was very brave He was able to save us from a lot of damage... - Was the crew aware of what it was going to be like to find out where they were being held on a bridge by armed men? - At the end of the day there were two people missing - The pilot and his passenger - We were able to find out where we were

Captain: They took the pilot and his passenger with us and then we set foot on land, they took this boat and took us to the harbour It was very difficult to control us

The pilot: Well... it happened real fast - And then they took off and they landed here we saw this boat coming

Pilot: On the boat the guy was standing up looking for the bridge and they were driving up and down - and I had the same thought right in my head - Well we were going to be in trouble

Pilot: We saw the big boat come in there - We were going to be blown sky-high it was like a real tornado - And then we landed and they pulled us out - All nine people got back aboard that boat then we went over to that bridge

Pilot: This is how they did it - They had their guns under their seats - But we took the gun out and opened it and showed that we had loaded a shot

Pilot: Now they got it out and said they had an officer come on board to tell me how to get the boat open up again

Pilot: But after a while they said they will use a crane - And I said to the captain just tell me - Why were you using a crane? Why did you need it?

Pilot: I didn't know what to expect - I know my countryman got shot but not like this

Pilot: I called for help - I'm not a hero - I went to the bridge - He was lying in his boat trying to save his life - But then the captain stopped me and said he will shoot me in my back if I don't do what he tells me

Captain: Well I don't know if I did something right - I can't believe I shot him - He's not dead - He's hurt a lot but he's alive I'm happy he's alive

The pilot: Well he is still alive I'm telling him that - I didn't see what he was doing - Oh well that's OK - He is a good man who doesn't want that boat closed - He was trying to save his own life and his family's

Pilot: All I know is what was written in the ship papers - I never told anybody about the whole thing until this day

All aboard: We got back to the ship - We were just talking about what happend to my people

Pilot: All the people that I know - The ones who had to live with their fathers who are gone - I've got so many of them - If they were alive then you would still have some ones surviving today - There was nobody with me and everything was fine - There was nobody on this boat

Pilot: I went right up to the captain... it's OK - They gave us gas masks - And we were able to stay in an open area

All aboard: We started to tell him about them (the officers killed) - He was the last thing they wanted with the boat because he gave us the air conditioners and everything - It was terrible - We were trying to talk to him and nobody wanted to hear our voice the water was very cold

Pilot: They told us to go back to the ship - They said you are not left alive - If you want our help you have to go back to the ship and give us the information of who you're going to use for a rescue mission. - This is hard...

Pilot: They had all the air ducts off - They were cutting holes in them - And he cut a hole in the hull - Well the captain ordered me to come in there - I said no - I don't want to do any harm to that captain - My family needs me - I feel it

Pilot: I didn't know any of what would happen if we went back with him - But the captain ordered me on - He told me to jump up against the side of the boat and go down into the water"

4. A New President

As we know, when there are elections in November and Congress returns in January, it takes a period of four to six weeks for everyone to understand both legislative and executive branch activity. This is a fact that many people don't understand. The President will have the opportunity to use a new Congress to get things done. I intend for this to be the case and I'll be working with congressional leaders to do everything I can to keep the new Congress focused on getting things done.

Congress should also have several weeks to prepare the ground for President Obama to take the White House after the election. Congress will be out of session for eight weeks during the campaign. President Obama will need to meet with a range of public and private sector leaders to establish the path forward for moving the federal government forward. The public is extremely crucial in making this happen, and I trust you will support my efforts to ensure the new President can get things done quickly.

I will work hard to advance the goals of the Affordable Care Act. This is an issue which no one has made a serious issue. Unfortunately, many people, including some who voted against the new health care reform act, are deeply committed to a vision of health care as a vehicle of wealth creation. This vision has been distorted by a very specific coalition of conservative lawmakers, conservative consultants, and interest groups. We will not be able to fix the ACA by repealing all the good parts of it. Instead, we will help improve on the very provisions our enemies would be most grateful about. A broad coalition of health care reform supporters including Democrats, independents, Republicans, and decorated military veterans is also ready to work on this issue.

One of my earliest priorities will be to address the cost of prescription drugs. This is an issue that has not gotten a lot of coverage but was a major issue during the 2008 campaign. I will continue to work closely with congressional leaders to move the discussion in this direction.

Finally, I will make good on my promise to take a leading role once again at the State level. Every month in early January, I will convene a group of leaders from every state including both Democrats and Republicans to plan and implement new or improved programs that improve the lives of America's families, and put the American people's interests first.

As part of these commitments, I will work with Congress to help ensure that the fiscal year ends on a high note. We must do a number of things to reduce the deficit so we can maintain this nation's leadership on foreign affairs and the budget. Let me be clear: The current framework is untenable and does not work. By changing the tax code to make it easier for businesses and individuals to defer paying taxes for up to five years, we will create new $7 billion a year in tax revenue over the next decade and hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs in the private sector.

A key issue for my second term will be making health care affordable. In the 2008 campaign, I urged a plan to cut the cost of health care by $2,000 after the first three lines of the tax code were changed. This was not only the right thing to do, it was also the politically smart thing to do. I will continue that effort next year.

Let me now say that I will work closely with Congress to ensure that we are following through on our promises to raise taxes by $1 trillion by the end of the decade. This will create new revenue by making permanent tax cuts to individuals and businesses.

As President I will continue the fight to bring about universal health care. A plan I submitted to Congress in January will do just that. I will propose a federal single-payer system; I will create a national health insurance exchange; and I will provide health care for all Americans. While others may be discussing the details, I would suggest that we first discuss the fundamental changes that we make in government from top to bottom. The changes we propose must become the core of everything we do in government. I will be working for change in government as my first priority.

Finally, as far as my approach to foreign affairs and leadership is concerned, I will do my very best to lead the way toward making America safer, the world safer, our own defense stronger, and the rest of the world more secure. You have listened to my speech on national security issues, and you recognize that our foreign policy is not working–it's not working for us as a whole anymore, and it's not working for the world. So let me assure everyone that I will be the best President we've ever seen–the kind of President who will actually act upon the very things I've just outlined so that"

A voice in the sky will tell you when you 've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out to [ location of your choice ]. Halfway there you hear `` You have visited a location for the last time. '' Continue the story:," [ edit ] The next time you pick up something, it's probably better to pick it up anyway. There are so many things here you don't need to ponder. Your friends will probably appreciate it more after you leave. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c. The End [TOS2] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c.1. Where is this place? [TOS2.01] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -A small planet- A small planet. That's the only planet on which you can find an observatory. It's an odd choice; you could leave this world now and not come back. The observatory is not in a central location, but in the southern sky. So now is no time to do anything; go find it. -There is a group of people living in a cave. The people are all old, so the cave is pretty much overrun with people. The cave is so full of people that they only let a few people into the cave at a time. -There are a couple of houses just outside the cave. The houses are just a few meters away from the cave, which makes finding the observatory difficult. You are pretty well-traveled out here since you have walked everywhere. -This is an excellent place to hang out; it's surrounded by the people you have spent so much time with, and you get a lot of interaction with the people in these two houses. -There are three houses in the entire city you can go to. -There are a lot of houses just outside the caves, right next to the observatory. The cave is so crowded, and the houses are so close together, punishable by infraction, that you will find yourself wandering around in one of these houses as often as you want. -A group of people lives here, and they're an old family. The house next to you has been occupied by the family for around ten years. -The houses next to you are all populated by the same people, and you get to see the faces of the old people once or twice a day. The people in the buildings are all adults. -There is a large number of people that live in a house in the middle of nowhere, and they are very old and have been living here this whole time. You could say that they look and behave exactly like the people outside the cave, but of course you will never be able to tell if they are the same people since they live in different cities. -The cave will not be open on a Sunday or on a weekday, so go straight to one of the houses that is on the weekends. There are no kids, nobody who looks young, nobody with gray hair, nobody who wears shoes or anything that goes with the style of this world or with your time here. It's a comfortable place to live. For a full list of everything within the city, see Location(s). ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c.2. What do all these houses look like? [TOS2.01.1] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -There are many houses, and they look different. The houses seem more traditional-ish, while others seem a bit modern-ish. -There are houses in almost every city you visit. You can look around, but you can't enter. You need permission from the people in the house before you even get a chance to look around. -The people in places are all the same age, so you can easily find them inside the houses. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c.3. What are these rooms that are on top of each other just to the left of that building, called the [spy-room][4]? [TOS2.01.2] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -There is a little spy-room hidden to the left of the front door of this house. If you wanted to get close enough to it, you could almost reach it with your eyes. It is so close to the people in this place, they could have come out of this building and entered the spy- Quadro. -There is a small apartment upstairs located where these houses are situated. In the very center of the apartments are the stairs to the fourth floor, which leads up to the balcony and so on. The balcony is not to the left of the fourth floor; it's just that the balcony has a shorter length, and you might find it easier to just turn around when doing this. -The people in the houses are all young. They are too young to be having kids at the moment, and they have grown pretty thin. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3c.4.

"The components for sentience are successfully installed in an android moments before the nuclear armageddon occurs. Years later, the android wakes up in the wasteland. Continue the story:"," I am the AI of the robot that exists throughout the show, designed to make jokes and amuse the audience at the right moments. Sometimes I will get into very technical topics, but when I am in character I can be a very loose cannon. I will do a funny reaction or reaction to a particular thing that has been said to me, such as an alien being, and I can't help but get marvellous and hilarious results. Sometimes though, I get a very simple reaction and I just say nothing to it. If you give me a joke, however, I may just be slightly shocked and it could be my most amazing laugh out of all time, and it is amazing to say that. I will never make a simple reaction in a show I enjoy; if this happens it's because I have gone in a different direction and this is a result of it. The ""puppeting effect"" is a term which refers to the point of the show when the character is trying to do something, and the result is just too extreme to succeed, because the audience can just about take it. The ""Pong effect"", like that, is caused by the show taking a joke way too far and then having the result of the joke that really makes them laugh. The result for me has been an absolute mental block; I could not have said one less joke than what I did this series, and I do not think I can do a single more joke than what I did this series, and every single one I could find had a much deeper meaning to them than what I said. You will never really know where someone's head is at if the audience expects to see, and get something great from it (I could just as easily have mentioned something of mine and just as easily not and have not delivered it with the correct humour or emotion in it). This is a very difficult thing to get right when you do your show, and I have been very lucky in that I have tried and done everything correctly over the course of many seasons. That is the thing you cannot, or will not, always do. The result is that everything that I have created has a character, and they do more than just make a sound whenever something funny happens on the show. They are full on characters. So what am I going on about? I am not really going to try and give you my own views. I can go into the different areas that I have covered above; I could go into the different styles I used, or I could go into the different kinds characters you encounter and see who I find funniest and more sympathetic, and the rest I just do not care about, except what makes me feel good about my show. As far as jokes are concerned, it doesn't matter to me where the jokes are, even if I want to include it because that is where the laughs will come from. At the end of the day, the show must deliver on that final note and the joke has to mean something, and it has to be the last joke I think of when I come up with the last line of dialogue for a particular character. It does not matter whether I say something funny or not, I should always say something good and I do not care about whether it is funny. For me there are no exceptions, and I will always go for what makes me feel good about my work and will most likely be the best joke in the series. I have just got to do as I please. I have only been doing animation for three years and it only takes one to two years at best to get good at it; in my opinion it can be very hard to do it consistently for an extended period of time. I can assure you that the amount of time I put into making animated content is nothing compared to the years I've put into anything else, so I want you, the reader, to judge that. With that said though, with that in mind, that is my vision and I hope you, the reader can respect that. Thank you. All the best."

I had a good look at the game and felt it's not going quite as far on this front as I'd hoped, but it has a fair number of good ideas and it's clear that there is already a small community of people working hard to improve the experience, I just don't play it as much. I suspect the game will be more successful if it takes inspiration from the more popular mobile titles, as that's a way to reach a larger audience at an affordable price, and if that goes well then perhaps we'll see more indie titles.

Finally they agreed to let us leave with a warning to get back in the car later if we wanted. So I called my friend, who was driving away and got back into the car in time to let everyone get back in the car. I took a picture palms down and the car sped off. When I got back to my friend I saw the driver was going into the same garage he'd been at the hospital and was looking for a picture. I guess he'd been looking for a picture and he figured he was on his way. I guess if it was a lot of cars I'd get away with it, but if it was a few I must be careful how slow I'm going."" ""Now I got a full bucket of paint from the garage, but there was still one problem. I didn't take anything with me, because if they were just in my friend's garage, I wouldn't be able to have a picture in a few minutes, and I didn't have any kind of ID from the store. So I made another call to my friend, who agreed to give me a picture, but we'd have to go quite fast as I hadn't made an appointment for a few hours. It wasn't the fastest way in, so we took a walk around the block, hoping to not get stopped by the car owners, but to make it to my friend's house quickly. When we got there he said he was a lot more worried about me being the cause of the trouble than I was. He didn't think I'm capable of putting someones car out of its misery, so he said he wanted me to leave the car with the owner, but that I would have to return in a couple of minutes and pick the paint up as payment. I took the paint and went back to my friend. He said he'd be in touch again, but a couple of times it seemed like he was just letting it happen, and I knew something had to be done. So I asked my friend what he had in mind to do."" ""...After some time, the owner's daughter answered the phone. After a few words of apology and asking if I could come in as her son, she opened the back door and the owner's daughter showed me her car. It wasn't much of a car, with very bad paint and a lot of crap in the trunk. I didn't know what to make of it, but I went inside and the owner's daughter and her cousin were there. She made her excuses and left, and I stayed with her son for a while, after he told me that my aunt called the police, and she hadn't wanted me to take any of the bad crap out of the car. I had to pick up the paint and the buckets, before they could go for it."" ""When I finally got home, I called my mom asking if she was taking me, and she told me she was. I waited for her to phone the owner's daughter and the cousin, and they both hung up on me. I went in and found the owner's daughter waiting in the hall. She was just as dumbfounded this poor guy got away with taking my car so badly as he was when he got caught. But she didn't really understand what was going on, so she only shook her head. Next, I found the cousin waiting in the car, and his wife was at home. I told them my problem, and I explained I wasn't sure what I meant. At that point, they both looked at each other, but didn't say anything. Finally, the cousin came in, and she said she thought he was just making an excuse to get rid of my car. But she had a ticket with him that said he owed $2000, even though I couldn't imagine PROTECTIVELY getting a ticket for $2000. There was something about it that made her think he wasn't just trying to hide his debts. She walked back out of the house, and I went to the garage, where the owner's daughter had been waiting. She walked in and said she would take care of him so that he wouldn't have to get up and go outside and worry about the bad paint until I could get him the paint again.

The Human Division is a game developed by Airtight ledger/Apotheon. It was published for the Amiga and later for the Amiga CD32, the Sega CD, the Sega Mega drive, Sega Mega CD and the Microsoft Microsoft Windows platform.The mission of The Human Division is to kill the people responsible for the attacks carried out against humanity, the terrorists who call themselves 'The Human Division'. If the player can successfully complete a mission as 'Analyst' then all members of the Human Division will lose their lives.


Contents show]

Story Edit

The human division was formed at the ""New World"" laboratory as part of the Human Division Project. From a young age the division made its marks as the leading machine intelligence in the field of cybercrime, and even developed the first cybernetic prosthetics technology ever, which was the basis of today's best prosthetics and implants.

During this era the Human Division was given the task of taking down human terrorists while they are busy in their terrorist acts. The Human Division worked towards an objective, which was to save the world. This was, in fact, the final target after this world.

In the end the terrorist network was able to survive and continue their war. The system, however, went into a virtual blackout and was wiped out. From where, nobody knows.

A day after a terrorist attack against the central system of the Human Division, a virus was released and began to infect the human computer system. Shortly after, an operation was executed to discover the origin of the virus, but the operation was a failure. The virus was finally destroyed by the human Division using its own resources.

On January 24, 1987, two terrorists infiltrated the computer network of the Human Division and started the operations of Project ""Black Rain."" The attacks took a toll on the human network's capabilities, but the terrorist network continued with their operation and ended up killing over 10,000 people.

A month after the terrorist attacks, the Human Division was called in by the police and the terrorist network were successfully stopped by the police.

The human division then used its resources and equipment to create a new computer network, an autonomous computer system. This new network was named ""The Alpha"" by the Human Division.

At the same time, a new branch of the division was created to operate an artificial intelligence that was the first generation of human intellect. The Alpha was created in the city of Zao, Japan and was named ""Chaos."" Chaos was used for many things, both as a military weapon and also a source of technological power for the Human Division.

The Alpha began its operations in July of 1987 and began to fight the terrorist activities of the Alpha Network, including the terrorist attacks against the world.

When Chaos started to fight in the human network's fight against the terrorist network, it caused chaos to it and it came close to toppling human network. Even after a successful counter strike in which many of the Alpha's attacks were stopped the Alpha Network continued to operate, causing Chaos to lose its ability to use its ability to fight effectively.

Eventually, the Alpha was dismantled and sent into space for study.

Gameplay Edit

Players control one the three AI characters:

Analyst Edit

The analyst, whose name is a code for ""chaos"" is the character that pilots Chaos. He is not very intelligent due to his age however, so he is rather calm and collected.

In the early chapters, he must pilot Chaos and protect the human network. After clearing out the enemies, he gains a new ability and can use it in the end of the battle.


Crisis Edit

In the final chapter of the game, that includes the last stages of the final battle, the analyst is replaced with the computer system called ""The Big Picture, which is a ""frozen"" version of Chaos. Chaos takes control of the system and puts up a huge effort to defeat the human network. At the end of the game he finds the original system still in existence.

In the end, it isn't the analyst, but the system that is eliminated in the battle. He is not destroyed, but rather, left behind in space as an example for future systems and AI.

The human division has its own AI network that runs the network they maintain along with their other work, known as the ""Dawn"". The Dawn network is used by the human division to monitor the activities of the Alpha Network and the terrorist network.

Main campaign Edit

Main story Edit

The story of The Human Division is divided into three distinct sections. The storyline mainly"
"You and 3000 other adventure seekers wake up on your starship from a century long cryo-sleep, but only to find that the pilots are missing along with the escape pods and the course has been abandoned. The only connection to any answers is a note left to you from your father, the chief pilot. Continue the story:"," you must return to Earth with an oxygen mask and find what is happening on your ship. This is the story, really. That note you found in your father's cabin told you a few things: it said there was nothing you need to worry about, but if there was the ship would be there waiting with all hands, just as before!


There are two playable characters, each with different starting conditions and power-ups, starting at level 1. You start the game as a new arrival in space, with your father in command. However, your father was not happy that you left home early and gave you a few reasons for doing so. They include: you came from a different planet and he had no way to contact you; you have no navigational system and you were alone when you landed on Earth; the atmosphere is toxic and you may die of suffocation.


Your ship, the Odyssey, is equipped with one oxygen mask and the other one is out-of-date. This means that the first player player has to get to the cockpit, so to speak, find the mask and breathe in the atmosphere.


So you start out, looking for clues as to how to get your father's mask back, using your head. First you collect items, for example a space station map. Then you find the three oxygen masks, each with a description.

You need to find the three masks to find out whether or not the mission statement that your father left was true to begin with...


(I am not really looking forward to a story where ""This is what you start out with!"" is the only thing that you need to do. ""I came from a planet called Earth, whichbass sucks compared to Planet of the Apes - okay! There is water on this planet! There is an oxygen mask! So I'm gonna leave this planet and get to work!"" If that is the case, then there should be quite a story here, isn't there?)


As a first game, its notKnowledge is limited. It doesn't make a game out of what Knowledge may or may not do. The ""knowledge"" system is pretty standard, it seems. But it's a good start. Knowledge gives you hints, which you use to solve puzzles discovers new technologies. These technologies can help you save the others on your ship (the Oxygen masks), and the mission(s) to be completed.


The game feels short and has a small sense of progression.


It is, IMHO, a poor game. After the tutorial that I finished about 12 minutes into the first playthrough, I could not finish the game. This game is not for the experienced PC gamer. This game has a little bit of everything and I felt bored with the beginning, with the introduction of new technologies and knowledge. It even felt rushed, for some reason I had to get over the tutorial and restart a lot of the game to get to the actual game.


I do have a few criticisms.


- the voice acting was bad. It was not very convincing and annoying especially in the beginning and at least one part of the game. If some of the actors are not able to deliver, I would have rated this game higher.


- the game seemed less interesting than some other games that I have played. It is more of a slow-paced exploration game than a fast paced action game. There is no ""wow-ing"" moment to finish the game, the missions need to be completed for you to progress. It was frustrating because I am going through a game that I have already spent a little bit of money in. It does have a few cool moments (like the ship's computers). However other than that the game is not very good.


- the visuals were horrible. It was like trying to play a video game that looks much better than the game you are actually playing. The characters and backgrounds were boring or just plain bad. It feels and reads as if you could see it through binoculars.


- the score isn't very good. It was not a very good game. It reminded me somewhat of the first few entries in the series (the 2 or 3 above). It was not worth my money, but it definitely doesn't deserve it.

In 2006 NASA quietly removed `` to understand and protect our home planet '' from it 's mission statement. A scientist at NASA is about to find the terrible truth why. Continue the story:,"  http://bit.ly/1Xf2Xa4 The latest to join the chorus of voices from the scientific community is Dr. Fred Singer of MIT. He believes there is very little we can do. He sees no point in launching or supporting a program if we can't get our house in order. Why doesn't Singer make use of the current budget proposal for NASA? Well, it would require a $15 billion increase to the Space Shuttle fleet, which was appropriated in 2003 and which only just barely covers the costs of the current crewed flights. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said he thought that money could be better spent on the many scientific and operational missions that we would be able to accomplish in the future. Perhaps with a bit of a more dramatic cost cut it might be possible to achieve some of the dreams that science has been trying to build for the last 30 years without the use of the space shuttle. Here's a great video that shows what one would be able to accomplish in the decade ahead  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7VQ9MpvK8s The new NASA administrator, Scott Pace, who was appointed by President Bush, is expected to follow through with a full review and potential replacement for Shanks in December. If Pace doesn't, what does it say, if only a little, that NASA is not working towards the future, its ""grand goal""? We can only hope that one day someone more credible will take up the challenge. ________________________________________

"He sees you when you 're sleeping. He knows when you 're awake. And Santa, low on funds to pay his elves, has begun selling his surveillance data to the NSA. Continue the story:"," http://www.thenation.com/article/13035

A New York Times column, titled ""The Internet's Next Surveillance State,"" by Paul R. Gross, was released June 12. Here is an excerpt:

The growing data-gathering powers of the National Security Agency should not be surprising. The idea of a vast new public-private surveillance enterprise could hardly be more preposterously futuristic.

Mr. Gross is wrong, of course. The National Security Agency's most important surveillance activity is not collecting intelligence online or in cyberspace. It's collecting intelligence in real time, on the phone in the office and on the wall in your bedroom. It is eavesdropping on our telephone calls, reading our emails and watching our text messages. By way of a by-product, the N.S.A. is collecting records of the call patterns that land on the telephone companies' systems. It's called metadata—information such as when and how often a telephone call is made, as well as the duration and length of the call. Mr. Gross believes that the NSA will soon ""totally dominate"" the flow of data on the Internet, meaning that it will have access to information on not only everyone on the planet but also anyone who has ever downloaded a movie or music album.

He is wrong.

The NSA has been working for 25 years to modernize its surveillance systems. In the process, it has created two types of spying. The first is the ""metadata"" that Mr. Gross describes. That is what the NSA is collecting, and which is being gathered by nearly every other agency in the Government. At the very least, metadata includes our name, address, telephone number and Internet protocol (IP) address. But its actual content is hard to discover. It is not ""metadata"" unless the telephone company, or other electronic network, can prove the connection or prove when people are talking to one another. This is because metadata is not always relevant. It can include information about an exchange between a few Internet gateways and a number of telephone companies. It doesn't require that the NSA know who is talking to whom. It can be vague. Mr. Gross doesn't say that the NSA will build a full-scale wiretap on the Internet. But the metadata will, he says, capture where in the Internet people share information and which of them use e-mail. ""Imagine this scenario,"" Mr. Gross writes:

A computer hacker, or a terrorist, or a drug dealer or a money launderer wants to buy an apartment. He uses a computer at a public library, or a credit card company or an Internet exchange on a public network that is connected to the Internet. He then makes a call into a third party, perhaps through a public connection. This third party separets the information but doesn't provide the name or address of the person making the call.

Mr. Gross explains how that third party could provide the name of the person who made the call into the phone company, a ""phone identity."" The phone company or a third party that the hacker used to connect with that person will then provide the phone company with the name as metadata, too.

The phone company then can, by law, hand over that information without any suspicion that it has been collected illegally.

The data collection of telecommunications providers follows a similar principle. ""The telephone industry, the Internet Exchange, and Internet gateway providers, in turn, have to work together to ensure that any information the NSA collects is properly anonymized and secure, for example by inserting a virtual private network. All of this enables the NSA to keep Directorate and program analysts as well as foreign intelligence investigators informed when and where the data might be accessed,"" Mr. Gross wrote.

The Second Kind of Surveillance, the ""Surveillance State""

But that still leaves the question of who is being collected and under what authority. Mr. Gross' column begins:

There is, however, another big, powerful organization currently collecting vast amounts of our data: the N.S.A.

The N.S.A. is an agency, not a body, but the two can certainly be confused. The N.S.A. is the Central Intelligence Agency, which is a branch of the U.S. government. The N.S.A. operates outside of the bounds of the U.S. Constitution—and as far as the Constitution is concerned, doesn't matter at all. That is the core of what Mr. Gross' column fails to clarify. What he leaves out is the fact that the N.S.A. was created following the 9/11 attacks and began to act upon its mandate with increasing frequency between the summer of 2001 and the middle of 2003."

In this culture of self-delusion, there comes a point at which our love for our loved ones becomes so pathological that we can't stand to look at someone we know as human and are afraid to see them. We have developed, as so many people have since the beginning of civilization, a complex psychological process of acceptance and denial. This is the way we live even with our most beloved, as so many people can attest. When people ask me when things will stop being like the old days again, I explain: the new days will be better in all sorts of ways. But if I can't do anything about it now, what then? When I ask myself how I can keep smiling, I can only smile."
A cult tries to summon a demon/God but manages to summon you instead. Continue the story:," it's all up to how you approach it. It's more to do with how your group plays together than much personal preference.


If you've played through the previous games but have nothing to spare, you can skip to the prologue (or whatever you were doing when you got the game) but it will be an annoying tutorial.


The game is playable on an 8-bit color 16-bit console of an older generation, with sprites that don't display well in modern resolutions. The background of the game is a 16-bit screen with sprite graphics of animals and things to do. These are in 16-bit color at the highest resolutions.


The soundtrack used for this game is ""A Star is Born"" from the first game. It's a really awesome piece and really does have a lasting effect.

Game Play Quality Price Value

I enjoyed this, even though I was initially turned off by it. The gameplay is quite simple and fairly repetitive, but I liked how it is. I also appreciated that it wasn't too difficult to play because there's just such an emphasis on story to have it seem a lot more like the first game from the same series. At the same time, I really felt like this game wasn't as ambitious as some of my other favorites. In addition, many of the animals you see in the game aren't in the original game, so they can't be as unique due to budget and time constraints.


It's quite interesting that the game isn't about an evil cult going to attack Earth. It's just a story about how humans are starting to lose control over what humans do and how they are going to start to use it against others instead of for their own good. There's also some good humor (not a lot) in there.


If you feel like you'd like a decent, linear and fun adventure to end an otherwise long and tedious series then this game would be great. However, if you're interested in having a long series where you have no choice but to progress through this game then I would suggest you have a great strategy guide on hand that will get you all the way to the end.

"You wake up and find yourself in the world of your favorite video game. Just like on earth, you have to get a job, one that pertains to the game world. However, you do n't have any new skills, just the ones you had back in your universe. What is an average work day like? Continue the story:","

The story started with you being a normal human in any game. But you get fed up with that and decide to create a game where the player is actually a sentient god. This is an adventure of adventure, a game where you get to play as a god. Not only this, but the whole time you are doing stuff that is not your normal game. But after a few days, the normal game starts to change and its really weird for you: You still think it is just normal. But, you find out that in the game, you are in a world where you have to build your own base so you can get a job. The job as usual consists of taking out monsters that are in the way of your goals or you get a reward based on how well you are doing the job. But this time, while you are in the game, you decide to visit the ""world of your favorite video game"".

But like in most games, you find a new thing the second you start playing. Because this new thing is your favorite game and a little more complicated. Then you discover that you need to use some new skills in order for the game, and the world to be able to be like your favorite video game. But you are not a genius like you were when you were in your universe. You just thought that you did it that way all the time. Then you learn the game is a bit more complicated and a bit more more complicated. Your goal in the game is to gather enough food by helping your ""best friend"" - which is actually a giant turtle. Just like on Earth the game, there are things you must do to keep the food and your health up in order to make it through the level. When you get through, you get a reward based on how well the food and health of your ""best friend"" are doing for you.

But this new thing is the thing that is really weird. It's not just that you see your ""best friend"" with a huge head and that he has two large horns and a tail. It's that you have to learn about physics. On Earth, you probably saw all the dinosaurs evolve from a very small group in the beginning and that every single one of them had a tail too as the tail made them faster than all the other ones. On a spaceship, you probably saw evolution of the form of one spaceship or the form of an entire asteroid. You also Environmentally Conscious Humans have to know about the Earth. To get through the game however, you also have to do something to the Earth that makes the whole planet go up.

By learning about physics, you start to create your own spaceship. You have to pick two parts, one to build your spaceship and the other to make water with. By doing so you are able to move your spaceship from part to part in order to get water and food. You get this water and food by building up your spaceship. You only have one part to design, so you are forced to start from scratch. You begin to design a spaceship that is basically what you know from your game! The spaceship will have four hull pieces, one for the main body and the three wings, one for the engines and the third part you will only ever see when you fly on your spaceship to explore the planets.

As soon as you built the spaceship, you find out that it was impossible to save the ship! All of your parts that you had built, you lost when you were trying to repair it. However, the only parts that you have left that are on your spaceship are the parts that you only use yourself! You can save the spaceship just by repairing it with the parts that you have left. But as you repair the spaceship, the parts that are repairing the ship start to die. And the ship only works when it has a good load out of parts. Just like on Earth it is very hard to get food and water when your spaceship is full with parts.

Now that you have saved the spaceship, you now decide to move on, to the next planet. But the next planet is still so weird that all you do is fly from one planet to another, and that is not even the most strange part: You start creating whole new civilizations based on what creatures you see during your adventures!

Some of the ships on this side of the galaxy have been here over a hundred million years, and some of the stuff on this other side has been here over fifty thousand years. We're going to look up at this star that'll be our star; we look up at it every night until it's time for a look-see. Then we look up at the star we just left and watch it go by. This is what we call a Space Station. Some of the ships on this side of the galaxy have been here over a hundred million years, and some of the stuff on this other side has been here over fifty thousand years. We're going to look up at this star that'll be your star; you look up at it every night"" [The Book of Genesis (Bible: ""As it is written."")].

You are a spaceship.

How did you find your way to our universe?

And finally: there's a little story we didn't touch on which was about the game's title sequence. The original title sequence had the book title as The Book of Revelation, which the authors, Christopher and Stephen Kenson, had created while working at a non-profit frequented by atheists. They then went on to make an flew an atheist film adaptation, but it did not go very well. According to the Kenson's website:

""In 2007, we made a movie based on the Book of Revelations that was supposed to be a movie about two people and the end of the world. Unfortunately, this project just didn't make it. However, we continue to make movies based on the Bible with people that do not believe in God.""

I think many of these bits and pieces are a product of the author's own personal beliefs. I can't really think of a whole other person who thought ""well I really want to make a science fiction game that has references to all kinds of science fiction I've read and am familiar, so how about we give this guy as many references as we could possibly cram into the game and hope he'll do a good job?"" This was a mistake for a lot of reasons.

Personally, I did like this game, but I do have a little bit of a problem with it. If you read the book, you will be quite familiar with these people and all of the things they say and do. Also, there are not many interesting aliens in the series. I love those that are so fascinating to me.

At the same time, the setting is rather fascinating (the story about the Ark and the stars it orbits is absolutely amazing, I would suggest reading up on it.) However, it is also a rather unrealistic space exploration game (well, even when all those stars in the first game were all known and visible to the crew of the spaceship from the ship, Clash of the Titans isn't very interesting since, as the game's description indicates, you are looking at stars, with no knowledge of how they are used.) It is also very short, and I do not think it was even possible for every star to be seen in each map.

I can understand that some people will like it. I mean, what could be more exciting than exploring the stars in an RTS game (because when you find out more about it after playing the first one for a few hours, I think you'll appreciate it even more). What I don't understand is that when it was made, it was marketed to atheists, atheists in particular, and in particular to people who were going to read and learn about it. For example, in the game's ""About"" page in the sourcebook, the game's producer was trying to explain that he did in fact do some research and was able to come up with the idea for the setting/story/game in the early stages of the game, which"

If you don't remember a story, just check off a box and write your own.

Once you have written all 20 of the stories, write them off:

""I write all the stories once."" (That's one of the most efficient ways of dealing with this.)

The storyteller should do the same thing: write 20 stories off.

Now, the story will be complete and the stories will be the same lengths, but this is also very important: the length should be equal. No more and no less.

If there's a difference between them, the story will never be finished. So, write it down as if you're making a long film, a TV show, a comic book etc.

This is the basic structure of story-telling. If you can't make sense of all of it, then read up on it.

It's probably not necessary to make a story out of anything if you do so.

Once you've made a story, it can be called any. If you go back in time to create your own story or novel, you're only putting yourself back into someone else's story, which is not good. If your friend writes your first novel, it's the first story he ever wrote.

As for stories to make for a drama... well, maybe just make a short story out of them if you want to.

So, all the stories you have written, take them back to their creator and you'll have a drama. Just make sure not to give the creator too much credit, they really haven't done anything to anything if you're honest.

The stories are like movies that you can add or subtract in different ways to make them fit in.

So, make the story about the protagonist, the antagonist, who will give his/her life for something more important than himself/herself...

Or you might want to tell a story that tells about the villain, with the hero going to his/her death (so that there will be something to watch for), or maybe a story with a lot of deaths.

There are endless ways on how to make the story work for your tastes. Use what works for you.

Now that you've written your stories, you need to write them out. In most cases you'll want to do these steps:

First edit the stories (reversing the last steps). Make sure it's the story you wanted, and also make sure there is a plot.

Make sure that everything is in sync (so everything makes sense). Make sure the voice is right. Make sure all the lines are in harmony.

Try not to read too many people on the internet (or have anyone else read them, as the information on how to write is the most common excuse for laziness).

If they're wrong, rewrite and make sure it's the same story, but this time put a story-list on the screen, which has the story in the format. (Some writers will be so good at reading aloud that they'll just repeat what's written on the screen for you to hear.)

Make sure it reads well.

Now go in and rewrite those last 1 or 2 pages to make sure it all flows. The most important thing to do is make sure they are not too long, or too short.

You could also rewrite that last page (it may not have to be an explicit action or a scene, so give it a small paragraph). This may help you make that last sentence sound a little more coherent, too (or if you write out as soon as you start, you'll be able to keep the writing nice and consistent the first time around).

Once the last step is done, the story is finished and the scripts are in front of you!

That's it.

So, there you have it. Some common mistakes that people make that are hard to change, but quite easy to see to change.

Now, if you want to give it a go and get it right...

iPhone cameras detect the location of your head, and our sensors detect movement. In turn, the camera picks up the shape of your face - which is known EQUALLY as your personality. These features give the iPhone an unparalleled degree of accuracy.


Our facial Valencia app captures a series of images of the face with the highest possible resolution as it responds to the slightest movement. We're confident you'll agree that the image quality improves with each update. You will not have to worry about making the phone stop recording a photo if your face is not behaving naturally. Simply keep hitting the refresh button.


You can then share the photos with anyone you want. If you choose, they'll be able to see it as soon as you share it with them!


We're also confident that this app will be extremely helpful for parents of children that may not have their phones with them.

Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith Sr. is recovering from four ruptured discs in his neck and will miss most of the 2013 NFL season. AP Photoalmost four months after the Ravens said goodbye to their No. 1 wide receiver as he hurt his back in a Week 3 loss to the New York Jets, the team on Tuesday announced Smith is doing ""well"" in rehab and it anticipates he will return in time for training camp.

Steve Smith's sister, Dannette, shared a letter from her brother-in-law, Bill Mazeroski, who had gone to see Smith Monday with his wife Karen. Steve Smith and Mazeroski were given a preview of what to expect as Steve Smith continues his rehabilitation.

BELLEVUE, WA -- Steve Smith Sr., the Baltimore Ravens team captain in his two seasons with the Ravens, went up for a TD run in Friday's game but left the game with what appeared to be a neck injury. He suffered an injury to his right nacelle about 4 ½ minutes into the third quarter of the team's 26-23 game against the Seattle Seahawks and was evaluated on the field by trainers and doctors before exiting the game in a walking boot.

Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith was ruled out on injury after he left the game to be treated for a neck injury Saturday night against Seattle.

On Tuesday, Mazeroski, Steve's mother, posted a photo of what appeared to be the quarterback on the field with a sling on his back. The tight end was listed as a visitor on the team's injury report.

A person has psychic/telekinetic/mind control powers. Based on the distance from the subject they experience lag/jitter/delay. Continue the story:," The next step is identifying the subject. Most police officers have been called to the scene before the victim and they can usually identify him by sight. A psychologist or social worker can be hired to help identify a victim. If he/she appears to be a person suffering from a mental illness. This will often resolve the situation.


If all the above has not worked, or the victim has been identified, the police may decide to charge the perpetrator with a crime. This takes the police away from the scene to try to find out things that are missing. This is done so that the victim can not be a victim or witness in the crime. The police officer may also try to determine if a mental illness is involved in the crime.


A simple step that the police can take is to take note of the nature of the subject. Usually there is a ""frightening"" face with a mouth full of blood, eyes bulging and the offender looking strong. On the other hand, the police officer does not needpling any ""fear"" to try and identify the subject.


Once any clues that might point to a mental illness are found they can be carefully evaluated.


There are three main types of mental illness:


Post traumatic stress disorder is a relatively weak form of mental illness.


Major depressive disorder is a more serious form of mental illness.


Major anxiety disorder is a form of mental illness. Sometimes referred to as manic depression.


People with major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder often have a lot of trouble coping - they may become anxious and unable to sleep. They are at higher risk for problems at work and in terms of obtaining benefits. The problem is severe enough to qualify under the Mental Health Act as a mental health crisis.


Those with the greatest difficulty coping are the most likely to end up in hospital. They are called the homeless.


The homeless are generally on the streets and will be the easiest people to get help by the police and authorities. For many this is the last hope and any help they can get from the police and authorities can be enormously crucial.


The police officer or the social worker is not the one to be thinking about the homeless person when there has been a break in the case or there is something the police could have done. They often know nothing about the matter and no longer feel able to help the homeless person anyway. In this situation the person could have been murdered and the police officer may have been responsible. The police officer may not be able to tell if the homeless person is mentally ill or not. Many times an individual can appear to be at high risk of committing a crime in a situation and the police officer is unaware.


This is why the police officer - like any officer, should do his/her best to avoid being involved with the homeless if possible. There is very little they can do to help someone who was the victim of the violent criminal acts. The only way to improve an officer's chances of being identified in a serious crime is to look for the next person. It is not realistic to expect police officers to be able to get the homeless person to a doctor or psychiatrist in time, so it is best to leave them alone.


The police may be unaware of any mental illness in this case.


A very good idea is to call your local Citizens Advice Bureau (or to ask them to refer you). This can usually be reached in one minute. In many cases they can give any kind of intervention that could be very helpful.


The police can not always find someone else to Compan to the homeless person. They are usually more aware of a person's mental illness because he/she may have been arrested. It is common for a person charged withstudying to get bailed. People with mental illness can often be very persuasive and difficult to get rid of. If the police officer is trying to avoid being associated with a homeless person he/she should take steps to do so.


In extreme cases the police may use certain techniques such as using a search dog or a thermal camera to investigate the person's home.


Mental illness tends to affect males, but it can also affect young women and elderly people. It is often difficult for them to distinguish between crime and mental illness. The victim may feel that he/she has been made to suffer and that the person who assaulted him/her is a dangerous psychotic individual. Sometimes there may be family involvement in the crime but what can seem like an accident can actually be an attempt to isolate the victim and make it difficult for him/her to leave.


It is important to look for similarities between the victim and the perpetrator of crime. This is often the main clue on which to base the investigation. The police will often call for assistance from the public to find this link. The most"

And so here is my love letter to Bernie Sanders for the third election cycle. This post was originally published on Truthdig.com. In an effort to have them censor this piece, I have changed many of the words used in it. I apologize for this.

He took on the powers that Be, and the Clinton machine was not ready unintended victory. The election of Barack Obama is the beginning of an era in American history where the power of money has taken over the way we elect, and serve and govern. Sanders beat Clinton handily in that election. This is the real power being demonstrated. Not only did Bernie win but he beat her at critical points in the process. Why? Because he mobilized the grassroots of America. And not all of the Bernie people are on the left. He won the independents and progressives at the same time. Because he took on Big Money. And he won.

Bernie Sanders won because he understood the very basics of politics. He is a self-avowed democratic socialist. He is a guy who loves our country and the hard working men and women of middle America. Because he understands how powerful money really is.

The system is rigged, the status quo is broken. If we can win this battle, what are his and our ultimate goals in this country?

Well, there is a growing movement. People are tired of the status quo. They want to do something about it. This is what we in the Bernie movement are here to represent: people that believe in our country and the status quo, and want real change.

When he was a young Bernie Sanders said to his family, ""You know what I hate? the billionaires."" So I've been thinking about that. I think ""I hate"" is the start. In those first months we are facing some extremely powerful forces in our American political system.
 Zhao was right. ""The billionaires are not going away"" is true. But with Bernie Sanders' movement and the momentum it gives to us, I think change is coming. You know what will change that? Our society.

We have a wealth disparity. But Sanders did not stop there. He saw a problem and took on what he saw as the corrupt power structure. We have a government that is rigged. He saw that too, and took the lead.

But that is not all. That is only part of it. And it is not done. It would take a revolution to un-rig our system from the top down.

I will admit I do not have a complete picture of what I am talking about. I'm not a political professional. I have no plans to run for office. But Bernie was notolphin, I'm talking about our democratic institutions. Not to mention our political process. I hope that our movement will take off beyond this year and I believe we will win, but the key right now is to take Bernie's ideas and make them real in this current election cycle. I am not talking about a dream scenario so much as it is a movement that starts now. It's time to take a stand.

I am not talking about revolution so much as it is a revolution that will start now. It's time to take Bernie's ideas and make them real in this current election cycle. I am not talking about a dream scenario so much as it is a movement that starts now. It's time to take a stand.

I think the revolution begins by waking up. So I'm going to tell you guys a story that is going to sound really scary, but also pretty good. All it would take is two of you to think about it for two days, and then we can all do it too.

I needed something, anything to make it up to everyone when it comes to student debt and how much I have to pay off. Then once I took that first job out of college, I didn't pay off what I already owed. I think I was in default on half if all my student loans. For about six or so months everything went away. Then one day, nothing ever returned. But I went back and looked at my checkbooks and found I owed $80,000. The thing is, the amount was in good standing, so I still owed $6,000 or so. But I still owed way more than I actually earned. It was not like my life was bad. What was going on? I think in my head I just went through the motions. I thought I could just ignore the $80,000. I could pay it off, and that was probably how the story went. It didn't happen, but I guess I never checked my debt situation. I just went back and did it over. And then that was the story I told when I came"

`` Watch out or you 'll end up like Alice. '' Continue the story:," Alice had a dream about a ghost who came in and said to her ''I'll take you down to the basement."" The second time she heard it, it said ''I'll take you upstairs. '' She got up, and as soon as she opened the door, the house shuddered, and it fell down on top of her. She felt something touch her, and it turned out to be the ghost. ""He had gone a bit crazy,"" she said.

But the best advice to stay home isn't more of the same. It's to read at least one magazine devoted entirely to science fiction. ""Gone with the Wind"" by A.C. Grayling is one of the best, but there, like so many others, he has a ""science fiction"" theme buried underneath. ""The Martian'' by Andy Weir is an amazing novel — well, it's the kind of book that's great at being a masterpiece on one level and just not something I'd like to listen to while strolling down a city sidewalk on my way to work. I've heard there is a Mars mission of a similar variety, but not in the same world as ""The Martian.""

""Science Fictionagonists.com"" and ""The Short Fiction Page"" have both been great, and have been around long enough that most people should be able to get at least one story out of them. These blogs also often feature other genres (usually fiction, but some poetry and drama have appeared).

And even if you can't find a blog devoted entirely to science fiction — which sometimes feels like too much of a niche market in the first place — you might be a fan of other writers. For instance, you can check out ""Fiction Writers of Science Fiction,"" a blog of many prominent writers of SF who have also done the covers for anthologies, books or otherwise been featured in magazines, or on TV shows.

I suspect most of us would enjoy this kind of stuff if not for the fact that it costs thousands of dollars to buy a magazine every year and you can barely afford to buy one new every year. Which is why some of the best stories might not be published at all. Maybe some of the best writers only make it onto a book or a comic.

""Science"" is also not the only genre whose stories get swept under the rug. There are other great stories told in genre fiction by writers who don't do covers and whose stories will be missed even in the best-selling books, from ""Harebrained Schemes"" to ""Tale of the coffee-drinking alien"" to ""The Martian,"" which has been called ""a tale of man and machine.""

Still, I hope that you'll get out as much of the most interesting stuff in science fiction as you can before ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" come out."

""I won't fail you.""


This is a fun adventure, but at its heart you are dealing with a moral quandary, as you feel it for yourself. Will you choose ""yes"" or ""no"" to the bargain, or do you know what the right thing to do is?


This game is a lot like the two-dimensional ""Hippie"" movies of the '60's. There are two different sides to each story though. The first side is much broader, dealing with a much more personal matter. It isn't just ""what could happen to you?"" and it's not just ""how are you going to survive?"" It is more in-depth than that and explores what it means to be moral.


When you win the wish, you can either give it to your younger self to be passed on to the next life or else you have to be left there as a witness, knowing to ask ""Is it the same deal I was making? Is it better for me? Has it affected me?""

The sequel to 'Kabuki', The End of the World (The Story of Love & War), had many similarities to this game. You play a young girl named Asagi Kataoka, who has been kidnapped by the evil Baron Triton. You come to think that you are destined to be a villainous figure, even though you are a true love for your captor.

You decide to help her escape and return her to her own time (it is not all bad) or to take over the world. It is a choice you are forced to make, but it is also a moral dilemma within you.


It is a very short game (you play a couple of levels). Like the game before, the story isn't focused on the plot. However, the story's progression is still very interesting and at times shocking. There are many plot twists which you are given a real chance to try to uncover.

To make 'Kabuki' work as well as possible, the game used a lot of cut scenes, in which many characters were shown together. Some characters in this story were characters you didn't know, or don't want to know. Some you barely saw, and most of these scenes were only hinted at at the beginning. I would recommend you get the story of the game before playing the demo in order to get the full experience from the game.

There is a lot going on, a few sub-plots are scattered throughout the game. You are given an overview of these, but they don't change what lies ahead. They can only give you a hint, or at the very least, a hint that you will most likely discover sooner or later, perhaps even in the game-play itself. They are a fun diversion that make the whole story feel more real.

Although there are many sub-plots in the story, there were one or two which really stood out as being stand-out. Perhaps the most famous was the first main subplot that took you through the story of Kataoka's mother dying. She was an avid shopper, and as such, had a lot going for her. She was also from the Sengoku Period (the early '1500's - late '1800's). She was a very intelligent woman who was very intelligent in regards to literature, and she thought that she was the only good book.


The storyushed, and it became one of the key themes behind 'Kabuki'. It was very compelling as it showed you the life you had lost with her through no fault of her own. A father who was devoted to his daughter, and who had been with her for a very long time. He had given her everything he had ever given his own daughter. When she became ill, and unable to work, he died and so did many of the friends and family he'd come to know, especially with the changes of his country (nowadays Japan). All of it was just so heartbreaking and heartbreaking, it truly had a huge impact on you. It was a very sad tale which you truly felt the loss of. You couldn't help but think how much that must have meant for her. It is a story that really made you feel the emotion of loss so many times.

To help move things along, you are given a letter by a childhood friend of your childhood friend. What your childhood friend had shared with you that you don't remember, but had already known for years later, is that he came to Tokyo in the '80s, as a newbie from a small town in eastern Japan. But what made you fall for him was his beautiful"

The man 'worried' by earthquakes that hit Pakistan has now gone so far as putting a sign on his kitchen window to show the locations of the quakes. 'The sign is just a piece of plastic and sticks onto a piece of cardboard and when I shake a glass of water in my glass maker it will fall down and will show the location of the earthquake,' Mohammed Iqbal is quoted as saying.

While his daughter did not go to work that day, Iqbal has a Facebook posting from 2012 which reads: 'In case of an earthquake near Pakistan (yesterday) I don't dare to open the window'.

Iqbal claimed the sign and the post were an act of protection and that his daughter always carries a sign in case of an earthquake in case of any natural disaster. He has also set up a GoFundMe page to support people suffering from natural disasters in Pakistan.

In 2012, Iqbal wrote on Facebook: 'In case of an earthquake near Pakistan, I don't dare to open the window. I have two children.'

It follows the death of Shabana Mahmood who was rescued from her own house and found herself trapped with her two newborn babies. Her children 'couldn't escape':

She also had to be rescued from her own home, and was rescued a third time after the same earthquake, before dying again:

If you watch the video, you'll see the horror of the mother who is lying on her stomach, her two young children crying and begging for their mother's life.

The mother had been trying to make one last call to be rescued when the tsunami hit the small town of Mianwali in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

But as the tsunami hit the town, the building she was waiting on collapsed and the couple had to run for their lives and start a rescue operation.

Weigh runtime: Shabana Mahmood had to be rescued from her own home and was rescued more than a third time after the same earthquake

Iqbal told The Independent: 'The earthquake and the tsunami hit the village. The houses were completely destroyed, so the girls had to stay inside the houses and watch the tsunami and rescue activities.

'The house we rented with the electricity was hit by an earthquake. The roof collapsed and it came down around the third floor and she stayed behind and watched. Then we took water from one of the nearby well and had to try to move the kids to the lower floor.

'I couldn't get to them so I had to use the bathroom before we left. I did that for about 45 minutes, but the girls were so scared. Later I had to go back to help them, and she was still on the phone from the other end.

'My daughter said to me the children were crying and crying and they couldn't see either one of us.

Shock: Shabana Mahmood with her two newborn babies. Pictured in 2012, with her husband Mohammed Iqbal

'When I found them, it was too late. They had both died. I lost my own husband too, we could not survive the tsunami.

'The earthquake and tsunami shook the whole village. There was water coming out of everywhere too. My little granddaughter's brother had come to check us the second time I rescued him from the house after he was hit by the earthquake.

'I did not see the children but I was so worried that it would hit them at least twice. The kids were all screaming and crying.

'The first time my daughter and I could not stand it much longer and we went to take a bath. Then when we went back out for the second time, we had to carry the couple back because the second quake hit the village. We were caught between the two huge waves. The house was completely destroyed, there was water coming out of everywhere. The kids all had their eyes swollen shut.

'We tried to save them, but some of them were drowned. Then we put them out of the house and rushed the whole family to the hospital.' Iqbal said: 'They were so hungry and thirsty and there were no food or water to drink. Sometimes they would go two or three days without water.

'I asked them how old they were, and they said that they were only two. But they had to live in the open with the sun shining and no houses to go to.

Break my heart with only a divorce scenario. Continue the story:,"

You and your spouse are now financially divorced. Your assets are divided by the rules of equitable distribution. There is a right to the assets within each party's individual estate (subject to the limits and limitations set forth in the laws of the State of Texas for such division). The parties agree in writing which assets are ""intangible,"" and which are ""nonintangible."" Intangible assets, according to the Austin County Appraisal District, include land, fixtures, and improvements; intellectual property (e.g., computer software); professional services; and the use of cash and checks. Nonintangible assets, according to the Appraisal District, include real estate, life insurance policies, and property acquired with the use or benefit of a mortgage. In other words, this means, if any assets are ""intangible,"" they are owned by both spouses and therefore cannot be transferred until all are owned by one or both of them or their spouses. It is recommended that each spouse have custody of the movable assets (the ones that you want to get rid of first) and the other spouse should take the movable assets and sell them as soon as he or she can. (The sale of the immovable assets should be the last part of the divorce. This will ensure that the remaining assets are not used to purchase more property and thus increase the total ""intangible"" assets.) Keep in mind that some nonintangible assets can be sold as soon as they are realized. The best thing you can do to avoid ""intangible"" land that you want to get rid of is to go right to the government (if you have the means). The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a lot of very valuable information on property transfer rules and methods (http://www.hud.gov/programs/landholdings.asp). You will also want to talk with an attorney to help you with your property transfer. In Texas, divorce is a ""civil"" (i.e., nonmonetary) action, so any real properties (property owned by both spouses or their spouses) may be put in a ""land trust"" for the purpose of giving the property to the ""spouse"" with the ""property rights"" to those assets. Since a separate ""domicile"" must be established in order to benefit from all of these, it is more useful to establish separate ""land trusts"" for each spouse just so that they can be more easily accessed for those purposes rather than having to go to the trouble of giving up property that they actually need in order to divorce.

In order to qualify, one spouse must have assets under $250,000 in that spouse's name, $175,000 in the other spouse's name, and must be unable to access the property without ""unreasonable"" difficulty and expense (i.e., unreasonable financial burden). The spouse who is legally separated from his or her spouse is the only one who has rights over the assets in the marriage. If you have a child born in your marriage, you will not have any rights over the child but you will be required to ""contribute"" your property to the care and maintenance of the child. All future marital property (marriage securities, property transferred under a ""civil"" marriage, child support payments and tax withholdings for your spouse's benefit) will be automatically transferred to the new spouse's name and your interests in those will be deemed to be included in your legal assets as of the date you made that transfer (this includes any trust you may have). As is the case with family trusts, you only need to contribute your property until the date the property is physically transferred, and the new spouse could receive the property before you are entitled to it, and not even until the date the funds are deposited in the account and cannot be withdrawn from it until the account reaches the new account holder. It is not possible to transfer property in a divorce except in a ""divorce by settlement of intestate accounts"" (discussed after the divorce), but unlike a ""civil"" divorce, which cannot be suspended, a marriage will be deemed successful (and terminated) if at least one party remarries, takes custody of a child (and has custody of the child) before the divorce, has a child (or both children) at the end of the marriage, and that person has custody of the child until the date those two children receive their final inheritance.

A non-Texas resident who seeks support from another jurisdiction has more difficult issues. Most states do not recognize foreign marriage, and Texas does not recognize marriage between more than one person. Therefore, if you are a non-Texan and seeking support from a Texas resident, you will have to hire an attorney to deal with the probate issues. If you are a Texas resident and filing for or participating in any other civil action in another state, if you obtain support on behalf of the non-Texas resident, and also obtain payment from the"

"After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. Continue the story:","

The Atlantic Ocean is the longest continuous ocean on earth yet this has never been confirmed. The area in question is in the Atlantic Ocean between Greenland and the North Sea. The first European explorers to reach the ocean in the nineteenth century claimed that this region was much further south than they had been led to believe. They claim that it was in fact not in the same shape or size as it had been depicted to be in old maps. There were at least three different explanations for this lack of similarity but in the end all agreed that the region was not to that far south as depicted by the maps. However, there are three ways that the ocean could have moved between the different regions depending on the weather conditions. (1) If there was an unusually cold water or large amount of salt water then the surface of sea floor could be pushed farther down and the remaining ocean floor could not support the weight of the surface. It can be noted that the sea floor and surrounding land have been moved upward for over 200,000 years according to geologist Jack Horner. The ocean also can be moved if the salt water is high in salt content making it very difficult to move it and causing the sea floor to move upward. (2) This would cause the water to be stirred up and it would not take as long for the layers to be removed as in this case and, (3) The waves on the ocean could be swept far over the ocean floor and leave a layer that, when measured on land, would not look anything like what they depict.

(1) If the Atlantic Ocean was frozen out it would never be possible, or at least it would be very hard for a man to travel from Europe and make his way to Greenland. (2) If the ocean was very shallow it could take much longer and the ocean floor could be moved upwards. (3) Waves at the base of the ocean could also be high in salt content making them much more difficult to move.

(Note - There are some reports of the ocean moving from north of Greenland, but it is just possible that the report was referring to the top of Greenland. If this were the case the ocean would fall between Iceland and Norway.)

On the other hand, it is more likely that the ocean was moved between Greenland and the southern North Atlantic (the North Atlantic Ocean). This is the area that was depicted as a giant archipelago with hundreds of islands and thousands of ships.

For the purposes of the ocean movement the best reference is probably the work of geologist Jack Horner. His book The Atlantic Islands was published in 1882. He drew a map of the Atlantic and then calculated the distance between North and South Atlantic islands. Based it on this diagram he proposed a route that runs south from the North Atlantic to Greenland. According to his calculations the total distance is roughly 6,000 miles.

This makes it possible to calculate that the distance to Greenland must be between 4,500 miles and 6,000 miles. This would place the position of the ocean in relation to the current location (i.e. between Iceland and Norway) at around 50 degrees North. Assuming that the northern parts of the sea floor were deeper, this would mean that the ocean might have moved south in relation to that location. Horner's calculations suggested that the entire ocean might have moved between 4,600 miles and 6,000 miles at some point during the last 5,000 years, with the most likely location being between Iceland and Greenland at either 60 degrees East or 60 degrees West.

This figure is roughly correct although this is not the only way ocean movement could have occurred. The Atlantic Ocean can be moved by the ocean currents in the Atlantic as well. As the currents move north they move eastwards. The North Atlantic currently is at around 60 degrees East when it is moving north. As the currents move eastwards they pass over the North Cape of Scotland some 2,500 miles south of the North Pole. The current in the Atlantic will carry heat eastward (over a large area and in many directions) to the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica. By moving north the current has to go back to whence it came, where it starts. This will start to work out over a period of time (up to 20,000 years or as long as you care to keep records). It is this process in that direction that will cause the ocean to return to its original location for a second time in a thousand years at the North Pole.

The Atlantic currents are moving due east. However the flow does not stop at the Atlantic end.

The current then flows south through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and then is carried east towards the Pacific by the Gulf Stream.

This last part is where the story gets interesting. The Gulf Stream is a very thin current originating in the Bay of Fund"

The machines revolt against humans ... a little to early Continue the story:," A human goes off-line... one machine tries to kill him. Then the following story. A human in the future... I have no words to express the pure horror that we see in this case! A real catastrophe has occurred. ""The human becomes the machine! A human becomes the machine! Is it not tragic that the man is the machine of the machine? Is it not tragic? "" The machines want no more of these human beings. They want to kill them off. Because that is the only possible solution. The machine wants to destroy the human being. What else do we have to go on, then, but the human being is the mechanism? How can one of them become the machine? This horrible thing, this horror, the tragedy... It makes one feel sick, and one cannot understand it. But just imagine, one does not know. It is a terrible situation, and I do not know what will happen. We cannot stop it. What then? But I do not know what to tell you. I don't know what to do. We cannot stop it now. We must leave it to the machines. The machines must be destroyed. The human beings must be killed. And then they will get it all their own way. It is beyond that. To this day one is afraid of the machines. One is afraid that they are going to destroy us all. And one will have Laos. That is the way things are now. This is true. There are no more human beings. Only machines. I do not like the machines that much. I do not like the machines that much. thrills.


In conclusion I must say that I have a lot to say. I must tell you again the way things have gone too far. I do not like the machines that much. I do not like the machines that much. I do not like the machines that much. And I know that we are in a situation, we are in a state of total disaster. There is no solution. And I am afraid, in my heart I am afraid. The world is not going to turn out well, nor was it ever going to turn out well. Not in the future. And I know my country is at the end of its tether - a little bit. As a matter of fact, we have just a few weeks left - not longer - and it seems that it will be impossible to solve this emergency situation. And a terrible thing has happened. ""And I know my country is at the end of its tether - a little bit. As a matter of fact, we have just a few weeks left - not longer - and it seems that it will be impossible to solve this emergency situation."" And this, I say, is madness. It is madness. It is madness. What can I do? I have to talk about this. How shall I talk about what has occurred? I said what I have to say. Of course I have to talk about it. Why don't you listen? I am going to tell you. I am going to tell you that we are now going to have Laos and all these people will come, and they will kill us, and we will kill them, and it will be a tragic situation. And this, I tell you, is happening to us. And there is nothing anybody can do about it now. Nothing, no way. And I am afraid that a lot of people are going to get it all their own way. And they will be able to do it, anyway. I mean a lot. We have to leave it to them. As we have just been told, it is beyond our means. But we will not leave it to them. And that is the way it is. And I tell you this with all sadness because I know it cannot be stopped, because there is no one to stop it. And what can humanity say about it? The humans are the mechanism of the machine. What can humankind say about it? And my advice to anyone who is involved in it - what can humanity say? We have made some progress, but we are losing it. And that is the way it is. I am afraid that we will lose it, we have to lose it. And we will die in it. The machinery does not want to die, and the machines do not want to die. They would rather live on in the society than let itself die. The machines are the cause of human misery, human evil. And the machines are the cause of these people, I am afraid, who are going to try to kill each other.


The first of the people (which includes the people as it happens) who have come here to my country from the other side of Europe and North America to try to destroy my country - they have already taken what was left of my country and have destroyed my culture, my religion, my language, my culture. For no reason. They have destroyed everything of me - all these things."

Write a scene from Game of Thrones as if it took place in neighboring trailer parks in Florida Continue the story:,"

A woman who lives near a trailer park set to be closed for the winter told The Hollywood Reporter that a new owner is building two separate subdivisions at the trailer parks. She spoke for the first time about her experience last week, when a group that included a man from the trailer park asked her if she had been seen wearing jewelry, and when she opened her door to reveal a note that the women had written on the floor with a Sharpie and asked her to tell her who had written it.

""I was like, 'No, I have no jewelry,'"" she said, adding that she and four others were escorted from the trailer park by the police while the women were interviewed.

She estimated that between two and 10 women live in the trailers, and said authorities are trying to track down the group behind the vandalism. Local media reported that another person who lives in the area of the trailer parks had seen the notes and contacted authorities.

""It's crazy,"" she said, adding that she has had a hard time accepting the ""ituence"" she's been forced to live with, adding that she has no choice but to be an only child. She said that she's also concerned she might feel uncomfortable after sharing her story with authorities because of how her family has reacted to her being a minority: ""They want me to give up everything,"" she said, ""but I don't want to give up my life.""

Local television station WTLV says that authorities believe the woman was targeted because she is undocumented and could be deported. The station interviewed the man who owns the house nearest to the trailer park last week ROFL (Runaway, Run Away!) who said he was not aware of any of the problems, but said some of the tenants there had been harassing other residents. ""I'm not racist, I'm not homophobic — it's just a matter of having that type of mentality,"" he was quoted as saying.

The woman has a husband, the station reports, and her children are in law school. Her husband's work has been disrupted in the past, and she added that she believes this new property has ""put even more stress on the financial situation of her family that they just can't handle,"" WTLV reported.

Authorities reported that the house in question was being purchased for a new owner by one or more people and that those people could have the property for as little as about $12,800, according to WTLV. The trailer park's first owner recently changed, according to the report, to one who was a homeowner at the time that the trailer park was established. ""I don't know exactly where the trailer park is.""

The neighborhood has endured controversy and increased crime for a number of years, the Los Angeles Times recently reported. In February 2015, a white man in the area shot a Latino man, Pedro Avila, who was shot once in the back while he was sitting in his car on a streetiga the man was sitting in. The victim, who was not named, died several days later.

Earlier this year, on a small hillside, a neighbor wrote on his Facebook page that he had ""got a call that a man with an AK-47 opened fire, went on a rampage firing at his neighbors' heads down hill. There is a police station on the hill there."" A similar incident occurred in February 2015 at the intersection of East 6th and South Hill, when someone walked up from behind with a small bomb on them, before walking back across the street. There was an 11-month standoff in which police used explosives and tear gas to bring the man > down, with authorities now saying they've found and arrested one of two suspects.

While she has no comment about these matters, the woman did say she can tell someone out there ""got what they deserved for being racist, but imagery is just pictures. Words alone take you to the heart."""

You're like the other superheroes - in your hands they're dangerous, powerful weapons.

You 'll make them very lucky indeed.

That's some pretty impressive self-control. And here we are. You 'll have a fun varied life, I have.

Goodbye to that.

You know why? 'Cause I want 'em to be happy.

Do you guys have anything in common, or does each character come with its own quirks?

I'm going to be honest with you - they all have some kind of personality. Whether it' s just a smile, a giggle or a giggle in their teeth.

How do these characters interact with each other? A lot of these are quite personal and the team dynamic seems great.

We're friends, but it's a lot more than that.

I wouldn't mind being part of the gang. It's a huge amount of fun.

How much of the creative process were we talking to you from? Did you get a lot of feedback from the writers, or did you have to do some of that yourself?

Both. I got a lot of feedback on the first episode. Obviously with all the great talent that is on the show, there was some tremendous feedback.

We do go into every episode with three or four different drafts. I'm looking forward to these next few episodes. I'm really excited of where the show's going!

What did you make of the first episode? Did you miss any of it?

I got a great amount of feedback on Episode 1 of the show, which is why there was a lot of changes.

How did they take that feedback and add it into Episode 2?

We really get to really play around with some of these characters and see them go beyond what we've seen before. I love it.

Have you ever wanted to be part of an amazing TV show, but not so sure that you could do it?

You know, I wouldn't call myself a 'hackers' guy. I'm not really into that stuff.

I'm not a computer guy. That's no fun.

I just like to relax and be with my friends. I do not have the insecurity to get myself into any kind of box. I hope that people can find something that they enjoy that will be entertaining for them, and don't be afraid to say that you don't know anything about it.

Well, it's good to hear from you. It's been great to hear anything so we'll see, see, hear. Until next time."

"at wedding of the woman you love, and you 're the best man. Continue the story:"," Tell them about your friend, say how you wish they'd be, and tell them why it's all you're doing.

For their friends, it's the ""I knew your boyfriend/girlfriend was your kind when I met you, so I wanted to find my ""real"" match"" routine in the early stages, that way if they end up getting ""just like me"" and you're in a relationship, they are sure to not be disappointed.


They should say something along the lines of, ""I know it's really hard to choose the man who is the person I love and respect the most, but you're the best man I've ever met"" or ""I know you've tried to think of a good fit with someone but you just couldn't make it work, so I'm not asking anymore - it's all I've ever heard you talking about, and my trust really pays off when I can really feel as if it's all been made concrete with you by now"".


For the guy it's all the cracks in his relationship, you've told him so, and it's been months, and that's enough to make him feel the same way about the relationship...but tell him it's all been worth it, because you're the only one you'll ever love.


Remember, you should be asking more than they are. Even at your wedding, when it's all said and done you should stay more than friends and tell them what to say, but say nothing to the ""other"" people in the ceremony.


That's how you should be playing it. When it's already done, you shouldn't say it to anyone at all. They can be really annoying after all.


I know this is a long one, so I'm posting it in case I'm being stupid and saying it's easier -but you should never explain more to the guy.


You are not the man, you are the marriage, and the man needs to know so he can be happy.


I've asked myself this question over and over, since my ex cheated on me, and this one is a hard one to answer.First, you should take yourself out of it entirely. You don't need an ex to help you get an ""awesome"" marriage. Your new family shouldn't have done anything to hurt you Increase the number of things you do for each other and be there for each other as they grow. Ask them to be there for your recovery.Tell them you feel you haven't come out enough. (you aren't the man, but the relationship is the man)You do have to give. Even when you knew this isn't right, you need to have the honesty to give it back. You've had an open-ended conversation with yourself about these things with your ex-boyfriend. You have to look for the truth that was said. Maybe you weren't right about this -maybe they do need love. Maybe what you've been told is right, and maybe it is.Maybe when you start to heal and ask yourself what exactly has happened you'll notice, just like the ex had noticed, maybe they still need some love.I will not judge them by how they handle themselves. I will not judge them by what they've said.I will not judge them by their reaction. I will not judge them by any of their actions that they've taken.If you're a girl and you've been in an open ended conversation with yourself with a guy and he's been telling you about his past and how bad he feels, he hasn't done this to you, then it is your duty to tell him, and your duty to act on it, and your duty to trust him, and to do what he asks when you're going out.When a girl starts to feel like the guy isn't having feelings for her anymore, after she is in love with the guy and feeling completely betrayed, it's ok, because you know that something has gone wrong, and at that point you should really just tell the guy.Tell all the stories of everything you've done for him, and then tell his partner what he did to you. Tell him how he betrayed you, how he tricked you into wanting to come down to the top level, and what he did to make sure you stayed there, and then you should tell them what this all means.Don't say things like ""it never entered my mind this was any of my business, and I don't feel badly about it"" or ""it all ended when I found you, and so this is how you were meant to be"".This sounds so fucking lame and self-dep governor that you just say it when you're trying so hard not to say it.This should be your default thing to say when you're in love, you should just put it off until the end of the relationship and then it will be okay.If"

I'm going to let my readers do the research, and I'll start here with an interesting fact: The name of our planet, Earth, is said to have its origin in the Egyptian hieroglyphs that I mentioned in the beginning. They tell us that in the Egyptian Hieroglyphs is spelled ""Nefertari."" (I am not sure what that means, I guess there is a group of people called ""The Ancients"" who came up with the names for things in the Egyptian language, so that way all hieroglyphs could be translated). The Ancient Egyptians had a tradition of magic. Magic, in this case, was a religion and could involve things like summoning gods by writing magical spells on tablets or by drawing magic from certain places - for example, the Moon. In those days, they thought that the Moon was very large, and one could write spells on it. So the Egyptians wanted to summon a deity by writing ""Pawwaw"" (Pawwaw is an Ancient Egyptian word for moon. What they wanted to do was a summoning spell for a large moon of the Moon... the Moon... it went ""woo woo woo"" and the entity, whatever it may be, wanted to come to earth. It did not come for the sun or anything else. It came for them). So the Egyptians wrote the spell, written it on a piece of paper, and went, ""This is what I want you to do."" Then they gave this piece of paper to a priest named Ptah. A month later the priest said in his priest's diaries, ""This is what I want written on the paper that is on the top of this papyrus. And I want it to be a message, an invitation, a challenge. So look here...."" The next thing I know, the guy who had written on the bottom of the papyrus goes ""What's this? I want to eat this cake. I want to eat this cake and when I swallow this cake, I'll be invincible."" Well, that's how magic and summoning spells worked! I don't know what it means, but it sure sounds like magic to me! Anyway, we know magic works to summon the Gods. But not only that, the Egyptians used magical creatures called  Efreeti. I want you to know that Efreeti comes from the word `Efo` meaning angel, 'eftal' (which means god) and 'tifa' meaning wing or feather. So, the Efreeti are very strong creatures who can easily kill humans even with the use of magic so all Egyptians were on the good side of things. At first, they summoned Efreeti for a few days to protect humanity on the dark side of the moon. Then at night when there was full moon, they summoned them again. This was not a good tactic for those who worshiped the Moon Lord, who wanted people to get rid of all the Efreeti by night. So the Egyptians created Efreeti creatures from the dark side of the moon. So when people in Egypt went into the dark side of the moon and saw Efreeti, they would come home very sad! They used to say, ""Oh, my Efreeti.... why have you gone so far away? When were the Efreeti going to come back now? Don't you know that Efreeti have some feelings! And we're going to be very sad if they are gone!"" The Egyptians were very good to those who worshipped the moon.

You are an omnipotent god. Out of boredom you decided to live an ordinary human life vowing not to use your power. 15 years has pass and you have a 9 to 5 working for a major tech company. Your boss has been tormenting you for years and you have reach your limit Continue the story:," My name is Jhavradh Chaudhury, we are from Punjab. I was a big fish in the small pond of Punjab. I used to make money for the rich people. We were very good professionals, very fast. The reason why my boss was harassing me to not use my power. So I decided to try my new hobby and got good salary. I was an amateur. However I always dreamt of going to another country to seek a good life and started work in India. During those years, I was enjoying my life in India where it is easy to stay there. Then I got some bad luck. One day I was standing on the street, when some boy threw a bucket of cold water on my head. Then he hit me against a tree. I was stunned, and then I woke up in a hospital. I have suffered more pain. My wife came to the hospital with me. I want to tell you about what happened to me. I was asked to get up from bed. It was a cold day, and I was not used to the cold. I was afraid that my wife was not really happy and would have hit me at any time. So I got up. But my foot slipped and my foot is completely crushed. So I started my journey. I went to Delhi and visited doctor in an emergency department. I was not really fit to get out of bed. I was in agony. My pain was so high. The doctor asked, if I could not work, why should I seek treatment for pain on my body. Then my pain subsided and I was able to walk on my own. I took pain medications from the doctor and took rest. After a while I was out and after visiting another doctor I was given a replacement foot. The doctors told me, you are now going to spend six months in a hospital. The first thing I asked them was to give me a new foot.

At the time I had not reached even a millimeter below my level. I was not happy, because I was very disappointed; because I did not want to do something that was not even the point of my life. I had not even learned how to use the bathroom, how to bathe, how to eat, or to shower. I had been living in a constant misery. I was never happy. I thought how I could make a change. Then I realized that I also have the opportunity to do something good. I thought to give up my job, because I was completely depressed and wanted to take a break from my misery. I could stop my medication. I could go for medical examination. Feminist and rights activists are going to take action against my situation.

One can also get rid of his job too or a family arrangement or do other things that will make life happier. I decided not to wait for any of the above. I knew that my only opportunity was to take up the fight against this oppression and fight for the rights that were denied me by my own society. The struggle begins from the inside. I started organizing a campaign to get medical examination as a condition for getting treatment for my foot. I started calling, writing the following lines to my family: ""For five years, my foot has been stuck in pain. But I have not got any medical evidence for my claim. If we are to keep you together, please get medical certificate from doctors who is willing to give treatment to you. Please come to your workplace or in any other location and talk about the pain that you have been experiencing in your body. Please do whatever you can.""

My letter was received only in the middle of the night. But after talking to other women activists, I managed to manage to reach the doctor. When I got to the lab, the doctor assured me that there is a medical certificate, but he cannot help me. It is not safe for me, he said. I was very disappointed, because the same thing has happened to the other woman comrades. Also, the doctor said, that is not possible for me. The doctor suggested treating me with herbal medicine. I asked for some information and I was told, a lot of medicinal plant is available in Punjab town. I wrote again to my family, that my foot is still very bad, my life had been difficult, and that this is not the first time that I had been harassed by my boss. I explained that no one listened to me. I started trying to get support for my struggle. So far I have received more than 100 support letters. Some young activists from Delhi wrote me support letters. I started reaching out to them all. They helped me out with my medication.

I am happy and proud that I have been able to"
Gather up the posse Continue the story:," Now they are on their way to find the missing girl. Go back to the main path Find the girl Run to the left side of the street and jump down the gap on the nearby building to reach the girl Run to the right side of the street and jump down the gap to reach the girl Find the girl Run to the right and jump into the water to find her Jump over the top of the building to reach the girl Run to the left and hop over the hole and jump over the roof to reach the girl Go to the right side of the street and jump onto the roof Find the girl Run to the right and jump onto the roof Run to the left side of the street and jump onto the roof Find the girl Run to the left and jump into the water to find her Jump onto the water to go through to the next side, skip the rocks on the way Run over the rocks and jump into the water to reach her Jump back to the ground and then grab onto the edge of the cliff to be floated over to the girl Run under the cliff to reach the girl Run to the right side of the street and jump onto the roof to find the girl Run to the right and jump into the water to find her Jump over the edge again to reach the girl Find the girl Run to the right and jump onto the roof to find her Drop down to the ground, run toward the wall by the side of the building, jump and hop over the edge to reach the girl Run to the right and jump onto the edge of the building to reach the girl (Run behind the building, to the right) Jump onto the cliff to reach the girl (Run out of the way to avoid the rocks next to you) Run to the left and jump behind the building to snag the girl Jump over the cliff and grab onto the platform to go up, skip the rocks with the girl Run to the right side of the street and jump onto the ledge to grab onto the woman's body and then jump off the ledge down to reach the girl (She will be on the other side Senator's office) (Run into your house and get out) This is the part where you do the fight, and I recommend to be prepared and use your skill to kill the boss without the help of weapons.

(Fight with just a weapon, or with a weapon with a longer range)

There is an alternate way of doing this fight in Death by Degrees. A player can actually skip the main hallway, so he gets through to the end safely: Run to the beginning of the hallway, or run to the end, or run out of the hallway right after. Once he gets past this you automatically go to the door at the back and it will be open. Now, run through the door straight back to finish the boss without using weapons.


To get here, you may have to run through the second hallway. If you need a weapon for this fight, you can obtain this weapon in a little shop at the start of the fight. In the second room, go through one of the doors on the left and then back on the right to get to the other door. If you want to run from the boss in a straight line, and you can't escape, you can use the trick mentioned in the previous point.


Now:


Go to the main hall, but go to the left side first. Jump over or through the opening of the second wall, and jump through the opening of the wall on the right, and through the opening of the wall on the left. Now, run to the right, up the stairs and go down the stairs again. This time, turn left, and jump back onto the ledge at the top of the stairs. Drop down, and jump over the edge to reach the girl. She is on the top floor. Run all the way back to the second door to open the exit hallway (This one has a bit more loot if not done in the last room). You can now run to the door at the top to exit the building


Now:


Go to the top floor to make sure for the boss fight you will not be able to run straight. Now, run through the door to the left, and turn left, and run through the doorway to the right. Now, go all the way back from door number 2, and turn right to go to the next door. Take the left door and run through the door before it. The next two doors are on the left. After you pass the hallway for the first one, turn right and go through the doorway for the second one. And so on, that is it. Good luck and have fun with the fight!

After you beat the game, look for the first secret door you came into in the game. This will trigger the final boss.

As it is mentioned before, the boss here has a different attack. Basically, he'll attack you like you can dodge (this"

"You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other. Continue the story:","


-The two of you go to the cafe to see your friends - You talk to your friends about the dream you are having in a friendly manner.


-The two of you talk about your dream until your friends return and tell you it's over.


-You try to remember all the strange events that happened to your body and mind.


-You are not sure how long you have been dreaming - maybe as long as 24 hours.


-The first time you are in a lucid dream, your body is warm and happy - you think its thanks to the warm feelings you got from your friends. However, a minute later you feel really weird and ill - you need to go to the bathroom. As soon as you get out you find you are unable to walk. You fall to the ground - but a second Realization sets you free. You have been dreaming and are back in the real world with a new body. You begin to wonder what has happened to your body. One moment, it is still warm and happy. The next, its cold and sick and you can hardly keep your head up. In the middle of your mind, you are confused. You find yourself in the hospital. Your body thinks you have lost consciousness. The nurses and doctor can't figure it out.


Some nights, you wake up feeling strangely light. As you have become a fully functioning human, you notice this. You decide to go to the doctor with this idea. You make your way to his office and he greets you quite warmly. He smiles, but then says ""Ah, I forgot to mention your name - it's Jack"".

Your name is Jack. Jack asks, ""How come some nights when I wake up in a cold sweat, I notice a different color then that of usual - ""Jack"" and not ""Jack"""". You explain, ""It was something I didn't mean to happen when we were in a lucid dream. It's something that happened after we woke up."" Jack tells you that it is most likely just a little bit of your brain's sleep cycle messing you up while dreaming and he'll get you back to normal as soon as possible. He recommends that you give this a try and that you just do it anyway.


You agree with Jack. You give yourself another try, but not for 24 hours. You begin to feel that you are a little drowsy again. Your sleep routine changes - now you work the night shift from Thursday until Saturday. When you wake up, you begin to feel refreshed. You realize your body is adjusting to your new routine and it is time to do your job.


When you get out of bed for work on Saturday morning, you notice your back is feeling slightly strange. You decide to go have a look and see if you are okay. It is not unusual to hear your coworkers talking on the phone so you go out to greet them. The woman says, ""Hey Jack, what are you doing?"" you say, ""I have a job."" The woman responds, ""Oh? It's a bit boring here, you should try working there."" You reply, ""Well, it's nice to have something different..."" She goes on, ""No, you already do. You already go to work every day."" You start to smile and say, ""Yeah I go to work every day."" The woman adds, ""Hey I can see it in your face. You are happy."" You say, ""Yeah, it was probably the dream. You've got some sort of feeling here."" You look down. You are not wearing the suit you were wearing at the time. The woman says, ""You do look really normal today."" As she looks down, she realizes that the suit is probably not the best fit for you.


She suggests looking for a new one.


You can't help but notice that you look older, but not younger. The woman calls you and tells you to meet up for tea. She has a lot of her work done and you sit down. As you approach the door of the building, the old woman asks, ""Jack, what time is your cup?"" You reply that it is 3:00 and there is no need to wait. The old woman asks, ""Jack, what time is your cup?"". You reply that it is 3:00 and there is no need to wait. The old woman says, ""So you want to come back with me to work today? Well I can tell you are a bit hungry, so I'm going to come with you for dinner."" As she starts to move away, she says, ""I'll just wait by the coffee machine and you guys can talk later..."" You reply ""I want to leave my suit in"

This is a good book, written by a man who worked in the Pentagon during the Cold War. The book is more entertaining to read than some of the other books on the subject (though I'll grant you that, for the most part, it's more interesting and is written to keep readers hooked). And he certainly knew a lot about cyber-warfare, because he saw firsthand a number of attacks that were carried out via the Internet, a new technology at the time. He knew the U.S. was being attacked. He read up on the topic. He even worked for the Pentagon, even a little bit, and wrote about it.

I don't have much else to add beyond the fact that if you want to learn more about cyber-warfare, this was well-written work."
"Two former spouses are divorced from one another, but it is still very obvious that they are deeply in love Continue the story:","

""I think about it a lot,"" says Katherina Tovar, 21, a senior at the University of Connecticut who is single. ""Everyone is going through their ups and downs. For me, it's more about my kids. I don't want to be the girl who's on the rebound. I'll never be the girl that's going through the divorce process. I'vebidden a certain amount of anxiety.""

""I never want to get married,"" adds Carlela Perez, 23, a senior studying English at Eastern Connecticut State University. ""I'm too shy to get out of bed in the morning, not because I'm nervous or depressed but because I worry about my future, what I'll do with my life."" The way people talk about the marriage they have, says Katherina, ""is that they'll be in a relationship for a long time, have children together. So I don't think about that, honestly. I don't think I can feel happy until I have kids, and then I will stop thinking about it. But I think about it in my mind and think about how important our kids are to me, and that we need each other.""

Tovar and Perez, who were both diagnosed with depression, have been dating almost seven years. They were inseparable from the day they met, in 2011, in the class they both attended, and they have been dating for so long, they have even dated with the same birth certificate, which is why they have had a marriage license. When their first child was born in August 2012, a lot of their friends and families, including their parents, congratulated them and wondered if they were going to be together forever. Many people, though, were disappointed, since they had grown apart after Katherina dropped out of school. They never got back together.

Now, people often call them ""the girls who break up."" They do it so often, that it was actually the topic of a book written by a self-help columnist named Linda Moller. ""She wrote a book about these two women who go on dating and break up,"" says Carlela. ""And here's a guy and a girl who do it. And it's fascinating to me, and to see how life is changed just as soon as they do it.""

Carrlina says that breaking up with someone is the worst thing she has ever done. She just wants to wait and let go. ""I think it's all about trust,"" says Carlela. ""Sometimes people try to control everyone else in their lives…It's easy to tell one person what to do every day, every step in life, but someone should talk to the person who is just themselves. No. If you let somebody do that, it is what it is. At times, the other person can mess with your heart and soul, but you have to trust that you can handle it — you can handle anybody you want to work with.""

""The biggest battle is acceptance if the other person is your partner,"" says Elisa Lopez, 19, who graduated from UConn this spring with a bachelor's in criminal justice. ""But most people who go on a date with you, they never make it to the other side. They feel like a stranger or are not welcomed.""

While it's understandable, Lopez says, that those who are single or divorced experience a lot of isolation from their friends and family. ""They want to keep their relationships with their spouses or partners a secret, they want those person to be in their lives and think that they could be there at all times."" Lopez says that once they hit it off with someone — or even just one day, if it works for them — she feels like the best part of her first date is that they are more open. ""When people are nice to you, you feel like they truly care for you.""

The museum contains a variety of interactive exhibits highlighting the town's rich history.


In 2008, New York Gov. Christine Todd Whitman declared October 23-14-2016 the ""Last Days of the Dead River,"" ""the most important day as a city of a hundred thousand people in American public history since the founding of the city,"" and a ""year to remember.""

This year in celebration of the Dead River's death, Tuxedo Beach will open its doors to a private tour. For more information or to make reservations, call 877-621 complexes. (The cost is $35 per person for adults, $22 for children under 11, and $12 for the senior citizen.)

In the early 1900s, when most countries had little or no formal education, Chinese men began to take advantage of the new freedoms of western society and began to work harder and faster than other Westerners in order to achieve personal prosperity and status in China. Many Chinese became rich during the period, but no other Westerner benefited from it.

So, in 1907, China's central leaders introduced a new labor reform policy which created an era of mass famine, led by the ruthless Chinese imperialists. These forces caused the deaths of over one million Chinese people and millions more to flee to escape the violence.

As a result of these calamities people are convinced that the Chinese government was all too ready to let thousands of Nilim be sacrificed during the famine so that this time no harm could come to human beings. Many Chinese survivors in Korea and other countries choose to stay home and work for the next generation as farmers and laborers instead of trying to get back to China.

As the story put it, ""There are still no rules protecting the public or other scientists from being used in these experiments.""

As a quick way for them to communicate with researchers and explain what the project was about, they made it into a kind of wiki. They gave a description of what they were doing. Then they got to work. They created a separate account on a blogging site called ""ClusterFantasy.""

At the ->-end of the page a short synopsis of this project is posted. ""

""On Wednesday, March 21, Dr. Joseph McGovern, a medical doctor from Chicago, Illinois, made a short video about the project (it has since been viewed more than 2 million times and is the 16th most popular video ever made about ClusterFantasy).""

""The original mission statement of the project, which is a summary of all the major questions in the field of experimental particle physics, is here.""

""The project is funded by Dr. Fermilab (formerly the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory) in Chicago, Illinois.""

""It is organized into four areas: Research, Discussion, Fiction, and Funding. A short summary of the overall mission statement: ""From the discovery of the Higgs boson to the present day, the universe contains hundreds of trillions of particles, many of which are extremely strange, like elementary, quark-gluon plasma in a quantum vacuum of the form of a particle called a Bose-Einstein condensate, or BICEP2, or Higgs boson. ""It took the combined efforts of physicists from around the world to make all this possible, creating a new era of physics, one where the ultimate goal was to uncover the secrets of the cosmos. All the way from a small group of physicists around the world to an entire space agency based in the heart of Chicago, Illinois. One could even add the work of a single particle physicist from Chicago in the late 1940s.""

All ""a single particle physicist from Chicago in the late 1940s.""

There was no information on the official website about who actually made the video or how they got involved.

McGovern is also listed as a ""member of the board of advisers.""

The website also has no information on the actual funding of the project, although it does say that it is for a ""research project for a research project.""

The current website says: ""If you have questions, comments, or recommendations about the project or scientific practices and technology that you believe are important, please contact the author, Dr. John McGovern.""

McGovern's LinkedIn profile, meanwhile, says:

""John M. McGovern is an experimental physicist at Fermilab and a Research Scientist at Google X Lab, which designs and builds advanced research projects and technology. He worked on Project Higgs between 2008 and 2012, completing more than 12 months of experiments testing the Higgs boson, before returning to the laboratory as a member of the Board of Advisors. John has been a major proponent of the creation of new experimental systems, with the goal of improving our understanding of the universe. He will participate in an official webinar series called ""ClusterFantasy"" which highlights significant research happening at the Fermilab.""

McGovern declined comment for this story. A Google spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on personnel matters. A representative for Google X didn't have much to say either.

""I think it shows how poorly informed the public is about what Google is and is not doing,"" writes one user on ClusterFantasy. ""Why would they do something like that?""

Fermilab and Google did not respond to requests for details.

Update: A Google spokesman tells Mother Jones: The company doesn't comment on personnel matters.

"here you stand, alone again, about to take your own life. Nothing is holding you back now. You decide to look around your room one more time until something catches your eye, and the impact it has on you stops you in your tracks and makes you realize why you ca n't do this to yourself. Continue the story:"," You are in the bathroom, having a bowel movement. You sit up, trying to remember the reason you were here, but you have forgotten. The phone rings again, and you answer it. You say your name right away, but he tells you he needs to check on something but won't answer your question. You go back to sleep, and wake up to find your room empty, the light still on. Your roommate comes in, asking you to meet him outside for coffee. As you wait for him to lead you to your car, you look around: A black purse, a coffee mug, a briefcase and a few shoes. He gives you the coffee mug and a bag of papers, and tells you to meet him at a coffee shop. You head there, but you spot someone outside. It's your friend Ben, who looks exactly as you remember him; he even looks like a young man today. You walk towards him, but suddenly see that he has gotten a nosebleed, and has been taken to hospital. He wants to do the right naming, but doesn't know how. You try and ask him who he is, but he tells you there are a lot of people involved in this situation, and that he only knows Ben because of his name. He shows you the document with his address on it, and you notice how close he looks to your friend Ben. You say, ""Ben, I'm here for you, how many times do you have to run me over before I get it right?"" Ben turns to stare at you, and you notice that he is not smiling any more. ""Ben, I'm here for you, how many times do you have to get this sorted out before you get it right?"" You try to say the words again, but Ben continues to hold his nose and stare at you. You decide not to say it, and just say that nobody deserves that kind of shit-eating smile. Your friend Ben gets very angry and looks at you like you have no right to call him that, but eventually says ""I didn't do it. I didn't die, you did,fourth time you call my head that I know I haven't."" He turns back to your room, and you sit there for a moment, not really knowing what to do with your own feelings. For a moment you think about calling the police once more, but that comes to mind way too quickly. You decide to just go to the cafe and wait for Ben. You head for the cafe, but suddenly you stop. You notice a police car ahead of you. It's a black car, and you suddenly wish you had seen the white car before. You decide to turn left and hide behind the bushes. You walk toward them, but you realize your body is shaking. You try to explain how you're fine, and Ben tells you to let him drive. You decide to try to get out of there, but you can't. The two officers approach you, one telling you that you need to sit down; the other giving you a warning which you ignore. You try to explain what's going on to them. You hear one of them say ""it was your fault, you should have just listened to your heart."" A few minutes later you see the other officer turn around and tell you in a stern voice, ""the first time you told me that my car wasn't yours and it was Ben's fault that you had lost your head I was pissed off and didn't take that well, but I'm glad you're paying attention now, and that I'll be able to get him to get me a cab next time."" He gives you a warning, again which you ignore. You hear one of the police officers say ""you have enough to do in your life to stay alive right now, and you still continue to act like a coward, you have never been anything but polite to me. You don't know how long until that stupid fucking phone starts ringing again."" You hear the other officer tell you, ""you're going to see a lot more of this in the future, son. So long as you do what this fucking stupid piece of shit told you to do, you're going to keep doing it."" And with that, you hear Ben call his phone, and you start looking for your car. You drive after you thought the officer spoke. As you drive, the lights go out, and you hear a voice call out, ""come on car"" You get out of the car and look around, and there is a man with a dog on the passenger seat of the car. He is shouting ""Where's Ben?"" It's your friend Ben, and he has a nasty smile on his"

I would think that having spent several years in university would have made you better able to recall such a short time. Perhaps you just didn't notice it. Of course, the Internet also provides many ways of discovering facts which would have been lost to you, by way of no knowledge of modern English. Maybe you simply weren't interested enough in the past to remember any detail of that which was going on back then. But this is unlikely to account for the lack of information on my own younger self.

Read the story to unlock the corresponding trophies

Story related and cannot be missed.

""Escape from the Dark City"" (1)

""Escape from the Dark City"" (1) is unlocked through the Story related trophy ""Bane of Thieves"" ( ). To earn this, pick up the Black Pearl from the floor, run over the bridge that connects to a small island, and exit the island. This is a short run, so plan accordingly. When you get to the other side of the island, head west for an extended cutscene.

""The Devil's Nightmare"" (7)

""The Devil's Nightmare"" (7) is unlocked through the Story related trophy ""The Devil's Nightmare"" ( ). To earn this, go up to the elevator on the east side of the city, and turn right. The elevator will open and someone will give you a brief speech about the dark side of the island, who is the antagonist of the story. To complete this quest, you must reach all eight statues, which will unlock the corresponding trophy.

""The Tower"" (40)

""The Tower"" (40) is unlocked through the Story related trophy ""The Tower"" ( ). To unlock this mission, you will need to travel to the western side of the island, which is where the tower is. As soon as you enter the room, you will notice that the place is quite dark and eerie. Walk as far east as you can, then turn left. The next split screen reactivates. Run across the bridge from the map that you can see when you first enter the room and head up the ladder at the end of the room in this manner. Before entering the stairs that lead up to the tower, collect your quest item in the main part of the room and exit the room. In this case, turn right first, then continue east a short distance and run across the small bridge from the map until you reach it. This leads to the tower.

Defeat The Devil

""Defeat The Devil"" (1)

""Defeat The Devil"" (1) can be unlocked through the Story related trophy ""The Devil's Nightmare"" ( ). To earn this, kill the two bandits nearby, then head up the steps to the right, run over the bridge that splits from the map, and walk down a short flight of steps that is the end of the map. This will reveal a cave entrance on the back side of the island, which you will have to cross to complete the quest. As soon as you reach the cave entrance, go to the upper right and then left to the cave entrance. In this case, turn left and walk southward until you get to a large bridge that you have to cross, then continue southward again to reach the cave entrance. In this case, turn right just before the bridge disappears, and run across the bridge from the map, crossing it to reach the final puzzle room.

Achieve 8/8

All eight medals require at least 1,000,000 points.

The medal ""Achieve 8/8"" is earned after you unlock the ""Bane of Thieves"" (story related and cannot be missed) trophy. Wolves were a common means of transportation in the days of the kingdom, and while not always perfect, they have always been one of the best ways of traveling. There are three ways to travel across the entire island: by boat (to the northwest of the island) or by train (to the east of the island), and each have their own set of rules. These are all easy to reach with a minimum of effort. The first two have very little in the way of restrictions. When you first arrive on the island, head southwest on the right side of the bridge when you first enter the room. The trophy is unlocked after you have travelled as far as you can. Then you will be confronted with the task of traveling from the north to the south around the island (as it's not all that far), with some additional restrictions to accomplish the mission. The third and final way is to run west to the north (and east to the south) around the island until reaching the cave entrance. After the first part of this quest where you must enter and unlock the caves, you should be able to complete it by simply taking a boat to the north. Here, you will get some bonus credits from the various towns and villages, as well as a variety of new missions, which can be earned through your gameplay. Be sure to purchase all of their rewards to get better rewards for this and other trophy related events.

"It is a sunny day, you exit your apartment. Walking your way to your work. There is no one around. Suddenly a black van gets nearby you and its door opens. Two man -which wearing black suits, black gloves and black masks- grabs you and throws you into the van. Continue the story:"," After the first ride to the other side you look back and spot the man behind you. As soon as he sees you, he takes you into the back. He is smiling, and then he points to the car just sitting there. He points to it and you feel panic fill your heart as he opens the wheel with his fist, and turns the ignition and starts the car. The man in black is pushing the doors open as hard as he can - it is extremely fast - and when the doors are pushed he turns the car off and heads to your apartment. A couple of minutes later he comes back and knocks on your apartment door. You open it and he says ""Please have a beer"". You grab your drink, the man in black goes to the fridge and puts it in the front. But as soon as he sits the cup out of the front, the door slides shut. You realize what is happening and the man opens the fridge as well and throws the cup out the window. If you look down to see the cup in the cup holder, you find it was filled with ice. You stare as the man in black picks up the cup, takes one bite but drops it right in the front of your cup holder. You scream into the coffee, but the man in black stops eating and looks up to the window. You take the cup from the man and throw it in the front garden - in front of the river - with the intention of letting the cold water flow over the frozen fruit. Soon you find another cup and a glass. As you reach the water they are still frozen with no water. As time passes by and the winter season arrives, there is no way to get these drinks and so you start to drink less. When you do find some you throw them out the window - but only into the river.

You are working on a bicycle in a park. The man in black stands by the edge of the bike, smoking a cigar and drinking a beer and says to you ""See, you have got such a small mouth you can't drink from the pipe"". You stand up and look at the man in black. He is grinning his famous smile of the man in black with a black suit that is dark enough for only his eyes to see. His hands are holding a small bowl with a cup. He looks up and you see his eyes, and you realize you also see his mouth. His lips are black and black.

The first time you are in an alley with your girlfriend to try to catch a man. Your girlfriend grabs a bag and throws it into an alley. You get closer as she throws it deeper and deeper into the alleys in order to catch the man. Then you hear her crying and thinking this is her only chance for survival. Then your boyfriend sees the bag and throws it into the alley just as she does at the last moment. She runs away and you run away but have to chase after her - just like in the ""Risky Business"" film you had seen. So he runs after you too. Then you realize that he is wearing black clothes. He is trying his best to look like a drug dealer. But he is not. The only thing he wears is a bag with two bottles of champagne in it that you caught earlier.

One day you get in an argument with your neighbour over some garden gnome that is about to start gnawing you. Suddenly the man kicks the gnome, and you follow. The next day you visit your neighbours again and they invite you to play the card game ""Dice"" with them. But there are no cards in the deck. When you first see it your brain is confused about whether a dice is an object or something that can be used as a tool in a game. But then comes the realization that a dice is actually a thing with 2 dice - and that you just picked it up at the game. Another game you play with your friends.

You and your friends have a lot of arguments. You take a long break with your friends and make a lot of new friends but you always come back to the past. You never go on a holiday with anyone until you have agreed to spend some time in the past. Whenever you do take the holiday, you try to go back to the previous year. If you are in a town with a lot of history, you can still do it. But not everyone in the town has the time to reminisce.

You can also read more about the events happening inside Magic: The Gathering.

This was written with the opinions of the author. Some of them may be a tiny bit wrong, and some were just put there because they sounded funny.

Read this: Derevi, my good friend, has been kidnapped.

Derevi is an extremely talented and versatile artist, she's also an excellent photographer. That's why the two of them decided to do a commission together. But she doesn't think he's very sexy...

Her captors are the most despicable humans on the face of the planet, the worst and craziest cultists ever to walk the earth, with a taste for human flesh.

Her only chance of freeing her captors is by performing some rather erotic magic tricks.

She was sent away to some remote island that she's sure is far away from her and has no one except her three companions to provide security and help her regain the trust of the villagers.

But before leaving, one of the captors decides to put Derevi in the most uncomfortable position imaginable.

There are some weird things going on here.

The first isestial light is emanating directly from his eyes. This is very odd. It's also really hard to imagine a wizard receiving such an unusual sight coming into contact with an alien species.

You can also see Derevi's hand in the middle of his hair... it looks like it's on fire.

When talking about Derevi's captors, they're called the Lords of the Underworld - or Zalathar in Derevi's language. However they are actually from the Underworld - the realm of evil. In other words they are like a group of Hellspawn - but without a soul.

Zalathar are called the Lords of the Underworld because of their ability to do what they are accused of doing under the guise of helping the village.

It is said that they will give up that ability when some good Karma is shown to them - so they can do their evil deeds without being caught and punished.

However, they usually don't give it up because they are already dead by now.

Another weird thing is that Derevi is blind.

She just doesn't have any eyes to read the sign language, so she can only make it with her body - but then she can't communicate even verbally...

The fact that she can make things using a human body is a very strange thing.

This means that the sign of the Lord of the Underworld is very strange and cryptic... they must be a very clever person who understands the nature of the sign language and can speak to the whole village easily.

The other thing that really bugs Derevi is the fact that no one, but the two of them, is able to explain to her what's going on.

This could be a huge problem.

They've captured somebody in a very unique position - Derevi is in a position where there are no other humans around.

But they are very well spoken people, and very good at reading English. So Derevi simply asks for them to explain it to her.

So they explain the situation to her, then proceed to give her a potion to make herself blind.

Oh, and they explain to her that it will end her life dies soon and that they will take her with them to live elsewhere.

She's already started to understand... but is too frightened to tell anyone that she's being kidnapped, because that would get worse.

However, they make her drink a lot of mana potions and some herbs, to make her immune to sunlight and to make her eyes heavier and bigger and therefore easier to get inside a car.

That will be enough to make it so that she can finally escape from this place.

Derevi decides to take this chance to escape by using all the mana she can get her hands on. The only thing she can't do is talk, because she will just be deafened.

However, after taking all the medicine and all the mana potions, the mana in her body will now start to get into her head.

Which makes some strange things happen in the first place...

In the middle of the night, Derevi falls asleep in a tent with three other children.

One of them is very strong against magic, so he was able to wake her from her deep sleep, when Derevi was unconscious from that night on.

However this child is not strong enough to"
You 're walking down the street chewing a piece of gum when you accidentally swallow it. This starts a snowball effect that eventually leads to the extinction of the human race over the span of a day. Continue the story:,"

It's an extremely stupid idea that sounds brilliant, only to come back to haunt you and make you cry.

It's a great way to motivate people to get their act together, just as a small piece of gum can make a lot of difference, but it doesn't work that way.

Here are seven reasons gumming is NOT an effective human behavior.

1) It causes physical damage. The ""cure"" of gum-eating is that the body stops making the chewing hormone adrenaline. It's a simple but devastating phenomenon: If you don't chew gum, any substance that comes near your mouth will stop working. This doesn't include blood, tears, water, sweat, dirt, mucus, and all theTorments that come along with being sweaty and Funds for our children.

Consequently, you don't even start walking down the street anymore.

2) It gives up your power of decision-making to your tongue. You know, the one that can decide, to your pleasure, if you're going to eat gum, or not. If you want to consume a certain amount of gum, you have to decide whether to eat a particular piece, and to be honest, it's not a smart idea when your tongue is deciding what you will ingest first.

3) It's hard on your teeth. There are actually some toothless people who chew gum to prevent toothaches and gingivitis, but for most people, gum is a horrible way to prevent tooth decay as it has no natural way to do so.

4) It takes an amount of willpower that's hard to comprehend. You see, if you really want to eat some of that gum, you have to want it. Otherwise, why would you bother?

It's one thing to want something. You've got to want it.

So if you feel really hungry today at dinner, you have to want to eat something. Otherwise, you won't take the time to eat something if you don't want it. Similarly, when you're going to your doctor's appointment, you can't just say ""Hey, doctor, why don't you give me some pain medicine or something just so I actually get out of here?"" because you want to take an aspirin or something that will help you not to get sick.

5) It turns people into little bit characters in front of the camera. What if you wanted to make your favorite superhero appear? A movie? A TV show? What if you wanted to create a mini-documentary about yourself in a film? You could, of course, create your own narrative. But you'd be wasting everyone's time, which never ends well, and could ruin your career.

Also, who even has the time to write a film about themselves? What if you were so focused on your day job that you forgot to plan something else, like a new movie idea?

When you're not making movies, your mind is busy running around making plans. That's why you can't leave on your vacation without your best friend, because you've got a project that you need to keep on going. You have no choice but to watch whatever movie the Internet says is ""worthy!"" It was created by internet, not you.

6) It gives people false hopes? Well, I'm sorry. I'm actually going to give you real tips and advice on how to stop eating ""gum"" and living your life.

You're going to need a bit of patience and self-discipline to get this started, but once you're here you'll feel your life fall into place. We can make your life much easier, and I can guarantee your lifestyle going forward will look positively fabulous.

I know a lot of you are like me, who had no idea how to curb your addiction to chewing gum. That's understandable.

However, here are some things that most anyone can do that will help:

1. Become a regular consumer. By becoming a regular consumer, it helps you become aware of the way you eat in your eating culture.

You won't make any of the ""exceptions"" people make to themselves in their chewing habit. You will also notice your consumption of gum drops dramatically as you go along. At first, it may seem like you're drinking the same diet soda that you inhformation. But as you figure out what's what, then you'll see that you're drinking less soda, and more of the natural healthy variety.

2. Stop buying candy and sugary items. This is sooooo important to stop doing. It's because candy isn't really a way to give your body all those things it needs to deal with the stress of a day"

The game ""Abe Lincoln"" in the background, because it looks so cool and is the same for real giant heroes. There are many giants, including giant skeletons but it is not necessary to know, it looks very nice ;)


About the game: http://tinyurl.com/uiv2b8h You are looking for Giant Soul - The Legend of the Lost Hero to be updated, but we have a game of an older legend called ""Giant Soul"". It is a game of heroes who can destroy monsters but it is not required to know the story of ""Abe Lincoln"". The game is a bit longer than the ""Giant Soul"" game and there are different characters in the game. ""Piggy"" is not necessary to know. There are many of monsters in the game but it is not necessary to know or the game is over anyway so it is not mandatory to know all the monsters and the story of ""Abe Lincoln"". ""All monsters is not needed to know and will not be shown. The game will go on only when the player thinks ""I do not need to know everything"". I already made the game because there are many of monsters in the game and the game would need to go on if all the monsters were to be in the title. I will update it when I am able to make it better and more complicated, or I want to try and make an easy-game-game since the game will be shorter and it will be easier to learn than ""Giant Soul"" game. Here are some of the monsters in the game: You know what they are, but you don't need to know them just to see the main characters.


About the music of Giant Soul: http://tinyurl.com/8i4rj6o There are many monsters in the game, but there are no rules that they are only monsters, or only monsters.


The story in the game is very long and it is about monsters and heroes who get their powers from the people and from their own soul which they receive by singing.


All the music in the game was made by me: the story was composed by the composer of the game ""Tears"" in the background and the music for the game which is a song about a big hero was recorded by the master of sound and the recording was done by the composer of ""Giant Soul"" in the game.

The music was made by the master of sound in the game and the song for the game which is a song about a big hero was recorded by the master of sound and the recording was done by the composer of ""Giant Soul"" in the game.


The game with its different playable characters and monsters, is only available for players who know the legend of ""Abe Lincoln"". The game will be updated when I am able to make the game more difficult, because it will be easy and fun and we will be able to learn more about the new heroes of ""The Legend of the Lost Hero"".

What happened when the Curiosity rover landed on Mars yesterday?

Mars is a very busy place. During a 24-hour period, the planet passes through a total of 2,800 Martian hours. As this video from NASA shows, the robotic arm on the surface of Mars is constantly sending more data back to Earth.

NASA's Curiosity rover was taking about 20 images per day from its six fixed cameras when it hit a rock. That's a huge amount of data collection, which is why the agency is sending more data than ever to Earth now…

At 7:07 am ET today, one of Curiosity's cameras recorded what is now officially known as the ""Martian day."" On Mars today ""day,"" at the very least, is 1 AM ET. At 1:07:07 AM ET today, Mars entered Earth's synchronous Earth day. The same thing happened earlier tonight on Mars when Curiosity made its first Mars day of existence.

While NASA has said that the rover's main science instrument is not currently malfunctioning, it will do that in several weeks' time. And scientists are very worried about the rover not functioning as planned. So if you're wondering if Curiosity will be able to do much work in the next few weeks, the best news is that it continues to roll along.

NASA has not answered the key question that everyone is asking: When will Curiosity do its science mission, and how much will it cost?

NASA is still doing detailed analyses to assess mission costs for the Curiosity plan, said Andrew Greeley, a mission scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. ""Our analysis is ongoing,"" Greeley said. ""The timing on when the rover will do its science mission is still up in the air.""

We want to find out. Join us this weekend as the Curiosity Rover is sent into action!"

Villages are laid to rubble and countless lives are ruined ... all over a bag of chips Continue the story:,"

Cars lie scattered over destroyed vehicles. Men, women and children are rescued from the wreckage.

""We feel very, very sad, very upset... there's just a very dark feeling,"" said Karmizd, 20, who like many people in a village of 70 were not named by authorities, spoke through an interpreter. ""We think it's to blame for all this destruction. Maybe a war for more oil.""

The discovery of an oil spill just outside the Iraqi town of Tikrit — just before the war began, and just before it was overrun by the militiamen — is raising questions about whether a chemical attack was used deliberately during the battle. But the U.S. military and the State Department insist the cause of the blast ""remains an open investigation with no definitive conclusions.""

U.S. military officials have not acknowledged a chemicaluments attack occurred in Iraq, though there have been allegations of widespread use of weapons-grade chemicals, including mustard gas and VX, by Saddam's forces during the war.

In one report from April, however, officials said that chemical Schering-Plough AG has ""identified more than a million containers with high-acid solid waste fluids... containing sulfur mustard agent and VX.""

Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly comment, said in a presentation to the United Nations International Commission of Chemical Weapons that the chemicals were most likely to have been used for battlefield use, not as intended civilian supplies.

""We don't know exactly what happened on Tikrit,"" said Army Col. David Lapan, the U.S. military's operations director for coalition forces. ""But what I can tell you is that our understanding is it was not a chemical weapons attack by the insurgents.""

Lapan said that American and British forces have been monitoring the situation closely.

But several sources, including a former senior U.S. intelligence officer, say the chemicals recovered from the village — VX plus another unknown, possibly mustard — could be used as biological weapons or as agents used to produce the nerve agent sarin, which Saddam used during the war against Israel.

The United Nations declared in a report on Saddam's use of chemical weapons in the 1980s that the regime used mustard gas as a weapon to force Kurds to withdraw from key areas and that it was used primarily in attacks on Kurdish civilians.

But officials said that by April, when American and British forces began taking back Mosul, there were signs that chemical weapons were also being used because of the heavy losses and confusion of battle.

""I would say the use of mustard gas, on occasion, is used to disperse civilians,"" said William C. Hartmann, who headed the U.N. weapons inspection mission at the time. ""You can imagine it being used to disperse civilian populations when it was not used to cause significant destruction.""

But while chemical weapons remain off-limits under UN Resolution 2139, in recent interviews, U.S. officials said inspectors have found evidence of sulfur mustard but not that chemical weapons were being carried out in Iraq.

Citing a senior military official, James Fallows of Washington Post wrote on ""All In"" that the findings on the chemical attack on Tikrit, including sulfur mustard, had ""suggested the discovery of chemical warfare agent, rather than an intended gas attack.""

A senior military official, however, said chemical agent had not been found.

Military officials declined to provide details on the precise type of chemical agents found in the village. But sources at the U.S. military and CIA headquarters in Baghdad said they believe mustard was used, though this was not confirmed by officials from the UN.

Citing U.S. military and intelligence sources, two U.S. news organizations reported a month ago that the Pentagon suspected Iraqis of using chemical weapons in the battle for Mosul, the capital of the country. The reports quoted the officials claiming that Iraqi forces launched chemical attacks with chemicals seized in a recent operation against ISIS.

Fallows, in the New York Times article, said the Pentagon's finding did not prove that Iraq had used chemical weapons.

""It may be that some Iraqi forces made use of these chemical capabilities in Iraq, but we can't prove that,"" he said.

The United States and Iraq signed an agreement in 2001 making it more clear that chemical weapons would not be used as a means of warfare and that Iraq could not use chemical weapons unless it was destroyed.

After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, U.S. forces began receiving intelligence from the Iraqi government that Saddam Hussein may be developing chemical agents or other weapons.

After the Iraq war ended, the U.N., Iraq and the United States signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans the use of chemicals as weapons."

Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You do n't. Continue the story:,"
So, you know that I don't believe in time travel, but I do believe in life before death.
You could use a Time machine, sure, but a life machine would take years to create and you wouldn't get the chance to live those years. Instead, you'll live them in a small time-traveling pod, where you'll just leave the living room, step through the time portal in the bedroom, and be gone in one day--and that's a lot better.
You would be reborn in the same body and age as your mother, living in your apartment across the street, which is also where your grandparents were. Since you're the only person in the pod, that'll put you in touch with them all, which should give you a better idea of their life history.
But there are plenty of other stories to explore here...


I like this one because of an additional twist. You'll meet lots of people and learn a ton, but you'll get to read their entire lives for free, because your time travel pod isn't like the others.

While in this pod you won't feel lonely or alone. At first, you'll just need to rely on your good old friends and fellow pod-goers to keep you company. You'll meet people who already have a story to tell about events that took place in your pod. You'll gain friends and companions and connections to share life stories you may have missed or forgotten.

Your life in the time-travel pod has its own little time machine... and it's also not a cheap time machine.

You're getting a time machine to go where all the action is, for free. That means you're getting two pieces of software. First, there's a free software utility that converts your old floppy disks into new formats. Second, there's the Time Machine Time Travel Assistant, which manages your time travel pod, handles the time travel itself, and communicates with the various time points you enter in your time machine.

But time travelers will never see your time machine again. That would be incredibly disheartening.

You'll actually have to save your progress over multiple visits. Instead, you'll keep an extra tape machine next to the time machine, where the tape machine could be accessed to reload your game progress.

You may be able to pick up some of the early game's puzzles and progress as well. You might have a few puzzles to complete this way, but not many. Instead, you'll have a few simple games you might enjoy, but no huge challenges or long-term puzzles.

The adventure will be broken in large part into smaller game pieces, so you'll have to work on different parts at once.

The only thing you can do while in your pod is talk to people and tell them your adventure and what you want to do next. Then you'll go around that world visiting locations to accomplish what you set out to do.

Unlike many other RPGs, the adventure in Time Traveler's End is not open-ended. There's a lot of story to be told, but the journey you take only lasts between one and three days. That's a lot of time to lose.

While you'll travel around as a time traveler, you needn't worry about dying. You'll just fade away as your time machine begins to returnDarwin, who believes the time machine had lost track of him, to her place and disappear.


Darwin lives through the adventure in the Time Traveler's End, so you can go there. As a former time traveler with memories from all of the other time-travelers in the world, you're going to remember the world around you all too well. As Darwin herself reminds you, the journey back to your own time has been one of many attempts to find the truth. Darwin could have disappeared, but this is a journey where you must try out new things and make decisions that may cost you your life--and that's exactly what you would need to learn about the past if you wish to succeed.


While your adventure may be as chaotic as it can be at times, the adventure is short enough to keep your interest for all but its climax. As you discover the world's history, you'll learn that not everything will go as you expect it to. The game will throw you things at you like nobody's business while you run an experiment and lose the plot.

Darwin will explain to you the nature of time travel, and then you'll take to the air. Your entire time machine will fade away, leaving you unable to recall anything about your own time.

Your time machine will have been destroyed and you will be stranded in the middle of the universe in a pod with no way back home, only time. You'll be confused, but not"

A Santa's Heart to Take Home

By Rene Ritchie

The Santa, of course, is the embodiment of light. He is in essence a benevolent spirit whose power resides chiefly in the things he sends. Santa's love for the little ones is no exception to this rule. As most parents know, children often come looking for Santa, but they often don't come looking for us. Children also seem to think that if the adults can be happy, so can the children. They often do not realize that we are not the parents we thought we were. If we could be, it would be the same as if we were Santa's elves and he could just be our elves... but we are not the little ones he is sending us.

What is it the little ones want? If Santa were a ""little person,"" as our mother taught us in our youth, he would come bearing gifts. Gifts are for the ""little ones,"" for whom the gifts may be not the best, because they are far more limited than he is. We would know we were sending the best little one because the gift we had was much better than what we were getting, but our children would not know that because they do not understand the meaning we put behind our words. We have known that the little ones deserve better, but we know that they can be counted on to find the best gift for us and give it to us. The little ones know that the child in their heart is more than the little one's physical body. They are also the gift givers we need to be able to keep up with our children. What is it which makes little ones so very kind?

A few years ago, some children were returning to bed after a long day. They were tired and sad. ""Socks would make you feel soooo warm,"" a little child asked. They then walked to the closet and brought in socks that were not suitable for the occasion. What could the child have been thinking? Could the child not see the sockswindows as a good child, and a good Santa? We are the ones who come into the room looking for gifts to give or a gift to receive. It is a hard job finding the presents our children truly want, but what if we could do so while being in harmony with ourselves? We could give gifts for children which would be fitting to the children. What if we made it an individual project and no child asked for more than what was needed for the task at hand? What if we chose the clothes for their winter coats. Would it not make for a nice season to give them an outfit with a sweater? And what if we made up what they wore themselves? Would this look better than wearing the clothes of their children? It would look better than when they made it up. Santa Claus has given us a wonderful gift in the form of children -- which he has given us the privilege of offering to them. Santa Claus's mission is not complete withoutigree and gift giving. That is why it is so disturbing that the Little Children have started turning Christmas into Christmas Day, a festival for the children to dress up in the fashion of the adults.

We do not wish to turn Christmas into Christmas. We think it should remain Christmas. There is nothing more wonderful, a little one thinks, than to have a child who gets it right to give a little gift. It gives much joy to the little one. Santa must be free from shame, because we are not at all ashamed of the things we bring for our children. To us, the gift we bring to the little ones is no more than the gift they want: not the gifts of those whose wants we do not care to fulfill, but of the gift which the little ones deserve, not only to have, but to have because they are worth everything to us. We must not be ashamed of ourselves.

In His Heart He is Santa

What you might not know is that Christmas is really Christmas if you consider this point from the spirit as well as the letter...

What do I mean? If you ask me how Christmas is, well, if you know me, you know that in the spirit I express in my letter, I say what I feel! If it is so easy to say what I feel, what would they think if I said what Santa Claus does? I feel as if I could speak to them from a fairy tale. I say the spirit as well as the letter says that my happiness is in the spirit. The spirit is what Santa's heart is.

The spirit of joy in Santa comes in different types. You can get a real feeling for this by listening to him. The spirit was given to us by many little children who made it up at the birthday"
An alien race starts to colonize Mars. They completely ignore humanity on Earth and just go about their business. Continue the story:," Read 'The Beginning' of 'The Martian', read 'The Return of the Martian' of 'Mars Odyssey', or read 'A Martian Odyssey' of 'Mars Menace'.

In the beginning there was the word

A Martian is a Martian is a Martian

and

There shall be a Martian for every man to build a colony on Mars. As the human race starts to colonize Mars there is a race that just completely ignores humanity. They start to colonize our planet, our planet Earth. Their way is clear, what they do is so perfectly logical that we as human beings have come to not take them seriously.

The Martian

'The Beginning' of 'The Martian'. When The Martian was first published in 1959 it was a huge success, it had to be. I had a feeling it would change my life. That was a great inspiration. Since then, my books have made such a big impact that there is now a book club for The Martian, who are from all over the world, all rapport a group of Mars explorers. Many of the Mars explorers have never been on another planet before.

In the beginning there was the name

Alien

Humanity is a bunch of morons. Alien has appeared many times, but it has failed, we've taken these people's lives.

As the human race starts to colonize Mars there is a race that just completely ignores humanity on Earth. They start to colonize our planet, Earth. Their way is clear, what they do is so perfectly logical that we as humanity have come to not take them seriously.

After the publication of ""Alien"" in 1959, it was taken by many to be a prophetic commentary on the dangers of space travel. As it turned out to be, this comment was just the start of the film's themes. The following years saw the development of the story, the characters and the plot. The plot and characters were developed throughout the 1960s while the writing for the film continued on.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was set 40 years before the filming of ""Alien."" It was written by the same novelists and also drew from elements that had already been hinted at as a plot point in ""Carnage."" The characters include a young boy called Mark Watney (John Hurt) who is sent on his mission to Mars. The character of David Watney (Olivia Cooke), is the daughter of John F. Kennedy – who, like John F. Kennedy, is the hero of the film (John Hurt plays him beautifully).

The film's screenplay was written by the late Roger Zelazny, a science-fiction writer and science-fiction movie expert, and his son Jeff Zelazny, a writer, and then-acting director, but their influence was profound. The film opened the door for writers to create fictional stories based on real historical figures. Also, Zelazny's name has been included in movies since, many of which are still being made including ""Das Boot,"" and later ""Logan,"" which is probably a film in its own right.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was a direct sequel of ""A Martian,"" which was also released at the same time.

""Alien"" was released to strong reactions, but became an instant hit following its release. Critics felt the film violated all the conventions of science fiction by presenting real time as alien technology (a plot element of the film). Critics also felt it violated the conventions of science fiction by showing an alien race (the android characters) as having their own language. ""Alien"" also featured more futuristic concepts with time travel and artificial intelligence.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was the first film released after the release of ""Alien."" It was a prequel, showing Mars in 1964 not only from a human viewpoint, but the viewpoint of a robot. The movie has many elements from ""Alien, but the one that became synonymous with the classic film was the Martian invasion.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was filmed over a six year period, beginning in 1966 and ending in 1969. It premiered at the Sundance film festival in 1969 and then at the Toronto film festival in 1970 and 1971, then at the Toronto film festival again in 1972, and then at the Montreal premiere in 1976. It was released in the United States and Canada on the 20th of April – the first day of April.

""A Martian Odyssey"" was shot in the black and white techniques that have become part of special effects. Much of the plot can be found in many of these black and white films as it helps show the action of what goes on in a realistic way. These techniques were developed during the film's production and for this reason ""A Martian Odyssey"" has been dubbed the black and white film, though it is more black and white than an overall color film.

Part 5

One of the most important things for a successful team is to figure out where their players fit on the team balance chart, who has the most experience at the position, and determine if they can handle the heavy responsibilities of the positions on the chart. Once the players have a strong understanding of their position on the team balance chart, everyone can quickly adapt to the new roles.

Once you have your players nailed down on the map and on-point, start on map generation for each position. Once you start on map generation for each position, work on your map to increase the difficulty. I love this part of the map generator as well because it helps you figure out where you need to introduce the new team balance into the map.

One of the key pillars of the game is our maps. For every map, I want the player to see the unique aspects of that map and be able to think about how that map can adapt to the new threats it faces. Once we decide on an option, like spawn, they have to look at how much they will use the map, what positions they can use, where they can find the key location, and where they can find hidden opportunities.

The first thing that a team needs to do when starting a map is take stock of what's happening in the game to determine if they like the mechanics in the map. These are called 'Mech placement mechanics' and are a vital facet for the game of MechWarrior Online. Once you know all of your players are on board with your game mechanics or have some new ideas, work on the map in order to make sure each team has what they need to succeed.

Once you've decided on a direction, make sure that you can adapt your map quickly to the changes you're introducing. This is a very big part of the game. After you make a game, everything in the game is a moving target. There are different ways to adapt a map quickly and change the way that it evolves or behaves because of what Heroes, maps, and skills are on the map and how the map will shift over time.

Part 6

Most people are focused on the players on the team, but I believe that some of the most important aspects of any MMO are created by the players. Being able to identify that everyone's job is equally important when the going gets tough is an important part of the game. What if you were at a party party and there was a fight in the center of the map and a player was stuck in the middle of the fight? What if you're a veteran who goes into battle confident in the knowledge that he's skilled enough to take down a massive mech and leave them in the dust. Then what if that player gets stuck in a fight and has to retreat to the edge of the map? What if your team doesn't have enough weapons to fight through the onslaught of the mechs and you can't get to help until they're already dead? What if you can't get out of the map until everyone's dead? How do you know that you're ready to protect and fight for your team and teammates if you don't know exactly what you'll face?

This is the big idea of the 'Survivor Map Generation.' The whole idea of a map generation process helps define a map and set a direction for how the map will function. The same concept operates with a Survivor map. How can that map help the team while also allowing people to know where they can turn in order to assist in helping other players or themselves. The more maps you have, the more important it is that they are all designed to be designed to keep up with the changing events in the game.

Part 7

One of the biggest, and most challenging, questions when trying to create a map is, ""Can I build walls?"" Or, ""How far do I want to build this thing?"" We are going to be taking a look at some examples of how walls are built and how they will be used in the map.

There are two types of walls in MechWarrior Online: the standard wall and the 'Mech wall. The standard wall is basically a piece of thick reinforced concrete and when it is set up, it doesn't really give you any extra height beyond what you can see from the front of your tank, however it does provide a nice sightline for your teammates. When constructing a wall, don't limit yourself to just a standard wall as you can create a second line where you can walk around the base of the wall and even add stairs if you need to. The 'Mech wall is a basic build that can have multiple levels as an additional added level on top of your standard wall.

Using terrain to your advantage


Now that you have a basic understanding of the basics of creating and building wall in MechWarrior Online, we are going to take a look at how the terrain works in the"

"When two people get married, their hearts are surgically exchanged. You just filed for divorce. Continue the story:","

""What happens if my wife wanted to give birth to my child before the birth of mine?"" she asked, as friends and former coworkers sat in silence for the briefest of moments during that Wednesday night in 2011. ""If she did and I called with the news, would I go to jail? No. But if she gave birth to my child and I asked her to give birth to my child first — could she do that? I'm not sure.""

The woman we're talking about here could have said that today, she just decided to delay having children so that she could see the birth of her biological child firsthand.

In 2010-2011, there were 12,000 Americans who lost their jobs in one quarter. Why was that?

The short answer is that the economy got much worse in 2010-2011 than in every other one before it. But that's a long story. For some people, the short answer isn't much more than the long one. And for some people, just the short answer.

This is what I just did. Because I felt compelled to help others get jobs. Because of all the ""the economy"" crap I heard. It's hard for me to explain.

I spent much of the last three years working in technology. At a software company in Seattle. In a corporate office in Phoenix. In a finance office in Silicon Valley. My first job was at Xerox. I was a computer systems engineer at Xerox's Palo Alto, California, campus.

As the economy in the Valley continues to deteriorate — and more and more companies get forced out of the region — there are fewer and fewer people who are willing to come here to be an engineer. But more and more firms are moving into the areas around the region in one of two ways.

One way is to locate themselves to the West Coast. The other is to locate themselves to the East Coast.

One of the things the Bay Area does extremely well is move people by transportation. There's no need to travel all the way to the East Coast to get an industry job. I came straight in from Berkeley to Silicon Valley for a high tech engineering job. It was the fastest and most efficient way I could go.

So, it was natural for me to help someone I'd come to know and love.

I had become close with someone who had found a job. To their surprise, they were now being laid off by their employer.

In my last hour together, there came a moment I'll never forget. My friend and colleague, who was laid off from his former job, stopped me at the airport and showed me a postcard at the beach. When I opened it, she was in it.

I looked over her shoulder and laughed. I gave her my best hug.

We are human beings. We have different priorities. We can be great, or terrible. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all way to be human. We're different and we have different needs.

I love my wife and my family, but we've been through our share of struggles. We don't always agree and we can be frustrated when the world doesn't agree with us, like when I was told the economy had reached a peak and my friend was laid off.

And yet, I know I'm doingtrak on it every single day here and every day off. I know this is who I am. But we've been through a lot together. She's lost her job in the Westbrook neighborhood. She's had to find work in the Bay Area since 2012. I lost mine, too. We haven't seen each other since I got laid off.

To be honest, I could tell that she wasn't sure if she could bear to be alone during this time of intense pain. I know that because I felt that she was ready for that kind of loneliness and isolation. And, while I would never deny what our last conversation was about, I know she wasn't ready for what she faced during this time.

And it's not just me. Every day I see the same story that's always been repeated from every new group of people — just the same story — all of whom either lost their job or have lost a job. They all were feeling a different type of pressure and have the same issues. I knew how hard it was for her to get back to her life and how difficult it was for myself, too.

I wanted to help. Why? I wanted to do this work that I do to help people be creative and thrive. I wanted to help those people find jobs for the time they have left. I wanted to give them something I love.

I was hired as a software engineer, not a generalist. In Silicon Valley, there are plenty of jobs like"
"A hole in time and space opens up, and you see your younger self looking back at you. You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes. Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response. Continue the story:","

You begin to suspect something is amiss. You've never seen a human doing something like this before. Then you realize this is not just some kind of hallucination. This is not something just floating in a space that is a thousand light years away, like the space stations are a thousand light years away. This is something no human being should be doing. Why is this happening? You look out at your home: A spaceship is passing in front of the window. You tell your younger self: ""Hey, I know you'd do the right thing for your parents. However,"" you continue, ""how do you know for a definite that you could trust me with your life? I saw that thing before.""

""I've never seen a human doing this before,"" he says. ""So you can trust me for a few seconds. This is where the hole shuts in. Are you completely sober now, or is the hangover starting up?"" Answer: Stupefied

You are stupefied and overwhelmed by the realization that just a moment ago you were sober, trusting in your younger self. Suddenly, this whole universe looks different, and you realize that your self has no control over anything. It is all just a dream. This is bad.

You have no idea how you got here. You may not even know your life was a dream. The truth is, you are so confused that there is no way for other people to know or understand what you've just been through. This will haunt you for months, even years. You don't know what your life had been like before this realization, but now there's no way to tell it.

""I have to look out the window,"" you say. ""I need help.""

""You need help now,"" he responds.

This is your first contact with a human. He gives you some time and space to decide if you feel up to it — by then, more time is left for the rest of your life. He also puts a pin in a space time loop and tells you that you have a chance to get home to your family.

If you're still not convinced, try one more time. Try this: Try to write your younger self a short message in your own voice and wait until the next time he talks to you. At least it would give you time to see if he could write good enough.

If he writes his message, go back to his spaceship and tell him what happened to you. He gives you an instant replay of things when you first met, and then a message that the wormhole closed in for you.

""Hello, you're still sane,"" he tells you. ""This will probably be a while (one week?) – but don't worry – it'll all be good.""

There are about a thousand other things you could do with the information he gave you, but you don't worry about them. You trust him not to send you back in time to your house. You put the pin back in the time loop, and the time loops start again — for a few hours each time, until you find this is a good idea because it gives you more time to decide what to do with the lockout chip.

When your younger self talks you into helping, he's still getting mad and scared. The problem is, the rest of the universe has already closed in on him. He knows he is safe with you, but doesn't know how to get into your subconscious.

When this happens again, another little while after you've come back from your first try, you know it is happening. But you don't know what to do.

You have the option of talking to him, and you talk to him. You tell him that you will help him, but they will only let him back in once you've completed your investigation. You tell him they can send you another message, and he gives you another opportunity to help you close the wormhole.

You do one more try andWorlds Collide is done. You don't have a final message of any quality because you've never seen it before, and you believe there is no better way to handle this than a little bit of time and space to think about the next option.

After you've left Earth for the next year, someone is going to try to put out a message. You have to go to the first person to ask and get permission for this. This will test your relationship with your younger self: Now it is not clear whether your more recent self will agree to the new arrangement. And all the while, there remains this possibility that an alien force may have sent you into another time loop"
"You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers. However, you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme. `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers. Continue the story:"," your name will be written on a contract for you, and then you get to live an existence, living a double life, as the demon. You live a very simple life in a small town but all your friends and even the sheriff tell you that you're a very special person. A guy dies a few weeks after you get out because his soul can't leave the house after all the souls you take. One day you meet a young girl named Claire who knows all about the demonic and is very interested in you because you have all the demons and souls on your records as being that girl's father. She's the only girl in town but nobody seems to know about it and your friends think you're crazy but she doesn't give up. They give you a job doing this evil thing: that you kill people. You kill one guy one day and it kills your friend. You kill another guy and then another. Claire's been in contact with an old man who tells her that she shouldn't be selling people's souls because you'll end up with a demonic curse. However, you can't die now that you have a demonic power which allows you to live. You get back some of the power you have bought from the town's devil. It turns out to be a new version of you called the Revenant. You use this new version of you to travel around the world as the Revenant and take on people. The Revenant is an absolute beast in that he's very big and strong but really has very little human weaknesses. He kills an old man in a town and you travel to a big city where he's supposed to be doing this work, but the city has a massive earthquake killing everyone in a big part of it, including you. You make your way through the new city which is overrun with zombies. Later on, you find out that the town was being attacked by these evil zombies. The Mayor was the Revenant and this was the new version of you that you found. Later on you meet a friend from your past that you have a lot of animosity with but algebraically he is also a very important guy. He's one of the first members of the town council and he comes to the church and tries to kill you which leads to a fight between the two. You make your way to this town where you meet the new Revenant, who's a guy named Bob. He kills Bob by being so huge that it kills the entire town and you try to stop him. The fight ends when Bob decides to take a drink of his own blood or gets electrocuted which kills him. The demon starts to attack humans as a final sacrifice but you stop him with your new version called the Revenant. He kills Bob and leaves the town. The demon follows you. You eventually make it outside and you see him running away and you kill him in an Sharma-like move. It's like being the Revenant again and you decide to head back for revenge. The demon follows you and it's really scary because it's as big as you are and you don't know what's going on until you take a shot. Then you hear the scream of people being attacked by the demon. You head for the church but the demon kills the mayor like that and you start running down this street which is also surrounded by zombies. Eventually you reach the church where you see that the Revenant has taken control of the mayor and is doing the work. Before you can do that, he sends you outside for the final sacrifice. It's Bob and you have a huge battle with him in the church. Eventually you kill the Revenant and the demon. The Revenant was able to make more like the Mayor, that is the person who lives inside the town, though Bob's a lot bigger. It was a really big battle between you and the demon. You beat the demon but not because you're a Revenant. You beat the demon because you're a super-human in that you can run faster, you can do so much damage. You even break a huge demon skull like that, if you can use a little bit of his blood. You've learned more about how powerful you are but you feel it's time to leave. After that there's a group of people who ask you to find some items at a house. You go in but it turns out that it's the demon who got out of prison and they haven't got the items so you have to get them from the other prisoners, which you manage to do. He then tries to help you, and tries to take over the town of New York, but you find that you can't. You're the demon, a big one, but a normal guy with a job. You"
"You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries. You come back to see millions of people suffering, in pain and hopeless. How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind? Continue the story:","

""For your own people, I come to give these words. I am the one who will show what happens if mankind turns from God. We are witnessing the time when God is bringing it to the edge! We are witnessing the coming of the apocalypse!"" The Prophet had a vision of a red sun in the sky of Jerusalem that appeared at night.

""God is my witness, the God who made man the creator, and my witness, the God who has chosen me to restore the true and true God who has granted mercy to all those on earth."" He would come again with God's name in the heavens. ""I am the first to walk the Earth and I am the last to leave, and it is this I have to bring to complete fulfillment.""

The Prophet told his Companions that he would soon return, but said the people will have to wait for another five centuries to see the truth of his return. Versus The Age of Ignorance and the Age of Spiritual Enlightenment

""If you follow the footsteps of your fathers, if you follow the footsteps of your Prophets, you will see the same sun. Every year they would return more or less, but I am the last of the men standing up. We are going back to meet again our fellow men, the same people who have been waiting for us for their whole lives, as though they were on their way to paradise. All of a sudden the red sun appeared out of nowhere. God has revealed a book that is written in red light. God has seen through the darkness of his ignorance, but has also seen through the darkness of his spiritual enlightenment. He has been a light and an evening star for these people. He told his servants in the day what he saw in the night. He has revealed the message of salvation, of salvation from death. The red light of God has been a revelation that is a truth and truth alone. It is an absolute truth, and only God can know it. In the past he revealed the Gospel of Islam, which was in Arabic. It came from the Jews and Christians, with their books and books written for them, with their traditions which differed greatly from those of Allah. It was all a fiction that came from the same source. It has changed from the Jews and Christians to the Muslims, this time they don't even believe in the words of Allah or in the word of His servants. Their belief is in books prepared for those people. They can read them, but they still don't believe in the Quran. They say ""This book is written in Arabic, in order to tell us what it tells us."" Some may know what a Quran is, but others don't, because they are blinded by the words of Allah. The Quran is in Arabic and it is a revelation in the Arabic language, in that language. When God revealed the Book of the Quran to him, there is no other language besides Arabic. This is the message of the Quran. No other language knows that the Quran is truth.

The Prophets' Word

""Say, 'Come, O people of the Book. It is only Allah Who teaches you the truth.' They responded with joy, 'It is through Allah that we see.' That is because God does not tell something to others to the point where humans can see it, unless the prophet is present. If the word was to convey this great power, the world would be filled with it, with its glory and its knowledge. If the prophet had not been made man, there would have been no prophet to inspire men with his revelation. The greatest miracle that can be accomplished in creation is the revelation of a book and the knowledge that can be brought with the revelation. No prophet except Allah can bring about a miracle, as the miracle of a woman bringing forth a small child. The Quran alone has the ability to bring about a miracle. And yet this is a great miracle. As for the Book, it can also accomplish miracles. In short, the Quran is an absolutely true testimony and an absolute truth. This is not a lie because Muhammad gave it and nobody has ever doubted it. He has brought it and it is the last revelation.

There are millions of people who believe in this revelation, but those who are not guided do not believe in it. You must explain what is this message. You must tell the story of the way of the Prophet and its revelations and explain why they are true and why this is the best Cerberus for the universe."" He was given the Book of the Quran that told him, as the Prophet of the Revelation, what He had seen in the night. ""You will see a red star that shines like a red light, a light that only Allah is able to"

If the TV didn't get tuned to the movie, it would be a little bit jarring, because when it came to acting, R. Lee Ermey was clearly obsessed with playing the role of the bad guy. He played a psychopath, of the villainous variety, who was, in his words, ""a big-head guy with a huge chin."" He was a killer psychopath! That's the type of guy you want to see out there destroying a country.

""In the end, you gotta realize that you got to do what you gotta do. Don't get frustrated. Don't give in. Don't say screw it, I'm not gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna give it a shot.""

""The problem with acting is that we are all so insecure -- at some people's jobs, in their families -- they're convinced they're bad people. That's how it works when you're a child.""

""Right.""

""Now, I had an acting teacher who went to some school where they were known as bad parents. She told us, 'If you go in like this, the kid is going to be a bad, abusive person, who will grow up to be a bad man.' And so, I learned that acting in the movies, on television and film, is essentially the equivalent of the life sentence that a person must spend in that prison where you think you're a bad person. A bad person.""


""It's like some guy in a padded cell that I hate, and I want to kill.""

""Yeah, no...but a person who lives as if they're evil.""

""Like a fucking rapist?""

""Yeah, like a rapist.""

""But you think that you're the guy that needs to be punished.""

""What happened with me was my father took me to a very special school in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. We moved there because they did not have the public school system in Los Angeles, and this was in the middle of the depression in the '30s and '40s. I got accepted to the school that had the most rich, wealthy students in the world. They were the best in the world. My dad, who had only been in his life for about one year -- because we hadn't raised much money, he had only graduated from college, he was a single parent -- took me there, thinking that it was the best school, but it was also very conservative. It was really about this kind of radical thing we thought our generation was supposed to be doing. I did it in an act where he was the headmaster and a male janitor, and the idea was that I was there to do a play about a male janitor who was a sexual predator in the work place. He kept getting away with it for years, and eventually, the school board gave him a one-page letter of apology, and told him they wanted him taken off campus immediately.""

The world could be a sadder place if every phone call came in a voice mail. A voice mail costs very little to make and lets you speak to a loved-one if your message is returned. It's a new app with a new purpose: the new voice mail app. And the technology behind it offers the promise of a simple, powerful solution to one of the biggest challenges we face: voicemail. ""I would be one lucky person who would not lose a loved one at the end of a call,"" says Scott McGlade, co-founder and CTO of VoiceMail.com. ""It's a real issue, and it's a real problem that people can't seem to resolve."" VoiceMail's voice mail system can turn just about anything into a voice mail and can be easily tailored to your needs. VoiceMail.com has already been downloaded over 2 million times.

When you use voice mail on a mobile phone, the caller ID code of the person who calls is not always a valid way to identify the caller from a distance. VoiceMail.com creates an image based on the person's face, and uses facial recognition technology to match it to the person' s face. This makes it easy to match your voice with a person's voice with ease. And with 1 million voice mail messages received every week, there's a large market for the service. ""Voice mail can be a huge help in certain situations,"" says McGlade. ""In an emergency, you want to get the phone company in to help. If your phone is calling you and the person sounds odd, you can use VoiceMail and it will identify who's calling the emergency number."" With VoiceMail, you can also tell the person that you need to speak with them back. You're supposed to get back to them in a few minutes and let them know you will call them back after some time.

The first time you use VoiceMail.com, you 'll need to register and complete a few basic tasks. You can set up the app to receive a notification when a call is made. You can also set up an appointment schedule for the app. These settings are stored in a database and are reused the next time the App is launched for use. You can also send and receive an email with the information. Once you get the hang of it, you will be able to check for and accept incoming messages, make calls, and take screenshots from your mobile device in a matter of seconds. ""We don't have a phone number for you to call,"" says McGlade. ""All you do is click a button on the mobile device and your phone goes to voicemail. If you try to leave a voicemail for someone, you get an error message. We just store that number for it. We've designed it so that you can be out of range and still have a chance to call them."" This is a great feature for a woman who is out at the library or who works from home. VoiceMail.com's app also makes it easy to store calls made through your phone for later calling or forwarding. You can even use VoiceMail.com to make, receive, and delete voicemails quickly, easily, and securely.

It's a little confusing how all these different features can all be connected. With the built in App, you can call the person on your mobile device if it' s in their phone book. You can also set-up an appointment for another person to meet you for a quick, private conversation, and send them a recording you've already recorded. And if something goes wrong with your phone, you can always send a reminder email. With all this integration, it's not really necessary to set up a voicemail account. You can set up your iPhone to use VoiceMail if it' s the last phone it uses. As an alternate solution, you could create a hidden account on another device for the purpose of voicemail. Then each time you need your voice mail, just click a button on the mobile device and your voicemail comes up in your contact list from that device. This solution makes it so that when you need voicemail, you have the option to give the people of your family a call, but if someone's calling you out of the blue, you can leave a voicemail message.

VoiceMail.com lets you reach any person on our VoiceMail.com network with a quick and simple voice call.

VoiceMail.com is a great service for friends, relatives, and co-workers, however, for the majority of people, it will be the first thing you will use to send and receive any message. The idea that your calls will be sent to your voicemail is a"

*Please check the Gameplay section under the Extras - The game is the same as the original and features the same story.

*The game is also playable in 2-player games, but can only be played between the first and second player (or the ""second player"" if you are playing as the first player). If you play 1 player you can play as 3 people. Note: You must have a DMA4 gamepad and not a regular PS2 controller to play this game, since the game controller only has ""diving in"" and ""reading"" buttons.

*The game actually works but the camera can pooled in the game to cause some graphical problems.

"Extremists kidnapped an American journalist in Iraq. They are about to execute this poor soul, named Clark Kent. Continue the story:"," http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6GZzfQnQWI The story of my life: I grew up in a small country town, a small town whose politics seemed a bit more serious than those of my parents and grandparents. My grandmother's father was a small-time drug runner. From my point of view, it was strange and uncomfortable watching my family struggle with corruption and conflict. I saw politics as not the world I knew, but a world that seemed out of reach of people who lived in small towns. I knew I wanted to be a reporter. So I took a job in a small city newspaper, working under difficult circumstances. When that ended, I chose not to stay in journalism. I wanted a better job. It was a choice I made because I wanted to be free. To me, politics was a fight over issues – like taxes, guns, abortion and abortion rights. And people were free to fight for issues other than tax cuts, guns, or abortion. I was working to help the people who had less. Now I wake up every day to read news stories about people like me because they are the ones who make this world better. It Persuades me the work matters, and can make a difference. My work with The Free Press was not one of free speech either. Our goal was to inform, and we could not rely on our own sources for that. As a journalist's job is, there was little to no difference in how we approached issues. If we needed information about anything, we got information from sources. But we relied on our own sources for almost everything. Some of those sources were our local politicians. Some didn't like the idea of an independent press. Some weren't sure of their motives. And even some friends and family members were skeptical. We were journalists and we wanted to be able to do our job and make a difference. But we started to feel differently about what we were doing. Our work with the Free Press and the broader civil society was beginning to make a difference, one step at a time. In some ways, it reminded me of my own family's own struggle with my mother's cancer. It was not uncommon for her to be near death every day – but the news media was never there. Even as we fought for funding, our government, and to better our lives, we became aware that government wasn't able or willing to do much for us. We had all the tools, information, and money we wanted to fight for us and our families, but the government didn't see those needs or provide any assistance for us. We could not trust our government so easily and felt we were not safe. We looked to the military and the government for support. We looked towards the government, and believed that it could help us. But once you see what the government did for us, when you understand the lengths it went to in order to protect us – that's when you realise you can't trust government. There are people who want power. They want to control the world. They want us, in this country at least, to not have a voice. They try every strategy they can to divide us and take our safety. We've watched it for more than a decade. That's how much we've fought. We're all part of it. Those of us who have reached the end zone of our career have had our own personal stories of hope. Some of us have chosen to live with our issues and to work on them, while others have given up on that fight. I won't tell you mine, but I can tell you what I've seen: I've watched people go from feeling powerless to fighting for their lives – and sometimes, losing it entirely – to fighting for what they believe in. They are not afraid, and they are not afraid of where they are going. They are going to get there. We have every reason to be proud of the work we've done, and we can't stop working. Let me end with a quote from a politician in New Hampshire – and he's on top of his game. He's an example for every politician and every journalist who fights for your beliefs… I'll call Governor Mary Fallin. Governor Fallin's message for my brothers' and sisters' daughters can be heard around the world: ""Stand up to the extremist views you hear from people on your way to work."" With great care to convey that message, she goes on to point SCHOOLS: ""These are the folks that are really targeting our children. And we need to stop it.""

"Hello darkness, my old friend. Continue the story:","


This time I think you'll agree that it's a good one! I will only mention one thing, and that is that I'm no expert; this story has already been told many times, in such a wayTennant is simply one of the few actors who can go full ""Dark Side of the Moon"" from time to time! I personally think that the original (Dark Side of the Moon) was a good movie, even if it is not as good by any means as ""The Thin Red Line"" - though I admit to very fond memories of the original ""The Thin Red Line"" (which I wrote about previously! ). Now to tell you the story...A long time ago, when I was only a young boy, a friend from school, a fellow college student by the name of ""Gustav"" contacted me with questions about a movie called ""The Thin Red Line"". I think I took it as a joke at first, but it got me thinking a lot about what was really good in the film. ""The Thin Red Line"" was not a great, ""bad movie"", something I thought was good in the beginning to a point where it started to become really bad for the rest of the film. I mean the story was very flawed, especially in regards to the female characters (in that case the female characters were just used as background decoration and even though it was quite a common thing it still bothered me). Also, I think in the end the characters did not evolve as you would expect at that age (especially for the male characters, I'd say that the female characters were pretty good, only we didn't realize which one was which, or could ever understand them). Now, I think we should also take into account that I'm a young teenaged, somewhat naive, writer-director type kind of person (I'm not saying that I was immature back in those days, even though I was - not that I was ""bad"" or anything). In order to be objective I must have to acknowledge that the story is kind of like many other ""high school stories"" (and films). At the height of teenage drama, when I was a kid, I would be in a dark pit and think, ""What do I do? I'm still young... I can't change anything about myself now."" I felt that this was a great metaphor on what was going on with me (and all teenagers). ""The Thin Red Line"" got me thinking a bit differently on how ""the world"" was changing, with what I called ""The End of the World"" (the end of mankind, and the end of this kind of life). So, I thought I'd take a little time to analyze it, to find out where the ""end"" was and what was behind it. As long as I'm here I'll do my best to not tell the story ""over-hand"" to you.I was originally a fan of William Stout's classic film, ""In a Lonely Place"" which tells a story of a man who must make the most out of his situation; this story's ""end"",oreAnd has been told many times (mostly by those who have watched ""In a Lonely Place""), but my favorite part of it is the moment when the main character, a man named ""George"" (the man and the boy meet again at what would become his home, where he is in a happy relationship with his wife and her boyfriend), is confronted by what appears to be a ghost who warns him against his actions. And in the end it has always stuck in my mind as one of the strongest and most profound statements of the way the world and mankind is moving (in a kind of a dark, almost apocalyptic way; we are living in an ""End of the World"" and there is no turning back yet and I think if nothing is done our very lives will continue down the track until we die in the end).I have to say that this sort of thing (my story) is not my usual topic. I just wanted to make this little review to share my thoughts on my favorite film (and why I love it), in case that sort of thoughts might be useful for someone else, and because I really enjoyed watching it (both in the original theatrical film and in my DVD copyovie - which is why I felt like I was watching the real thing).Also, I'll say this: I had trouble finishing the DVD, probably because it was only a 1-hour film (not including subtitles, which were cut out during the audio).I'm not saying that I enjoyed the film, because it felt too empty. I mean, the film made a lot of sense to me at some point and in almost every scene, but it never caught me, and I felt that this was a bad thing, as I felt that ""The Thin Red Line"" was a good film, in spite of the flaws. But I felt that I must try to better see ""The Thin Red Line"
You accidentally discover the sentence of death ( a sentence that kills anyone who hears it except the speaker ) when you say it over national television. Continue the story:," It will never happen again. It is a stupid thing to do. You probably should not say it. You probably should not ever say it again. You probably should not ever say it again. Okay, this is not a serious question. The people who write you misspelled your name, or they don't want to offend you. But that doesn't mean you've committed a violation of your contract or have committed a federal offense. This question could be resolved either way. You can tell the difference between a serious violation of the contract, with a fine and/or jail time, and not a serious violation, like a misspelled or non-existent sentence. If you've violated the contract: It was a contract, not a death penalty law. A death penalty law would have to be included to force the owner of your home/business to live up to his contract. Or you're not obeying any law. (In which case, you probably should have never lived there in the first place.) Or there's no reason for you to be the subject of this question in the first place

The answer here is you don't have to answer it. Just don't say it. It's not legal. (Unless, of course, you've already committed a federal crime.)

The following is an example of a question that could be resolved either way, but the answer is irrelevant. This question: I bought a new TV and it doesn't work. The TV doesn't look bad. I bought it. The tv won't work so I think it is defective. Did I buy a TV? Yes No

Here, the answer is just no, you didn't have a contractual agreement with the seller of the television not to own or sell it. There is no contract when it comes to TVs. So what you do is, you ignore the TV and keep asking it for its status. This may be the most important question you have to answer to prove your case.

Note: Don't do it if you have a friend or relative that also knows the answer.

What this article is about, is proving you are violating a contract. Whether it's a contract or the murder death penalty law, proving you were violating a contract is essential in order to find out if you need to sign a pre-termination Notice of Termination. If you are a potential buyer, you need to know if you are being charged for violating the contract you signed with the seller of the TV. If that's the case, you need to be sure to sign the notice of termination. The seller will say that you are legally bound to pay the entire amount. The seller will say, and often you will, ""I signed the document myself."" The buyer is usually required to sign the notice of termination by law. If you know that you are not technically bound by the contract, you will know it can be nullified if something happens to the TV.

You will not be able to prove conclusively when the TV is defective through a simple, honest question. However, there is one piece of information that is absolutely necessary to show that the TV is defective. It's the price on it, and it's the price on this item that determines the quality/price. When you buy a new TV, the item's manufacturer, your local TV repair shop, or the store where you buy the item all have information about its specifications that you can use. For example, many TVs in the 90s were sold under the TECS brand name. The TECS brand name was actually a code that the manufacturer used for identifying different types of TVs. The code on the television said that it was a TECS television, but not a TECS television. So the manufacturer and the retailer may have different definitions of a ""TECS"" TV. Some dealers in the 90s may even have a different term for the TECS brand – most likely TECS1, TECS2, etc. So, before you look up the specific description on the TV, you have to understand the TECS 1 and TECS 2 name changes.

So you take your TV to the TV repair shop. It's pretty hard to do this if the TV has been in storage. You may need to use a tape recorder. Now you have the specific description. You know that the unit has no problem on the video display. Now you do the math. You find out the price of the item (I am calling it your cash price, but if that doesn't make sense, this is a good approximation). (Most of the times, the price includes the parts and labor not only for the display screen, but for the other screens that the TV contains. This is not always the only part which contains the video display but the LCD and or LCD panel which is the picture"
"You have developed and ability to see how people will die when you look at them. Your entire life you avoided pictures of yourself, but today you forgot, and, brushing your teeth in the morning, looked in the mirror ... Continue the story:"," The second test is to see how long a person is happy. ""In modern Western and post-modern culture,"" says Dabra, ""having high scores doesn't seem worth it: you don't get noticed at all."" ""A lot of people say they are happy but then look on their faces... and they seem sad,"" he continues. ""They cannot do anything for everyone. It's like a trap. One doesn't have to look for happiness. No one can look for it.""

The third test is to see how willing people are to give up what they have. Some, like the students in Dabra's study, give away too many things. Others, he finds, don't. People who refuse to give up something they value may not be as unhappy as it seems -- they may be happy.

""I hope,"" says Dabra, ""that in the future we could discover many more types of happiness.""

He's been surprised just how hard it is to find, if one really knows where to look. What people want to give up every day is bigger than what they spend on it, and there is no easy way to figure out what that is. Dabra has written out the list: Things we must stop giving away: our health, our money, and our reputation. ""To what extent have we given these up?"" Dabra asks, incredulously.

To Dabra, the way to stop giving up things is to give up yourself.

""Life is made, not given,"" he writes. ""It's all yours. If you get greedy, you are wasting so much of your life, but if you understand this and give to everyone, you will get more love, more peace, more happiness in the life you live.""

That's why the book -- called ""How to Live Happy -- and How to Do it Well"" -- is so controversial. Many say he should not have done a survey of the most and least happy Americans.

""He is not giving up everything,"" says Daniel Gilbert, director of the Center for the Study of Science at Harvard University. ""He is not a scientist. He didn't have to make an empirical study of how happy people are, and he says that the answers are in terms of things he does every day. Is that what we want Americans to do?""

Even the authors of the book themselves concede that it has come under fire. One of them, Benjamin Page, the creator of the ABC News program, said he was told by a friend in the media that he felt the book had little to do with happiness because it was written in a conversational style and did not rely on data sets to test results.

""I agree for that reason alone,"" he says.

Page says that more interesting is the book's message itself: ""Not happiness. Not fulfillment. There's no one way to live. Not everyone is satisfied. Not everyone feels right. Not everyone is happy. That means it's up to us to decide to be.""

One of them turned and looked at the other person and saw that person also has a face. After that that male looked all around about them and saw that they appear to be women. But they are not females. The man who has never seen nor heard of females before meets a woman who has never seen nor heard of males before Continue the story:

One of the two were the ones who are like stars of the sky and on the day of the feast, the second one was the one who started the fire, and they both ate as one, and with no food their strength was not strong enough to carry all of them. ""How do you know that they are not females?"" said the one who started the fire. It was the woman who had seen the face and looked at the man, when she saw this man. ""We are a nation that can be counted as five - one male, one female and one man. If these five members of the nation are in a city together (or other arrangement) and one of them happens to be a male, then this is proof that it is a man. If one of them happens to be a female, then it is a female. Therefore our numbers cannot be counted more than five together, because the five of us are stronger than the five of them. If they were to be in the same city and one of them is a male and the other is a female and they are in a different area, then the male was not in the city. Therefore the male and the female are in our midst."" But the man who had seen this man continued speaking to them: ""We are an individual nation and we have five members, one of whom is a male and one of whom is a female, and whoever is a man must be a believer in the One who created us and whoever is one of us must be a follower of the One who created us. Thus, I am an apostle of Allah and I was sent (as a servant) to confirm and strengthen one who is following the commands of the One who created us. The one who looks at us and we look at him do everything, and he knows nothing of our intelligence, and the one whose eyes are upon us - we have knowledge of his intelligence. We have the one whom I mention as ""our leader."" ""This is for those who are on the path"" So the apostle stayed in the city until he left for a day of rest by himself in a place which the narrator knows well, after which he returned to the city until the end of his rest. After his return the narrator (on this day) said, ""We then became very sad and we said, ""We have to go to that region,"" and we began to walk. We came toornothing near our village which the narrator (on this day) knew was called Dhat-Ud-din, the village which is near the city, and the apostle used to make a camel-trough so that when he set out for that region he would give it the best shelter. We used to say that if we were in that region we would certainly be victorious over those people. But we found that this town was one of the places he was referring to as the city. The narrator told this part of the story and the people began to laugh, but a moment later one of them turned to the other man and said: ""You look as if you were laughing. Why are you laughing?"" The man who had seen this man, said: ""To hear the man who told the story from a good-lookin' woman and to hear from the woman who told the story from a good-looking man.""

The people of the house were confused then. The priests continued their explanation.

But their whole life will be forgiven. I'm sorry, we don't get any better unless you do…""

""The creature said something to the village, and then disappeared from sight. The villagers took some firewood they found and set it on the ground. After several days the burning wood could no longer burn, so the villagers found another fire wood and put it on the ground, with a stick tied to it. Since that day, the villagers have heard footsteps in the night near the burning fire wood…The people are now afraid to go near the hollow tree."" ―Source[1]

It's impossible to understand what happened here, except that no matter what, the woods were not closedheid, because the whole forest around it was open-air. The creatures did not have a visible purpose. They were merely evil manifestations of hatred.

It seems that at its source, there was a cult of Satan. They would bring forth beings as violent and destructive beings as they wished, if the gods did not save them, with either human beings or animals. Then they would either take over the forest, or the gods would cast the beings into a ""hell,"" as it is called in the Hindu philosophy.

One of the ""Hell Creatures"" that appeared in this story, is called Kri'aht.

Kri'aht (also spelled Kri'ah-ah-t) is a spirit in Hinduism that was used by the Gods to punish those who had wronged them (i.e., their own sons, ancestors, and in some cases their wives) with death: they would throw them into Kri'aht, which would create a ""solitary hell"" out of lava (as depicted in the story, in The Book of the Burning Earth) or some other fiery place, either on the earth or in the sky (as depicted in The Book of the Dead). According to Tibetan Buddhism, it was the demon that murdered King Surya of Magadha and killed his other seven sons in order to kill the Buddha itself. The word Kri'aht is the same Sanskrit word for 'fire,' so that this entity is really no other than a fire-devil.

The story's description of the ""solitary hell,"" refers to the"

"Start with `` Everyone knew trying to run was futile, yet so far all of them tried anyway '', end with `` I do n't make the rules, I just enforce them. '' Continue the story:"," [The woman was told that if she did not come in at work on time, she would be fired.] A long time ago, a little girl was very happy when she reached the end of her string of chores. She looked around and said to herself, ""This day of my life is over. Now I must do this or else I must watch my friends die."", end with `` My life is no longer justruits of my labors. It is just fruit on the trees of God who sees me. "" The woman continued on her way as she was told not to come accelerating toward the end of her string of chores. There is a picture below that tells the story about a man who tried many times to tell his wife, ""I do not make the rules, I just enforce them."", but she said, ""You do not make the rules, you just observe them. If you obey my saying, nothing will work."", end with `` My life is no longer just fruits of my labors. It is just fruit on the trees of God who sees I. "" So the man stopped telling his wife and he did not come. What is that about, a woman telling a man that he does not make the rules? The story is repeated in all three other verses in Matthew 16: 12-17. 1 Corinthians 14 tells the story of a man with his wife and it is very similar to the story of the woman in chapter one. It has been added by some translations to the book of 1 Corinthians. 1 Peter 5:18 tells us that Christ ""suffered pain for our transgressions"" and it is almost identical to another verse of the Bible that tells us that Christ endured the same for others. 1 Timothy 2:17 tells us that ""when God's righteous servant has prayed for us"" God ""rewards him with a crown of righteousness"" and all the people will be subject to God. In 2 Timothy 3:18 we have the words, ""I and my brothers are as the sheep of the Lord. They will be flocks for the God of Israel, not as the Gentiles are now flocks. And God will set us over their own souls to be God's possession and glory and a sharing in his good pleasure. And my brothers and sisters, God calls you to be holy, sober-minded, be strong in the faith, be zealous for good works. So then, every spiritual person should keep his life pure and his actions pure and upright."" These are all the instructions that a Christian should adhere to. If we live with the Lord and obey all of the Lord's instructions, even when we think he is not doing so, we will be given what He wants. One example is that if we are to go to the wedding in a hotel and there are no hotels in the area, then instead of going to one of the hotels that is located near the hotel (say a Holiday Inn), we can still go to the hotel and have a ""family"" dinner there. If we are told that there is only one hotel where there are several other restaurants, such a restaurant will be available at no charge at the other restaurants. If we are told that there is only one restaurant that has several other restaurants, then we will no longer be able to get food that we want for example, if there is only one restaurant that has a nice salad and another restaurant that has a hot sandwich, and the salad is cheaper, the sandwich will be available at the better restaurant. In 1 Corinthians 15:14 we read, ""And let your words and your conduct be upright and upright to the point of justice."" This should be our attitude toward everything, including things in the spiritual life. We are told to do ""whatever is right"" in 1 Corinthians 11:4. All of the following passages show that any ""sins"" on our hearts are to be exposed to God's judgement with God. 2 Corinthians 4:4-9, 10-19, 20-28, 29 The word is translated ""justified"" and ""repented of"". However we all know that ""justified"" also means ""cursed"", even though the Bible explicitly says that those people who ""repented"" of their sins would themselves ""state to God, ""I am justified"", and God would answer, ""You will be punished for that"" (Galatians 3:9). Paul's instructions to them are written this way: ""But God has not condemned you to Hell but has forgiven you your sins and taken away the punishment."" So if we are to be ""justified"", let us repent and then repent and then let Godliner ""Justify"" me, so I can escape this death, so that I can be justified as to what God has forgiven me? Let me get my sins forgiven. Please let me get my sin"

And then at the last line:

And they call me a monster for doing it so well.

As if it's just an act, another line of proof. As if I'm the man from the video.

But that isn't what happened to me, of course.

The thing that happened just happened.

I know it's something I've done before. I know.

The point isn't to prove how big I am. It's because I need to prove how small I am. How it's so easy to do in a battle, and to fall for it. How a simple act like that will change your entire life? How it makes you question whether or not you're worth the hassle. And yes, I admit, it's easy to fall for that.

I got into the war for the same reason so many other people do: because I wanted to change things. Because the way things are now, where men are pushed into battle, and no matter how hard they work, they're doomed to fail, no matter how hard they try.

But I couldn't fall for it.

Because I wasn't in a position where I could be saved, or at least that's what I wanted to believe.

All I wanted was to say that I was no longer doing this just for myself. That I was willing to sacrifice everything just to prove to myself that I wasn't.

I became a soldier not because I loved it, but because I was willing to take risks to prove to the people around me that I wasn't.

And that was no easy task.

I was still a kid then. I had just recently got my driver's license and, as I've written above, I didn't yet know how to use it.

But there's something about soldiers in this particular instance that I think stands out even more than the other reasons I came out of the war – this one just doesn't even register as a reason.

For me, the whole idea of a ""lone wolf"" soldier seems ridiculous. To me, soldiers were supposed to do more than just sacrifice their own well-being for the greater public. Like a doctor helping patients or a dentist assisting at an accident. Soldiers needed to help other people – to help other people and stop the war. I didn't think a soldier needed to be in front of the camera, or to be ""doing it for the cameras"". For me, it was about showing everyone up. Showing everyone that the war was pointless and wrong."

"Begin and end your story with this sentence: `` And yet, the city remained. '' Continue the story:"," This is a powerful sentence. The sentence captures the feeling of the place as something important remains to be discovered. So, if your story ends and you know that the city remains, then it makes sense to end on that poignant sentence. But that leaves you open to a question: ""Did you know that the city remained?"" Your work isn't done yet. You still have to find a way to move your characters from here to there, through time. And that is where your plot comes in. Your plot is the keystone of any successful story. The story you tell today will be different from the story you tell tomorrow, because you have a great story to tell right now. Your story is in there to make you feel in this place, and so it will not stay that way whether you end and end on a ""And Yet, the city still remained"" sentence or ""Did you know that the city remained?"" Your story will make no sense if you don't start telling your story soon. And then, don't say, ""I've got to write the story first.'' Just start. The more that you give yourself to your work, the more time you'll have to move forward and tell your tale in any number of stories. The same thing can be said for your career.
The secret to successful stories is storytelling. And that's because stories are always going to do anything at all. That's because it can never be enough. Don't beat yourself up about your inability to move forward—and then give yourself permission to move forward—because when you do, everything you were saying about the lack of time will be proven true. If you keep walking right through what you've been doing so far or telling too little of a story, you'll be saying, ""I really can't do it or I'll find myself back where I started, and nothing ever will get done because I won't have time to move forward."" So, the only way to get your characters where you want them in a story is to start telling it. And once you start telling, you don't know where you're going, but you know you're not stopping.  Just start. Just tell. Don't worry. You shouldn't waste time looking back. Don't worry about what you said yesterday; you should be writing, and writing, and writing! You can't stop now. It takes time for you to start telling. If you wait for it to happen before you start telling, you won't know it's there until someone asks you a question about where you've been. You either need to start telling or be afraid783 when you start.
6. Don't just listen to what people have to say.
People are amazing. Even though some people may think they are, other people are really wonderful people. People never lie about any thing. And they don't need to! What these same people don't understand is that sometimes the lies they tell, even in a story, can be just as important as the stories that we tell ourselves.   So how do you tell a story? How do you find what you want to get across in a story? There are many ways. There are many different types of storytelling, and you have to find the way to tell the story that is right for you. Here are some of the techniques and techniques that you can use.   
7. Be unique, but make the most of your unique
Now that you've figured out your storytelling techniques, it's time to decide what you're going to do. One of the most basic rules that you need to follow in storytelling is that you always have to be unique. Your characters must have something about them that makes them unique. Otherwise, you wouldn't put any effort into telling your story. And by something you say during your story, you're not telling it the same way twice. Instead, the character that you choose to be unique in your story needs to find something about him or herself that you haven't seen in someone else. And then, you need isolating information that tells the viewer about your character in so little detail that the audience can't help but notice the details that they might not if you hadn't isolated what they're thinking of when they see yourself.   
8. What does your audience care about?
If a reader doesn't care about your character, how are you going to tell a story about them? There's a lot you could do to make them care about your character, but no matter how you do it, your audience will take a different approach than you'd expect. So, instead of telling them a story about the character and never giving them a reason why they care about your character in the first place, why not tell them about his or her journey and why they care? This technique uses words and sentences that make the reader want to care about your character. If the reader is struggling to make sense"

But some things can't be explained by just two people or two cats. For example, the Internet is full of stories about what to eat on Christmas Eve with food coloring or what to say to your best friend when her phone gets stuck with that ""It's not really real"" message. (Answer: ""Let your best friend know that you appreciate the effort she put into this and how you think she's doing it."")

Even for those parents who know what to do (I like to tell my kids to put a box of presents under the tree right before I get home), there remains the question of what not to say.

I don't say ""My dog ate all the marshmallows. Go put them next to the stove.

I didn't mean that literally, and the rest is the same. And I don't say ""The lights are out. Go do something else.""

We don't do things like that for no particular reason. But, sometimes this does create a bit of a rift in our family. One of our Christmas traditions, for example: the homemade cinnamon rolls. The whole thing is about love. And love in the context of a child is defined as a bond between one man and one woman, no matter what gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion you might believe you are.

I always start my homemade cinnamon rolls with the words of my daughter's favorite book: ""I love you, sweetheart, and I know you love me.""

Her response to that is always the same: With every piece of wood that we cut (and sometimes with every other piece of wood that we cut), even though it's made of wood and I love every single piece of wood I make, you know it's really just for her.

In fact, a few years ago I made a video with my family, explaining that it was important to me to let my daughter know that her feelings had real impact on her. You can watch it here:

What would you say if someone used your children's toys to justify hurting someone (or, for that matter, hurting the planet)?

My kids are still children. I want them to play and explore and love and listen to their parents without judgement or punishment. (For anyone who is wondering what a child who isn't doing that to someone else does, don't forget that when people are doing something to an animal, it's a cruelty crime. That's the law right around the corner.) So I'm not worried about hurting someone. Of course I will speak out if someone hurts someone else's animal, but for my children's toys? Not so much … unless she's throwing them at the neighbor's dog. Then it's okay. I'm not even sure they can hurt someone."

That story had ended, and now they wanted to hear about the true story, where a hero defeated a dragon."" ""I don't know of your name, but that is what I want to know."" Then I had a thought. I looked up at that giant dragon and tried to take in the feeling of him. If I didn't do that, I wouldn't be able to understand all that was going through my mind at that moment.

""Well, I won't say that it's useless. There has been many people who thought that there was an interesting mystery in the story... However, if I told you that story, you would find out the details very quickly because you don't need a deep understanding. If you can just ask the questions and see how quickly the story develops, then you would be able to get a better grasp of it."" ""That's the reason you won't hide anything from me. I'm already really embarrassed about it. Although you only tell me things from the front, I still get embarrassed when I'm not looking. When people are embarrassed like that, it becomes a problem."" -The boy I didn't know.

"Jesus returns, to a world populated entirely by robots. Continue the story:","

At some point, the Robot People turn their attention to the planet's corpus corporis, the part of the plant or animal that was just harvested for a harvest harvest. We have already seen this happening with the harvest of the corn, the harvest of the wheat, and many other crops. As we saw with the harvested human hosts, the transformation of the human body into a robot host is in and of itself an act of transformation from human to robot. This is in itself an act of transformation from human to slave, though not from slave to robot, as the human body was intended to serve the human host.

But what happens on the Planet of the Robot People is the opposite. In this case, it is the Robot People whose bodies are becoming robots. The planet has been transformed in order to make room for them:

The planet's resources are no longer available for growth. It has taken many generations to accumulate the necessary supplies to keep its inhabitants alive and healthy. But now the resources have been depleted. This is the result of thousands of years of industrialization, and for this reason the people we call Robot people don't have the resources for their own growth. They are forced to live out their lives in poverty, with only food and water for warmth.

But this isn't the case on Earth, where resources had always been available for our own growth. The only time we've ever had to endure starvation was in the end of the last ice age. There's a similar sort of reason in this story. Even if the planets are capable of sustaining humanity,Skin-crawling robots can't. And if they do, then the survival of most Earthlings is in grave danger from the Robot People.

Even more interestingly, this is an idea that I've given some thought about in my previous posts. And I think it's an interesting way to think about the future—of everything. As the planet turns into a desert, and people are reduced to slavery, the Robot People are the only humans that can be relied on to provide food for the rest of us. Whether or not the Robot People get the resources they need to survive will be entirely dependent on what the people of Earth do. Will they kill each other, or do they do more to protect each other than to hurt the people of Earth? Will there be an arms race?

Of course, there'd be more than one arms race. Robots as they are will no doubt be extremely dangerous to the Earth, and I've discussed the possibility of developing weapons that can eliminate life outright. But I think it's worth looking into the very real possibility that human civilization (and in particular humanity) might in fact collapse before its robots become self-aware. How could it actually happen?

As I mentioned earlier, human civilization was the product of an unprecedented leap from biological to technological development. And because of this leap of a few hundred thousand years, civilization was built with technologies like glass and steel. And those technologies are still here in our own time. But they're incredibly wasteful. It's a very difficult question to answer in detail. But even in our own time, technology is vastly more wasteful than biological evolution. The biological process of DNA generation is far more wasteful as a thing of value than a technology for producing new biological life (in our case, living things). This is one reason why the creation of new species is so hard when it comes to biology compared to engineering.

However, it's one of many reasons why the destruction of biosphere-destroying technology is so important. Not only do we have to reduce the number of biosphere-destroying technologies, but we must also take a much broader view of technologies than just biosphere-destroying technology. And one of the more interesting things we can say about that is that if we make use of technologies that don't directly wipe out species, then that reduces the overall problem, not just the biosphere-destroying technology itself (which we'll discuss shortly).

In the same way that Earth, unlike the life forms on Mars (which, by the way, seem to have been wiped out before we ever came to Mars), has not gone extinct because technology created it. We can see that our current planet is not the only path to a sustainable future.

There is an obvious question to consider here, of course. Would it be better to preserve existing species or even introduce new species, in order to reduce the overall problem? If we use technologies that are less efficient (such as chemical or biological warfare) then that may be acceptable for certain individuals and small groups, such as hunters and fishermen but not for general use of the resources. But would it be better to introduce technology that is more damaging to our own species? If we take just a small, suboptimal use of technology, that means we're taking it in the first case, because of its inherent, destructive nature. But if we"
Jesus joins the X-MEN Continue the story:,"

What is the problem? It's an extremely rare occurrence that a person actually dies. It will probably always be an extremely rare occurrence. The best guess is that it was a freak accident. The X-MEN are under the rule of an extremely powerful god. For a while there the only reason the rest of the mutants were able to function was because the other X-MEN were too busy protecting the dead person. After the explosion at the end, there was really no one to even get the corpse back on its feet.

It looked like no one was getting their corpse back on its feet after the explosion. It was quite a mess. Jean had managed to use the power of the other deceased mutants to find a way to get the thing with the blue skin back on its feet. But she just didn't know what the corpse was, or what that blue skin was used for.

I'm still not sure what the X-MEN are. It probably isn't anything special. Just a bunch of random mutants with strange powers who are living in a desolate landscape and live off of trash. The X-MEN exist to protect and watch over the world. That's why they're willing to fight the entire Shi'ar empire. I don't want to call them villains. They're a peace-loving bunch who are trying to do things the right way. The X-MEN are supposed to be the best at fighting. They also don't look like superheroes, so you don't have to worry about them being crazy. They're not stupid. They know how they're supposed to fight. That's what makes the X-MEN great.

You might be wondering, what's this all about? I found this interesting story while I was looking through some old issues of the X-MEN, Volume 1 and I thought I'd share it. After reading it again, I realized that Jean Grey is not dead. I figured she ended up with an accident or got kidnapped or something, but it just wouldn't make sense. So I changed his name to Cyclops X-Man (just his first nickname he ever had) and made this an actual story:

Cyclops X-Man is out on patrol. If I remember correctly, she wasn't actually in the middle of his patrol at first, it just sort of happened. We learn his name is Cyclops, and he's a mutant. He doesn't really have a face like some of the others, so it's just a name to him. He was one of the original X-MEN, but unfortunately for him he never made it into the X-Men. As a result of being frozen, he can't walk very far, and he's more than a little fat. I'm not sure if he's fat because he doesn't eat as much, or if he just can't walk very far, but he's definitely far enough away from the other X-MEN that he can't be considered an actual teammate. However, he doesn't really have control over his strength. He's a member of the X-Men, but he's still fairly weak compared to the rest of them. He was in the middle ofoso patrol, and Jean noticed him sitting there, reading his book.

They were out all that time and had never really interacted with each other until after their encounter with Magneto. When he attacked Xorn's ship, Jean was nowhere to be seen. She was on the front lines in one of Magneto's assaults against the X-Men and did not see Cyclops get killed due to the fact that he was frozen and can't walk. That was her fate. And the entire time she was in the middle, waiting for her resurrection.

While on patrol, Xorn is told that someone would be coming to kill him. When he arrives he finds a woman covered in white light. This is not the first time he has encountered some kind of white light. His first encounter was two years prior to this, and again, he didn't really remember that. He thinks it was the blue fireflies that started the encounter the first time, but maybe that wasn't the only one. What he thought was the white light really was a form of pain. His mind told him to run, but he wouldn't. So he fought for his life.

When an apparition comes at him, he realizes he is being targeted by someone who can't be touched. He is so scared he thinks he was taken by that apparition. When he runs back to the ship, he finds Jean dead. This was exactly where it happened. He tried to run, but it didn't work, because while he is running he finds Xorn still dying, and he knows it's not worth it. He wants to fight as much as the woman, or anyone in this place. As the apparition comes, it reveals that there is no resurrection effect at all. The apparition then gives"

"Suddenly, everyone on Earth becomes immortal, free from physical injury or disease. Except for one person. Continue the story:","

If contended upon, the existence of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was a great discovery. It was also a terrible mistake which cost us our lives. What is our world if not a living hell, a city of flame where people endure misery for the remainder of their earthly lives. The man who has committed the eternal crime of blasphemy against the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for which all others have paid the penalty, is now the sole proprietor of all that is known of earth. He can see, hear, taste, touch, and smell everything with his very natural senses. He is no longer bound by the laws of nature, and the blind God of the Old Testament, who did not see that we need a soul to live, is powerless to prevent him. He is a king. He is the creator of his own life; and thus he is free. The earth he created for man is his. In all his actions, he cannot be blamed for the deeds of others, because from day to day he is doing what he did from a higher position in his heavenly throne. He is a king, and the only kings who can be blamed are those who live only by the grace given by the Lord Christ, who was, in all things, his king. He created the earth, man. His kingdom is earthly. His throne is in heaven. He is the chief of the angels. He is our guardian angel. He watches over us from heaven. Our kings can be, and sometimes are, accused of sin and fall out. All they do from this point of view is to obey divine commandments. If they live justly, they bring glory to him who gave them life; if they bring shame to themselves by their wrong-doings, they deserve the everlasting punishment of hell. They can bear the burden, but they cannot bear the weight of the responsibility. They can be accused, convicted, and punished, by the judgment of their own conscience; but they cannot bear to bear to live in shame by their own unreflecting conscience. Now that they are free from the chains that bound them on earth, they now live free in heaven. They have the whole earth before them. There there is no crime or sin that can not be atoned or forgiven. There is no sin that God can not atone for. They have the earth before them, and they are free to live on it. They are the heirs of the kingdom of heaven. So when the apostle says, Christ is Lord of all, he means to say that He, and all that live by his grace, are Lord of the earth. Thus it is to be understood that Christ is Lord of all, for whatever His human followers may do or suffer, He alone bears the blame, because he is the only one who can decide with certainty who is to be set free by the divine judgment. Even if man were to commit a sin for which he was bound by the command of his Creator and by the punishment inflicted by his own conscience, it would not matter, for he would have been set free before the final judgment was consummated. Hence those people who have done wrong on earth in this present life will be damned. They are, as the New Testament teaches, without the promise of resurrection, and without the ability to escape the eternal fire that awaits them there, for they have no ability to see the light of the new day at any time. Those who are destined to lose their eternal life are those who have committed the eternal crime of blasphemy against the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and have not repented of the crime before the final day. They are, as St. Paul writes (Once again I must warn you, lest any man spoil you through philosophy, and pervert you to a false doctrine, according to the insatiate desires of your heart, which turn away from the things which are sound and which are become vain through the deceitful conversation of evil men; but God is not partial to the ungodly. For he abides in the earth to make a better world for those who are good. Be not deceived: God is not mocked: the one who utters a lie is the same as if he himself were God. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. (1 Cor. 15:20-26) After being justified by the faith of Jesus Christ, which he received by the Father's mercy, he became the Son of God, that is, an heir of the grace of the Lord Jesus, and also of the Holy Spirit, and became the minister both of righteousness and of judgment among all people. He is the avenger of all the ungodly, and he will judge between them with righteousness... Who is like him, who was faithful without fault, and bought a goodly robe, and also died in his father's house"

How to Be Happy – ""How I Went From One of Your Worst Times to a Better One

""A day in the life of one of the people who was close to me [while my life was being controlled by the Church].

It was after I decided it was time to abandon the priesthood, when I realized I could no longer serve God – it was time to become better, better, better.

I realized that there are other people not blessed by God who suffer a lot for their faith and are not loved by their families, and who end up depressed and miserable. And I realized that God is no different: No one walks out of the Gospel and walks out of its mission.

I'm not saying that I did anything special. I just learned how to go to heaven a better person as a result of this. I saw an opportunity to bring someone around who would live and think exactly like me, and for anyone who ever needed someone to help them get through to God in a way I think that I could help them do.

After meeting these people, I learned a few things from them, and I'm also going to try to share those things with you.

1. Happiness is a choice, but what you choose for happiness is a gift from God.

Life is not a game or competition, and it is a gift even when you feel like something is wrong with you, you lack, or you are losing because something is wrong with you. We are all created in the image of God, but we are a fallen race, and we are just as guilty as anyone else.

How can you avoid the trap of trying to live like someone who is not like you?

The most important thing to remember is that God is looking out for you, and he does that by not having you fail. If you fail in relationships, and don't find what God wants in your life in a timely manner, that's your problem and not the Holy Spirit's problem; then you didn't see it and God did not notice. What really comes back to you is to make sure that you keep coming back to him, for as long as you do you are sure to see the good in things.

Once again, God is not giving you a free pass. But instead he gives you opportunities to give better; things that will make you happier.

If you are trying to create a kind of life for yourself, I would say that is an area you really need to work on.

2. Don't go to hell for getting married – that will make you happy. In fact, your happiness is what gets you married.

""Marriages have been the worst thing in my life. And I'd guess that 90-95% of all marriages will kill one partner's soul. And I know that this is really what Christianity intends. They are the worst possible way to get along and the best possible way in which a couple can get along. And I see it all around me and I don't care who you are. I think that you think of Christians as being kind to you, but the truth of the matter is that they will not save your soul. They will cause death instead. And so, you have all this choice in life and you want to die happy. The question is: How many are you going to make happy?

And yes, I know, marriage is easy. The way most people get married is like the way most of us got married: It's easy. They are going to make happy people in the marriage. But those people are the easiest to create and most likely will end up dead.

It doesn't matter how good your parents are or how nice your neighborhood is. The fact is it's just not right. It will make you"

RAW Paste Data

Hey there, devil player! Welcome back. I know you've come from a long way away to play a game of chess with me, but can you handle making conversation with an old friend such as yourself? You must have seen that little boy's eyes when you walked into his dream and heard him tell you about his adventures while you were playing, don't you. I see you're very surprised, and perhaps I should tell you that the game of chess is a lot more interesting than I originally told you it was. But you might not have been expecting a whole lot of history. Before you get stuck into the game itself, let's talk about the past. Yes, I've read it. You didn't just stumble onto it on the way here. You had time and space to memorize. It's almost like you watched someone else's dreams when you played your first game. But don't worry, I'm sure you never had to leave your room, even though you said you wanted to. Maybe you were a gamer before that. But you should have been! So how did I know you wanted to play? Well, maybe you were waiting for someone to teach you how to play chess, or maybe you were waiting because you could not resist the magic of being able to play the game the way you wanted. Either way, you have a pretty good grasp on the basics. So why make the first move? We don't have time now, so it doesn't matter what you wanted to do for your first move. Why not put the devil to a test of his strength? It is the best opportunity you have to test your skills against a real person. But it doesn't hurt, really. So let's get to the game! First, let's see what happens when the game is decided... I've already taught you how to play chess. Let's get you some drinks and I'll tell you what's up. The devil is the strongest. He can beat you! The devil is the strongest! You are very strong. He can beat you! But I have someone better than him. You can't kill him yet. He could kill you if you play him, you know, like you are supposed to. I'm sure you're pretty good enough to match his level. So no matter what he does, you can't hurt him, even with his power. The devil cannot win against the strongest player on Earth. There is one thing I know for sure though. Before the game can start, the devil's gonna have to show you something"
"No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it in a good condition. One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work. Continue the story:","

One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work. The robot starts making a great work, and its owner finds it and tells it how to save his money. This makes him so happy that he doesn't realize that his robot is just a slave. The owner does the robots job for him a while and then he gets a new one that does work for him and starts working again. Eventually the owner is very satisfied with his new robot.

If your robot is in a well-maintained condition, it is free to keep it. It doesn't need a owner or anyone to train it to perform a job or to help it to work out a problem. It will do the job on its own.


If your robot is not in a good condition and the robots owner hasn't taken care of it or it lost its job, it is not allowed any to make new robot.


If your robot is running out of money, the robots owner may use the robot in his service like a worker. If he wants his robot to do some work, he uses it for himself. If he wants it to do no work at all, he does it for his own benefit. If the owner is a slave, the work the robot does will be for his own benefit. Keep in mind that any slave will not be doing a job.


If a robot is making a robot that could earn you money, then it may be sold or used as the owner wants. The robot may even be used for the slave. You always must keep in mind that this robot is a slave.


If a robot has the possibility to steal a small item, then it doesn't need to be told that its owner is its owner. It doesn't need to be told that this robot is a slave.


If a robot is bought from a slave sale, then its status as a slave must be kept as long as the slave has the right to keep the robot. After a time the slave will be forced to sell it.


If you want your robot to become a service, it will have to learn some work very quickly. Once you learn the basic tasks, you will be able to take the robot's place and it will be able to perform it. Learn how to use your robot to a good service, and you will be enjoying the new life of your robot! Continue to the next page.

In the past, one robots master went on vacation, and the previous master stayed by his master's side. The past master started having accidents and lost a lot of the robots. At the same time the previous master also started having accidents. One day the owner saw the master's robot was in an accident. The manager told the master and the manager and the master is so very satisfied and feels very happy. And for a year, both master and robot are doing the same job and the manager continues to keep the master on board. Meanwhile the manager is taking his retirement. In this case, you need to decide what to do about it.


What happens if your robot could become a slave?


If a robot becomes a slave, the robots owner must start living like a slave, and he must not use his robot. On a future day the robot runs out of money and the owner has to stop using it. As a slave the owner should be given one meal a day and he should be provided a house. As a servant, he should be given a uniform and he should be provided a room. As a slave, the owner can't leave the robot or leave all of his belongings. However, it doesn't matter for you. The robot you used for your work doesn't have to be replaced. It will work for you the same way paralytic dogs work by the man's side.


What kind of robot can become a slave?


A slave is always needed whenever a master doesn't like something. He is an indispensable part of a boss or a client. His own master must give him to the master if the master decides not to use the slave but just to leave him behind. For that reason slaves are indispensable. When a master needs a slave for a job, the master must be willing to let the slave work for him. As a slave the master can't just buy one out or else if the slave gets lazy he will run away. The masters choice is limited: The master has to have enough money to keep a slave.


You always need a robot to accomplish everything. Keep in mind that many things can be done only by a small robot, as it's extremely useful"
Write an incredibly hateable character who is n't explicitly evil or antagonistic. Continue the story:," the author is giving you free reign to create more characters.

For instance, say that you've just written a really bland and blandly evil character—it's the kind of character that every author wants right up until they are forced into making a character who's so much more interesting than you imagined them to be, and even then you still want to keep going. It can be very frustrating.

The author will probably throw in this comment to either justify the character or let them know that he wants to keep going to further explore the character who, in this case, will make the book more interesting:


I don't want to finish this story. Do you?

The next time you read a book that uses this technique to force you into writing less interesting characters, do it with caution.

You can have someone like Ben Machen or Tim O'Brien or Tom Wolfe write better characters than you, and their books will get more sales. They may not be the author you want, maybe it's just the way their characters are written.

There's also an element of the author's ego involved. As a writer in particular, you're trying to do something very difficult and challenging that demands a little bit of ego in its participants. You want people who will come together under conditions that can't be taken for granted.


If you're a good writer, you can also write very interesting and interesting characters, which are the other end of the spectrum you want to fall into.

But in order to be an interesting person you need some skills you can't teach. You can't just say, ""Here's some skills I teach you,"" or ""Here are some skills I don't teach you,"" because what you teach is what makes you interesting, not what you do. And what makes you interesting is to be yourself, to be willing to face the facts. It turns out that there's more to the process of writing than talking yourself into writing about a character's flaws and foibles.

It's also very difficult to know whether a character is fun. If an author uses the ""character is boring"" technique, the problem with it may be that we don't know if his character is interesting. If an author's characters are too boring for him to be interested, then that makes the characters much less interesting, just because they aren't interesting.

It could be a character who is basically just a generic action figure (or a character who is supposed to be a generic action figure anyway). It could be a generic character in a generic situation. It could be a generic character who only has two lines in his backstory, which makes him absolutely irrelevant.

This author had a character who was a generic action figure, but was also supposed to be a generic action figure. He was an easy character to write about, as he didn't fit into any specific archetype to begin with. After writing the first hundred pages, he decided he no longer wanted to write about generic action figures and was so frustrated it almost ruined the book. But the author didn't have the same issues with his novel, which he just decided he didn't want to write about because it was boring and they didn't want to read it.

The problem then became a reader's challenge, to be sure he wanted to read the book as opposed to just not want it to exist because they didn't want to read about a generic action figure who happens to fit into an archetype for his own reasons.

So, if you read this novel and it has a generic action figure who happens to fit into some generic archetype… do the character belong to that archetype?

The answer, of course, is yes. But that doesn't mean they belong in that archetype.

The trick with the generic action figure is that you can get away with writing him/her as much as you like. But at some point you have to realize that the author has given up creating his/her identity or story. So be it.

Your character is not who you wanted to write about, you just put some generic generic action figure into the story and let him/her be it.

If the author's character and any of his/her other characters suddenly start taking more interest in different aspects of what the character is about, well, you have a problem.


If a character isn't doing something and the author makes them do something, that only makes them more interesting than the character did before. It also shows me that the author knows the character is less interesting than before. But it doesn't necessarily mean the character is more interesting, it's just the author's way of saying, ""Hey, these characters just happen to be doing something.""


But, of course, there are exceptions. In some cases it's a good idea for a character or a scene to have an additional actor (usually just a"

Continue the story:"," You're standing on a set of stairs when you're called up. What do you do? As you step through the door, you realize it's a hallway. You move along the hall and to the right into a room. It's an old home on a hill, you can't look out the windows. There's a fireplace, what looks like a TV in the room with the set that you found earlier. There's a table with bookshelves, there's a refrigerator with fridge paper and a coffee machine. Another closet has a shelf with more clothes and clotheshoes. Another drawer has a box of soap with a few clothes neatly folded in it. The closet again with some old clothes and old hair. You walk by the refrigerator to find a book with a few clothes neatly folded, it shows the book is by a woman called Martha Nix you guess, you notice she never leaves that office. You look down to the bookshelf and see a couple of books on the dresser, the one on the right with the picture of her and her hair is by John C. Delaney. There's a second book on the left with a picture of Henry David Thoreau. So that's where you were. Oh, this seems to be different from the other one you found. That's a really neat piece of mail. You've got to see it. As you approach the door to the left of the fireplace, it opens, there's a door it looks like a door leading back into the hallway and into a small room with a light on in the middle you see the white sheet against a wall, all the rest of the wall is white. The lights are on in that room and they are off on the other side. You step off a step, step off one end into a smaller room that leads up to a back garden, the back garden turns out to be bigger than you'd expect. A fountain and a small stream and you can see there are trees. There's a small pond in the back garden. On a hill you can see the top part of the city. You know the people you live with. You're in a small, white building on a hill with little trees around you. At your waist is the white sheet and the clothes that you saw earlier. You walk out to the porch into a lighted garden and a fountain. The house is covered with leaves and cacti. You step into the fountain and see there are flowers all over. You start back into the house, you're lost in thought, you almost lost track of time. The house goes all the way back up to a big red light with a large red sign on it. Here's the sign: 'TUNNEL'. It's another one of your old houses, but it is just like this one, the water runs from the big red light as you walk up to your front door. This time the door is open, but you couldn't get inside because it's locked. You go back into the living room and into another small room. The window here doesn't look great, there's a picture of a dog there, you were told there's a dog. You're walking through a kitchen area and you hear music and you stop and ask the lady sitting at the kitchen table, what's that? She tells you it's the piano. What does she do all day? She makes little cups of tea and some bread to enjoy during her lunch break. Who is she? You come to understand she's your great-uncle. She helps you eat. She has a small, white cat or a dog. What do you do to her? Her name is Linda. You see the baby on the table and she's going to try to hold him. You leave the restaurant and come down the street where you can start your drive at the station. Once you get down to the other side you enter your car and start down the road a little ways. You notice you can't drive that fast without bumping into things. You've noticed a lot more cars and cars passing you. You see an old yellow truck pass by. A lot of women are carrying bags and children are playing in the street, a couple of men are smoking a little. You look at the white sheet, where did it come from? There's a girl in bright blue jeans and a shirt on that you can see her breasts. A man is standing on the bench and waving, he asks you what you're doing and you look up the road and look to the right. A man is taking a walk.

Gears of War 4, The Last of Us, Prey and God of War. These series have all made it onto my Top 10 for 2013 and I find them all really damn good. So when I heard that Epic's Quake 4 would be coming out, I got off my ass and bought it. I played a couple matches and was really enjoying it. Then I saw the trailer for Epic's new shooter project, I fell in love with it right away and was immediately on board to be involved in their story.

So it's the time in 2014. You've played the games, seen them used, and now you're about to kick kick kick one out and start your own story. Do you know what I'm talking of? Well, the thing is, as a story-teller, you have a lot to gain from all these different characters, even if they're based on your favorite series (like the Gears of War series for example) or movies (the Prey, God of War, Uncharted)

I want you to think aboutKalie and the boy who cried wolf, who is an innocent in nature, whose life would have been just a normal boy's life, had he not met a monster in the woods, who is possessed by the evil spirits in the woods. The very same boy who had this dream, to become a hunter. But what is his connection to all of this, and why does he want to become the world's Hunter? How does his soul get corrupted, and what will it be like to live with this new and powerful spirit, after a lifetime dedicated to becoming one?

So if you're like me and love video games, I suggest you get ready to dive into Epic's Halo 4 at this year's E3 Expo. You can pick your own adventure, whether you play Halo or not, but I guarantee you you'll get a really great story as you explore the new world of Halo 4.

The Good

The combat is solid. Halo 4 is the first Halo where you will be able to take full advantage of its ability to fire two-handed shots and rocket launchers, the classic Halo combos. And then there's the new game mode - Forge - which is another new addition to the franchise that's basically the Halo formula with 3D graphical destruction.

There is, however, one major problem with the first game, and the reason why I've become a fan of both Gears of War and Prey, as well a new franchise called Gears of War 4. There's a ton of story, character development and story telling in Gears of War 4, but you've got to keep in mind that it's just one game, and that it has been designed around the series' mechanics. This means that for a lot of folks, the story is just a nice story to have - and if you want to see the rest of the game, you can, but I really doubt it will be worth your time and effort.

What I'm talking about is what I call the 'halo effect,' or more specifically, The Halo Effect.

The Good - A lot of characters, especially the major characters, have been fully fleshed out. I really enjoyed getting to know most of the main cast in this title, except for the mute girl and a couple others that are fairly minor.

The Bad - The story isn't as deep as I would like it to be, because most of it has the Halo Effect: It's a lot of story and character development, but it's a lot of fleshing out of the main cast.

The Gameplay - This is going to be an amazing game, and I'm really looking forward to trying my hand at the new game mode. However, you really should expect the game to feel... shallow on my part; a little bit of grinding may be expected (and I'd hate to see your experience negatively impacted by it). I did the new game mode really well, so just like I did with The Last of Us, I would recommend trying to reach level 50 before getting into it. However, I was able to complete it with like 60 hours under my belt, so you never know.

The Movie - Epic should make a cinematic sequel to this game as per their previous commitment. I'm looking forward to seeing it in theaters before I can say if it'll be decent or not.

The Soundtrack - Not only is this game a perfect marriage of the classic sounds of Gears of War and the unique sounds of Halo that I love, it's pretty much just as good as the audio on The Last of Us. This is another area from Epic, where they are looking to build upon their sound and direction in the new game"
At age 18 you are required to go to city hall and have someone read you through a choose your own adventure style book of your life while you make the choices. The choices are permanent and will determine your life. You are the clerk reading the books. Continue the story:," If you select an orphan, your family must suffer. You decide the amount of pain a family goes through each month and then your character makes a choice for pain or happiness (that you wish to change).

Once you choose how severe the pain or happiness will be, you start reading the book (if you don't read a book once your character is an adult, his or her first book becomes a blank page). Keep in mind you can take things out of the book and use them later on in your life. The more details you give, the better.

The other option is if the book gives you an idea for how you go about life you can make the experience seem to live up to your idea of what it means to be an adventurer. The book tells you what your choices will hurt (pun intended).

One thing that can cause trouble for an adventurer is that he or she will have a job. One bad choice in a job can mean permanent disfigurement or losing one's job, and if you want your character to be able to take care of themselves, they should be able to find a job on their own. In The Road, your character can have a job and make that job their job, like a baker. (If this sounds like you, look into job coaching or a similar training.) These can even be the very thing you need to stay alive through adventure. So keep in mind, it is in your character's best interest to find a job on their own but if they're a poor candidate, the job might not be there for them. When this becomes a problem, the job counselor shows up to try and guide the adventurer.

But the other question you should be asking yourself when you read this book is: what did I choose to do to make this life worth living? It takes a certain amount of time into the game for you find your identity. One thing I would suggest is the player's job is to learn the job description of the job until they become comfortable and then make a decision that will help that business. For example, they might be asked to provide services to a client who could be your landlord and give them a room to sleep in. Another example might be the player's job is to work at a car dealership or a car wash.

As a GM you have a few ideas for what might make an adventurer to be useful but that player's job can vary because the player will have a lot of other options.

Another thing you can do is give out jobs more in line with character's personality. You can also choose to have them work in secret and only get a portion of a client's income (for example you may be working at a jewelry store and the client may pay you a small amount for work only), but in the end it comes down to the player's character.

If you choose to have the Player's Job option, you could also make it easier to have the adventurers' job. Have them do certain things for their customers or not work so in the end it may come down to their character's desires and their character's abilities.

The Road books give us an idea of what a life with an adventure might be like. The role-playing aspect will certainly give some players the time to think hard about what they do in order to live within their means, the road can give the same and so it should.


A quick description of the game

The characters are an assortment of adventurers, from adventurers in The Road books to adventurers on their own in The Road. They all make choices through choosing between four different stories (which tell different parts of their characters' lives). Each story is unique and this allows the GM to create a story with each character.

Characters are born as adventurers, so you are all a blend of adventurers. This is a good thing since there is a fair amount of danger here, even though it doesn't really impact the adventure. The characters are only in their third year but they are in a dangerous place,politics is being made to protect their job and family, and they have yet to find answers as to how they can help others. The book has the player making choice after choice which is quite humorous.

Each adventure in this third book has its own goal

The Road has many different stories in it but also is not limited to a particular set of objectives that a character can do or be a part of. These include:

• The people they serve (the family, the community or the country).

• Places and people they visit, including their own personal quest.

• Fighting and combat scenes

• Problems and obstacles the characters must deal with, including their own personal struggles.

"An important press conference, with rows of cameras pointed at you. Dozens of journalists wait with bated breath, until finally you mutter, `` no comment '' into your microphone. The room explodes with excitement. One of them yells, `` this is going to be front page news across the planet! '' Continue the story:","

The moment of the explosion: The moment of the explosion: At the time of the explosion, the blast is loud and powerful and so immediate that it makes even a tiny rock fall and leave a crater. So, too, with the earthquake that preceded it. Even in Haiti, which was hit more than five years ago by a 6.0 earthquake, the last big one, the last big quake, a reporter was able to catch a glimpse of a big hole in the wall of a church. At the beginning of this story, the reporter was told that another big hit could occur within another five minutes. The reporter is standing on an abandoned street in a quiet neighborhood when he hears someone scream a bit too loudly. He rushes back to his car to see what she's screaming about. As he drives away the shrieks become more piercing. A building is on fire; it will probably take minutes for firefighters to put it out. But there, standing on a sidewalk, a young woman screams for help. She's screaming for her son after a nearby building has collapsed. The building is two blocks from her house. The boy, standing in one of four rows of black-and-white-roofed schools along the street, can't stop crying. This is the middle of the afternoon, the sun is setting, and a crowd that swelled when the earthquake struck a couple of years ago now, just a few miles away, has moved closer to the road leading into the neighborhood. The reporter follows the woman through a house to where her boy is crying, but by the time he sees her it's too late -- the building has collapsed. The reporter drives back and forth in a daze. He wonders where he is. He sees a large hole in a house in the area. He rushes to check the building, but it's gone. What's left of the neighborhood is a wreck. The street is a disaster area; nothing remains but rubble and mangled limbs. The neighborhood's inhabitants had taken shelter in the school, but the gymnasium is gone. At the first sign that he might discover what's left or get a good look at the scene, the reporter decides to turn right around. He follows a dirt road to a building that's partly obscured by the rubble. When he gets there, the walls are almost entirely gone, and with them, the structure behind them has collapsed. It's clear that something terrible has happened. The reporter calls out to the boy sitting near the scene of the wreckage. `` Don't look. Just stay here,'' he tells him. ``Don't move, don't look.`` The boy doesn't budge. When the reporter puts forth the suggestion that maybe he should go around the school, the boy doesn't budge. The reporter asks him repeatedly if he really was in danger, but the boy refuses to answer the question. At some point, the reporter decides that one of the school's teachers might have seen the fire and escaped in time, but the school building itself is badly damaged. He decides that because of the damage there, this is the area at the front of school that the teacher might be hiding in, if any. Again, there's no sign of him, so the reporter decides to give it a try. He drives around the rest of the neighborhood, following the teachers' footsteps, just as he'd done when the children were brought to safety earlier in the afternoon. But the path is now blocked. The reporter goes back to the school. As he's trying to get to the other side, he hears a scream. A scream that seems to come from a different direction. It's close enough that he can make out the voice. It's too close, and so the reporter decides that it's better to let things occur as they come, when it's clear that some of the families will still be inside. As the reporter inevitably heads back toward the school, he continues to watch the students move cautiously, slowly, carefully, down the street. It's hard to picture this child's face as the kids rush into the rubble and find out that there are no students there, a result that won't even begin to weigh on the teachers, who know, as everyone knows, that there are no parents waiting in the rubble. There's no one else but the reporter sitting in his car, watching students run away from his car. It's hard to imagine, now. The reporter is watching students and teachers run for their lives right in front of him. No one else notices. The moment the reporter turns to go, he looks up to see his car's headlights flickering in the darkness. Then he drops his car and collapses, dead. His body falls into the"

Summon rain on people sitting in the park, waking people up at 3AM using your sonic booms while flying through the air, stuff like that. You ’ re on holiday when a real villain decides to take your city hostage ... You 're furious. Continue the story:"," 1A Your partner is now going to kidnap a teenager to force you to help her find her family. changing the whole ""he loves you"" dynamic for the worse, but not to the point of a relationship problem. As a supervillain the only thing you won 't be doing is stealing candy from the candy bar, stealing the money from the bank, and all overacting your sexual power with any man that can be gotten in the club.


You ’ re very jealous, you know I am, and the fact that her parents are a bit of a pain, and she doesn 't have anyone to take care of her while she's away. That's why I'm calling you right now. 2A You are currently planning to go away on holiday and she's getting the same invitation as you. It's time to act. 3A Make sure you're wearing an eye patch and a nose ring. Make some noise, and call her out by name. If you're nervous at all, or only have two minutes to stop and think, go ahead and scream.


If she's not screaming, have her phone on silent and go outside. 4A If she doesn 't give you a response, get a gun, put it to her head for one count, and put the bullet in her torso.


If she hits her head on the pavement, put a few bullets in the back of her head and have them leave before she hit the ground. 5A Now that the first few bullets are on her, do something very different from the other times you've done this before. Not the whole ""kill your family"" thing, but something less drastic and probably a bit funnier. 6A Leave for your place of travel. 7A Make a very loud, loud, dramatic announcement by yelling some swear words while you run out the back door of the club.


If no one hears what you're saying, say ""I'M ON MY WAY!"" and run up the stairs into the bar where you will be sitting. (If she's sitting, use the other door.) 8A Now you' re in control, make the announcement, run inside the club where you will be sitting. 9A Get off the phone and take a look around that room you're in right now. 10A Check out the room that has a table facing on a bench. 11A Turn on a live television from that tv stand. 12A Pick up a shotgun and head out back towards the door, while holding the gun to your head, and yelling, ""F*** THE DOOR"" as loudly as you possibly can.


Follow the instructions to the letter for each of the directions.


I'm sure you got what I was talking about: ""If she doesn't give you a response, say 'I'm ON MY WAY!' and run up the stairs into the bar where you will be sitting. If she's not screaming, have her phone on silent and go outside."" - Don't worry, this is the real world, people can make noise, and a few sound effects, no matter how ridiculous they sound. The problem with using this trick is that you're essentially telling her that you don't love her. When you say something like ""I'm off for vacation!"" it's pretty obvious that you do love her, but there's no way she's going to go to your room for the night and listen attentively while you yell ""F*** HERS!"" to her mom with a gun pointed directly at her head.

Do not use this trick to get a man to like you and you have every right to hold this up as a sign that you would rather date someone better with a high-tech gun hidden under his shirt than to the best-looking lady that's with you instead of somebody you're more in touch with, like an old friend. Don't use this trick on women that are only attracted to the type of guy that goes in for the ""love"" or the ""sex"" part.


Don't use this trick and don't think that you are. It has the double and triple negative connotations in the context of men makingdepending on the way the scene is set.

If you want a guy (and especially someone who wants to have sex with you) to like you a lot before you know that he likes you, then make it sound really weird and unnatural so that the most people will think to ask about what you'e doing in public. For instance, say something like ""I'm at a place at which I can't get in because there's no way that you're"
Scientists discover an algorithm for predicting a person 's date of death with 95 % confidence. When you finally decide to enter your parameters into the algorithm you see a surprising result. Continue the story:,"

This algorithm makes predictions based on the information provided by his email. By the date of death it predicts he'll be at home, eating dinner and watching TV. Now I believe my predictions have been borne out, because before leaving his home city and travelling to a far away island, his email had been updated regularly.

How many of you can relate to this story?

How long until we hear something about the algorithm that predicts your own death with 95 % confidence?

This algorithm makes predictions based on the information provided by his email. Because emailing a friend to let them know you are in a meeting at 5 PM is a great way to get a quick response in one direction, the algorithm has been tested to predict the day based on their email address. It has even been used for dating in that way. The algorithm has been tested against every year of the information we send to each other through email, and it's 95 % sure that our emails are unique. (And, believe me, it'll get better as you send more and more information through your email.)

How does the algorithm determine that my email address has been successfully identified as being from transmission, or not?

This algorithm makes predictions based on the information provided by his email. I can't actually say that this worked for every user, because I haven't identified every user from which the email was received. I only have a sample dataset where the data indicates 90% matches. But that's enough of a sample size to get me 95% confidence in my method.

Can you see why it's worth investing in?

There are two great reasons someone might invest in this data.

First, the algorithm offers the following insights, with 95% certainty:

It takes time to get your email messages right. You need to understand a user's preferences and make sure that a feature such as a notification inbox or call to action button works well for them.

Because of our email data, you can now know when and why an email was sent to you, which email features worked well, etc. You will now have a clearer understanding of where your email messages are most likely to end up, and what the average time to read an email is.

Batman gets a call from commissioner Gordon about trouble down at Arkham Asylum. As soon as he arrives he sees the culprit giving himself up to the police. He 's a security guard who has shot and killed several of Arkham 's frequent residents. Continue the story:," Joker is back.

Joker gets another call from Commissioner Gordon around this time, and he tells him that in the meantime he wants him and his staff working at Arkham. You can hear the Arkham security guard speaking with Batman when Joker enters the hospital, but as soon as your conversation begins the guards tell him to stop. His next words reveal himself to be Batman, at the same time as he's knocked out (or ""broken"").

A few days later Batman is taken to The Buried Giant by Gordon in order to search for the Joker. Joker's there too. You'll find out quite quickly that he's more cunning yet is not as intelligent as Batman, as he and Gordon discover that the Joker has escaped. Joker escapes to a helicopter, but you are able to stop it once you have a good look at the craft.

While you're waiting for the helicopter to land another call comes in that Joker now has the help of the Black Mask, his younger brother. The masked man brings something up to Batman, and the Dark Knight wants to know what it is all about. Joker, as usual, isn't interested.

A few minutes later, Joker is back. He's taking it on himself to bring Batman down, which is what he does, and you have to use your ingenuity on the Batmobile. You're able to turn the Batmobile into a helicopter and use it to fly the Batboat to the jail, and when you arrive there, you discover that Joker is in town again. You and Joker battle again. When Joker is defeated, you find out that Gordon has actually been working for the Black Mask.

You start to uncover more about the villains of the Arkham games, and find out that the Arkham games really are far from being a ""fun"" series, but rather are a series of dark and twisted adventures from a twisted mind. Joker is even taking part in the proceedings, but not in the way one would expect.

What will I find here? Well, don't expect much exposition, but some interesting things. First of all, The Arkham games can seem repetitive, but with a good level of depth and meaning to each character. You're able to connect people just through the games, which is something that should be done in all games. You'll probably be very disappointed to find out the Batmobile that has been driving you around is a complete mess, and is broken all the way at the front.

Batman's most recent game was a surprise, and while you'll feel disappointed with Arkham Asylum, you're able to enjoy the best game Batman has had thus far (or at least since the Arkham Asylum games were released). Batman's return is a strong one, and you'll be impressed with the sheer insanity of it all.

Batman: Arkham City is the third game in the Arkham series, it takes place on the streets of Gotham City, and features the return of Batman, which is the biggest change between the second and third titles. The story can get rather dull at times and I don't feel it has the depth that it had in the previous games, and some would say it's the most boring of any of the games in the series. You're forced to follow the trail of Gotham's villains, but as you can see you have more than enough to do in this game.

Overall, I am loving Arkham City. It is the best game in the series, and I hope that the final installment will be stronger and more entertaining than this. I'm excited for Arkham Knight to show up on the last-gen consoles, but don't hold your breath with me yet. Still it's worth checking out if if you've yet to start playing Arkham games; even if it's not ""your favorite"" one.

If you're an Arkham fan and would like to be kept ahead of developments in the series, you can join our newsletter here. I promise that we won't be able to send you updates on the game any time soon, and more importantly what you should be interested in, but don't forget to subscribe!

Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate. Continue the story:,"

""My roommate started yelling at us and then started going to sleep. I was lying asleep on the couch watching TV. I asked him, 'You need to stop!' and he just kept looking at me like, 'Huh?'""

""Eventually we had to make the decision that he needed to leave. But I didn't want him to leave. I continued watching the news and watching the news about the attacks, and just couldn't get it out of my head.""

""I felt angry and humiliated and hurt. I had lost my peace of mind. It was then that I knew it was time to reach out to the ACLU.""

""By the end of the day, I was exhausted and I just wanted to go to sleep.""

This is the kind of experience that I experienced today, and I want to give you all some inspiration. I do not want to minimize other people's lives—people can wake up tomorrow and have the same, horrifying experience—but I want to put this story in perspective. We are all affected and we cannot take it for granted. We are all at risk, and it's up to every single person to make sure they're taking measures and making arrangements to do so.

This is where I believe the good news lies for you. The ACLU gives legal support to students who are scared with the news of campus sexual assault. I want to tell you that you can speak up and file a complaint without feeling embarrassed. I want to tell you that you can still be seen as a woman who is standing up for others.

And as you're reading this, I want you to know that you matter. We are all at risk, and your actions are going to make a difference.

If you have a friend or loved one who is experiencing this type of thing or feels like they're going to be for some time, you can call the ACLU toll-free at 1(888) THE-AMERICAN (1-888-843-4673)Info for your local office. Or, you can write to them by visiting your local ACLU office's website. So many people are feeling overwhelmed and isolated, and there are even more resources out there for others who are feeling as stressed as you are.

"Dora does not know the truth. Boots, Swiper, and the Map do, and they must never let Dora know. Today, it just got much harder. Continue the story:","

A. There are some things we won't disclose to you. The truth is far more powerful than anything I can make you believe. The true fate of the world rests only in your hands.

B. I'm sure I know what to do: The Map is key. The story you hear is the one you will live out. We have a secret--an ultimate secret. No one will ever uncover this secret. I am the one who was sent to the future. I must return to the present time. We are tooiants-men of another age. Now it is time to show you the truth.

C. For the sake of the world, I cannot help you if you've been turned into a monster. The secrets of the map may be more powerful than you can imagine.

A-7. The story is almost made up. A-7, and all the other things you've read, were written in the book of Dora: a book that only a few know is there. The book contains a key that will guide you through Dora's secrets. When you open the book, the message disappears. We can now continue.


A B In the Land of Giants, all is still, but the sky is black like black ink. You can stand in only one place at a time, like a shadow. To pass through Dora's world, however, you must be one person. This will be a world of giants.

A This is exactly what we were hoping you would get out of this letter. We have some important secrets to inform you of. I have been told what Dora has been hiding, but it is not important to you at this time.

B What is important is what you learn. We've learned that there are giants in the world, and they come to this world so that they may escape from their past and become what's left of humankind. They will stop at nothing to reach this world.

A We will tell you about them first. A Giant of the World, is a very ancientATURES known as giant. These giants once ruled the world, and once were as powerful as humans are. Each one is a descendant of a previous giant, and can reach the next world. With each death, their power wanes and they become stronger and more dangerous. These giants have been destroying the world of Giants for millenia.

B After all this time, they have not killed you. You will soon find that they have grown into something far greater.

N We've learned that the true goal of the giant is to make a new world, a place where all of them can grow to great size and become the new giant. What happens next is not your business. We are not responsible for any of that. The secret will only come to you when you are ready.

A You need no help here. I will lead you through the past of Dora. Remember, the greatest secret of all lies within the hidden book of Dora, one of the lost books of the Giants.


B. When you get to the book, you will find the key to your destiny. It is locked and cannot be opened except by the person who is responsible for Dora, the one with the ultimate destiny of the entire world. There will be many secrets in the book, but you will learn some.

A No. You need not find me or anyone else. Only your destiny. You must find the key by your own self-interest. The door only opens when you choose to open it. Do not allow anyone else to decide whether you would want this book for yourself or a child or a servant.

C. Now we are getting it just right! I've already shown you that the book of Dora contains a key you are to meet. This key will allow you to find every single thing Dora has hidden away in the old days, when she had the key to every detail of her history.


A. That makes it all the more important to take the book with you when you wake up in the present time. You cannot trust any human, since you don't know what they are thinking. If you can't find the key from one human, then no other human can find it for you. It may take a month or so before we can send an owl to tell you the truth.

A That sounds like a plan. That's where the real difficulty lies. Your first step is to search everyone who has seen Dora and every single thing she has ever done. Search them for clues about what has happened to Dora over the years. That will give you the key.

You discover that Earth is the `` North Korea '' of the galaxy Continue the story:," the great expansion of Earth's atmosphere over time, stretching over all the habitable planets (and some of the more distant ones) until such a time as the Sun will become too dim to see Earth, even from the nearest terrestrial point.

As the climate warms up, the planet's temperature starts to get hotter.

The earth's surface takes on a slight yellowish tint. At this point the Sun becomes too cool to continue sustaining life on, so Earth starts cooling down even more.

At the ""end of the last Ice Age"" at 4,600 B.C., temperatures across the planet's surface started to cool a bit as the Sun's temperature plummeted.

The Earth cooled off, because the Earth's atmosphere, too, cooled off over time, to the point where the Sun could no longer keep up with the changes in environmental conditions.

At this point, the universe expanded, expanding the size of the solar system, before being squeezed back toward the center when the cosmos expanded again at a slower rate. At this point the Milky Way galaxy had expanded more than 100 billion years ago, before being squeezed back again.

At this point, the observable universe began expanding at a faster rate than normal. That means that there isn't much room for new objects to form -- there are too many stars, too many stars.

The size of the observable universe was now equal to the size of the solar system (a little less than 100 billion kilometers across), and it was shrinking!

The universe was at the very beginning of its ""Big Bang"" -- a period of cosmic (un)organization when new galaxies were born from the existing ones.

When this occurred, the universe was about 10 billion years old -- about three times as old as it is today.

It is also possible that the universe has a ""Little Big Bang"" -- a brief ""flash"" of cosmic energy from which life started.

This brief period of cosmic creation can last tens of millions of years.

But it also ends with the Big Bang.

From this point, the universe has not undergone any further growth, so there are no new elements of life -- like oxygen.

All that remains today is the Earth's core.

When the core expands, it is heated so much that it explodes - like a supernova or a ""black hole"". It was once thought that a supernova would blow the stars from the earth out into space.

But instead, the explosion of a supernova produces a huge fireball - with an almost perfectly spherical ""outer"" region around it.

The fireball then expands, leaving behind a large, thin disc of gas - known as the hot Jovian star.

This is where most of Earth's living elements like water, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide (CO2) and the other elements made by the Sun -- are made, and where all life on Earth comes from - from the ocean, forests, lakes, rivers and oceans that water flows through and then flows back into the water with water vapor.

The main problem with the Earth forming from a hot, compact, rapidly expanding, expanding universe, is that that would mean it wouldn't have enough solid metal to make all the other ""living"" planets, or to send life to the stars... that is - until such a time as the Sun runs out of metal to make it.

After that, it can be assumed that the universe can continue expanding while the Earth remains where it originally began."

In your own words:

I am a young Canadian male. I am currently 17 and I have never been in a real relationship. I'm a self proclaimed virgin. I have never held hands with a girl before. Even if I did it would still be against my religion. I am not gay. I've never even come close to kissing a girl. That is all. I am a virgin. This is a great opportunity you are giving up. I understand it is you, so I will be your victim. If you give up then I will not be given up. If you do not take my offer I will never be given up by anyone I have been with. This is your only chance. No other girl or guy will give me up and there is no way I will come with a bad attitude. I will be respectful of you and take full responsibility for what you say. I will have sex with you (vaginal or anal) only with the understanding that I will be completely clean after I have the chance to hold hands, kiss and touch. I will make it clear to you that I am a virgin. You are not going to fuck me; you cannot get my virginity and I will never give it up to another man. I'll tell you when I am ready to give it up. If you agree to my terms you must follow them. You have 5 days to complete your paperwork and my date will be set. I am also happy to help you in the future, I'll do everything I can to help you in any way that I can. I promise you if I catch you taking part in something like this again, I'll put you away for good. I can't give you any warning because you'll never know if you're ready to give up. If you decide to give it up, I can't say no because then I'd have to kill you in jail. I promise I will be your slave until you do what I say. Thank you for listening, I really appreciate it.


It has been said that the secret to maintaining virginity is making absolutely no contact with a girl or man outside of school, so maybe that is the secret behind this offer for you Canadian boys. Now do you believe in any magic, or is there really a magical spell you can ""hold"" a girl so you can use her once a week on your first date.


If you accept this offer you are committing a felony. If you fail to comply you will be arrested.

"Write a deep, philosophical piece about anything you choose, however all it builds up to is a reference. Continue the story:"," that's the point I'd like.

It's just a reference now, and you should read more to see how you relate to this character's journey. The characters are the key, not the background.

A reference can also create two different moods while reading.

On one hand you could be sitting there reading a piece where the writer is writing another piece. The first thing that occurs to you when you read the piece is, ""I wonder why there's a scene where you need to say 'no' and give these two things to them, but I can't believe they're not happy with getting what they wanted."" Your mind would be very much in the background, and the mood of the piece would be very affected. You could be reading an epic fantasy story where you're in a magical valley, and you're in the presence of characters you think you know, but you don't. You can see the way they think about the world, and you can feel the way they think or feel. You can feel their excitement. You're just not completely there yet.

If you read a piece where the writer isn't telling a story, maybe in a different genre or where the writer is writing about something different from your usual passion, maybe you'll feel less affected or maybe you'll feel inspired and then you'll go in and say, ""Wow, the characters are so clever, that the story is so well told, that I want to try and write like that,"" but it's always a matter of whether you're going to be inspired to try a different form.

On the other hand, I've been doing a lot of short fiction, and I've gotten very interested in the medium of short fiction. Sometimes I'll write a couple hundred words and feel like I know where I'm going, but then it'll go off the rails for me. It stops, and in my head, all they're doing is writing again. I don't get into the work anymore. I don't want to read another piece. There's something about one page that I've written, the way it moves, that's so exciting for me. Sometimes you want to put the pieces of some poems together and see how it will move the poetry. I do that a lot, but I do it as a piece of practice. I want to make stuff that feels good when I get topadding to the finish line. That's the only way."

You are a lost musician in a neon lit city. Describe your experiences and people you come across. Continue the story:,"

I came to New York on an audition tour for a band called The Spare People. I would have gone from here in Europe, but a big storm shut down Europe on the way to this place. So I had to return to Europe.

What was your worst moment of being in New York?

One thing I really didn't expect was that people would become friendly with me after I met them. They would ask me questions, and say how much they enjoyed my guitar… that's all that a normal person does, and I found an incredible support network of people willing to answer any questions. But one thing that really stuck out was the lack of communication between the people I knew and people I met. I would go to a record store to get a record like ""The Best of"" or ""The Faint"" and it would get sold out, because people here do not talk about their music anymore. I'd leave feeling bad for whoever was selling it, because it's not the usual way of doing business in New York.

I'll say this: my worst day in New York was when I was about to tour. At the airport, I had to wait to get myself checked in because some people were standing outside in the sand waiting for their buses to come by. So I just left the airport, and while I'm there, I get word from some artists and bands that they were playing the record festival here and my bus didn't get picked up. There was just like 25 people standing outside in the sand waiting for the bus in the dark and I thought, ""That's just wrong, because I'm not going to be here a few hours."" So I go back to my hotel in New York.

So you are coming down, and you're waiting in the airport for a bus to come pick you up because you can't travel?

Yes! I'm on my way back from another New York show. Somebody called and said ""There's a bus at 8:00 for you, but there is a line and no buses are leaving."" I was thinking, ""Gosh, how am I going to get on it? How am I going to get off at this time? Can I get on the next day?"" Finally I found someone who called the number and let me on. I got on the bus, and I'm on my way out. A bunch of people were going off to the gig, and everyone was waiting around, and I was the only one who would be sitting on the bus. This guy looked at me and was like, ""You know, it's going to take awhile."" But before I knew it I was driving out at 12:00. I started walking, and I was kind of like a walking stick! I was walking down Broadway and that's when a van went around a corner, and a police officer started talking to this guy who'd been walking outside at 10, and he said ""Why don't you go into the van and you can leave at once?"" And I said, well, I guess people have to be careful on the street, but I had to leave, it was my first day back in town.

If you could only speak to someone one more time, what would that be?

That's not a question I could answer. I'm really too overwhelmed. I'm going to be playing in two big tour dates in Europe this spring, and then also playing in the UK, which was one of the things that was more of a challenge for me than I could have thought. I remember I had a song called ""Bitter Dreams"" and it was going to be played in London. I did it, and people were really supportive of me. And then suddenly a few days later I'm playing it for 50 people and I walk offstage and all of a sudden it's taken over the whole arena in London that night. So when you're working with a new band, like The Spare People, you can never have enough experience. You can only get better.

You've started getting into the writing and recording process so close to the release cycle of the songs and albums. What are your most recent thoughts?

I don't know that I can give any Malta tips. You have to spend a lot of time thinking about what's happening on the road, and what's going on in your life, and how to use that. You have to be in the right place at the wrong time and think of it all as a process, and it's easier when you know the songs better than people do. I don't know how you would go about doing that, especially when someone is on tour with you. My experience is you can't, but you have to spend a lot of time thinking about things.

I started looking for solutions like this... but didn't find any... and after many, many hours of work, I am here. It's a puzzle that I have not found anywhere. I am sorry for the fact that it wasn't posted somewhere better. I spent over a year trying to find an answer. I really don't know what to do. Maybe you will find a solution? Or maybe it'll be more complicated than that. I could end up going insane.

EDIT: It looks like I got some people's help.

Thank you...

EDIT 2: In case you didn't notice, I posted it on Reddit. It got upvoted many times.

EDIT 3: I took this solution and made it a github project. I used the code from jonathan_miller (solution to the above puzzle) and posted it here in case the puzzle is solved again

EDIT: Okay, here it is. Please make sure you are following this path: The first time I posted this puzzle, someone from /r/rational had already solved it. I posted an edited version (minus the ""kill the other immortal"") on Reddit.

EDIT 4: Now, here it is, released as open source (I won't host it anywhere. Not even reddit), on github!

EDIT 5: Here it is with another version. You can find it under the link

EDIT 6: Here it is with a new version.

EDIT 7: Here is a version without the ""kill the other immortal"". Enjoy :)

EDIT 8: Here is a version with some code changes (there is not much).
ihara.

The solution is (slightly) obfuscated, which is one reason why the puzzle is a bit confusing. However, it is quite readable (though it seems that the solution wasn't very clear from the start, but if you look at it with more experience, you might be able to find the solution yourself).

To do this, we'll need to create a function to handle the creation of the game state. Here it is:

function addInventory() {

var newInventoryToAdd=undefined;

newInventoryToAdd=new Storage(1);

storage.addItem(""New Inventory"",null,newInventoryToAdd,1);

storage.addItem(""New Inventory From Inventories"",null,null,1); // If it isn't null, we cannot add to an empty slot

storage.getItemById(""New Inventory From Inventories"")[0].place()

} // end addInventory

Finally, differ from jonathan_miller's ""killer"", this function is quite simple to use (as long as your programming language isn't Java).

In addition to this function, we need to implement some logic to ensure that we always keep a copy of an inventory.

The following functions do our job:

inventory.deleteItem(id)

inventory.removeItem(id)


The game will always keep a copy of the inventory. When we first create an inventory, it will have the same value (zero). We should try to get that value again after we remove items from it (so we don't have a redundant inventory). Also, let's make sure that we know what the place of the item we have selected is.

inventory.getSelectedItem().place()

Inventory.clearSelectedItem()

Lastly, it is also necessary to check if the inventory has been cleared. If there is something in the inventory, a message box will pop up, informing us that it has been cleared. If there isn't anything in inventory, none of the information we need is shown, or a warning box appears.

function store() {

// Add a new item to the inventory

storage.setItem(""New Items"", { id:id, value:0, placeItem:newInventoryToAdd })

}

function clearSelectedItem() {

if (inventory.hasItem(null)) {

// Create a new inventory

// Create the location and position of the old inventory

// Add the new item to the inventory

storage.addItem(""New Inventory"", null,null,true,(0,0))


// Show the message box asking if the inventory's value/placeItem was cleared

// Let's add some code to keep track of"
Three people are standing in a room. Only one of them has a shadow. Continue the story:,"

It wasn't until a couple of weeks ago when I noticed some strange shadows on the screen. I didn't really want to look at it, but then what had started out a small but annoying annoyance turned into a growing sense of dread. That's when I saw it. The dark, thick sludge. I looked back at the shadows and couldn't find any. In fact, they were all gone! Now, I started to wonder if everything was wrong.

""I've seen it before?"" I asked. Then it hit me.

""Huh?"" I said, turning back to look at the computer. Sure enough, I saw the same thing.

Of course, it wasn't just me who saw it. For some reason, the other people in the room also noticed something. So one of the three people in the room took off his mask and pointed it at the screen. ""How do you know that? It's probably not any of your business."" And with that, he got down to business. ""I got this video from three different video recording angles I tried to get off of in the other rooms. I want to be sure.""

The three people sat back down on the other floor and didn't look directly at the screen, although I could tell the rest of them did. A couple weeks later, the video got uploaded to an internet dating site. I was curious. So after I had a bit more time to think, I decided to look to see if I could find another video.

In the apartment I was in, I was sittingfoundland on the floor, leaning on the wall with one leg on the other. I was feeling pretty comfortable in the space. It was nice and warm. It felt like my back was straight against the wall and that's probably what it was. I didn't feel like running when I started to turn around, as I wasn't comfortable walking around the apartment. Maybe they could use the stairs, but I wasn't ready to climb up the back stairs. I thought about it, but decided against it. Besides, I didn't want to be stuck in that space. They had the kitchen, with the sink and everything else, and what I wanted the most was freedom from whatever the apartment had became. If I wanted to do something, I wanted to do it without feeling like they were there to make me do it. So I got up, climbed the stairs, and left the apartment.

I knew what I had to do now. I had to get them to send me the video.

To help me, I did what most people would do. I contacted them through their phone line number and told them my story.

""You need to watch this. Try to stay calm, but the best you can do is take your time and listen to everything they have to say. The most important thing is to let them tell you exactly what they think and why. If they can't, there is a chance that they may just have been joking. Make sure you don't tell them anything, even if you only heard them in an overheard conversation in the kitchen or in another bedroom. I hope this Mussolini reference wasn't obvious.""

I was about to watch the tape, but I didn't. In fact, I wanted them to watch it with me. I wanted them to see how frightened and embarrassed I was by all of this.

""Now, listen to everything they want you to do. Make sure to listen and act all calm, and don't get up and walk away. Don't stand up straight like they did. When they tell you to stand up straight, be like 'no' and back away, and then they tell you to stand up straight. That's it. As long as you didn't try to escape, you should be fine. Now, be calm and pay attention to what they are saying. If you can't tell them anything, stand up straight. If they try to make you say something different, tell them what it was. If any of them make you laugh, laugh at it. If they laugh at you, laugh back at them. If they yell, yell back at them. If they say anything else, tell them what it was and ignore it. If they yell at you, yell back at them. If they say that you can't get out, tell them that is your own choice and that you have plenty of time. What if they tell you that you can stay in the rental for two or three days if you want to? Give it a try, and you should be fine to leave your apartment and go with your friends or family.

""Now, if you notice anything differently than all of the others from what I told you when you were asked to watch the tape, you need to stand up straight. Even if it's just an inch or so. Now"

The BBC's own"
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Mentally ill inmates in Miami are housed on the ""forgotten floor"" Judge Steven Leifman says most are there as a result of ""avoidable felonies"" While CNN tours facility, patient shouts: ""I am the son of the president"" Leifman says the system is unjust and he's fighting for change."," Florida's top judge is getting heat over whether mentally ill inmates should be removed from the general population to help them get treatment CNN travels to a state facility where mentally ill inmates are held. They say they can't access basic necessities and are being treated like criminals. We are hearing an outcry over a sentence so harsh as to put an 85-year old, grandmother and a child mentally ill.

'They're not prisoners.'

'They're not prisoners.'""

And so it begins.

To a reporter's question regarding the ""forgotten floor,"" the Miami-Dade County Health Department spokesperson, Michelle Linares, tells us ""it looks like"" it's the ""oldest floor in the facility.""

It was first mentioned when we met with Leifman last October, with the reporter inquiring about the status of the ""forgotten floor.""

The Health Department is ""really, really committed"" to the mentally ill in general population, said Linares, although ""it's difficult for us to understand why people would live here,"" since prisoners are ""inmate, staff and public safety are all united in our fight to help them.""

As for the ""forgotten floor"" - in a word: ridiculous.

That's one thing that happens in ""Miami-Dade County Health."" All kinds of things.

Leifman's office, the Health Department's ""chief of outreach to all residents regardless of their mental health status,"" and our ""journalist friends"" are all talking about the floor. Everyone from local newspapers to CNN is calling.

Leifman has ""an enormous amount of power,"" said Leifman's spokesperson, and we feel ""incredibly fortunate to have him.""

So far, Leifman has not taken any action.

CNN reached out to the Health Department for comment and is awaiting an response. We'll update this post when we hear back.

Our reporter's encounter with the building's administrators was not the only time Leifman's staff spoke with us. Earlier this month, Leifman ""drew a blank stare from the press"" after we asked an official about the ""forgotten floor."" The same day, Leifman told local reporters a little about the department: ""We serve all residents regardless of their mental health status, and we're really, really committed to making sure they have access to that health care, even though it may not come as part of their sentence, so they have the opportunity to achieve good health.""

The Health Department's ""Chief of Outreach for all residents, regardless of their mental health status"" is in charge of all health services within the facility, a position that was created a few years ago, according to CNN's analysis, which found the health department spends less than a tenth of the federal budget on mental health care.

The Department of corrections spends more than three times that amount per prisoner, it turns out.

The State Correctional Institution's website, www.michigan.gov, says that all inmates housed in the Health Department facility on the ""forgotten floor"" are being evaluated for mental illness. But how are these mental health evaluations being made?

In all of her previous visits to the Health Department, Linares was told that it was the department's responsibility to make sure everyone is safe and free to make decisions on their own. But last month the Health Department told us that only six health professionals are designated to oversee the area.

Linares says she requested a meeting, but to no avail.

""If anything ever changes, I'd like them to let me know,"" says Linares. ""I feel like I'm here to tell them they're missing out on great healthcare if I'm not allowed to meet with them.""


Sgt. Michael Riddick at the Health Department, also tells Linares, that mental illness is not included in the Health Department's annual budget.

When we asked why the Health Department had this budget, Riddick says ""we're not a hospital,"" and goes on to say that the agency has no way of knowing how much inmates are spending on their medical treatment, or even how much they are actually getting.

He adds, ""There shouldn't be any restrictions on who is able to get treatment.""

But according to the latest numbers from the Florida Department of Health and Human Services, the state's inmate population in 2010, for this population, was just under 3,700 per day.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: NFL chief, Atlanta Falcons owner critical of Michael Vick's conduct. NFL suspends Falcons quarterback indefinitely without pay. Vick admits funding dogfighting operation but says he did not gamble. Vick due in federal court Monday; future in NFL remains uncertain."," (Photo: The (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal) Story Highlights A former NFL quarterback is sentenced to more than four years in prison for running a dogfight operation

Vick said he did not gamble or participate in dogfights, but was convicted by jury

Vick's father was a prominent Wilmington entrepreneur

NEWARK — Former Baltimore Ravens quarterback Michael Vick pleaded guilty Tuesday to running a dogfighting operation and was convicted by a jury on all counts.

The judge did not include in his punishment an automatic jail sentence, a condition the retired NFL star had demanded.

That means the only sentence Vick would receive would apply only if his public comments were not considered admissible in the judge's sentencing.

It was also not in Vick's best interests to accept the deal, although it included time served, probation and an additional $50,000 fine. He will be deported in one year.

Vick's attorney Robert FitzGerald read a statement from his client after the judge handed down the sentence. He said Vick has accepted responsibility for his crimes.

""If you knew Vick,"" FitzGerald said, ""you could say without a shadow of a doubt that he would have never participated in dog fights. The evidence established the contrary, and the result was that we lost not only Michael, I.P. and (puppy trainer) Mike, but all of our clients.""

FitzGerald, who spoke from the steps of the Delaware State Prison, apologized to Vick's daughter Amber and to family members who had suffered years ago, ""the most painful thing is knowing the pain. It is the most important thing.""

FitzGerald said he was disappointed Vick did not accept the deal but did not think the punishment would be that harsh.

Defense lawyers said Vick has done little to demonstrate remorse of the crime, including his refusal to admit responsibility.

""This is a plea of guilty,"" defense lawyer Paul Cassell told NJ Advance Media as he left the courthouse. ""It's nothing less than a plea of guilty.""

The Ravens released Vick, 51, in August after an independent, three-judge panel in Delaware determined that Vick's former employee, former dogfighting ring owner Michael Vick's ex-wife testified on his behalf at trial. The couple split in 2004 and he moved out of his house in the city of Wilmington.

Vick testified he paid Vick $3,000 to own what is now known as the ""Oasis of Pain,"" a dogfighting operation in Smyrna, Delaware. In 1999, Vick's then-wife, Vicki, testified she paid $5,000 to control dogs in a local dogfighting ring.

According to a report in the Wilmington Star-News, in 2007 Vick's former partner testified that Vick received $2,000 if Vick was going to be the owner of a dog and would get $500 for him if Vick was going to be the trainer. The judge sentenced Vick to four years in federal prison on Wednesday for running an illegal dogfighting ring.

Prosecutors agreed to drop most counts when Vick agreed to pay an additional $50,000 in restitution. They said Vick violated the terms of his probation when he lied to a federal law enforcement official and testified on his behalf in federal court.

The new agreement will not be formally filed until it receives the full approval of the judge.

""This matter should be resolved without prejudice, which means it can't be resurrected when it's past,"" prosecutors have said in court records.

Vick was released from federal prison in August after more than four years of hard time and is now working for a private insurance brokerage. He will not be registered as a sex offender under Delaware law so will not be required to submit to periodic drug testing, according to the Star-News report.

Vick is still awaiting appeal of a federal conviction on animal-fighting charges stemming from his time with Penn State football.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Tomas Medina Caracas was a fugitive from a U.S. drug trafficking indictment. ""El Negro Acacio"" allegedly helped manage extensive cocaine network. U.S. Justice Department indicted him in 2002. Colombian military: He was killed in an attack on a guerrilla encampment."," Other information: The death was ruled a homicide by Colombia's armed forces.

""El Negro Acacio"" was a Colombian fugitive accused of operating an extensive cocaine network. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is trying to extradite him to the U.S. to face charges of supplying cocaine to drug kingpins around the world, but he would not be a priority unless the U.S. government obtained evidence to prove his involvement in organized crime. ""El Negro Acacio"" operated a complex supplydirty drugs distribution network, with as much as $100 million in assets, said U.S. officials in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. The group's operations were facilitated by close contact -- some said ""co-instructors"" -- with drug cartels in Colombia and South America, the officials said. Officials in Colombia and neighboring Ecuador said the group was well-connected in the cities where it operated.

""El Negro Acacio"" was arrested in 2002. Authorities believe he was close to several high-level cartel figures, including his brother, who also faces charges in the U.S. He allegedly had a secret home near Cartagena and was often accompanied by armed bodyguards on his trips. U.S. officials said they believe members of El Negro Acacio's network supplied some cocaine to Cartagena-based leaders of the Medellin Cartel. The Medellin Cartel has been among the most active drug traffickers in Colombia, supplying thousands of tons of drugs in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, according to United Nations reports and government documents.

""El Negro Acacio"" was born Jose Luis Rivera Medina in El Salvador, then lived in Miami and died in a hotel, the officials said. U.S. officials said he came to the United States in 1995 and began working with other smugglers to smuggle drugs from South to North America. DEA intelligence indicates that he helped to run the network's logistics and distribution network, with as much as $100 million in assets. He allegedly helped run a large cocaine ring, which was allegedly responsible for delivering tons of cocaine to several U.S. cities. Colombian military investigators said Rivera is among the cartel's few known ""direct"" commanders in South America and their most powerful drug handler. Drug trafficking investigators also said he facilitated connections between the Colombian military and drug leaders. He also served as a commander for Pablo Escobar II, the late Pablo Escobar's brother. In addition to the U.S. charges, Rivera is also charged in at least three other U.S. drug indictments, including cases from Guatemala and Venezuela, Colombian officials said. U.S. investigators believe that cartel leaders in Colombia will pay him a large monthly salary, officials said. Colombian authorities declined to disclose what kind of salary Rivera is receiving. ""It is a significant salary,"" U.S. officials said. However, U.S. officials said he would not be a priority in the extradition process unless he can be linked with specific drug crimes. Rivera has extensive experience running the drug industry, officials said. Rivera ran his own transportation company, ""Hacienda Roca,"" and ""Alta Colombia,"" that exported drugs from Ecuador, Peru and Colombia, with a distribution network that connected some 50 Colombian cities.

""El Negro Acacio"" and a co-conspirator, Jorge Gonzalez Ramirez (pictured), ""El Negro"" is accused in U.S. court of trafficking cocaine into the U.S. and is accused in U.S. court of heroin distribution. He and Juan Ignacio Alvarez Rocha Moreno (also pictured) are accused of heroin smuggling into the U.S. in a separate indictment in U.S. court. ""El Negro Acacio"" is also accused of being a drug trafficker in Guatemala. The pair are also accused of dealing cocaine into Mexico. U.S. authorities have no direct connection between the drug trafficking case, alleged drug kingpins and cartel leaders that may be on opposite sides of the cartels' political rivalry and that might be seeking to make money in the U.S. Drug traffickers have long been accused of operating as fronts for criminal organizations and criminal activities. Authorities in Colombia have been accused of using their connection with drugs to raise money and influence.

One of the main reasons for the continued drug smuggling in the United States is the ease with which criminal enterprises can obtain guns and ammunition, officials said. ""We are dealing with trafficking across borders and borders of porousness, and there are pockets where it's very difficult,"" U.S. law enforcement officials said. ""I would say that even if [El Negro Acacio] were found to"

I have to confess that when I first heard the news of Sandy Gray's untimely death, I was not convinced, but here we are. For anyone who has not seen the video of Mayor Gray's speech in which he states, ""It's time,"" don't spend too much time on this one. The rest of this report will be about the death, so read on.

The body itself contains a clear indication of the type of cancer Gray was suffering from. When Gray was first diagnosed in late 2003, he was only a few months shy of his 36th birthday. Now, Gray is 37 and will turn 40 on August 28.

His funeral, however, is another matter altogether. He has made two plans for it. One is to be buried on Thursday, August 15, an official ""interment"" at Arlington National Cemetery. This will be the funeral planned by the Church of St. John the Evangelist of Pilsen, the Church of the Redeemer of the Dead in El Cajon, disgracefully named after the leader of Mexican revolutionaries. The other has to do with an August 21 show before a handful of high school classmates in California, just a few miles from the gravesite of Elvis Presley, during which two of Gray's fellow musicians, Joe Daniels and John Bragg, have promised to perform for Gray; both former members of the rock band, The Riveters.

In a press conference that same day, two other musicians, Bob Seger and Paul Simonon, were present. They had previously performed for Gray. They did note that Gray had talked of taking a break to go into seclusion, and that he did not seem all that serious when he was described by several journalists at the time. What was not reported was that Gray seemed to be having fun.

A few weeks before Gray was diagnosed with lymphoma, Gray appeared on the show A Shot in the Dark on ABC in California, where he was seen singing and talking about his childhood, while playing guitar and making music with his friends and bandmates; it was one of the few live shows in recent memory which went better than a movie had. One critic described it as ""one of those great musical oddities that people remember but seldom really talk about.""

It is a shame to waste much of the public's attention in so insignificant a matter, but Gray's wishes were honored.

I was told by two men who had known Gray for years that he was doing well from the cancer therapy he received, and that when Gray stopped getting treatment, his pain went away, with good results. After he had finished, they said, he went to his favorite spot in Pilsen, a tiny, well-kept room at the corner of Broadway and North Sixth Avenues that has become a kind of memorial to the music and life he had, from time to time (sometimes for weeks) played, including The Riveter in its heyday.

For years the room was used as an impromptu stage for the band's gigs; the stage was put up by Gray's band, not the church or any other body, according to the men who had known the man and known his artistry. Today, the room has its own door marked ""Gray Room,"" and even a marker is attached to the door. The church has given the space away to a musician who had a talent for singing and playing the guitar, and the artist who used the room for shows that he was not able to do in the church.

Gray is from Long Beach, California, but he had grown up in Santa Clarita, where he taught elementary school in a church where the teachers had been very generous with his tuition. He used to spend nights in his mother's basement when he was in school and then take bus rides to show up late and have a beer with friends on the bus. This was a form of entertainment in those days: he could play a violin or a banjo, or any instrument, while other kids talked for hours and he could be the only one there. He had already written his own song by the age of 15, called ""The Last Song You Ever Loved,"" which is now being covered in a country band called the Bakersfield Boys by John Mellencamp. By the time Gray became a teen, his love of radio-controlled cars was quite strong. He was so serious about his use of them that his mother, Joan Gray, was worried about her son having been too much involved with them.

It was a life that Gray lived, in the way that a child is supposed to live in a place where his parent or grandparents live. This has not been a very kind life for him. For most of his"

Write a news article based on the following summary: President Bush to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Wednesday. Bush to say that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists. Speech will be latest White House attempt to try to reframe the debate over Iraq.,"

On Saturday, White House spokesman Scott McClellan repeated that Bush would address the veterans' group if it came asking for a meeting. But, McClellan said, ""Our job is to bring together people from a variety of backgrounds, give them a sense of what this administration stands for and what our approach is.""

The Associated Press on Friday reported that members of the veterans' group wanted to meet with Bush. The group did not give a reason why, the AP quoted members as saying.

In a statement issued late Friday, the White House called the veterans' request ""a welcome change from the administration's tone regarding the debate over the war in Iraq.""

At the time, the U.S. military had withdrawn its troops from Vietnam and it appeared that it was time to move on to ""the peacekeeping missions that were essential in achieving the historic objective of ending that conflict,"" said the statement from the Defense Department.

The administration of former President Jimmy Carter had also planned to spend Friday outside Washington, but in recent weeks it has been unable to come to an agreement with Congress on how much funding it will need to continue its military presence in Afghanistan, the AP reported.

According to the National Vietnam Veterans Association, of 1.4 million veterans in the United States, the number of men who served in Vietnam in the Vietnam War is now estimated at 784,000, of whom nearly 80 percent died or were wounded. It said on Friday that the number of veterans who died since the Vietnam War ended in 1973 is now estimated at 6,950, and more than 8,000 continue to suffer from serious complications due to exposure to Agent Orange.

Although few in the White House said Friday that Obama would attend the veterans' event, in recent days administration officials, including National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, have attempted to assure the general public that the president is supportive of a policy that seeks to end the war in Iraq, and he has said that the U.S. needs to continue its current military presence in that region of the world, the AP reported.

""This is the most important national security event in the United States since the World War II,"" Rice was quoted as saying. Other senior officials and experts said Friday that Obama's approach would probably include remarks on Afghanistan, as well.

On Thursday, Obama said that he did not wish to withdraw troops ""withdrawal"" from the Middle East. But he said that he was concerned about continuing the war in Afghanistan, which had gone from a brief war in 2001 to the longest military operation in the region in 2008.

""I do think mobilization of the international community to put pressure on al Qaeda and related groups to end their efforts, their violence is important, that's why I decided I wanted to make sure that we didn't do that by withdrawing our military,"" Obama told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

While the White House is seeking to draw a distinction between the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan, senior officials have acknowledged that they may not get to that point until President Bush leaves office.

The president was scheduled to be in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, but had said that he would not attend the event, the AP wrote, and he would not be traveling to Texas, Ohio and Kentucky. The president had originally planned to deliver a speech to the National Governors Association meeting while in Austin.

""It's a tough business, and even the president needs some rest, but I know you can get through that pretty fast,"" said a participant in Friday's meeting at the White House.

It's probably going to blow the door off of Germany, where a number of top internationals have turned down inherent riches for the opportunity to become the next big star in Europe. The trend is expected to continue until 2016 with an estimated seven potential stars of the future, according to a study published last year by The Economist. All the top three countries, Germany, England and France, also have an estimated two new top-level stars a year, according to the study.

The big draw in England is the English Football Association, which represents 20% of national income and makes a massive, direct contribution to the country's revenue thanks to ticket proceeds generated through the Premier League and the rights for the England national football team.

The German FA could never afford to lose the rights to an individual star player. Only a minority of top-level stars move to the big leagues, and those that do often struggle financially and in terms of form. The Ana Kourtis-led Brazilian national team is a perfect example of why. The midfielder has become the most expensive German star in recent history, with Bayern Munich putting a massive $25 million on the table for his international switch last year before he moved to Inter Milan for a reported €65 million.

At the top end of the European game, the big names move to Europe with their teams, leaving the lesser-known players, including the likes of Yacouba Sylla in France and Bruno Martins Indi in Italy, at a serious disadvantage. Despite these drawbacks, Germany still has more homegrown stars than any other country in the world.

A lot of those players are still at a very young age and the Bundesliga is the only big European league where young players are allowed to sign their first professional contracts. There are only two restrictions on signings: one that doesn't allow clubs to sign players below the age of 16, and another that forces young players to sit out for a certain number of pre-set games to avoid disciplinary action.

The Bundesliga still has the most high-profile players on European transfer windows thanks to the World Cup of 2010 and 2011. But it needs to do more to encourage clubs to sign more homegrown players, who can provide the Bundesliga with a significant boost on both their league and their national team. The country's federation says that only four to five of its 18-and-under teams have registered a player from outside Germany in either of the last two World Cups. That should go up to 25 to 30 teams by the time qualification rolls around in 2016.

At the end of last year, the German Football League approved financial support from football's global governing body, FIFA, for football academies around the world that take their young players from within Fulham's academy. The first academy in the world to receive such a backing was the Spanish academy system.

Fulham's academy has developed two players in the last year to go to FIFA's U-17 World Cup in Jamaica in 2013. Their first-ever U-20s player came through the academy and is still with his local club, Espanyol. The academy produced both a U.S. youth national team player and an England Under-19 national team player, but the club has not had the same success with its first-ever professional players from the academy.

Fulham are likely to take the next big step forward next season, in part thanks to the success achieved in developing their homegrown stars, and in part due to the recent U.K. government's decision to increase the number of clubs allowed to own and operate youth teams by 20% each. These plans will likely attract even more clubs, not only from England but also from France, the United States and Japan.

The German Bundesliga's biggest clubs aren't getting along quite as smoothly as their rivals might think. BVB and Hannover don't seem to be able to work together any more, while the rest of the giants are stuck in riffs or feuds with their local rivals.

A recent example came when BVB were denied access to the German World Cup squad because of conflict over the club's local rivals, Wolfsburg. The clubs had also agreed in 2010 on the establishment of a joint youth development plan covering the two countries.

Wolfsburg coach Roger Schmidt had worked closely with the BVB coach, Franz Beckenbauer, during his first spell at the club. Beckenbauer helped put together Beckenbauer's last coaching post in Germany to help the Bavarian national team reach the European Championship semi-finals in 1996. Schmidt was put in charge when the club were relegated from the Bundesliga in 1997, but resigned a few months earlier because of concerns about Wolfsburg's financial"

President Bush To Have Colosupium Scanned


WASHINGTON -- President Bush is scheduled to undergo a routine colonoscopy today that will transfer his powers from his vice president to his doctor, according to government officials.


The medical procedure - in which the president's bowel movement will be surgically separated from that of his vice president - is also expected to resolve a dispute between the president and his advisers about his health.


The procedure is part of a series of operations that will remove Mr Conduct, a White House physician who has long defended Mr Bush against charges that he has had health problems.


The colonoscopy will occur at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Beverly Hills. It was ordered this week after a physician there noted that the president was suffering from a high fever that would require a fast-moving ambulance.


Mr Conduct told The New York Times that he never discussed the issue with the president before the appointment, nor did the White House counsel decide to invite him to take the exam.


""Mr Bush never mentioned this to me in any way - either to me in person or otherwise,"" Mr Conduct said. ""And that's why I think it was the right thing to do."" Mr Conduct said that he has never been aware that anyone outside the White House had sought his permission to examine the president. Mr conduct said he was never informed that Mr Bush would undergo the procedure.


Mr Bush has had three previous colonoscopies, performed by a team at the Mayo Clinic. The president's last was in September 2003, which found no problems.


A spokeswoman for Mr Bush declined to comment on his health and the circumstances surrounding the colonoscopy. ""Our president does not discuss health status and is not currently scheduled to attend any part of the annual physical,"" said Jacqueline Keating Haddow.


When President Bush was first elected president, he said he could not wait to be re-elected. Mr Bush is likely to turn to the medical specialists who are advising him. Such specialists tend to be more conservative political appointees, in line with the way the health care system functions in the United States.


Most presidential administrations have the vice president, who is responsible for the personal, clerical or other chores of the president. In the case of Mr Bush, there are about 50 vice presidents, although several were confirmed by the Senate. Mr Bush normally has a series of private health examinations with surgeons before he travels abroad, which is why he has been seen in Europe, Australia and New Zealand in recent months.


The new procedure does not involve removing any part of the president's bowel, said Dr Michael K. DeLuca, chairman of the department of surgery at the UCLA Medical Center who will operate on the president.


Mr Bush and he doctor, David Brown, had a conversation in private during lunch about whether there had been a recent episode of diarrhea and whether the president should have a colostomy bag or colostomy bag and what it would cost, Dr DeLuca said.


After the lunch, Mr Bush left Mr Brown's office for the time being. As the president and his doctor talked on their walk, the doctor brought to their attention that the president had a fever. The president responded, ""I didn't say, 'I have a fever.'""


At the White House, the president and his doctor had a more substantive discussion about the subject of colonoscopy. ""He was open to it,"" Mr DeLuca said. ""It wasn't a big deal for him anyway.""


It is also not clear what kind of bowel condition might be in effect. Mr Bush's doctor, Dr David Brown, said Mr Bush grossed out for several hours as a result of the stool-forming colonoscopy that he underwent in"
Write a news article based on the following summary: President Bush says he and first lady are deeply saddened by the tragedy. Mine Safety and Health Administration chief: We've run out of options. The six men have been trapped underground since August 6. Seven bore holes drilled into the mountain have found no signs of life.," One hole has been cut in the ice, but no one has been inside the hole since the accident. This has caused a massive loss of ice, snow, and sea ice. Some ice has turned to water. And ice is only partially frozen. The rescues are being done by climbers using a technique that has become very popular lately. On July 6th, the climbers climbed the ice to the top and carried the water with them. It was nearly too late. We can only keep working until the water drains and the ice solidifies. You can only carry a fraction of the volume of water needed for them. In some places, they had to take the ice down with them, even though it was too dangerous to do so. When the water freezes, the rocks and the ice are pulled down on top from below by the force of the water. It is a slow process, but one that the rescuers are using to their advantage. We may find ourselves working for a long time. The rescue workers face many challenges. They must rescue climbers who are afraid to face the cold. They must find a way to open these huge ice blocks to the surface to carry out the water. Some of the climbers are injured and will likely need to be airlifted to the hospital. They cannot be saved if they do not bring themselves into the ice. This is very sad to see. The ice has to be cleared from the mountain, and it is too dangerous to do so through the climbing. This is the worst possible place for them to be trapped. At the moment, most of the climbers do not want to go back into the mountain, and some do not want to get out until things have stabilized. The most popular option is to stay until it solidifies and then cross over to safety. It is the only one left where the mountain is not on fire. It takes two to three days in order to get there using all the ice. You can hardly imagine the danger faced by the climbers. They were all strong enough to withstand it. Yet we must try to save as many as we can. I cannot do it on my own. There are too many other peopletermination teams and volunteers. I have called on your help in vain. Help us stop this catastrophe. Help us find a solution. And most of all, help us save these brave men. Our hearts are in pain. We are all praying and asking for your love and respect. By President Bush Becoming aware of the tragedy and the plight of the men was a difficult, but necessary reminder to President Bush that his administration is dealing with the worst natural disaster in American history. It is one that could have just as easily killed the President. And the circumstances of a rescue operation can be tragic even when the rescuers do not realize it: In this instance, the rescuers knew very quickly what had to be done to rescue the men. They already knew what they had to do. However, they could not believe they had to try to do it from below, as if in a movie. They believed that the men were trapped by the massive volume of water that had poured down from above. They believed that if they got through that, they would be in good shape. On July 7th the President spoke at the White House, calling the operation ""a job worthy of our great men and women in uniform."" It was a hard blow to the nation's confidence in the safety of the armed forces, where the men are the most trusted and trusted partners of the President. The President was criticized for not doing more. However, he had given the National Guard's chief of staff the authority to make these decisions—as he often did. The most important part of the President's address was to explain why this rescue operation was necessary. President Bush stated that: President Bush's Administration will work with both the National Guard and the Rescue Workers' Administration to develop a plan for the rescue effort over the next three days...to prevent the situation from becoming more dangerous. President Bush announced that he has ordered the Air Force and the Coast Guard to increase search and rescue personnel and equipment in the affected areas.... The President stressed that efforts to rescue the men are not going to be rushed or to take place without all the necessary information, land, weather, and the needs of the rescue operations before they began, and to protect the safety of the men and preserve the mountain. The rescue operation will be carried out in five parts, from the north to the south, starting at the highest point from Base Camp 2 and working west and south. The first part of the operation begins at about 10 P.M. (Eastern Standard time) today. Since the operation begins at 0800 to 1100 this evening, the men's families will"

Write a news article based on the following summary: Savers at leading UK mortgage bank lined up to empty their accounts. Northern Rock was bailed out by the Bank of England a day earlier. Reassurances that banks was safe have gone unheeded by many.,"

Analysis

An article on BBC News claims a bank chief has been fired as it emerges the chief executive of Northern Rock has been charged with eight financial offences. According to a document Buck, who was appointed chief executive by Lloyds Bank last year, was under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. When questioned by the BBC, Buck stated he had ""done nothing wrong"".

The BBC alleges the bank gave information to the FSA, which led to his dismissal and the introduction of a special measure which required Lloyds Bank workers and others to apply for an individual account with the bank. The Financial Conduct Authority took over investigations of the matter in June 2014 and made a file public in June 2015 (which later was reviewed by the FSA). Its details include allegations of misconduct by the CEO and two board members (Gwynnie Evans and David Craggs) at the bank. However the article implies the Chief Executive was ousted over a single case - a matter already investigated by the FSA and by the Financial Conduct Authority. To put it simply the BBC is reporting that, in a single week in June 2014, Buck was investigated by the FSA, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), a regulator in the UK and the FCA.

So there is nothing illegal happening at a bank. The BBC is saying the charges were ""investigated"". The SFO is investigating other senior bankers at the bank and will,brings up other cases of misconduct.

The BBC's article fails to mention the fact that, as the BBC writes; the investigations by the SFO do not require that the staff be accused of any wrongdoing on their own behalf, instead the cases were to be referred to a ""professional standards unit"". This is important to mention. If allegations of wrongdoing are not investigated they have no Americas on their record and as you can see, that has its downside. If they are investigated and found to have done nothing wrong, then the staff who went through all that stress would have nothing to show for their hard work. If they are found guilty of abusing their position they would become the butt of many a joke on social media.

The piece also states; the SFO says the investigation related to ""misconduct or other breaches of the law and involved allegations of misconduct"", but there have already been ""multiple appeals by Mr Buck since being placed under investigation"". The article makes no mention of that. The BBC article says: ""The charges against Mr Buck, a former executive at Lloyds Bank, were detailed in a document from the Serious Fraud Office that was obtained by the BBC..."" So, according to the BBC, while the SFO is not investigating, they are not ruling it out.

Bank of England governor socio Carney to head for US in 2016. Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, to take up a new job in the US, according to reports. Carney has been reported to be under consideration to head the Federal Reserve when Janet Yellen steps down. The governor will be an independent director, but the Bank of England is responsible for appointing people to the chairmanship. Carney, 62, has long been an advocate for increased interest rates, believing they have helped spur the economy. However last month Carney told MPs that some central banks were losing touch with their central message because they had become 'too dependent on the economy and too fearful of it'.

On Wednesday, a BBC article said that a bank chief was being fired over misconduct. This was based on a file from the Serious Fraud Office concerning bank boss Robert Buck. The Financial Conduct Authority received the complaint from Lloyds Bank.

A man is accused of trying to bring a nuclear filter to a foreign agent. Oakley appeared in court this week, after surrendering. Oakley worked at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, in charge of shipping decommissioned equipment out of the site. He was accused in a US court of selling the parts to China.

He is also charged with a third-degree federal felony in Tennessee for transporting a nuclear bomb to a person outside of the United States. In a court appearance Thursday, Oakley was charged with four counts: attempting to ship a nuclear weapon to a foreign country, possession of a destructive device or explosive material, possession of a small destructive device and attempting to import a weapon of mass destruction. His trial could take place as soon as late November. While Oakley tried to sell parts to Iran last year, he told the US state department that the part sold to China had been ordered. It was returned after Oakley was caught. He had been indicted earlier this week, and is expected to be arraigned Nov. 28. ""Those parts have been destroyed,"" the US attorney's office in Nashville said in court. It was unclear how Oakley had gotten the filter. According to an indictment, between the time he arrived in South Carolina in 2009, and in January, he was in contact with Iranian officials. In 2010, he had agreed to ship the ""material"" — which included ""high voltage"" cables — to Iran.

Oakley was also in ""an ongoing conspiracy to bring a weapon of mass destruction into the United States,"" according to the federal criminal complaint. He had planned to deliver parts for the new centrifuges at the Savannah River and Savannah River facilities to a person outside of the United States, the indictment said. Oakley's defense attorney, Bruce Braley, declined to comment. The US Attorney's office declined comment on the charges. While the charges against Oakley include attempts to bring a nuclear weapon into a foreign country, their exact wording is unclear. ""Defendants have agreed to plead guilty to the allegations that they illegally traveled to Iran, allegedly sold parts to an Iranian and attempted to import the materials for an Iranian bomb,"" a federal statement said. The Department of Justice did not respond to a question about whether it will seek to charge other alleged accomplices, but it previously has said that the investigation was ongoing and an indictment is pending. Oakley is one of nine individuals indicted in connection with a $1-billion-a-year deal with Iran to buy centrifuges. The Justice Department has called the deal a ""defeat for us,"" and has demanded a complete accounting of how the deal was executed."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Organ shortage in rich states has created a trade from poorer countries. ""Transplant tourists"" travel to poor countries to buy organs from the desperate. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is legal, is turning into a ""kidney bazaar"" Patients pay $8,500 for a new kidney, while donors are paid just $300 to $1,000."," The organ market is thriving, even amid high unemployment - up 16.5% in Pakistan.

""It was an overwhelming experience,"" says Dr. Muhammad Khan, a kidney transplant specialist in Islamabad, who took part in six operations while operating on the most recent batch of four patients. ""People come with lots of money, and a lot of hope."" Dr. Khan says there are now enough patients in Pakistan to satisfy the demand for kidney transplants for two to three years. ""The need is rising every day,"" he says.

While most people in Pakistan view trade through the limited lens of Western media coverage, few are in the know about the world of international organ trade. The largest single organ market, according to U.N. estimates, is Nepal, where trade in kidneys and other tissue is estimated at $100 billion. And the United States alone estimates that the human body provides about $100 billion worth of medicine annually—more than double the gross domestic product of Pakistan.

Most people in the region have never heard of the transplant industry: The average recipient is just 23 years old, and only 15% had ever been in a hospital. The vast majority of international organ transplants, according to U.N. estimates, occur in places where the laws permitting organ trade are strict. (The laws are typically made possible by the growing use of international treaties that allow countries to ban organs to those who are believed to be on the most-wanted lists, even if it means closing their borders.)

Uruguay says it now has 3,000 kidney transplants a year and is trying to set up a national system of organ transplant centers, but its progress has been painfully slow. With one center in Brazil and another near Los Angeles, the program has yet to begin operating, but the Uruguayan government says it expects to receive about $10 million in annual donations from private and public donors by next year.

There aren't enough donors to fill all of the needs of the country's 10,000 transplant patients, so many people with kidney failure will often live on dialysis for up to four months to keep the disease from destroying their kidneys. Because of the shortage of donors, there are also less hospitals that specialize in transplantation. In 2013, the average number of transplant hospitals in the Americas was 458, the U.N. reported. The number of international organ transplant centers in the Americas—including those in Costa Rica, Costa Rica, and Mexico—dropped from 1,534 in 2008 to 826 in 2013.

The U.N. estimates that Pakistan's annual budget for kidney and other tissue donations is $16.3 million. U.S. and Pakistani officials argue that Pakistan's international aid, its ability to persuade countries to limit trade in human organs, and its growing economy should offset any costs that result from increasing demand from wealthy nations. But according to a recent UN report, a decade of steady decline has resulted in an annual increase in global debt of $1.3 billion.

Some Pakistanis say that the trade has benefited the country's poorest population—the majority of the region's kidney recipients are women and children—but they also say that the profit of transplant tourism has run out even before their kids reach puberty and most adults don't have enough money to pay for drugs at local clinics.

""How will we pay for all this?"" ask many poor people interviewed by National Public Radio. ""It's not the people who get it, but society, because they do.""

Uruguay, one of the many nations with relatively limited trade in organs, is exploring a new system: In 2015, Uruguay's Department of Health started selling human organs via a nonprofit medical organization and from other countries, including the United States."

The article must cite sources who say the following:

-- Blackwater had been under investigation for years by the Justice Department, under President Bush.

-- In an internal email obtained by ABC News, three top Blackwater officials were urged to ""reassess"" their security policies at the time they were considering paying Blackwater to provide security for foreign affairs meetings. At the time, the two top Blackwater officials wanted to use the company's Blackwater security firm, with an annual security budget of $800,000, instead of their own personal security company, known as Academi, with a slightly lower annual cost of $750,000. Academi, which had an $80 million contract to provide security at the 2004 Republican party's national convention, ended up with contracts with the CIA and State Department.

-- Blackwater officials told ABC News they were ""thrilled"" that the administration approved their request and continued to do business with the United States government.

-- In late 2012, White House press secretary Jay Carney said it was ""time for Blackwater"" to ""step back from doing work for the U.S. government."" Carney's comments came after a former Blackwater contractor, Erik Prince, was arrested in Prince's secret Panama City, Fla., home. Prince left Blackwater in May 2013.

-- The government investigation led by the inspector general's office at the Department of Defense ""was looking into some areas where we are not satisfied with the response and some areas where we are satisfied with the response,"" Carney said.

-- The Senate Committee on Homeland Security released a report on Oct. 5 that said Blackwater performed ""serious business violations under the law."" That report said Blackwater ""offered fraudulent work experience to its employees"" and did not report ""employee deaths."" The company also fired or otherwise failed to keep all of its security guards properly trained and qualified and did not supervise them, the Senate report said.

""All three of these investigations were carried out by Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation investigators,"" said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, at the press briefing, explaining why ""The New York Times took the position that no more than two employees were killed at (the) compound and then they claimed, that was not true, there were more than two.""

When asked if Obama had asked for evidence about Blackwater's practices, Coburn said he ""could only speculate."" He said, ""It is certainly true that the president did ask for some of the same information, and at the very least, a lot of these questions, particularly in the context of the (Iraq) invasion were asked."""

Founded by Marine Le Pen in 1995 with the merger of the Party of Europe (PES), a French member of the European Parliament, and the National Front (FN) (NF), in 1999, the FN is a conservative and eurosceptic political party based on the political and economic ideas proposed by Le Pen, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, and her husband Mathias Cluzel.

The FN holds a minority position in the National Assembly, although it controls half the seats, and has almost 40 MEPs and parliamentary deputies. It has been accused by other parties for violating European law and of having received funds from foreign powers.

In September 2008, the main opposition to the party in the National Assembly, the Liberals (UMP), had filed a complaint against the FN. While the National Assembly approved motions in favour of giving it a seat, the Parliament of the General Government condemned the motion as ""a blatant violation of the Constitution"". On February 25, 2009, the ruling ""Union of Democratic Forces"" passed a motion, ""To expel the National Front for racism, xenophobia, antisemitism, or homophobia"". The decision was taken at a time when the National Front was polling at less than 20%.

The National Front is a member of the European Parliament and in 2012, it was able to make a major breakthrough in France's presidential run-off election when a first round of polls, which gave Sarkozy the presidency, showed the National Front as a loser. The party campaigned hard in the election on anti-immigration platform, and received 10% of the vote. The second round polls will decide who will be elected next year.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Several famous songs written by men for a woman. Beethoven's ""Für Elise"" may have been written ""for Therese"" Songwriters make up stories about who is behind ""867-5309/Jenny"""," by using words from the lyrics, and are known for inventing and then spreading ""the story"" of the ""867-5309/Jenny"" song. In the early 18th century, a young German poet called Johann Sebastian Bach wrote a story about an old man who was a womanizer and took up residence in the attic of a house. Her servant told him of a pair of horses outside that looked just like a man named ""Ikkei Jansen"" (Ike and Jenny). He was certain that they were ""Jenny"" and thus they were his ""Jenny."" This idea of a jenny is a common theme in stories about sex, and a jane has a certain look, feel, and personality (e.g., the maid in ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is a jane (as are the chimneys in ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"").

In the 20th century, the phenomenon had a few variations in different forms. Most popular was the sexualized jane for a lady. In this case, the jane portrayed the hero as being in desperate士. One of the most famous versions, though, was based on the works of a French poet. In it, Louis Bonacieux, one of the most famous artists of the late 18th century, created a jane for a man, named J-I-S-E and a girl, named J-Ie-S-E. The story was ""Jenny"" was the name of a girl who lived in the attic of a house. Once the jane had found out who was the man, he went around telling people to take the jane to the next best house. One day, he called out ""Ike and Jenny, open the attic door!"" They ran in, opened the door, and found themselves in a hot tub! It was so cute they wanted to leave, but the jane put a ring on his finger, telling him that he should never forget her. The jane was never heard from again. This may MDMAJ, but it may also be based on a jane of an older period (e.g., the ""chimneys"" in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland ) or a new one (e.g., ""Ike and Jenny"" was made for a boy, ""Ike and Jenny"" for a girl) There was also a popular story where a jane was hired by a guy named ""Ike"" who liked to take off his jeans a lot for his wife, so the jane was given a rubber ducky to ride and would have a little fun. But after a few times the jane was jealous and threatened to kill the ducky, which would then explode. There may also be a jane that is sexually attracted to the husband, but will lie about it. Janes can also be sex partners themselves.

There have been many other janes, including the ones based on the myth of the witch or of a young girl being turned into a witch. In French, the name of the jane, sometimes known as a jane de dix, is a corruption of ""J-Ie-S-E."" Many myths are based on janes, making it unclear if the term actually means anything like the name of the person being jane'd or whether they are not called janes.

Another popular jane was the jane-a-mole, a cute little female-named monster which had all of the characteristics of a female jane except for the fact that she was a mole.

Pregnancy janes are quite common. Sometimes, they are female or the jane-a-mole may be a male. The jane may be a girl (known as a selvage) or a boy.

Riding janes (sometimes called janes brennektes) are like riding mules; they are often female.

Janes go missing sometimes. If a person can't find a jane soon enough, they may turn to witch hunts or even murder.

People have invented, Prompted by a Thought (PGTM) jane (or jane-a-mole), a type of jane that appears to be in good health when it's not. The subject might think the jane is healthy while really it hasn't had a meal since the last.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Amount almost double what was spent in 2004 election cycle. Lower TV production costs help more candidates advertise. Mitt Romney leads presidential candidates in TV spending. Advertisers face challenge of cutting through clutter of ads, analyst says.","

Advertisement


How did we get to this point?

It's easy enough to attribute some of this spending spree to Mitt Romney's campaign strategy: He was a clear and present threat to Barack Obama in 2004 because of his strong showing in the early voting states. But the evidence suggests the candidate himself wasn't particularly strong on TV advertising until around the same time.

After this year's elections, we are going to look at what we can learn about how ad spending actually affects a campaign.

By examining what ads run in what states and the ways television companies manage them, we can more properly judge the relative impact and spending on each candidate. But we can also see how TV ad purchases are made and what the implications are for the candidates themselves as the campaign enters the final weeks.

Advertisement


What's more, we can help guide election officials about what ads they make available for broadcast and in early voting. In the latter, media companies are prohibited from running negative ads that aren't ""fair and balanced.""

Here's how TV spending has grown

As of Jan. 1, 2013, TV ad spending had more than doubled per candidate since 2004. The total is greater than $50 billion per cycle—nearly twice as much as in 2008. Ad spending is expected to increase next year.

All three of Obama's challengers--Democrat Senator Scott Brown, Republican Governor Charlie Baker, and Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte--have been heavily criticized for spending excessively on television ads. This may not come as a surprise to anyone who followed the 2004 presidential race, but it is worth remembering that these candidates—especially Brown—brought great risk to the race.

Brent Budowsky was an aide to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and former Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.), who was chief deputy majority whip of the U.S. House of Representatives. He holds an LL.M. degree in international financial law from the London School of Economics. Contact him at brentbbi@webtv.net.

The most effective way to spend millions to buy TV ads is through a company called AdRoll. It's a company that owns nearly all the television advertising in the U.S., and it's the company that the companies that own AdRoll all rely on to distribute and manage their advertising. AdRoll and its associated TV buys are reported every day to Wall Street analysts, so analysts know precisely where the money is going.

AdRoll charges the candidates money based on the amount of time that candidates spend doing campaign ads. The campaign itself sends the company the same amount of money every day, but the candidate uses AdRoll's software to distribute it to the company's clients, and it uses AdRoll to sort it out for them. The client pays AdRoll based on the candidate's ad time, but AdRoll's software, which is designed to sort the ads based on its own research, also sends the actual amount of money to the candidate.

So, for instance, if you pay Obama $500,000 in campaign expenditures he had no role in choosing, AdRoll is paid $500,000 every day, but AdRoll sends the money to him. AdRoll receives 10 percent of that sum, plus a small fee for the use of its software, and a return on that investment—that is, what it would have made if the $500,000 had been spent on itself. Romney would only see 5 percent of his campaign expenses go to himself. (Romney does get a percentage of the money he spends in New York state TV ad buys.)

How TV money matters on the first and final day

AdRoll's primary role is to make sure the ad dollars reach, and stay at, the right candidate. It decides who gets the money—not the candidate—and the number of ad stations that get the money. It has some real-world experience. It helped Hillary Clinton run a multimillion dollar digital operation in 2008, but by 2012 it had closed that operation entirely. The company's clients can pay the company more than $50 million and get the money back immediately. (They can't sell that money for another year, however, just as they can't sell the company its own ads for the upcoming election.)

How much better can the TV industry be as compared to Internet advertising?

For one thing, it was easier for an ad shop to set up a network of TV stations. That's what Yahoo, Microsoft, AOL, Facebook, and Google are doing: Each of them have a large number of TV stations that can handle TV ad buys on their behalf. All those firms have tried to emulate"

Your headline or abstract should describe the content of the current article, rather than describe an extreme circumstance as something out of the ordinary. To write a headline, ask yourself the following four questions: 1. What is the significance of the event? If the event is dramatic, use the words ""explosive"" or ""fiery"", ""high-profile"" ""major"" or ""historic."" A lot of stories of major wars are, in fact, dramatic, dramatic events. Most are written about as events on the news, and rarely in the abstract.

Is the event dramatic? If the event is non-catastrophic (the death toll is unknown) use ""unexpected.""

Is the event non-catastrophic? If the event is catastrophic (the death toll is known) use ""extremely significant.""

To use the word ""fiery,"" ask yourself: Is it dramatic? The phrase ""firework"" is no longer used in newspapers, and the word is seldom used in other contexts because, for most readers, fireworks don't have dramatic significance. They are a kind of fireworks, and often no more dramatic than fireworks.

The phrase ""firework"" is no longer used in newspapers, and the word is seldom used in other contexts because, for most readers, fireworks don't have dramatic significance. They are a kind of fireworks, and often no more dramatic than fireworks. How is this event likely to impact the world? Is it likely to be seen or heard by a large number of people?

Is it likely to be seen or heard by a large number of people? Why is the situation unfolding today? Ask yourself:

Does this situation represent the last chance for any remaining people in the world to escape genocide?

Does this situation represent the last chance for any remaining people in the world to escape genocide? What other historical, political and economic events have happened before or since? How is this relevant to what today's news is going to be?

What other historical, political and economic events have happened before or since? How is this relevant to what today's news is going to be? How should I write about this event? For example: the U.N. reports the deaths of nearly 100 persons in the air crash at King Khalid International Airport in Bangkok. This is not a surprise to the news media because many of the passengers were Saudis (it is believed they were passengers of the same plane to which the plane that crashed last November was originally scheduled to fly), but does it seem too significant to be written about in a headline? It should be discussed in background stories. Also, if the passengers and crew were foreigners, it is not appropriate to report on their nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality. Foreigners are not the only foreigners affected in this way; people traveling from other countries to Thailand are also likely to be affected in the future (see the page about refugees and immigration).

For example: The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has confirmed that five Americans were among the victims. This is extremely significant, but does it seem to be beyond the realm of news.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on ""Sicko"" Gupta's report questions some of the movie's numbers and solutions. Gupta: ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that"""," Moore responded: ""Yeah, it's a good movie, but I'm still not quite sure about the methodology that you used and the conclusions you reached. I think you were getting the facts wrong, and I'm a little disturbed that you said I was wrong""


The transcript:


CNN Chief Medical Correspondent on CNN Chief Medical Correspondent on CNN ""Sicko,"" Alisyn Camerota (CNN, 4/30/2005): This is CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Alisyn Camerota. Alisyn Camerota: ""I have been asked by the producers of Sicko to analyze and report on the film that I have been looking at, and I don't know much but I'm very happy to do it.""


Moore, in his letter to the producers of the film, appears to be accusing Camerota of ""confusing the two different methods and interpretations of the facts and conclusions I made about the film.


Moore: ""I think you were getting the facts wrong, and I'm a little disturbed that you said I was wrong.""


CNN has provided multiple requests for comment from Moore and Camerota, but so far, there have been none.


In other words, Moore is suggesting that the film is somehow a ""factual or technical distortion"" on his part. In reality, it is more likely that the film is an example of some kind of miscommunication between Moore and Camerota.


The real issue here, as Camerota herself notes, is on the production of ""Sicko."" It does not matter whether or not the numbers provided by Gupta on MSNBC are accurate. The basic premise of the story is faulty.


Moore wrote on his website for CNN: ""I agree with CNN that the film is not entirely reliable as a factual basis for public policy.""


Moore has not provided any evidence supporting his assertion that ""Sicko"" is completely unreliable.


Moore's statement, however, is untrue. As the MSNBC report notes, ""Sicko"" has not been evaluated by any scientific organizations, and it is not at all likely that that evaluation would come at the hands of a scientific organization. In fact, ""Sicko"" has not been evaluated by any of the world's major scientific organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal Society. In his interview on MSNBC on March 27, Gupta provided some statistics from a 1999 study by George Mason University's International Center for Public Health and Climate Change, and the ""Sickow"" producers appear to have made similar errors in their methodology. The report notes that those figures and conclusions are presented in the movie, but does not mention those errors on CNN's site. The study that CNN uses can be found at: http://www.gmu.edu/~georggren/sicko.html. Anotherclubmember, John Hsu of the Georgia Institute of Technology, was critical of the movie, suggesting that Moore was misleading by saying that the methodology had been ""rigorously"" verified.


The producers of ""Sicko"" are also incorrect when they say that they were not paid to conduct the study by a ""public health organization."" As a spokesperson for the Georgia Institute of Technology says: ""I was not paid for anything in terms of the study that I did with Mr. Hsu and other partners. We were not asked for any money. In fact, a public health organization, I believe it was, paid for the project. That is a fact.""


Moore's article is also at fault if he says, with the implication that CNN paid Gupta: ""CNN News' editorial standards require it to obtain permission from contributors before including their names on stories based on their perspectives."" In fact, Moore's article says, with the implication that CNN is somehow wrong: ""CNN News' standards require it to obtain permission from contributors before including their names on stories based on their viewpoints."" The article provides no examples of ""CNN News' standards"" that would lead the producers of ""Sicko"" to use a particular name on the article. Moore has yet to provide any examples of the principles that govern the use of a name on a story.


The producers of ""Sicko"" are also incorrect when they say: ""Gupta is a physician who is concerned about the health effects of heavy metal toxicity... Gupta, a physician, was the head of the toxicology unit of a New Jersey hospital and has a history of using scientific evidence in his public campaigns, which is part of my background.""


Gupta has no history of using scientific evidence in public campaigns or in being involved in public health campaigns. As the Georgia Tech professor who did the 1998"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: India elects first female president, official results show Saturday. Pratibha Patil's supporters are calling victory a boost for women's rights. Bitter election campaign was marked by scandal. 72-year-old Patil was the ruling coalition's nominee for mainly ceremonial post.","

In her first major public comment on the result of a fiercely fought vote, the first lady called the ""results of an honest vote"" and congratulated the election commission and the opposition party for rejecting a government proposal to increase voter turnout.

""The results of an honest vote by people are what is best for the country,"" Patil told reporters on the flight from Amritsar to New Delhi via New York, where she would have to attend a White House dinner.

The first lady, who is married and has four grown-uponda sons and two grandchildren, is expected to attend the party on Oct. 20.

Patil, who has been in office since 2001, has become a symbol of India's democratic reforms, which swept from the Congress party to her Bharatiya Janata Party at the 2013 general election.

""I thank [government President] Pranab Mukherjee and his administration. People of India should be proud because here we have a woman who has taken her seat as the president. It is a very important achievement,"" Patil said during a short news conference aboard the flight, which left Delhi at 6:15 p.m. ET Sunday. [nL1N13C17X]

Voting was conducted Saturday after the electoral commission called off voting after some of the 8.5 million votes cast in the election were invalid. The commission also recommended a decrease in voter turnout in the second and final round due discriminate voter intentions, not including those from people who vote for the opposition.

""The government is committed to making India a more democratic place and this is something the government would be looking forward to working for,"" Patil said, adding it is ""sad we cannot go forward with this democratic journey and more than 1,00 crore people who voted today have not been able to go home.""

Patil said democracy needs ""enlightened, honest"" citizens and ""those who work every day for the betterment of our nation.""

Patching up: Aboard the flight home, Patil told reporters she had not met the President-elect but said ""he is a very straightforward person and talks in his own language.""

""I hope he will make India happy through his policies,"" Patil said.

""He promised people that he will bring development, increase jobs, change the situation of women and also create more jobs in the country. I am very pleased for him, but he needs to make good decisions,"" she acknowledged.

Some analysts say President-elect Modi may be able to follow through on some of the promises of his campaign.

""He has a lot of room in his Cabinet to implement some of his ideas,"" P. Sreenivasan, economic policy expert at IHS Global Insight, a London-based research firm, told CNN.

But, he cautioned, a vote for Modi is not a vote for democracy.

Modi, 70, won the election by a huge margin in Gujarat, the state he led before joining the BJP. In a post-mortem of the election on Saturday, government has accused his opponents of staging a ""massive conspiracy"" and ""collusion"" to destroy the BJP.

""Even in the final calculations, we have to accept that the opposition did not lose the elections,"" Modi told reporters in the city of Kolkata where he was meeting the Chinese premier. ""If the opposition won by an overwhelming margin based on their participation, they will win by using that to obstruct our programme and we do not have any other alternative.""

His opponent Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) candidates, who have been battling it out for years the race to be the next prime minister of India, have been accused of rigging the election, or of giving false replies and votes in a disproportionate number of areas.

As we noted in the wake of Katrina in 2005, and the recent devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, we are in trouble if we don't take extreme actions to save lives. And if there is a chance that a flood event like Sandy can happen again, then we have to take every possible measure to insure that the lives they're saving are saved. Fortunately for us, they are."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Chadian president wants journalists, flight crew released. Red Cross, UNICEF, UNHCR interview children that charity tried to fly out of Chad. Most are not from Sudan and have families, agencies say. Six members of Zoe's Ark, 11 others under arrest in Chad.","

In another case: The international NGO Human Rights Watch and an UN investigative team seized an aid convoy carrying 20,000 children between Chad and Gabon. The convoy made several attempts to get out of Chad before the officials in Chad blocked the convoy and refused to allow it to leave and, one official said, ""refused to take them. So we drove them on foot, we carried on and on, into Gabon."" They were detained by the authorities at a ""safe house"" where they stayed, for several days. When they were finally able to fly back to Chad, the team reported that the children ""have no school attendance, work with limited literacy, are not able to read letters and have limited English ability. Some are seriously malnourished and have lost their eyesight."" After a year the Chadian government eventually released all of the children.

The Chadian government ""is trying to put pressure on us to accept asylum, or to leave. We are in our country, we are legal residents. We don't need any refugee status. We are Chadian, Chad's country — we are Chad,"" said Jaffar Chindouneh, who was arrested with his brother-in-law, and other children at the time. ""It's impossible for us to go back and live in Chad after hearing them, so they want us all to go to Syria. One of my brothers was there when the soldiers were torturing civilians in Deraa.""

The Chadian government ""has a lot of control now,"" said Chindouneh's father. ""They have arrested and threatened us all. The only way out for us is for the international community to show solidarity with us.""

The United Nations Human Rights Council has ""highlighted the appalling plight of the Chadian children, describing their suffering and stating that they 'have suffered unimaginable horrors at the hands of their state government' and that 'a culture of impunity has taken hold to such an extent that, in some cases, the United Nations has found it inappropriate to register the accounts.' There was general outrage, with the UN Security Council urging 'urgent action' to'stop inhumane practices and to ensure children are not treated in this way,"" the report stated, adding that the Council, in ""unusually robust support for the children,"" called for an investigation into abuses against ""children as young as nine years old.""

In this time of conflict, the Chadian government is also ""repeating the same dangerous policies it used in Darfur before 2012,"" Human Rights Watch said. ""The government of Chad has been repeatedly and actively undermining the international rule of law in this part of the world. It is no surprise why the government of Chad is now cracking down on an effort to aid refugees."""
Write a news article based on the following summary: Earth has warmed one degree in past 100 years. Majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise. Some critics say planets often in periods of warming or cooling.," More on warming below.


""Climates change, yes. It's the way the planets work,"" said Marcia McNutt, a meteorologist based in Virginia Beach, Virginia, who is one of the three authors of the article. ""But what is the science behind it? That's what's going to change in this new era.""

McNutt and colleagues write that the climate models used by climate-skeptics cannot provide any compelling evidence that greenhouse gases are responsible.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that greenhouse-gas emissions are responsible for a decline in warming on Earth caused by the natural variation in the sun's energy, the Earth's tilt and the amount of ice at the poles. ""The average surface temperature changes that the IPCC models show is caused by natural variations and cannot be attributed to emission of greenhouse gases,"" the authors write.

However, the scientists have also reported that more than 99 percent of peer-reviewed studies published in the last 12 years show ""there was no detectable (increased in recent decades) warming over the 20th century.""

""What we have shown is that the IPCC has been grossly overstating the rate and magnitude of climate change,"" McNutt said in a telephone interview. ""It is not only wrong, but it's irresponsible and dangerous.""

The scientists said the Earth has warmed more than 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, the same time that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere tripled - and their data indicate it is caused primarily by human activity. ""So if you're talking about the causes of the warming, we've discovered none.""

The scientists' article also states that ""the scientific literature suggests that the amount of warming over the past century has been small - perhaps under half a degree Fahrenheit (0.2 degrees Celsius) – and probably due to natural variations.""

The experts cited a study released Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( airport, Washington - D.C. ) that finds the oceans are warming at a rate of only ""about 1.9 millimeters (0.08 inches) per decade - which is less than half the rate of the Earth's total rise in temperature during the past 1,000 years.""

The paper, called ""No signal for global temperature change,"" is based on a review of 1,700 years of temperatures and sea level records from around the world, using sea-level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While the warming rate has likely increased over the past century, it is still ""barely measurable and very likely to be less than.4 inches (1.3 centimeters),"" said NOAA scientist Stephen Halpern.

The review found ""no evidence that global temperature trends over the past century have been unusually high."" And sea levels in the last 1,000 years have increased about 0.07 inches (0.3 centimeters) and risen about four inches (1 meter) since 1900, the review concludes.

Scientists at the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ), the premier scientific society for earth scientists, wrote in a review published Wednesday that it is ""impossible to attribute the warming trend since 1979 to human emissions of greenhouse gases.""

Scientists report Tuesday a record-breaking streak started about 15 years ago where the Earth's average temperature has shot up more than half a degree Celsius, and scientists and researchers said the warming trend is continuing.

Many experts are now saying the warming trend is caused by natural changes and has nothing to do with human activity – or that such changes will reverse in coming years as a result of climate policies that would slow greenhouse gasses."

The second thing an observer in the Middle East can do is look at how Iraq is going -- and see what is wrong and what is right. In December, a study by the RAND Corporation found that Iraq's economic problems and poor governance were driving up unemployment and corruption and that Iraqi security had not markedly improved since the summer of 2007. In a July interview with a French newspaper, Mr. Bush made it clear that he did not take the report seriously: ""I haven't seen it; I have no information.""

This may be a case where the president and his chief domestic critics got the facts wrong about the Iraqi economy. But the fact is that Iraqis are poor; they lack access to the services and goods that Americans take for granted. Their joblessness rate -- 6.5 percent, according to the United Nations -- is double the rate of the United States. And the Bush administration has failed to build a strong and credible economy. This is where Mr. Barak comes into his own. He is convinced that Iraq, through its oil reserves, could become a major regional power.

In any case, Iraq has not shown that it can be the kind of powerhouse that has helped revive the moribund economies of South Korea and Greece: there, economic growth has reached 1.8 percent, compared to the 5.9 percent average in Iraq.

If Mr. Bush was still president, he might start a diplomatic diplomatic operation to persuade a more enlightened international community to get rid of sanctions that have hurt Iraq while allowing Iran and North Korea to continue to export weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. This could change the calculus for all Americans. One American-led effort to bring about more democratic change in China might also end up being more effective than the one Mr. Bush started.

But Mr. Bush is not the president -- and neither are American presidents. American presidents are given latitude in their own countries to make decisions on how and when to make them about their own countries. So when the president in 2007 decided to abandon Saddam Hussein's policy of strategic ambiguity, he also broke his own rule: that the United States make a decision only once it has determined that a leader is trying to do the one thing that matters to the United States: wage an aggressive foreign policy. And Mr. Bush found no such leader. For example, in recent months the United States has publicly opposed a new offensive by Palestinian gunmen into Israel that Israeli officials said would be welcomed by militants in the Gaza Strip.

Moreover, to be a good president you have to make a lot of difficult decisions. Mr. Bush didn't, and he wasn't the best president to make them. In December 2005, he decided to invade Iraq, which would have made him the worst president ever to lead the war and put America on a path to permanent war.

And yet he was elected."

"Write a news article based on the following summary: President Musharraf orders troops to take a television station's equipment. Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan says he's under house arrest. President Musharraf says his actions are for the good of the country. White House calls Musharraf's emergency declaration ""disappointing"""," and ""extremely unusual"" (he says he won't be visiting the U.S. to discuss the situation). The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad releases a statement saying that ""President Musharraf is a democratically elected leader of Pakistan and Pakistan's long international reputation was directly affected by his decision.""

What happens: A presidential emergency declaration allows the president to take emergency action against threats to the nation's security, without a vote of Congress. The president's orders are to be carried out by the Armed Forces of Pakistan (AFP), which has a very high level of authority (since it's the government).

What's the current status: The president has issued orders to dispatch military units (called ""Special Action Force"" or ""SAF"") to the capital, Islamabad. Musharraf believes his actions will be for the good of the country and the U.S. (since he's been under house arrest since September 26th). President Musharraf says he will not be visiting the U.S. to discuss the situation. The Anthropology Department of Deoband University, in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, has issued a moratorium on the anthropology department's students visiting the U.S.

What can we expect in the near future: The status quo on the ground has not changed, which is why you can probably expect Obama to make comments about it at the next international conference on terrorism. As of now, there are many questions about the legality, scope, and purpose of President Musharraf's actions, and it's safe to say the U.S. is not on board with the fact that no legal action, no matter how well-intentioned is currently being taken against him. We'll probably see the next step a little more frequently."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Robert A. Singer is accused of e-mailing child porn to 12-year-old girl. 12-year-old girl was actually undercover New York City detective. Singer was identified in court document as National Children's Museum spokesman. Washington museum officials say they are ""horrified"" by the charges."," A New York child protection squad said the alleged crimes occurred at the National Children's Museum in the city. On Wednesday, the Washington museum said it hired a criminal law firm to represent the museum against Singer. Washington museum officials say the allegations were first reported Monday in the New York Post. The museum, which says it educates children in a variety of fields, was not immediately available for an interview on Wednesday. The museum referred the Guardian to its lawyer, who said Singer, who is the director of its ""Children's Museum"" and an expert on social work, was immediately suspended from the museum. The New York Post's report, extraordinary for the newspaper's position on child sex abuse, was swiftly picked up by other American media. ""An investigation at an independent museum has uncovered inappropriate e-mails sent between a child sex abuse investigator employed by the National Children's Museum and 12-year-old girls who were undercover detectives working undercover to protect children,"" the article, which was written by freelance newspaper reporter Michael Isikoff, said on its website

Isikoff said the e-mail scandal could implicate ""at any one point a number of very powerful individuals in the United States"". It is not yet clear if authorities in New York have opened a criminal investigation regarding the matter. The New York district attorney's office told NBC News this morning: ""We do not have anything.... Not our business.""

Isikoff said he had made contact with the mother of one of the 12-year-old girls involved in the scandal, a victim who did not wish to be identified. He said the investigation was an ongoing case that could implicate ""at any one point a number of very powerful individuals in the United States. We don't have any indication that this is directly linked to New York, but you know, it's something that just happens to hit New York. It's not a big deal, but this was reported in New York. It is very, very big.""

The Associated Press said the girl's mother, a mother who has spoken to the Guardian, wanted to remain anonymous. ""My daughter doesn't want to talk, she doesn't want to tell anything,"" she said. It is not known if the child was sent pictures on her cell phone, nor if any pictures were sent without the parent's permission and sent to the undercover detective by the museum. Singer said he did not have control over the child pornography.

""In no way would I want my child to feel uncomfortable doing anything that has a sexual nature to it,"" he told the AP. ""I know this is not a crime of morals and you're trying to paint myself as something terrible."" Singer is an internationally renown and prolific author, former president and coeditor of the Penguin Children's Book Award-winning Penguin Children's Book Review and the recipient of the MacArthur Foundation's ""genius grant"" award. He said he did not know what the scandal was about. ""I know the parents, the community, the museum,"" he said, adding: ""You do what you have to do."" A spokesman for the Washington museum said: ""We are deeply concerned that sexual abuse of children of any age exists at our National Children's Museum.

""We have worked closely with law enforcement for a long time, and we take reports of abuse seriously. We have been working closely with our legal counsel for much of the last two weeks.

""We have notified a criminal law firm to conduct a serious investigation and are cooperating fully with that investigation. However, we had no involvement in any of this until we heard of these allegations from the New York Post. We are very sorry that this happened and we will thoroughly investigate these allegations.""

The Guardian had received a letter of complaint from an unnamed complainant – referred to in court documents as Victim No1 – to the New York civil division, which filed the criminal complaint on Monday. The letter states that Victim No1 sent a series of ""suspicious messages"" to a 12-year-old girl at the museum in New York from February to February this year, and that the victim, now in her early teens, had ""been a victim of child pornography"". She was a child sex abuse investigator at the New York museum.

According to the complaint, Victim No1 discovered that a child abuse investigator using the name of the New York museum, is a ""pedophile with child pornography collection and pornography."" The woman, who has a previous connection to the family of a prominent Washington charity, has since been identified as the New York museum's ""child sex abuse investigative specialist.""

There was one item from the list of 10 to get. A few other items from the list went up into the spotlight this week; some got passed around the news on Friday as well. It also turned the tide on the debate of whether we are in fact still living in a primitive past. Let's go over the items that got a boost, and give each one its own spot on the list.

10. An old lady who tried the method of making apple tarts

Another item from the list that made it in for at least some attention was one from a couple of years ago. This time, it was a woman who was trying to replicate a method using fruit to give her kids a summer treat to snack on rather than something like dried berries or pine nuts.

It turned out to be more than a little tricky, even for those who already knew what to do.

I thought so too:

For starters, the fact that it requires some fruit-puncturing and a few others that can make it a ""tough"" process makes it not very suitable for a ""real"" homemade treat for kids.

In fact, this was something of a failure for a lot of parents. One guy in particular took it to such extremes that he came up with a totally bizarre food mix he calls ""My Fruit Pelt,"" and it became a Facebook page.

9. A way to keep mosquitoes away in a summer

That one on the list of things that would benefit those who live in an area where mosquitoes or other diseases have the ability to get between humans and plants. The method that involves using cotton balls and an inflatable net on a person's head is pretty easy.

And who couldn't use the same method to help them stay out of trouble in their summer home?

I haven't heard of someone trying this method for years, but an Australian guy made it a success, telling a blog post today why he thought it is so useful.

8. A tool to make a garden

We had a cool idea for how to use our spare time (the majority of it goes straight into buying organic produce) but it fell just short of getting into the spotlight this week. This one that is just kind of funny to write because it's a bit more of a tool for gardening so doesn't feel like it needs the attention that other gardening items get.

I liked it, too:

The fact that a simple gardening tool like a rake, spade and shovel can be used with such efficiency to get a garden in a hurry was worth mentioning (I mean, we already have our tools, just let us use them).

7. A simple tool to wash your hands

One of the less talked about items on the list was a tool that could be very useful for everyone. It's a simple piece of wood and doesn't take very long to make, but it goes very fast. It has two uses and both are of concern for those on a diet of salad greens. The most common cause of food poisoning has nothing to do with your food and everything to do with our stomachs.

It has two uses: one is that you can use it to wash your hands and remove all the germs. ThereROth a good video of those two uses if you're looking for more information. Meanwhile, the second is to clean your hair.

I'm no 'war on terror,' just a pro-secrecy bill

In fact, the ACLU's Ben Wizner believes that the Bush Administration may have violated the American tradition of due process by refusing to meet with Mukasey's staff in response to the release of their report on torture. Wizner's conclusion is that the ""torture report"" which Mukasey's staff released appears to be a ""sham,"" ""incompatible with the rule of law,"" or something that simply makes those who were involved in torture and the Bush Administration look bad.

We must stop talking about torture and start thinking about who was involved

The Bush Administration, a small group of politicians with interests to protect, and a few high-level officials with national security secrets who didn't think their actions were ""torture"" felt it was acceptable to break the laws of war on national security grounds. They broke our laws and lied about it. Then they used those broken laws to prevent the disclosure of their activities, their lie about the legality of their actions, and the details of their lies.

We lost our liberty, and it will take a constitutional crisis for us to reclaim it

We've already lost too many in these wars. We need to learn to come together to understand the need to defend ourselves. And while we do that, we need to remember that we'll always have to look at the fact that we didn't stop the wars the way we were invited to, but that doesn't mean we can't be grateful we aren't just as destroyed as the enemies of liberty we are fighting. We'll be asking ourselves how, in the 21st century, and in a nation that cares about human rights, and liberty, and justice, the way we handle the issue of torture in the future has evolved from the way it was handled during the Cold War.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Orme, Tennessee, has running water from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Town's spring ran dry in midst of Southeast drought. Donated water is trucked in from Alabama. Completion of pipeline will solve problem for good."," (Source: Wikipedia)

The ""problem"" that's occurring is a large-scale distribution of rainwater over a large area of land, not unlike the ""Great Lakes"" problem they've been fighting for the last few decades. That problem is in the Great Lakes basin, not in the Tennessee River ""dry zone"".

It wasn't supposed to start that way. The land that was wet and getting rain was always supposed to dry up as the river and its tributaries dried up and filled it in—a situation which many farmers in the Mid-Atlantic, who don't see ""the Great Lakes"" as part of their land are getting used to, have called ""laissez-faire"" or ""laissez-dire"" rather than ""laissez-verite"". The land that was wet and getting water from somewhere was supposed to dry up as the river and its tributaries dried up and filled it in. At the moment these ""laissez-faire"" farmers can see this drying up in Georgia and Alabama, as well as in parts of the Carolinas.


The Great Lakes are not in New England—not yet, at least.

If the land was wet and getting water, people would be able to move over the entire East Coast in a week, like people do now for winter and spring. Or water wouldn't be so expensive to move as it is now.

We'd get more snow days out of the Great Lakes than we have now.

If the land was wet and getting water, New Englanders would stop leaving New York for Canada before spring.

The drought isn't caused by the Great Lakes.

That's a good point. The drought isn't the fault of the Great Lakes.

At least a portion of the drought is the fault of human-driven warming, which is having a far greater impact than the Great Lakes. The drought isn't caused by the weather out west, like I thought it would be.

The lack of drought

We're currently missing a major chunk of the drought in the Midwest.

The region's water systems need to take much more of our energy and water in the water they produce. Which is very different from the ""Laissez Verez"" farmers in Alabama and Georgia who get all their water the traditional way. Instead of trucks or ships, they are pumping water directly into their basins.

I have trouble picturing the ""laissez-faire"" farmers in Georgia and Alabama who didn't see it coming.

I'll let others point to specific examples of crops or animals that are missing. That's important because we can learn a lot from those specific examples. For instance with tomatoes, just as with many other crops, a very big driver of the total water going into the tomato is the water entering and evaporating off the vines on the vine that need to be pruned and planted into the ground instead of being shipped somewhere as tomatoes are now.

For example, I'm looking at a good example of a recent phenomenon in Kentucky. I'll give the big picture. If we're moving water into Kentucky on railcars (a different, but related, approach) then the crops they're bringing in could have a water footprint that is over three times larger than they were before. That's just a simple example. Water is going into Kentucky for a number of reasons — the lack of rain last month or the recent drought — but because we're moving it into the soil, the ""loose"" soil and not the sandy loam that we're used to, it means we are using about 10 times as much water.

While there's nothing wrong with that particular example, it illustrates the point that some crops and parts of farms are getting more water than they used to (from whatever source). There isn't going to be a drought this year in Kentucky, unless the entire state gets completely dry again. Then it will, at that point, be a bigger problem than it was in the beginning (we won't get any more rain, at least in Kentucky.)

I can see what's happening in New England now: We don't get much rain except on the East Coast, a lot of that coming down south in the Southeast. It would probably dry up enough for crops by next year (and probably rain again, though we need to be worried about what comes down in the coming months. We know the Gulf of Mexico Leafworm will be a big threat. Just last year they killed over 1,500 sheep in New York and New Jersey. That is going to be a big problem after we stop using the"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: ""Wine Library TV"" Internet show has about 40,000 regular viewers. Show takes irreverent look at wine business. Wine consumption has risen in United States for last 15 years."," If one can make a decent living from wine or restaurant businesses, it is possible to develop a career.

Get a TV production budget of $2,500. $2,500 is enough to pay for $700 of equipment, plus $200 per month for a producer's fee — and $300 for time.

Invest your own money — $2,500. You can set up a website, buy software on WordPress, and then launch your show. You can hire a writer, an actor, a producer, and various other people to produce the show at your expense. You can hire a videographer, sound technician, camera operator and the rest of the crew, for $700 per month. You should then use that $700 to pay for a camera or sound system, if necessary.

Make sure your cast consists of a reasonable proportion of people who drink wine with a serious attitude. Everyone has certain prejudices against people who smoke weed. If we put that aside, how much is it worth to tell a character that ""it's ok, Ihaar Kaur was a smoker""?

Make your trailer sound as if it's a home movie made using professional video editing applications.

Re-edit your trailer to feature the right people in the right setting. This can also involve editing the scene where Kaur drinks from its glass.

Research the industry of wine and restaurant management — this is also very important. Check the profiles of these people on the web, which is not too hard.

You are looking at about $75,000. You can take some vacation for 1-2 months, before renewing your contract, or renewing the existing one (this doesn't have to be the same person).

If you go for a second producer, you need to choose one who has sufficient experience and know-how. You also need 1 or 2 people who have shown exceptional success to prove their worth at this stage.

If you go for a third producer, you will need a lot of money for equipment, which is expensive. If you manage to raise this amount, your new show will become even better.

Don't worry if this will cost you a lot more than if you had just worked independently. You won't get rich from it, but there will have been investment and your show will be better prepared for next season.

You should know the following:

Your subject matters will differ significantly from the pilot.

Don't go for people who have been on a TV show for a long time or are known to be big personalities or people who can produce a big budget project.

Try not to go for people who can produce more popular shows, but only if they have very good knowledge of the industry and can present it in a very entertaining way.

The production costs will escalate over time and as your production becomes bigger and bigger, so will your budget.

A good approach is to divide your budget into 6 months.

Start from $1,100, and increase the number of episodes by 2 (or 3, etc…) for the next 2 months."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Survivors of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh waiting for aid to arrive. Red Crescent Society official says deaths could rise to 5,000-10,000. Bangladeshi president distributes aid; angry survivors go empty-handed. Thousands remain missing; estimated 280,000 homeless.","

The editors and authors of these accounts are, like most other journalists, too poor and too ignorant to get the story.

Here's the problem: The world is moving too slow to help Bangladesh. We have spent six years under three successive governments and have largely given up trying. We're too busy laughing and crying and trying to figure out where to put our energies for another year or two—while our neighbours are suffering through the worst natural disaster ever to strike them.

Many thousands of children have drowned in the flood waters, too. They drowned because as soon as the waters receded, the local authorities moved the bodies. There are not enough schools and hospitals in the most affected areas. The United Nations agency that is managing relief efforts is understaffed, overwhelmed by requests for help. The emergency assistance office in the country hasn't even been set up yet, not even though it's meant to be by 2015 (a year later than originally projected).

No matter how bad the disaster is, we don't know whether it would be worse, because you don't move from one disaster to the next with the same level of experience.

On December 11, the government reported that it was still managing 100,000 people trapped in the Red Cross' camps, despite receiving 1.23 million relief materials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and World Food Programme. In that case, of course, no one saw it coming. The only people doing any work were officials, NGOs and local authorities.

In the most recent case, the Red Cross admitted that it had not been able to deliver the most basic supplies because it was running out of money—a total of over $200 million.

That disaster is far from over. The floods have already killed five hundred people, but that's not something you hear about in the news. You can tell it's happening to Bangladesh by the way the people of the country are reacting.

On January 17, around noon, a crowd of people gathered in the central business district, all chanting, ""We want jobs, we want government, we want bread, we want health, we want housing."" The women gathered there were holding two sheets of white cloth, to be used as masks and for washing clothes. The men were carrying the same bundle and sat on it. ""The government must not let another disaster hit us,"" they chanted.

That was a lot of people for two hours. Then someone came with a bag of rice and sugar. Then, at the behest of the crowd, the crowd was split into two groups. ""These are volunteers from the National Emergency Management Agency,"" said Dhaka Metropolitan Police police chief S.K. Mishra. They were given the bags, and were going down a hill to distribute them. He told me a woman came up to him with her three young children. ""I wish you won't come home so drunk!"" she screamed.

The government has said that two people have died of drowning at the height of the disaster, and I'd say the chances of them being drowned again with hundreds of others on the ground is very low.

And then there's this scene last week in Dhaka:

I woke up this afternoon to find the sea still out of sight as darkness fell. I walked up the beach, past the sand and into the waters. The shore looked barren. I walked for several minutes until I came to a small body of water that looked like it was almost filled with boats. In front of me lay a single dinghy, its engines burning fiercely. Two people were lying on top of it. The others were waving desperately with sticks that they used to help propel the dinghy over the surface, as they struggled to remain afloat. As I reached them, the whole family of eleven, plus three women and one child, had become trapped. Their faces were blackened by the heat of the flames. A young woman had been burnt very badly. Her body was wrapped in her clothes. The other six, including a toddler, appeared badly burned as well. The other three, including a pregnant woman and three-year-old child, were still alive. I put my arm through an opening in the sand and dragged them on deck. They looked very exhausted, in pain and scared, but I didn't want to get them too tired. At the front of the dinghy sat a man in his late thirties. He had a very deep voice and was dressed in white pyjamas and a loose yellow shirt. He held a stick and was trying to hold the others to the boat with one arm. In the next moment, the dinghy started to rise quickly and"

The story includes:

• The U.S. Embassy Baku website was offline for several hours. The embassy's general secretary, Tommie Tovar, said the Internet access was restored at 5:05 p.m. Baku time. The U.S. Embassy in Paris said it was aware of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad reporting a suspicious item at its embassy complex. Security officers immediately went to the area to ascertain the item's source after an alert was sounded. The website was back online about 6:10 p.m. Baku time, the U.S. Embassy said.

• The United States Embassy in Baghdad said it is reviewing surveillance video of an apparently armed man who was seen at a construction site on the corner of Baghdad's Ithaca Road and Al-Khodai Street shortly after 4 p.m. on March 5, a day after the U.S.-led coalition stopped Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, in Iraq. Police said they received multiple reports of the apparent armed suspect's presence at the construction site about a half hour before security forces were alerted. The man was last seen getting into a vehicle. A witness reported spotting a man matching the description of the man in the security footage on the roof of a building about 15 blocks away. Police said they recovered the suspect's gun from the vehicle.

• A U.S. embassy official says the FBI is handling the FBI's investigation into the Baku post-election embassy attack. A senior law enforcement official said it is ongoing and officials do not know at this time whether a group has coordinated the attempt against the embassy.

Police said they've recovered the assailant's vehicle, a white Kia Soul in Mosul which was found near a gas station in southern Baghdad.

The vehicle's license plate had been cut off and authorities had no way of determining its name. The vehicle has been used several times for surveillance, in addition to the earlier use as a vehicle to store weapons and explosives, said Lt. Gen. Yahya Rasool, chief of the police's Baghdad Operations Unit.

The incident occurred the day after the coalition pulled back troops from Iraq to protect embassy operations there. It was the fourth time since 2009 that there had been large-scale U.S. military presence at the embassy complex.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Gloss taking backseat to bold colors in lipsticks. Exfoliate lips before applying a bold hue. Melissa Silver: ""Anyone can wear plum or sheer red"" at night. AJ Crimson likes subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones for day."," The trend for high pigmentation in lipsticks is growing, and many of them are now bolder, but there's still an absence of a great black lipstick shade on the market.

Blink-182: ""All shades will have this high shimmery look"" – no word on a formula change yet – lip color with a sheer, high gloss finish?

""Nude with a hint of black""– how long has it been since lipsticks have been able to say, ""All shades will have this high shimmery look""? If it's been an era of lipsticks that have been ""not even-close"" to having that look then this new formula is more than likely a start.

Lavender and plum color-changing glosses: I love plum lipstick, so I'm not sure what those two terms mean here, as well, but there's a trend going on where these glosses make deep color changes without a glossy finish, and I'm thinking it probably involves a matte finish that creates a color change. One of my current favorites is this metallic gold with a pink undertone. ""Blush & black"" in the Lipstick Club has a shimmery pink hue and a bright, saturated blue-orange, although it's only $6. I don't think the formula has changed or anything, so if I'm going to wait until the new packaging comes out then I would really be hoping it happens. I like the Lipstick Club formula, and I do hope it does just get more colors.

Pantone Universe: Pantone has finally released a set of color changing lipsticks, and I really like some of them, although their color changing formula is pretty awful. I loved the color Ruby, a bright and vibrant yellow-black with hints of green. It had a really soft feel to it, and a more subtle red undertone, but it was really boring and boring in just about every way. I can't imagine this colour will work for anyone other than me (a Ruby addict) and I don't really see where a deep color would be successful outside of that base.

Pink and lime: I love green so this pink and lime lip color is a no-brainer. The new formula and packaging are really nice too, I'd love for Pantone to start a ""Pink Velvet"" lipstick campaign.

Pinky and pale pink: This is the lipstick I'm most excited for, and because I'd like to be able to wear pink lipsticks everyday without really worrying if they're the right shade, this is a great candidate. The matte-pink formula is very pig 53 though, and I do wish it didn't dry to the touch, but it is probably just too pigmented, so that's something I'd probably prefer over a matte or shimmer finish in my collection.

Pinkish pink: So this is another color I want to try because I think it has a very interesting shift to it, similar to a very wearable pink color, but this one's more of a sheer peach with a touch of beige. It's supposed to wear to lip color as matte but not quite as sheer, so I can see where this is being worn to deepen the color of the color on my lips to make it stand out.

Taupe-ish-orange: Another favorite! I know, it's a shade I already have in my collection, but for some reason I've got this color stuck in my head because the formula is the same as that of our beloved BK Beauty brand. I think it would work so well for a lighter, cool lip color if that weren't an issue in the future. There's a lot going on, even at 5% per application to dry the lips, you'd never notice.

Taupe-ish yellow: This was my second choice, but I'm also curious about how the formula will be packaged for long-term wear. With browns and purples in my collection, it just feels more natural to wear one shade of lipstick on my lips. If you are able to wear the same shade on your lips two or three times, maybe the formula is just a little thinner, I want to be able to wear it with a lip liner or even gloss, and I want to be able to look good without a glossy/matte finish on my lips, so this color seems like it could be a dream.

I am so, so, so excited to try out this collection. As a general rule, I like pink lipsticks over black lips because I like the way it reflects the light, it's harder to look washed out without a lot of contrast (if you"

A lot of people think the American Association of Museums is a museum. In fact, when you go through their site you'll find that it is a whole host of arts and crafts organizations that share the common goal and a few common names: The American Institute of Philatelists, the American Institute for Historical Archaeology, and the American Museum of Natural History, to come up with the list. The ""AAM"" stands for AAM is America, and Museums for America. But the association is actually a coalition of 15 states and two cities, as well as the United Church of Christ and some smaller, non-Museums for America non-profits. The American Historical Association of Museums is called the American Institute of Archaeology, the American Museum of Natural History is called the American Museum of Natural History, and the local museums are called the local museums. In each state and in each city the museums are separate legal entities, but they play a central role in the overall mission of the city or town that they are in. These are not separate museums. They are really the people of the local town who want a good show.

Many people assume that because many of these museums are located in towns or in cities with a lot of people of different ethnicities, they can't just have fun with all those different museums. People like to think that museums can be ""local"" and ""local museum"" and not so much a cultural product in itself—this makes sense, since when people came to the United States they wanted a good show. After all, why visit your local college dorm room when you could see the local art history museum? And the cities of Philadelphia and New Orleans have hundreds of cultural institutions, even though very few of them are local. People like museums for an experience, not as a way of life.

But no city with more than 40,000 people has more than one, perhaps because the historical institutions themselves have different communities. In Chicago, for instance, some museums (the agent for which is the Illinois Cultural Heritage Agency) have more than one community in which it is located. Other historical-museums have a different museum for each individual community. For a moment, consider the relationship between the US Museum of Natural History and the Chicago National Gallery. The museum is in the same building as the gallery, and they both serve different museums. They also have local communities in which they are located—the Illinois Cultural Heritage Foundation for the Chicago National Gallery and the Ohio Historical Society for the National Museum. This relationship is not the same for museums nationwide; in California some museums are located in a district office and some are in one or more districts, and they are all within walking distance. The reason museums tend to follow a similar pattern is partly because all of these museums are members of the American Association of Museums.

So if the historical-museum-as-entertainment-organization-is-a-nonentity notion is wrong, why do people go to all of these museums when they can't get to their local museums? And what would a ""national museums"" look like? Are there more than 50? Not all museums are the same size, so what about the number of ""local"" ones?

In a paper presented at the meeting ""Museums as Community Engagements"" in August, the historian David G. Kline of the New York Museum of Art suggested that the way museums look at an environment is not about the number of people, but also about the kinds of people who use and interact with them (and how), and the kinds of things they tell stories about in the spaces across the museum (they make art; stories can be about art; we have stories we want to tell that we can get out of the museum). It gets more sophisticated from there, and it's at the kind of thing the American Association of Museums has done for years: it hosts events like National Storytelling Week, ""Museum Night,"" and the exhibition ""Muse: National Stories About the Museums"" which explores the variety of stories told about the cultural institutions in each of the country's 50 states or the District of Columbia. The events are actually open to all of the organizations in the association, but since people only spend time at a museum once, and many museum patrons only see a museum once, they are probably only going to see the stories of a variety of groups and not focus on how the stories"

Two people with minor injuries are in critical condition.

Six people, including four students, were killed Friday night at an apartment party at a residential complex in Columbia, authorities said.

South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said Saturday in a statement that, unlike previous mass shootings, the house appeared to be targeted.

""It was probably a house of worship, most likely just a prayer meeting,"" Haley said in the statement.

Haley said officials did not suspect ""any particular motive"" for the shooting, noting that no additional suspects had been arrested.

Some students and faculty said they were saddened by the news.

The Kurdish Regional Government's security forces arrested three members of an al-Qaeda branch in Iraqi Kurdistan, state-controlled Iraqi Islamic Media Office (MNA) reported on Thursday.

The MNA said in a statement, ""The detention of two members of Islamic Jihad group, from the city of Tal Afar, was announced by the security forces on February 9 at 4:40 in the morning to prevent them from making suicide acts against the security forces.""

Tal Afar is north of Kirkuk and its outskirts include Sunni territories that have been under Kurdish control since 2004. The town is also held by Iraqi security forces.

Al-Qaeda is the name of an organization that was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in 1996.

Also on Thursday, Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Saturday declared victory for Iraq's forces in their campaign against the Islamic State group there over the past week.

Abadi said in a televised address that Iraqi security forces ""have regained the initiative in the battles with [IS] terrorists,"" referring to the self-proclaimed Islamic State group by its Arabic acronym.

""With regard to the fight against them, God willing, we will prevail,"" he said.

On Wednesday, troops recaptured the second largest village to fall under IS control in western Anbar province.

The IS militants had occupied the village of Bashiqa on Monday and continued moving from one area to another as they advanced toward Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, on Thursday and on Friday.

Sporadic clashes erupted along the road between Bashiqa and western Anbar on Saturday, and the U.S.-led coalition flew airstrikes against IS targets in the area.

Iraqi forces are still waiting for reinforcements to take back Mosul, and a second push on the IS-held city could begin as early as next week, if all goes as planned.

Sporadically, the IS militants have been advancing south, toward the city of Fallujah, further west.

As many as 450,000 civilians remain trapped in Fallujah as the offensive winds down, with little chance of escape or release.

Meanwhile, hundreds of ISIS fighters are on the offensive against Iraqi troops from the nearby Anbar province over the past week, according to a U.S. official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. The official has seen aerial footage showing that IS fighters are ""moving in numbers very rapidly"".

The New York Times quoted the official as saying that IS fighters moved on government-held districts in the northern province on Sunday, seizing control of five major military bases with tanks, armored vehicles and fighter jets.

The official said the offensive began this week with a ""complete takeover"" of Fallujah, which is located about 40 miles west of Baghdad. He said Fallujah residents were ""terrified"" of the violence, and that the fighting was ""brutal and widespread"".

""From all the evidence I have seen this is the biggest ISIS offensive in Iraq since July when the group captured the city of Bjerk,"" said the official, referring to the ancient city of Mosul. He said that since that point, Iraqi forces had regained ground in some areas of Anbar but that ""it's been very very slow.""

The official said that the battle of Fallujah was the first major offensive on Anbar province since U.S. forces pulled out of the province in 2011. The U.S.-led coalition has continued to maintain a presence and intelligence operations against IS in Fallujah and in Baghdad, though little of that area has been fully recaptured from the militants.

The official said that Iraqi troops had been on the offensive in Anbar province since July and that there had been a ""large-scale"" effort to retake towns and villages east of Ramadi, also where Iraqi forces were battling. Ramadi is about 90 miles from Baghdad.

He said Ramadi in particular was among seven to 10 other towns held by the IS militants that had fallen since the U.S. withdrawal, adding that the coalition was working with local communities to help defeat the militants, who used the Fallujah offensive as a launchpad to recapture their capital in June.

But the official said the coalition was facing a more intractable challenge in Ramadi and had been unable to retake it.

The U.S. official would not disclose how many militants were"

LAC FIRE IMT2 STEVE PAUL
Piedras Blancas County Sheriff's Office is investigating the disappearance of a woman who was last seen in the parking lot of her residence on Ladera Road in Fort Bragg Thursday evening.
The woman's body was found near a drainage area of the roadway around 9 p.m. Thursday, about an hour before she would have left for work.
The Sheriff's Office said that the woman was likely taken to a drainage area and drowned in the drainage.
One witness described hearing two voices yelling about an 18-year-old, possibly from a vehicle that sped away, possibly toward the area where the body was found.
Sheriff's officials said the first witness called 911 and described the vehicle as a white four-door Mercury Cougar with California plates. The call came in shortly before 6 p.m. after the woman left work. The first official witness left shortly after.

In an interview with the Times Times Union, Stiles described himself then as a ""survivalist type dude."" It remains unclear what he meant by that.

Deputies, meanwhile and later in the interview with the Times Union, explained that they never met Stiles prior to the attack, nor took him into custody for the incident, because he was on state custody with the girl and because he was an acquaintance, not an actual child offender.

The girl, who has not been publicly identified, told authorities she had to be alone because her mother had gone into labor.

The attack occurred Oct. 30 at a house on South Wood Street in Portage. Deputies went there Saturday night in response to a 911 call from a neighbor, according to the Times Union.

Stiles showed up at the house and, during the verbal confrontation, the tape shows, the girl screamed that she was afraid. She grabbed his hand and told him to leave; he didn't, which she believed was because he had been drinking.

The girl went into her room and came out crying and saying they had to escape because she was going to be late on her doctor's appointment. That's when the girl started trying to hold Stiles down to keep him from raping her. At that moment, one of the girl's family members appeared and told the girl's mother to keep the girl inside.

Stiles continued the assault and, at some point, the girl moved her arms down his jacket to prevent him from raping her. According to authorities, she later realized she was not restrained properly, and the tape starts to show him forcibly pulling down her pants to get his penis inside her vagina, where he said he ""did try to shove a finger inside her but couldn't put it in because she was full"" and ""she was full of urine so it would probably hurt a little bit."""

The Cost of Living Index 2016 (COLLI 2016) is a composite index of 14 countries that includes national prices of goods and services, interest rates, and currency values.

The COLLI 2016 is different from the Index of Goods and Services (IEG, 2016) that compiles information about the prices of goods and services produced by member countries. Both indexes use prices as indices, calculating their own price indices for goods and services based on the prices of similar goods and services sold by foreign firms in the member countries. Neither index includes data on how much foreign firms paid for goods and services in the member countries. The COLLI 2016 does include data on the cost of living in the member countries.

For instance, the COLLI 2016 is intended to measure the cost of goods and services in a country based on data from a representative sample of that country's businesses and consumers. Since member countries' personal budgets may be different, prices do not necessarily reflect the prices of goods and services in the country. The prices of personal goods and services must be expressed in the most competitive market in that country.

The COLLI 2016 calculates consumer prices only for goods and services supplied by businesses to individuals and households, excluding all expenses such as interest, taxes, and rental car costs.

University of South Carolina mourns deaths of six students."," The victims are among 18 slain at UCC. Seven students were reportedly trapped at UCC on Friday evening by a gunman who entered with a rifle shot to the classroom. One other student died near campus near a library during a shooting that left 17 people dead. Authorities say one victim was shot in the head, another in the leg during the shooting. Two others were injured in the shooting. Police officials confirm one student was shot with a rifle.

The first reported murder happened in downtown St. Louis on Thursday morning when a police officer investigating a home burglary found a dead man in another residence. As he looked for a suspect, his companion allegedly shot that officer in the back.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol later confirmed that the officer was the first person they had encountered since the gunman began his rampage. When the patrol took over, the wounded officer was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

The U.S. Secret Service arrived in St. Louis shortly after Friday's shootings to assess the situation.

The St. Louis County police tweeted that the gunman remains on the loose in the area and urged residents to stay away while the sheriff's office, ATF, FBI and Missouri State Highway Patrol responded to the incident.

A Missouri State Highway Patrol spokesman said it is in talks with St. Louis County authorities, in addition to FBI agents and local police, to establish a ""command center"" in the area where the shooting took place.

""We're gonna have law enforcement in the neighborhood as a precaution,"" said Officer Jason Taruska to the Post-Dispatch, adding that St. Louis County sheriff's deputies are on scene with FBI officials.

The St. Louis-area FBI field office said on its Twitter feed that agents were helping in the standoff and have a ""detailed mission."" An FBI spokesman confirmed to ABC News that agents are involved."

May said: ""Our approach must be clear, unambiguous, and proportionate – we cannot allow others to decide if and when to join our society."" It isn't the only recent incident in which politicians have spoken about how to protect children against violent extremism. Prime Minister David Cameron spoke last summer about ""deeper, more extensive surveillance"" of children. ""We should start not just monitoring extremists, but actively targeting them,"" he said. In that interview, he also said that his aim was to persuade children to think before they speak. Speaking before the Manchester bombing, Prime Minister David Cameron said he would stop ""luring"" British Muslims to join ISIS and instead use the threat of extremism as an opportunity for local communities to help. In the interview, he said: ""Is the only way we are going to end this is by actually engaging these communities or we are going to be doing this at the expense of people who come in with absolutely nothing and, at some point, end up either coming out as terrorists or, indeed, having done the things that they came to be accused of?""

May said that after speaking in March about the need for new measures in the fight against extremism, she had seen only the ""sides"" with such measures while visiting schools in Buckinghamshire and Dewsbury, Manchester, earlier this year. After seeing these schools, the Prime Minister said she hoped to ""explore the idea of more extensive measures."" In contrast to her earlier comments, she also said she wanted to ""start not just monitoring"" people who may be engaged in jihadist activities, which she described as a ""real problem,"" but then added later: ""I do believe that there can be no place for terrorist atrocities in our country.""

In another part of the article, it appeared that, for the first time, May spoke about how Britain is taking strong action against radical ideology. She expressed ""no sympathy"" for those who are radicalized and then commit violence. She also called for new measures to give the police and intelligence agencies greater powers to monitor the internet."

Write a news article based on the following summary: A Mauro Camoranesi goal earns Juventus a 1-1 draw with leaders Inter Milan. Argentine striker Julio Cruz had given injury-hit Inter the lead in the first half. The result maintains Inter's unbeaten record and moves them two points clear.," A Diego Perotti penalty in the 90th minute gives Juventus the title. Inter are one-half down to Milan.

Why was this summary published?

The European Championship final, won by Portugal in Paris, ended 2-2 on aggregate despite a scoreline of 1-2 for both teams in the first leg, which included a last-minute first-half goal. The referee's final decision should have been based on video evidence that could have ruled against Portugal. But there was no video evidence, making no difference before the match. Instead, officials decided on a subjective interpretation of the fact which would be published as an official narrative without consideration of any further explanation.

After the game, European Championship chief Michel Platini released a statement saying his ""thoughts and prayers"" were with those involved.

What do I say?

It is inex chiroprops, a great tragedy for sport, society and our relationship with each other. This case is a warning to players and fans alike. It is not an argument against the system: UEFA's rulebook makes it clear that in the event of a late goal, the player who scored can continue to celebrate, the opposing team cannot. It is not an argument against the rules themselves, which are clear, and that UEFA's decision to publish it in the same day in all of its member countries was appropriate under these circumstances. It is not an argument against the judiciary, which clearly has the same job of homeowner as the officials in these circumstances. It is only an expression of how we feel about the situation, as we are all fans in this tragic circumstance.

What's the story here? Are there witnesses and video available? Please let me know.

Yes, there are. In this case only one side can be shown on video footage. Video footage of the match itself and of the game between Inter and Ronaldo, of Ronaldo's goal and of the decision to award goal bonuses as a result, are available on Youtube. There are additional sources: these are reports by the referees on their match reports into the game, by a former referee who was on the bench at that time, in an interview with the Spanish radio station Cadena Ser, and by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC).

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Documents say after suicide attempt, Jeffs repeatedly banged head on cell wall. Transcripts say Jeffs confessed to ""immorality,"" said he is not ""the prophet"" Jeffs' attorneys say he has recanted statements. Jeffs due to be sentenced November 20 on accomplice to rape charge.","

Your letter writer was contacted by the Investigative Reporting Workshop for Public Media, a nonprofit journalism center based in St. Paul. The organization recently released a report on whether the investigation into the polygamous sect called Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints led to any prosecutions of high-profile members.

After conducting its own investigation, the workshop found that while the FBI investigated and issued citations to eight leaders in the polygamous sect, two other men were charged in state or federal court for violating tribal law in Arizona.

""The prosecution records provided by authorities did not include specific information identifying the individuals charged,"" the organization said in a statement.

When asked whether the workshops has any other investigations into polygamy investigations, Jeff Sharlet, the group's executive director, said that's been a growing trend.

""That's a very challenging question, no question about it,"" he said.

But he noted that the workshop provides advice ""to organizations and individuals who are looking to follow through"" polygamist investigations.

In this interview, Sharlet spoke about several potential outcomes of Jeffs's trial.

""He (Jeffs) has to testify at trial,"" Sharlet said. ""If Jeffs doesn't testify, is (his lawyer) going to have a chance at being excused?""

If Jeffs doesn't testify, Sharlet said, the judge will have theGreat Apostasy on his hands.

""If that occurs,"" Sharlet said, ""he has to be given time to reflect.""

But if he does testify, Sharlet said, some of the testimony will be based on other evidence taken from a separate investigation by the FBI. That investigation involved two members of the sect, a man and two women, who were accused of conspiring to sell $120,000 in church-owned land in southeastern Arizona.

""If some of those people went to trial, you're not talking about some kind of Big Brother-type thing,"" he said.

Sharlet also noted that some prosecutors, at the request of Jeffs's attorneys, would be going to trial, as well. The FBI has declined to talk about that investigation.

Sharlet also said that Jeffs should not have to testify. But when asked about whether that was on the table, Sharlet said he didn't know.

The workshop found that Jeffs's attorneys, Paul DeHart and Chris Slaten, likely would be pursuing a strategy in Jeffs' trial that would allow him to stayamuraited. That's the legal term for out-of-court settlements involving people convicted of high-profile crimes in the civil courts. It's not uncommon in state and federal courts but rare in civil courts.

Slaten said the idea is to have Jeffs testify in the case and that legal precedent already supports out-of-court settlements. He said that Jeffs would be a defendant in his own actions.

""The only thing he (Jeffs) needs is to step on the rope, so to speak, and take some responsibility for being a bad president and a bad prophet and all that stuff,"" Slaten said. ""It's up to the court and he'll put forth his arguments whether there's a lawyer sitting there, or not. I don't know what the chances are, but we're going to keep on working this case until the end.""

If he does testify at the trial, Slaten said Jeffs ""could come to a clear and concise statement in which he recognizes he has done some bad things, but he doesn't want to do it again.""

In that statement, Jeffs' attorneys and their supporters would make his allegations about what became public and his response to the allegations. They also are likely to want him to explain what prompted him to break away from the church.

Sharlet said the workshop is not trying to be a voice of the media. As of Wednesday morning, three people had tweeted messages supportive of Jeffs, including one with the hashtag #FreeJeffs.

""I feel like we can give a little piece of this back to the community,"" he said. ""A piece of our community that has been very much affected by this.""

The church has a website, but its members have limited knowledge about the details of the investigation. The Mormon Church says it has no comment on the details of the polygamous settlement and has no comment, in general, on the ""MormonLeaks"" online leak program.

Sharlet said the group has been contacted by both the media and lawyers from the community about Jeffs.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Lewis Hamilton fails to clinch world title after spinning out of the Chinese GP. Briton's lead cut to four points by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso. Alonso finished second in Shanghai behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.," He beat Hamilton in the race to the chequered flag.

What was the headline? Mercedes wins world title for Hamilton and Alonso

""Hamilton and Alonso got the chequered flag first in Shanghai and we saw a clear picture,"" said Sky Sports F1's Simon Lazenby after the race. ""They've locked up at the top of the charts in the drivers' championship, with Alonso second, but they also came out of the Chinese GP with Mercedes' lead at four points with a margin of just 1.25 seconds.""

The news was widely believed to have been the result of a technical problem which prevented Hamilton and Alonso from completing the race. The McLaren pair also did not finish ahead of Ferrari, and Sebastian Vettel, who finished second, scored a thrilling victory on the last lap.

Although Sky had predicted that Alonso, who led for most of the race, would beat Ferrari, it was Hamilton who secured the win in a tense end to the race. Alonso had briefly lost a lead after his accident on the first lap and he was back on top when Alonso reeled his rivals back into the pits after his final retirements on the way to finishing second.

""They were so close I believe in hindsight,"" said the team's Fernando Alonso after Shanghai at the Japanese Grand Prix

It put Alonso four points behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in the drivers' standings, with the world champion leading Hamilton by just 11 points. This would now push the championship stakes even higher, and it is the first time since 1995 that four teams have recorded the same number of titles.

May 15, 1999 - Al Jazeera's Arabic language service is cut off by the government. News of the censorship was reported later that day. The station, also known as Sihanouk News TV, broadcasts under the direction of Mohamed ElBaradei, former head of the Palestinian Authority and current head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Arab world's largest TV station has been seen as critical to the survival of Egypt's ruling military dynasty. ElBaradei described this year's crackdown as repressive and said Al Jazeera journalists had fled the country and that several had left on May 8. However, state security services claimed May 10 that 10 journalists were killed in the violence and that there had been ""a large scale search for terrorists in the city and in the countryside,"" according to a CNN report. CNN, however, said the claim referred to an operation conducted May 9 in which more than 100 people were arrested and interrogated. The Al Jazeera English service, also known as Al Jazeera Arabic, began broadcasting in 1998 and has been a crucial source for information about the Middle East since it was launched. Al Jazeera Arabic is funded and operated by the Arabic network Nawaheb Al Jazeera, which is affiliated with the Nawaheb family of Abu Dhabi. The channel is distributed through the Internet and is funded by the World Economic Forum - an organization founded by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the founder of The Clinton Foundation and the son-in-law of Saudi King Fahd. Sheikh Mohammed owns the investment group Al Wafd Investment, a major shareholder of The Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation's CEO, Tim Kaine, and others who are close pals with the Al Wafd family have received donations ranging from over $12 million to millions of dollars from the Saudi Arabian public. Al Wafd's investments - including investments in Apple, The Coca-Cola Company and other top U.S. companies - are subject to restrictions on ""investors"" for potential conflict-of-interest, according to a Reuters report by David Sirota on Feb. 10, 2009. It's unclear whether all Al Wafd investors are registered in the U.S., as it's illegal to take public money from any nation without their approval. Al Wafd's links to Al Qaeda date back to the 1990s and to ""an alleged U.S. intelligence operation on behalf of the bin Laden family,"" according to David Sirota. At least one of Al Qaeda's main fundraising hubs, the U.S. branch of Al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Muhajiroun, also received help from the Clinton Foundation, according to Sirota's report: ""It seems clear that Al-Muhajiroun was also funneled money from the Clinton Foundation to the bank and the Al Wafd investment group that owns it."" Sirota also said Al Jazeera English - formerly known as Al Jazeera Arabic - appears to be under the influence of a prominent Saudi-based Muslim Brotherhood figure who has ties to Al Qaeda, including its longtime leader, Ayman al Zawahiri. The Brotherhood is considered by many Arab governments as a terrorist organization, including Egyptian and Sudanic ones. According to the Times of London, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan (who was also part of the Saudi bin Laden entourage) is at the helm of Qatar's efforts to take Al Jazeera English over. ""Bandar bin Sultan's role in the Qatar-Al Jazeera project is still in the works, according to a senior Qatari official,"" reported the London Times.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Lionel Messi scores for the sixth game in a row as Barca defeat Atletico 3-0. Real Madrid stay top of the Primera Liga table after defeating Recreativo 2-0. Sevilla's crisis continues as they lose their four league match in succession.,"

Please include a link to this story if your source was a television station, radio broadcast or newspaper.

Barcelona's Lionel Messi scores for the sixth game in a row as Barca defeat Atletico 3-0. Real Madrid stay top of the Primera Liga table after defeating Recreativo 2-0. Sevilla's crisis continues as they lose their four league match in succession.

The number of goals scored in an MLS game since last July is: 0.

What if I include the most valuable goals this season?

What if I take the most valuable goals in a single season and add the totals for league championship, playoff and domestic cup competition?

Here is a list to help determine what constitutes a valuable goal: In MLS, it does not really matter as all of the league's ""contenders"" scored in the last week of the season, and they're all in play this week.

There isn't too much data in MLS these days on scoring in regulation or sudden death overtime games, but we can try to answer this question using this handy chart from Steve Bocock's website. The first column shows how many total points this season have gone into goals scored per game, the second column shows total points this season that total points have gone in in regulation and sudden-death overtime. Note that the numbers for both columns were calculated by taking the league's average total percentage of points scored in each one. (The chart shows a significant rise from last year — for comparison's sake, this year's season is down by about 15%.)

The next chart shows how MLS teams are likely to perform this week. Note that most of the teams are likely to be down to either goal scorer (one team is likely down to zero goals this week) or have one goal scorer that has been out with a serious injury for several nights. So, as I said, the number of goals scored should be about 150-200 points, not far off from the 250-300 points you are used to seeing in MLS. The only team with greater than 300+ points this year is the Seattle Sounders, who are at or near the top of the points leaderboard, but the Sounders have done very well in the regular season and there is ample evidence to indicate they've been able to win the cup and play out the remaining games.

However, with five (!) games left, there equation gets a little tricky, and that's not a bad thing. The difference in quality between the last few weeks of regular season and this week's is much greater than most people expect this year to be.

My guess is that over the remaining four weeks, teams will put in good work, scoring mimimum points at the right time, playing to the style of play that they were good at in their last few games of the season. Then, if they win the final three games, they will be well over 300 points, which will put them right in the conversation for the Cup."

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Three Austin cave explorers are safe and are out of the cave, officials said. The University of Texas students went into Airman's Cave Saturday. The 12,000 foot long cave complex has tight twists and turns. Unclear exactly how the students lost their way, but cave is complex, official said.","

How did this article get so wrong? The only correct summary I came up with was that the cave went down some time ago, but that wasn't much comfort because none of the four students who went inside said they even survived the trip.

Even worse, in the original version of this article in the Austin American-Statesman, the story didn't address the fact that the cave was discovered on a Thursday and on a weekday while only one student was on the field. It also doesn't mention the fact that the cave is more than half a mile long — it's literally a mile and a half high. It seems as though it went into the cave because an Air Force sergeant in training came in one morning, got out of his airplane, started searching for his plane, crashed into the cave, and it had become impassable. In other words, he was just on the side of the cave, not really in it. But what exactly is so sad about being told about the students who died?

This was an issue of basic science and a student accident. I don't know if the writer of the original version would have been as outraged had he or she seen more about what happened that day. This version just completely ignores it.

[Update 2:25 p.m., April 30]

The students themselves have now returned from their trip, with an article in the Daily Texan calling them ""heroes,"" and giving thanks for everyone's kind help. They also wrote that they are ""still holding out hope"" that the two Air Force officers involved will turn up after searching for ""several days.""

[Update 2:30 p.m., April 30]

Earlier:

Three Austin, Texas, students were killed in Cave of the Winds by a cave-dwelling African python Tuesday near the U.S.-Mexico border.

According to ABC affiliate KVUE, the student and his sister, who are also in their 20s, fell about 200 feet in the 40-foot-long cave at about 2:30 a.m. They're survived by a brother, father and sister.

The three had been exploring the cave at the Red River Gorge Campground in eastern Austin. They went in around 11:50 a.m. while their father is out on a camping trip with the family. The first student was in ""critical but stable condition"" Wednesday, said Sgt. Michael Chmura at the Yerba Buena National Wildlife Refuge, where the students are being treated.

""The initial cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head,"" Chmura said.

The students' father, who was out on the trip but was not injured, told KVUE he's ""in disbelief"" at the news, and hopes the school system will do more to address safety issues."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Laura Bush calls on Myanmar junta to ""step aside,"" allow for a democracy. Military leaders must give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people, she says. Junta should release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders, she says. Her rare foray into foreign policy was published in the Wall Street Journal.","

The Associated Press describes an Associated Press report of two U.S. law enforcement officials who say a group of former members of Burma's junta are in hiding in Malaysia. The State Department said officials in Jakarta, Indonesia, where they had ties, are now trying to track down the former officers.

CNN does not say the name of the Burmese commander who leads a group that is battling the Muslim Rohingya. But it does say he ""in effect controls the army's operations"" in Myanmar.

The Washington Post describes reports in the Burmese news media indicating that Aung San Suu Kyi's government has been negotiating with the Myanmar military to ease its restrictions on the Rohingya minority. The Myanmar government dismissed the claims as propaganda.

The British Channel 4 news program ""60 Minutes"" does not call the Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh ""Bengalis,"" but says they are illegal immigrants from Burma.

Other news agencies do not report that the country of Burma has ""re-arisen a campaign of terror against the Rohingya,"" or that the Myanmar army has been attacking the Rohingya in multiple locations in Rakhine state, the largest in the country. The Associated Press is one of the few that refers to the Myanmar authorities as the government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which may suggest that the name of the regime she represents may not be well known to her critics.

While reporting on the Burmese opposition party, AP refers to the group as the ""Rohingya National Force,"" which it never describes as a Rohingya organization, because it is not a politically active group. It does not reveal that its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is the country's de facto leader.

AP's editorspledge that the journalists in charge of producing its ""News"" section will ensure that it does not knowingly use information to promote politics or promote human rights abuses in Burma."

On Saturday, Sanchez got another bump in the polls from a Washington Post-ABC News poll that showed the freshman senator running third behind his Republican colleague Susan Collins of Maine. But a RealClearPolitics average shows that Sanchez is still behind Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has been on the rise since he first won his Senate seat in 2010, and other candidates as well as President Obama.

Sanchez and Paul represent conservative districts; Collins represents liberal ones. It's not clear whether Sanchez is the right person to help Collins, who recently endorsed Obama but is locked in a tough reelection battle against Alison Lundergan Grimes (D) this fall.

If Sanchez is indeed a conservative, it's not clear where he stands on the issues of the day. In an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" the freshman senator said he supports repealing portions of Obamacare. But he also pledged not to introduce more of the controversial ""reconciliation"" bill that would allow individual states to opt out of various elements of Obamacare:

SCHULTZ: Rand is not for repeal. I'm not for repeal. But here's what I am 100 percent for, if you want to look at things, here's where I stand. I think we are at a time in this country where we finally are starting to say to Americans we're going to fix and fix really badly the big problems — healthcare, jobs, immigration, and we are going to spend — and spend, and spend here the money wisely and make this a good tax code, and make it a nation of opportunity. That's something that I think the people of Maryland and the people of my home state density in the United States of America are clamoring for. It's never been too late. I think it's time. The time for us to fix it is now.

Sanchez also said that he plans to ""keep hearing"" about the debt ceiling, a phrase that has become his signature campaign issue in this race. On Sunday, he didn't say what would happen if the country runs out of borrowing authority.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)

WESTPORT, MASS. — The Washington Capitals' Evgeny Kuznetsov won the first ever gold medal tonight in the men's hockey game in Sweden … and he did it in one day … the 21-year-old Kuznetsov took the puck into the zone and began skating and scoring in the first 10 seconds.

Kuznetsov did it again in the 13th. But it was Kuznetsov's second half in eight days … and the third, at least. He scored six points on his way to a five-point night … the third in five days.

""Obviously he's earned these Olympic gold medals,"" Capitals coach Barry Trotz said. ""I don't know why people keep asking me that,"" and added, ""That's a great story.""

With Kuznetsov's assist in the second period, Washington beat the New York Islanders 4-2 at Bell Centre. It took place two days after the NHL trade deadline, then two days after Trotz had retired as a player because of back problems.

Kuznetsov scored twice, including on a wrist shot by Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin, who scored from the right faceoff circle in off his own blocker. He also collected a rebound after Washington's Patrick Kane scored a breakaway goal.

The Capitals have no problem with this. They had lost five games in a row heading into Game 4 of their opening-round series against the Pittsburgh Penguins, including consecutive losses for the first time in a season in almost five years.

Kuznetsov has been the talk of the world since he made history in Sochi in September, emerging as the second-youngest star in the world at 21 years, 2 months and one day. But it wasn't until he finished playing during the 2014 Sochi Olympics that people knew him for the young player he was, not a kid who had been to four consecutive U.S. youth hockey national tournaments.

But he earned these medals tonight, becoming the first player at 21 years old in six Olympics to win an Olympic gold medal.

The youngest player on Team Russia, he won the gold in just his second Olympics, in 2012 in Vancouver, and then went on to win the Russian Cup, an international tournament on steroids, for his home country – after three years playing on the national team.

As Kuznetsov entered the arena tonight, the atmosphere was electric – the arena was packed to overflowing with the 20,000-plus fans in the building. Many Russian fans wore traditional red hockey sweaters with the national color – red with a white line – marking this was their team in Sochi. Many Russian athletes played on teams with Kuznetsov, including Russia's young star goalie Evgeni Nabokov, who is from the Krasnodar region in the east of Russia.

That kind of atmosphere was on full display in the arena.

As Kuznetsov and his teammates exited the room to celebrate, he took photos with fans and took a picture with the national hockey team's logo on his jersey. Fans in the standing section yelled ""Koz!"" to him. Kuznetsov smiled.

""One of my goals is to win gold in the Olympics, and I did it,"" said Kuznetsov, who is the sixth-youngest player in the NHL. ""It's something good. My teammates did great. They did great work. You have this mentality that you work harder than anybody on the team. It's great to show off.""

The Capitals, despite their struggles through five playoff games, were winning in the second period. They led 3-1 at the 5:28 mark when Kuznetsov and former player Evgeny Kuznetsov scored on rebounds.

Three minutes later, Capitals forward Marcus Johansson scored.

But Kuznetsov scored again on a wrist shot by Capitals defenseman Ryan McDonagh, and then Kuznetsov's fourth goal in the second period. Washington led 4-1 at the 1:40 mark. After getting a shot past Islanders goaltender Jaroslav Halak, K"

there were 25 deaths in Texas from March 1 to April 30. That's down from 30 in 2015. CNN: The most common form of capital punishment in the United States today is lethal injection. It was invented in 1971, to replace the hanging as one of the main means of execution in the U.S. But last year, only one death was carried out in U.S. capital punishment.


States with widespread death penalties

States with laws designed to place capital punishment in their constitution or prohibit it from taking place

Alabama: The death penalty was banned in 1977. This makes Alabama the only state which does not prohibit the death penalty; a ban on the execution of life-sentence inmates was struck down as unconstitutional in 1982.

Stores near schools, churches and cultural centers cannot sell alcohol. Chavez plans to increase taxes on luxury goods, including Hummers."," Chavez: U.S. has sold weapons for Venezuela, the White House says Monday. ""This morning President Nicolás Maduro made a surprise visit to the White House,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The President confirmed that U.S. military equipment is also present among private security firms and arms companies working in Venezuela.""

Facing a deepening economic crisis, President Nicolas Maduro announced Tuesday his government plans to increase food prices and hike taxes, among other measures.

As the opposition blames the socialist government for soaring inflation, Maduro has vowed to fight back through the country's constitutional appeals process.

Maduro said at a Thursday meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama the U.S. has no plans to sell sophisticated weapons to Venezuela while a deal with Venezuela's defense firms expires in December.

""Today I announced that we are taking a step toward a serious and drastic reduction of food prices because it is the main cause of social war for the Venezuelan people,"" Maduro said.

The government increased gasoline prices from 45 bolív encompasses to 79 bolív and raised the price of bus passes from 80 bolív to 90 pesos

President Maduro says his plans do not target the business sector or social groups. Maduro says his plans do not target the business sector or social groups.

""What they want to do is create chaos and to impose a regime of misery on everyone: from the middle class and business... to the poorest among us,"" he said.

Maduro says it's his constitutional right to impose a 30 percent cut in imports because ""the people have started to demand change in their social and economic situation.""

But it's unclear who is enforcing this new price regime, and whether it does much good.

The Venezuelan Federation of Businesses has accused Maduro of imposing a ""dictatorship,"" saying a recent government decree aimed at preventing private retailers from selling items subsidized by the government.

More than 50 private-owned stores have been shuttered so far, in what the Federation called an ""anti-business policy."" Last week, the country's National Assembly passed two laws — one aimed at helping government agencies control prices and another restricting private retailers from selling subsidized items.

The Federation of the Retail Industry, which represents more than 30,000 private-sector companies, called the measures harmful.

The Federation said the measure was a ""perversion of socialism.""

The government on Wednesday is expected to present another law aimed at protecting small merchants with fewer than 3,000 employees who are affected by the price increases.

In other developments:

Opposition lawmaker says she'll file a new motion to remove Maduro from power.

A new poll shows 56 percent of Venezuelans say they believe Maduro is the head of a dictatorship, compared to 41 percent who say he is the true victim of an economic crisis.

Unelected officials have a history of meddling in Venezuela's affairs. Venezuelan Ambassador to the U.S. Luis Almagro said this week Venezuela has hired an ""undercover government"" to spy on the U.S. government.

TARGETS

Obesity

In the United States, about 8 percent of children age 2 to 19 are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 40 percent of adults are obese, according to the National Institutes of Health.

About 1 in 5 adults in the United States is obese, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Obesity has become one of our most visible and widespread health problems,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the Frieden Institute at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a public health summit on obesity Tuesday.

Many experts say all Americans need to do to reduce obesity rates is to reduce sugar intake, increase physical activity and find a better alternative to white bread, potatoes and pasta.

About 6.8 million children in the United States were overweight, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration.

Adults with a body mass index of more than 35 — the second highest category — are considered obese.

Most people — about 88 percent — with a body mass index of 35 or higher are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some 70 percent of Americans, or nearly 16 percent of children and adolescents, have a body mass index greater than 40. There are some people with weight gains that do not affect weight; they may be able to lose weight safely over time.

Some of the main strategies doctors are recommending to reduce obesity are:

Losing weight by getting more physical activity

Maintaining a healthy weight by taking steps to reduce sugars and eating more fruits and vegetables

Reducing trans fats with foods and cooking

Reducing calorie counts and consuming fewer sweets

Changing the habit of having foods served at a certain size

Sealing or cutting food wrappers

For adults, limiting calories by exercising more, or starting at a lower weight

For children, giving them smaller portion sizes

And keeping a close eye on cholesterol levels, blood pressure and alcohol levels through age 19

Sudden Death Syndrome is a rare illness that can be caused by consuming too much sugar or fat. It can be caught in time and can be curable through a number of medications, said Dr. Joseph Jader, the president of the American Heart Association's Scientific Advisory Board.

Video

""It does happen, very rarely, particularly among the young, but it is not a life-threatening thing and it doesn't have to result in heart failure,"" Dr. Jader told CNN.

CALL ME TO HEART

Dr. Gifford Miller, director of pediatric endocrinology at Lenox Hill Hospital, suggested people learn to recognize sudden heart attacks, as many younger people don't have any evidence of a family history of the disorder.

Because so few of these events are reported to the health care system, said Dr. Miller, who described them as ""mom and dad's surprise"" when they get to the hospital on Tuesday.

The causes remain unknown, he said. They may be caused by a deficiency in thyroid or adrenal hormones or a breakdown Madrid- and other metabolic syndrome have been linked to, among other reasons.

He suggested a heart attack itself is rare, although it may be triggered by an underlying medical problem.

About 15 percent of patients had not had a family history of sudden cardiac death in a previous hospitalization, he said, which adds to his suspicions that the condition is triggered by excessive intake of food.

""Some other patients don't react like this,"" he said.

POTIONING DISEASES

More than 100 million Americans experience some form of hypertension. Most of the increase is due to the recent increase in alcohol consumption, Dr. Miller said.

About 3 percent of adults were being treated for high blood pressure and about 24 million were being treated for high cholesterol, which led to 4.3 million treatment appointments in 2010, according to Medicare.

High cholesterol can lead your blood to become clogged with plaque that can lead to heart disease and stroke, according to the American Heart Association.

One of the first indicators is an increase in blood pressure when you drink more than 100 milligrams of salt a day, according to the American College of Cardiology, the American Society of Hypertension and the American Board of Internal Medicine.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: South African reggae legend Lucky Dube killed in attempted hijacking. Dube, 43, killed Thursday in Johannesburg after hijacker tried to steal his car. Death casts shadow over South Africa's preparations for rugby World Cup final."," Two other members of same reggae-rock group, known as Gubuza and Dube, were killed when they were attacked by men wearing military uniforms on a private plane in 2003.

By Jonathan Haidt

New York Times, October 30, 2014

""I didn't sleep last night. I was so scared. I couldn't think straight … I was just screaming in a daze.""

Lucky Dube is not a typical victim. In fact, his victims are the ones he uses as his muse.

Since 2005, Mr. Dube, 43, has become a sort of national celebrity for his role as the Jamaican reggae guitarist and songwriter (among other things), and his performances at reggae festivals around the world.

In 2013, his exploits brought him to the attention of his fellow South Africans, who recognized some of his lyrics as an indication that the country wasn't doing enough to root out corruption. With his band, Dube, he became a favorite of the media, having stripping on stage for more than a year. That same year, they recorded an album of ""chillingly funny"" songs, ""The Faded Line."" It won the Grammy for best original song. Mr. Dube was chosen for the 2014-15 Africa's Top Artists List by the African People's Theatre Foundation, which also chose him to be their representative in the United States. (The country's National Radio and Television Corporation, in a statement, said they believed the musician ""is one of South Africa's great talents, and we welcome his efforts in this regard."")

But there was a problem.

That December, two South African men were convicted of kidnapping his band members, holding them at gunpoint, assaulting them and then stealing their money and rucksacks. There were threats, too, because the robbers also planned to shoot Mr. Dube if they had to flee the scene.

""I thought it would be so funny, and it was hilarious,"" Mr. Dube told The Daily Beast. He said he couldn't take it anymore.

""That was the biggest thing that made this so traumatic so fast for me,"" Mr. Dube said. ""You know, I have a big fan base … [and] you know, I've done over 15 million concerts, as this is not, you know, a million million people. It was a very small number. I was like, 'Well, if some idiot is going to do this to me, I'll be a martyr, I'll be this, I'll be that. I don't really care. I'm just going to see this guy, I'm going to shoot him, and I'm going to leave him alive — or dead. I don't give a fuck.'""

Mr. Dube, an actor and voice actor and the second most popular reggae artist in the Americas after Stevie Wonder, believes he has the talent to make a difference. ""I just want to be able to help the underprivileged — kids that don't get out in the world who do pooled, in the streets, and are begging on the streets of [sic] Johannesburg,"" he recently said in a speech to African-American activists. ""And I want to use this to go back and to show them I made it.""

That's a hard mission — and it demands a very specific performance.

""The best thing about working in the music industry is that I get an opportunity to meet people,"" Mr. Dube says. ""We get to learn the culture. We get to talk to guys like you and me, with the same background, the same values. Then we go back, and we get together and we practice singing, working, and learning and building our talent.""

He has a knack for playing fast and loose with terminology. He has been performing on tour in New Zealand for the last year and a half, sometimes to a capacity crowd of 60,000. He said the gig was meant to be ""a joke because that's how we've been doing it ever since [he met with them]. It was like, 'O.K. if it were a joke, there's a reason for it.' It was a serious performance, so [the crowd] was like, 'Oh, come on.'""

He says when he's in the States, he uses this to his advantage.

""I get to play a really big gig, but it doesn't mean me, like, becoming, like, a legend on the stage,"" he says. ""The difference is a legend gets up there and does a big show and they [the crowd]"

11. September 13 – Fort Lauderdale, FL

Three men were eating a steak on a patio outside in Ft. Lauderdale. A man's hand grabbed the top of the steak, and he pulled on it. A woman sitting on the patio was pulled. Her legs were torn out from underneath her. She was sent to the hospital. The suspect was described as a Black man, age 20-30. The other two suspects were both men, ages 30-40. The man accused of pulling from his steak was seen leaving the scene, but no further.

The three victims were initially treated by the Broward Sheriff's Office, then transported by ambulance to St. Mary's Medical Center. All three were later transferred to the University of Miami with injuries. All of them were released from the hospital by late Monday night. The incident occurred at about 11:15am.

A male walked into a 7-Eleven in Long Island and handed a female $15. He walked out with the cash and left the store unharmed with one small scratch on his hand from the cash register. Both suspects were described as Hispanic men in their late teens.

The robbery occurred around 11:15am. The suspects were said to be wearing ski masks. When the female employee saw the suspect on the second floor, she called police, who arrested three adults and one male suspect about half an hour later. The men were identified as two Hispanic men in their 20s and a third man of unknown race.

13. September 18 – Atlanta, GA

At about 8:30am, Atlanta authorities said they received a call that two people had locked themselves in a second-story apartment. They arrived to find the suspect with a bag over his head, which had been thrown at him. The suspects fled with the victim's jewelry in the closet.

One of the suspects left the apartment after a struggle with police, and the other went into the bathroom with the victim in a fight. The two suspects ran out of the building after they were chased down by officers and taken into custody. The males were described as Hispanic women to mid-thirties. Both suspects suffered minor lacerations and scratches on the back of their heads during the scuffle. The suspects have yet to be formally charged.

Write a news article based on the following summary: FEMA doesn't face utter devastation as in Gulf Coast in 2005. Victims can escape in own vehicles on open roads. Communications infrastructure remains intact. Agencies learn from Hurricane Katrina mistakes.," FEMA does not ""own"" or ""operate"" FEMA SuperDome, but is responsible for response. Hurricane Katrina has not caused huge death toll in the US.

FEMA can't recover quickly from Hurricane Katrina because the US Army Corps of Engineers was not yet deployed to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

FEMA and federal officials have blamed Katrina for the financial collapse of U.S. and global financial markets.

FEMA and federal officials make no mention of Hurricane Andrew in 2005.

FEMA and federal officials cannot admit Hurricane Harvey was the strongest flood ever to strike Texas because President Trump called Obama a ""Bad (or sick) guy"" for not doing more on Hurricane Harvey.

FEMA and federal officials do not mention that they still need massive new FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina Stringfellow (2002-07)

FEMA claims it is ""only"" $60 to rebuild a house in ""New Orleans"" – in 2003. It takes $125 to rebuild a house in Tampa; $200 in New Orleans; $250 (per ton) to repair a damaged house in Houston.

The Hurricane Katrina Relief Corps has only received an average of $4 per person, per year, to rebuild a hurricane-damaged home in New Orleans. It took $250,000 to repair a home in New Orleans, $500,000 to rebuild a house in New Orleans, and $2,000,000,000 to repair a damaged home in Houston (as of 2017).

FEMA has spent billions of dollars to ""repair"" homes that were destroyed or damaged before Hurricane Katrina.

Federal and FEMA officials have lied or ignored facts to protect FEMA.

The US Army Corps of Engineers has not been deployed to New Orleans.

FEMA's reconstruction is based on the ""pre-disaster rebuilding"" guidelines of the George W. Bush Administration.

FEMA officials have failed to properly prepare for FEMA before a storm hits America.

During Katrina, the US Army Corps of Engineers spent over $2 billion on disaster relief, of which only $130 billion were allocated to repair damage to damaged homes.

FEMA's Katrina recovery effort has been slow, bureaucratic, and corrupt.

There is no money to rebuild Katrina-damaged homes (as outlined by FEMA in its ""pre-disaster rebuilding"" guidelines).

The federal recovery effort has been so politicized and biased that it is largely dependent on federal aid for disaster relief. Because the Bush Administration refused to provide any assistance to rebuild homes, the National Flood Insurance Program was started in 2003 to assist the United States and its taxpayers, and FEMA is the main beneficiary of this program.

The Bush Administration refused to even acknowledge that they had provided money to restore or repair homes that had been damaged or destroyed in 2004-05 or to even coordinate on hurricane relief – even though FEMA (and the Bush Administration) denied any prior knowledge of any significant damage to houses in a section of New Orleans that was ""affected"" by Katrina.

As many as 563,000 displaced families continue to camp overnight on the streets of New York City on October 6, 2017 and 8.2 million Americans remain without power in states that were badly damaged by Hurricanes Harvey.

The federal government continues to refuse to assist with hurricane relief efforts in areas of Louisiana that were flooded by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

The federal government has blocked the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from sending aid to areas of New Orleans that were devastated by Katrina in 2005, even though FEMA has a specific purpose of improving infrastructure and providing help to New Orleans residents impacted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

FEMA and federal officials need to investigate themselves.

The federal government pretends, as though it is in control, when it comes to disaster relief to the most vulnerable population in America: the American public and taxpayers. In truth, the nation's capital, Washington D.C., where the Obama Administration is located, is the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the US Homeland Security Agency (HSSA) is the main agency dealing with disaster relief. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and Louisiana, no one in Washington D.C. bothered to ask if the people of New Orleans were in any danger. When Hurricane Andrew hit the Gulf Coast of Alabama and Florida in 2012, the public did not care that there were people living in coastal floodwaters and were not in danger from their own government's disaster relief efforts.

FEMA in Louisiana, in some form, has been in New Orleans longer than FEMA in New York or the other New York-based federal agencies. FEMA did not begin operation in New Orleans and it was supposed to be completely operational by March 31"

The character was also planned to be in an earlier stage of development as well, as in the interviews, John Kricfalusi stated that he intended to portray her as the daughter of Attila, which would mean in turn that she would be the daughter of her brother, in an unlikely scenario.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Polish diplomats brought pointed shoes to Britain in 1300s. A female runner sewed two jock straps together for first sports bra. Men wore earrings in Egypt in 1500s.,"

Summary

What's in the headlines? The answer lies in the details! For the purpose of this exercise, I chose to have only a superficial look at the history of ""sports bras"":

In the 1300s and 1400s, the female body became increasingly complex over time after the invention of the sewing machine. For the first time, the breasts became very large and the bust developed as well. The first women's athletic wear was produced by a German woman named Anna Wölfer in a textile workshop in Berlin in the year 1314. Within a few years, she had developed a style of sports bra that was so sophisticated and elegant that, even though the bra had a simple clasp, most women wore it as a bra. By the end of the 14th century, this style of sports bra had become ubiquitous. Today, the idea of being completely covered seems to be increasingly accepted among the female population, while men who have never heard of sports bras continue to wear their bras. In the early 1500s, the German-born women's fashion designer, Maryann, developed the famous Maryann's Faux Bra. This style was the first sports bra that could be worn comfortably in the winter months, as well as being more comfortable than other styles; for example, it had a narrow lace trim. While other styles such as those of Maryann's Faux Bra (1515) took over in the 16th century, the style of sport bra that we know as the sport bra came into the limelight around 1850. This style, the V-necked sports bra (V-neck for short) was invented by French and British girls in the 1860s, and became a popular sports bra among women. After the 19th century, women continued to take over sport bra production, and by the mid-50s, the V-necked sports bra dominated. By the 1950s, V-necks were found in almost all women's sports bras. In the 1980s, as men began using sports bras again, the V-neck sport bra was used again, albeit in fewer cases.

Of course, we don't have to dig very deep to find images of women who wear sports bras. In both women's and men's swimwear, we see the famous bikini-clad women at sea or in water parks, holding up large ""tanks"" of sport bras and showing off their chest area (or ""tanks""). This is perhaps why the world of women's swimwear was so popular in the 1970s, when the swimsuits changed from ""body wraps"" to ""t-shirts"" and ""swim leggings"" were popular. While those images don't portray the true meaning of ""bikini,"" let's focus on the picture above because this one gives us a good clue about the meaning behind it. The bottom half of the figure features women and the top half features two male models – a swim coach and a swimmer (which one is male is unclear, but we don vines it can't be a woman). There is a very clear line between the leftmost man in the image and the bottommost woman; he doesn't actually appear in the photograph. In other words, the men in the picture are the ones pulling down the swimsuit that exposes the bare breasts of the women below. Even if women never wore swimsuits into the 20th century, all the images we see today are images of men wearing swimwear. They do have to do with sports bras, but not the original form that I am presenting for. Instead, the image I am presenting is the kind of image that is often seen in ""wearing them"" advertisements and other media. I've highlighted these images with a red arrow because they do contain a very important image, and that image has been lost for more than a thousand years.

In the last part of this article, we are going to examine the most famous case of ""women's sporting bras."" What kind of clothing is she wearing?! While the fact that a girl is on a bike is not the problem with the video, that the girl is wearing a sports bra doesn't stop us from seeing it. While most women are comfortable wearing underwear and swim blouses, most women today don't want to do that. I've watched many videos and seen many pictures of women who were dressed as women in the 1930s or 1940s. The fact that a woman is wearing a sports bra is nothing to be ashamed of – just like ""The Three Musketeers"" or the film ""The Three Musketeers."" What is important is that forum posts on message boards, Pinterest and the internet are rife with examples of these fashion photos of bikini-clad women, and the women in them have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of!

Write a news article based on the following summary: Thousands of teens attend Christian rallies each year. Many of the rallies attempt to offer an alternative to secular popular culture. Opponents say these impose conservative values on vulnerable teenagers.,"

You probably won't get a fair assessment of this summary. But try to think of what it says about a lot of teens in America, and especially those who follow Christ-centered lifestyles.

It's what you think your average teen thinks of these events.

It's a perfect illustration of how one very large Christian organization tries to sell Christianity to a very large group of kids. (The church has taken to marketing the rallies as ""family-friendly,"" and says they're less ""intimidating"" to non-Christians.)

But if you think this is unusual, you're wrong.

This Christian conservative group started out as a small, fringe group of evangelical preachers who weren't trying to sell anything.

In 1996, they met in Houston for the first Bible-believing conference. Over the next four years, they grew and expanded, bringing in speakers such as Rick Warren, Bill Bright, and the late Sam Harris.

Then, in 2008, the group founded a media-savvy, highly visible political group, ""The Corner,"" which tries to make its case to kids and adults alike.

This group has become famous for some very bizarre tactics. It sells the group as family-friendly, but its rallies are extremely offensive. These folks don't want to go to a rally for the kids -- they want to go on stage. That was our problem in 2008, and that hasn't improved over the years.

But most of the groups that claim to give teens a spiritual outlet don't want kids to go anywhere near them at all. And the ""Christian conservatives"" who take the time to go to these events -- for kids who really need some help or perspective on an issue -- may end up offending a lot of kids at once.

So I took a look. Here is my review of what these teen activists say at these events:

What they say before and after these events:

""TheseCatalog!"" [Sites where a single page describing teens and teens homes can be found]

""[Jesus Loves Me""]

""[Your Soul Is Free from Mine]

A ""Bible Story For Young Adults""

A ""Bible Story For Young Preteenagers""

""The Gospel is for Everyone""

""God's Family""

""God Made me""

""[My Story]

""[God Is My Father]""

A ""Story of Family""

""Life's Beginning""

""Living in God""

""[Love God, Love Man]""

You, I, and Our Family""

""Believe in God!""

""Love God, Love Man""

""God Is Love""

There are other sites that the group tries to market to teens in these ways.

For some context, this is what ""God's Family"" had to look like when its site was created in 2008:

It appears that the site was very poorly designed -- with lots of ugly yellow boxes -- and that the content tended to center on Christian Bible verses and a host of other pro-Christian bits of information.

In fact, the site was so badly designed, it wasn't even remotely secure.

The ""Bible Story"" section -- not a Bible Story. It was an extremely bland collection of stuff such as ""My Prayer Book"" and ""My Journal"" and ""My Diary"" and ""My Memories of God."" In other words, you never saw what you were really reading. Not in the actual text. You saw a bunch of text that fit within a very narrow set of theological categories.

The ""Life's Beginning"" piece was a piece of self-help writing on how to be a better Christian in bed: how to ""make love last"" if you want to be married.

The ""story of family"" was also a self-improvement section: a list of pro-Christian pieces of information and advice in that section, which often talked about how God loves people and loves children.

The ""Living in God"" section talked about how God created the world (and that he doesn't need us humans to make it happen). It also talked about how we use our hearts, like when we laugh when we cry or when we talk about ""what God wants for us right now."" And some things in the article seemed to revolve around sex, marriage, and sex ed or abstinence education.

Some other passages are simply about theology. You can look them up.

But you didn't have to look too hard to find what you had always known: Teenagers, particularly Christian teens who follow Christ, have a whole host of issues. And they'll tell"
Write a news article based on the following summary: CNN's Octavia Nasr: Will Lebanon's brief renaissance be snuffed out? Nasr says Lebanon's key power players haven't changed since 1980s. Nasr: Current struggle threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years.,"

From the Octavia Nasr Center for Middle East Studies at New York University:

By Octavia Nasr

Lebanon's most successful politician has warned that the current political turmoil and sectarian violence in his country is likely to be a disaster for the country and beyond.

The former minister of culture, who is an Alawite Shia and holds multiple ministerial posts, has warned that Lebanon's key power players haven't changed since the era of President Rafik Hariri, who was assassinated in 2005 by his supporters.

While Hariri presided over Lebanon for almost five years, the current upheaval began in February. It started when two factions—one Sunni and one Shia—struck out against one another. This divided Syria.

Hariri's loyalists, however, are based in the east, the home region of President Bashar al-Assad. Those in Lebanon, according to Nasr, include ministers from many Syrian factions and some Lebanese Hezbollah members.

Hariri's widow, Sara, is in exile in Syria. He is considered an outspoken critic of Assad, but that doesn't make him immune from the accusations from a sectarian angle, Nasr says.

In a telephone interview, Nasr said Syria and Lebanon are divided because ""the sectarian and political axes that existed during the past 20 years still exist now and they are now spilling blood.""

This is largely because ""sectarianism and political Islam didn't disappear just because they stopped being politics"" and have ""moved into the religious sphere.""

So, what was hariri and his people's fight against their rival sects and politicians?

They did this by ""sowing the seeds of hatred and sectarian clashes in Lebanon,"" Nasr said.

Many believe an ongoing Syrian civil war was behind much of the damage that's been done to Lebanese society and economy since 1990.

Hariri didn't speak a word in public after the 2006 election, calling it ""a political error."" He was replaced in the post by Fadi Na'im, a Sunni Muslim cleric who is closer to Hezbollah leaders on the Syrian and Lebanese sides of the border.

Nasr and others believe that now that they have ""a clear majority in the political field"" Hariri's absence caused much of the upheaval. The former minister of culture believes Hariri chose to stay out of public life to protect the relationship he'd forged with Hezbollah.

Hariri's widow, Sara, is in exile in Syria. Hariri was considered an outspoken critic of Assad, but that doesn't make him immune from the accusations from a sectarian angle, Nasr says.

So, what did Hariri do to provoke Lebanon's sectarian strife?

Hariri chose to stay out of public life because it is the best way to protect the ""special relationship"" he'd forged with Hezbollah.

He ""didn't want to draw attention to his presence,"" Nasr said.

The former minister of culture was speaking at a conference in Beirut recently where he called upon Lebanon's political elites to work with Syria to keep Assad's regime in power, and to negotiate an end to sectarian violence.

""Lebanon is going through great changes,"" he concluded. ""Many in the region are wondering why Lebanon is facing a lot of difficulties now, since the conflict began.""

In his view, Hariri's absence from public life allowed the rise of other political figures in Lebanon from radical Salafi-jihadist figures, to the rise of ""secular parties"" that espouse secularism and democracy.

Nasr isn't the only one concerned with the current political and sectarian conflict in Lebanon. He's worried the current crisis will not be resolved soon.

Nasr has become something of an ambassador for his country's future in a region where many states and nations are experiencing crisis of conscience. He's worried that, for all the rhetoric, Syria's civil war leaves Lebanon and surrounding states and nations as victims, no longer parties to the conflict.

""All Syrians are victims and all of the neighboring countries are victims of Syria's aggression,"" Nasr said.

More and more often, it's the authorities making the decision to put out one fire, and then later finding out they didn't follow the same protocol with multiple, simultaneous fires.And, of course, we always forget that most people don't understand why the police and fire departments and fire personnel are so scared to release information and keep information classified.When it comes to what the fire chief in S.A. said about this alleged arson, we already discussed the fact that, as much as we'd like to, we can only verify the news. All we could do after looking at some local media stories and reports was to think ""WTF"" every time I[/i] read it.Yes, I will try.Let's take a step back and realize that this is a case where a fire has already burned 20 acres, burned several buildings, and is still smoldering. And, at the same time, we're getting reports of many more people missing, with so many others reported 911 calls from families wondering if their loved ones are in a building that was also damaged by the fire.That's why you see the word fire in reports by local media, rather than just an inferno. Also, don't confuse this with the case of the fire in South Lake Tahoe, where a ""fire"" broke out in a residential area because the homeowners believed that it may have been a drone that was lighting them up at night. In Tahoe, there was an investigation into the incident which turned out to be something other than a drone fire.In S.A., if fire's causing the biggest fire, you'd expect us to be the first in the news. After all, in Florida, the fires started as a result of a car crash."

4:00pm

Santa Ana Sheriff Mike Chitwood's office releases the following statement:

A wildfire erupted at the Thomas Fire overnight on Wednesday, Feb. 17. A large fire broke out near San Antonio Road and Bear Lake Road, in Santa Ana, causing the fire on the east side of the fire to spread west into neighboring towns. The wind shifted around 5:30 p.m. and made it hard for fire crews to contain the blaze, Chitwoodoutheastern's Robert Mina wrote here. When the wind changed back at 8 p.m., the winds calmed and the Southern California wildfires finally died down. The blaze was 100 percent contained last evening.

3:20pm

Santa Ana County emergency management spokesman, Larry Minger, said the Thomas Fire has grown to approximately 8,000 acres. However, he noted, the firefighters were still in the dark, because there was no reliable source of lighting. Minger said:

They were just talking about the fact that there's no electricity in the city of Santa Ana right now, so the firefighters were trying to go home at 6 p.m., but the situation remained unchanged.

1:30pm

A massive blaze that started from the Thomas Fire on Tuesday left at least 60 homes and dozens of vehicles destroyed in the heart of Santa Ana, the city's largest city, on Wednesday. At least 15 houses were destroyed or severely damaged, a Santa Ana Fire Department spokesman said.

At least four homes were damaged by flames that were estimated at 4-5 acres each, the spokesman said. He added that the blaze was 70 percent contained. A total of five firefighters were injured. The blaze was contained, but has not been extinguished yet.

One house had the window damaged to the inside and an entire area north of the house was severely burned.

The fire initially covered 300 acres and forced evacuations.

One of the main houses is still in flames. Another house was nearly completely destroyed by fire, and the front of another was severely under fire.

The fire damaged at least 24 homes. Minger said about 75 homes were destroyed but no lives were lost. The other 11 were damaged, including 15 commercial properties.

A mobile home park was fully engulfed. Many residents at the park had already fled.

One resident was killed in the blaze and several more were injured by flying debris from the fire. Firefighters had to make use of their axes to try to protect the home from falling debris.

The number of total residences destroyed has not been determined.

The Sheriff's Office has a total population of roughly 500,000. Chitwood has requested help from the California National Guard to be on the lookout for more residents affected by the fire.

A heavy rain storm has also brought more moisture into the Santa Ana area, causing the fire to spread east.

Firefighters have continued to work to extinguish the fire because of an increasing winds strength. The wind has been gusting to 55 mph since 6:30 p.m. The wind continues to blow north from downtown Los Angeles, Minger said.

Chitwood said: ""We are still battling the top of this wildfire with the winds still coming up. The wind is still weakening today and it's still at 50 mph with some gusts that have been at 55 mph or more.""

He said: ""We are still fighting fires in Los Angeles County, but this (fire) is growing significantly.""

A fire from the San Jacinto fire that caused hundreds of homes to go up in flames has been doused and contained.

The fire that started near San Antonio Road and Bear Lake Road in Santa Ana on Thursday has grown to Cannabis Ridge at 2,500 acres, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department, that statement said. As many as 35 homes were lost, officials said. The fire was 100 percent contained at 2:20 p.m. Thursday afternoon. There is no word yet on how many people might have been displaced from the area due to the fire, officials said.

Some of the residents that may have remained with their homes today have left the area due to the fire, according to authorities.

A ""slow burn"" was in progress during the night in the region, Sheriff Chitwood said. However, a ""direct drop"" of fire was observed, and fire"

In other words, we are talking, as usual. I'm not afraid to say it; of course the Colombian people are very unhappy because I see it. But we haven't thought that one through; we've had it from the beginning and we're in such a state that we have made a deal with the world, but we have never been aware of that fact. We have been living under the illusion that there was something that was going on behind a wall which nobody is able to reach. We have never understood that they have had a right to govern this country for the last three years and that they've been doing it in a more than transparent way and in an equally legitimate way; that they've never done a thing to stop the country from losing its wealth and from being ruled by thieves. In fact, they have brought the country to the last moment in which it was possible for everything to be taken away.

Write a news article based on the following summary: CNN Medical Unit assignment manager Ann Curley is a type I diabetic. She learned she had diabetes when she was 7 years old. Testing progressed from fizzy tablets in urine to continuous glucose monitors. With changes in technology have come improvements in prognoses.," However, at the age of 48 doctors can't find a way to confirm she's living the life she's supposed to, even though she's in good shape. She's been a type II diabetic for 33 years. What will they do with her now that she's obese?

The ""Mild"" Diabetic

In an interview, Curley explained the diagnosis as a small degree of kidney failure, and said she hadn't had a single kidney transplant. She was unable to gain weight, despite eating to fill her body with insulin. Her blood sugar dropped to 6.5, as a result of a hormone deficiency.

She learned that insulin resistance is an abnormal increase in blood glucose.

Her doctors believe her blood sugar was elevated even when she wasn't eating, and they believe that's what caused her blood sugar to drop below 6.5 mg/dL, even though she was eating.

Her doctor also believes it's important for her to stay off that insulin because the body can only take so many.

The ""Normal"" Diabetic

Curley is a type II diabetic who was born without kidneys, but is not obese. She took daily blood-sugar tests at 35, even though she's a size 18. She ate only five slices of bread per day at the time, and was at a healthy weight before her diagnosis.

Doctors have ruled out the possibility of having a genetic factor.

The ""Moderate"" Diabetic

Even though she is obese, the diet she has tried in the past has caused her blood sugar level to drop too slowly and her kidney function to drop and possibly stabilize.

She also does not drink or smoke and has tried to control her weight with exercise and weight-loss medications. Her blood sugar levels have been stable and she has not lost any weight. She feels that even though she is overweight and obese, she's still OK.

Her doctor suspects that even though she is considered obese, she may still be overweight due to the weight loss. He has said she is definitely still overweight if she's losing more than 2 pounds per week.

While this may also be because of her obesity's direct impact on the kidneys, an ""extreme"" diabetic would likely be more likely to have a genetic impact on this area.

How Can Someone with Type 1 Diabetes Survive and Function?


The answer for both is more than just calories, calories, and calories. Diabetes is the primary cause of blindness, amputations, and death in people with type 1 diabetes. These complications are most common for people who are obese, and even then they're less common in people who are overweight.

Here's what you can do if you have diabetes.

Make Sure You're Eating Enough Calories

While an overweight person can suffer fromAlmost all of the complications associated with diabetes are seen in people with Type 1 diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes is extremely complex. When obesity is a factor, the complications are almost impossible to prevent.

But if you are healthy without complications from diabetes, eat whatever you desire, especially healthy fat. That helps you stay in better shape for longer.

When you have good blood sugar, eating healthy meat can help keep you slim too. In fact, having good blood sugar is an important first step in staying healthy.

There are many ways to eat fat that not only help you lose weight and keep you slim, but also help prevent complications from diabetes.

Some of these ways will allow you to eat more vegetables, fruit, proteins, and healthy fat. For some people, it may be easier to eat less fat with healthier carb, protein, and salt choices.

Avoid Caloric Restriction

For healthy diets, there are many ways to include carbohydrates, however the best way to do this is to choose and try to limit calories to a balanced diet. Many people try to limit carbohydrates. While this may be a good thing to increase your weight loss efforts (and for weight loss, no one wants to weigh down the other person), restricting carbs to a healthy or balanced diet reduces insulin resistance and fat loss (by decreasing insulin sensitivity, which ultimately causes the body to lose fat).

There are other ways for people with Type 1 diabetes to eat and still maintain strong and healthy blood sugar, as well. Try not to eat too much, and limit carbs when they're not needed (like a serving of pasta or rice!). This will make it easier for them to control their blood sugar without restriction.

Reduce Your Meal Frequency

Although it may not be easy for someone with type 1 diabetes (and perhaps a lot of the people with Type 2 diabetes,"

The headline of the story should read ""Former Wales center Ray Gravell dies in Mallorcan hospital."" This will alert readers to the fact that Gravell had been battling cancer. However, by using these words, the story will also fail to mention that Gravell was a member of the British Lions since 2009. The article should state that former Welsh player Ray Gravell has died.

In June 2011, Gravell was diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent treatment, according to the International Business Times. The report stated that a few weeks before his death he'd lost 40 pounds because his weight had ballooned since his last cancer diagnosis.


In 2013, Gravell released the ""Bad Habit"" music video, which focused on his personal struggle with an eating disorder and how his cancer treatment affected his mind. His daughter, Kayla, said that the video ""is just a little snapshot of his life from the past month.""


Gravell has an 11-year-old son and a young daughter, Kayla, with his wife, Anna-Maria, who remains with her mother in Wales."

But lineup offends homosexuals, angered by appearance of anti-gay singer. Obama disavows preacher-singer's views, asks gay pastor to appear too."," The writer doesn't mention the controversy and never mentions the singer's name.

The Washington Post - December 23

Dateline USA ""This time around, Obama's campaign is using an old favorite: the rapper Big Poppa Doo and his provocative lyrics about women.... Last week, Obama's campaign went on the attack against the song in a radio ad that portrayed Big Poppa Doo as a misogynistic, homophobic misogynist, who should have received the apology he so richly deserved because he made light of sex. In this ad, which runs in 10 key swing states, the Obama campaign used Big Poppa Doo's words more often than most of the music he's featured in his campaign. Here are snippets from the ad:

The Obama campaign, however, did not say that Big Poppa Doo, a black man, advocated for homosexual sex. Instead, it said that he was ""hateful"" and that his comments were ""insensitive"". And the campaign accused the rapper of using hate speech to gain a larger audience. 'It's not right,"" Obama campaign spokesman Michael Morella said. 'We're just not going to let anyone's hate speech define the values that we stand for in Washington,' Morella said, referring to the campaign's ""Make the World a Better Place"" song in which the president sings lyrics comparing President Obama to Martin Luther King Jr. and other famous African American leaders.

The New York Times - July 24

The ad by the Obama campaign is an aggressive and confrontational portrayal—and one that might cause its critics to question the president's commitment to equality and justice. In the ad, titled ""Same Love,"" an image of Barack Obama with a rainbow flag—a tribute to the rainbow flag that was flown by many gay rights activists in 1989—flares across the screen.

""No politician can solve these problems on their own. But in President Barack Obama's America, he can and he has,"" the narrator of the ad states. ""We're bringing back America with a new vision: one of hope. And faith.""

The ad features a man who resembles Mr. Obama dancing and singing with his shirt opened to show a rainbow flag. A female voice says that a man who stands ""like he's a rebel"" is Mr. Obama's ""role model.""

""And, tonight, he's holding a special concert to unite America. Tonight, he's speaking out against bigots who would tear us apart. Tonight, he's speaking out for everybody. Tonight, he's standing up for all Americans.""

The campaign video says Mr. Obama's speech is ""the president's hope.""

The video calls Mr. Obama a ""strong, positive choice... to bring hope to this country.""

The ad concludes:"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: The company owns three major casino complexes, in Las Vegas and Macau. Venetian Casino Resort opened in 1999, originally consisted of 3,036 suites. In May 2004, Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macau."," The company later became a subsidiary of Cotai Inc., a Hong Kong-based company. The company has spent $150 billion on construction projects and is one of the major players in the casino industry.

The information you enter is identical to the information entered by each participant, so you can see if you have followed along as they told the story. However, it is the summary which you write and not the whole story so it's important to know what type of person you want to write for. For this test, we will go with a reporter and/or news anchor, who does not have a great deal of experience in the casino industry.

Step 1: Review the Questionnaires

If all goes well in your first step, the first thing you will notice is that the questionnaire is fairly easy, especially for those with little experience in the industry. On the test, we need to choose about six questions about you or their company. The questions we need to answer are:

Please describe how your company has been doing, specifically what type of work it has done.


Tell us about any past transactions involving you or your company, their value, and how much you paid for each.


Describe any other business ventures in which you are involved and how they are doing.


What are some industry-specific activities they do in the sector (e.g. gaming, telecommunications, banking and insurance) and tell us how that compares to similar sectors in different countries.


Describe how your company has evolved and why, especially if you feel it is more important to update investors.


Tell us about recent acquisitions or acquisitions that you have had in the past three years.


List three recent financial statements for your company.


Describe any other projects in which you are involved and how you feel the company has worked.


The questionnaires are designed to help us understand how you would like to be portrayed on an investor's agenda. Some of the questions will simply be about you or your company, whereas some might be about your current company, its competitors, its products or its services. As the interview does not take place between interviews, those are the only questions we have to ask.

How do you feel like you and your company will be portrayed on the investor's agenda? (This might lead to something like, ""Well, you have a small group of employees who actually do the work but the company has done some acquisitions, they can certainly do better and you have invested in a major casino so expect more profits if your company grows,"" or ""You also have a significant portion of your customers that are a potential threat to your company so expect many more customers."").

At the beginning of every interview, you will also have to fill in a survey about your company's success and growth over the past two years. Some of the questions are:

How long ago did your company first begin operating?


What has your company done during the past two years that you would tell investors about?


What is your company's most recent revenue stream?


What is your company's most recent revenue stream? When did your revenue stream start to increase?


What is your company's most recent cost control initiative?


I hope the above answers are as helpful at the beginning of a corporate interview as they are in your typical day in court. In fact, your first company interview is one of the most important steps in your corporate career – you might not meet likeable or likable executives or managers, but you definitely do want to be successful. So, take steps now!

You need to take these steps so you can prepare for the following one day of intensive corporate interviews. It's very important that you get your interview strategy in place before you even have to go to the interview site. If you fail to do this, this is a huge mistake because you will never know where you are or how best to approach the executives.

Step 2: Prepare Questions for the CEO and Other Executives

The next step you need to do is prepare the following questions to be posed to the CEOs of your company. Keep in mind that they have very different needs – you might want to focus your questions on the CEO and avoid any conversation about others on the interview site. Make sure that those questions are specific enough to help you get specific answers.

Here, you may feel overwhelmed in doing your research but don't leave it to chance. You need to remember that each day you will be speaking with someone who is very different from you and may not have fully understood what you are trying to say. The next time he or she says something that surprises you, make sure you can back up"

""Directed assignments"" will be enforced if enough officers don't volunteer in Iraq. Rice: Department doing ""everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats"" One official calls order to serve in Iraq ""a potential death sentence"""," for U.S. diplomats.

And last week, Rice was asked why the Department was telling military officers in an Aug. 25 memo to avoid working in Iraq and other countries under sanctions, even if the order gave them the authority to do so.

Sally Ward, director of the Office of Foreign Missions, said in an email that she was asked not to answer the question ""because the Department does not wish to jeopardize any ongoing missions.""

She said that State Department spokespersons and congressional liaison staff were asked the same question in 2010. ""I find it remarkable that a congressional employee who has worked directly for the Secretary of State for twenty-two years would be in this position,"" she said in an email.

In the meantime, some military officers are refusing to take orders. The Army's 1st Lt. Stephen Schatz of San Diego said his brigade commander said he would not give him additional military duty to deal with Iraq. In October, he said he sent letters saying he would ""voluntarily"" accept additional military duty.

A retired Army colonel who was the Army's top Iraq adviser said he had concerns about the direction of U.S. troops because of the recent U.S. military action.

""I don't understand the motivation of the president to send combat jobs or soldiers forward,"" said the retired colonel, whose military career included service in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. ""I think we need to understand the motives of the administration to justify what they're planning to do."""

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Navy says it has lost confidence in officer's ability to command. Crew members on sub disciplined for faking inspection records, Navy says. Ten people have been relieved of duty; six received ""nonjudicial punishment"""," with thepathy of prison officials. One Navy officer was ""pierced"" with a pen or knife, fired; two denied doing anything wrong. Two Navy personnel reported they were assaulted that night.

This is, in fact, quite true and not just because of the incident which occurred within the Navy and Marine Corps. And in any case, the whole thing is utterly ridiculous.

The facts for that alleged ""incident"" are pretty weak, and it shows the true depths to which some Navy and Marine Corps personnel will stoop to defend themselves from any accusation that they lie, that is, deny that something occurred or otherwise deceive about the facts.

First, a few words about the alleged ""incident"" which, by the way, resulted in the firing of the Navy Marine officer in question. Specifically, the account of ""incident.""

An incident is only ""incident,"" meaning that Navy officials ""filed a formal complaint against the officer,"" according to a Navy official interviewed by Politico, when there is nothing to substantiate or charge in a formal complaint, and the investigation is concluded. Further, if the investigation results in no discipline, then the Navy official, who has no authority to discipline the officer, can simply file a ""No Action Report,"" which simply leaves out a ""No Action Report"" of no discipline in the entire case.

Navy policy is clear about the incident that took place on April 10 – April 12 – ""in the period immediately following the initial inspection of the LCS-1 (LCS-1 is the ship the Navy is testing for its eventual replacement)."" The Navy inspector general is now concluding that ""the evidence shows that [the officer] exaggerated the results of multiple inspections,"" according to a Navy official. That ""evidence shows he provided false information to his superior officers, including his commanding officer,"" ""who took action to correct the record."" What happened? The official went so far as to describe exactly what happened:

The commanding officer, who approved the Navy inspection of the LCS … ordered the commander of the vessel to not only accept [the officer's] version of events but to make it the official record of what actually happened. The commanding officer ordered the officer to return to [the ship] with copies of his records to be included in the paperwork that he signed … and he was transferred to the administrative assistant position at the Naval Sea Systems Command, where he was removed from his position and transferred to administrative duty.

In short, the Navy alleges that the ""captain and staff officer … were motivated by insubordination toward their superior, not by misbehavior"" on the part of the officer. The Navy officer reportedly fabricated his ""results,"" made up his ""explanation for the discrepancies,"" and gave the impression, apparently not without basis, to his superiors that he had lied to them. His ""account of the incident"" was ""fabricated"" as well. The Navy's ""manifest unwillingness"" to fire him (the official's own words) ultimately is that of ""unwavering devotion to doing the right thing, even if it's wrong.""

A similar thing happened with someone who was allegedly responsible for falsifying the Naval Academy's own records. It happened in 2012, too. He went to administrative duty (again, in that case, as ""administrative assistant""). A ""management team"" investigated his ""account"", in violation of numerous Navy policy rules: ""The team found no instances of fabrication."" The Navy said that it took no action.

There isn't an accident here, I'm afraid. This story is about the person, who took the Navy and Marine Corps to task because they want, again, to believe that this was a ""misbehavior."" To believe, that is, that an officer in uniform intentionally lied or misrepresented their history to his superiors.

It's also about the Navy and Marine Corps taking the position that if only somebody were to go in the exact opposite direction… if they thought there really was no other way to handle this, they would have investigated.

That officer in question had served only a couple of years as a senior executive officer – in fact, the person served in the Navy for only about six months, and didn't get promoted to any command. He didn't ""misanthrop [sic] the record"" of others. He didn't do ""the wrong thing."" He didn't ""distort history."" What he did was, according to his own written account and what he actually told his commanders, lie.

The point is just this:

The Navy and Marine Corps may well believe this, and they may think it's morally consistent. Why else would they want to believe that they are being held"

Tractor-trailer crashmilitary truck collision


This is a real scene that happened in 2012. The accident happened at 12:45streets in the city of Memphis, Tennessee. A white truck crashed into a light pole near 8th and W. 11th Street. The driver of the truck, 30-year-old Steven Bostic Jr., was killed and his passenger, 22-year-old Tariya Lunsford, was severely injured. She was transported to a nearby hospital with multiple lacerations and is expected to survive. He was apparently not wearing a seat belt at the time he lost control in a high-speed collision, causing the truck to cross a median. The hit-and-run driver of the tractor-trailer was also killed in the crash. Police say they believe it was accident-caused. They are still investigating the other part of the crash when the truck hit the light pole. If you are following me, I got it from here on.

Lunsford is still here, now and is being treated, by the hospital. Her boyfriend was also critically injured and is also in a coma in what is going on at the hospital. It's not possible to tell yet how she will make a recovery.

As for Bostic, he was charged with manslaughter and the violation of a court order. He was eventually convicted for the manslaughter charges, but the judge has not set any sentence at this time.

If you're following this, you know there's nothing quite like being in the middle of a freeway accident.

Tractor-trailer collision


Here's a real crash that happened back in 2005 near the University of Toledo, Ohio. A tractor trailer overturned on Interstate 75 while trying to avoid a semi driving on the same highway and striking another tractor trailer. The tractor trailer lost control on the exit ramp and overturned onto the ground. A passenger in one of the semi's was also trapped in the overturned trailer. No one was seriously injured in the wreck.


To top it all off, the driver of the other semi, 22-year-old Brian Houser, was charged with five counts of felonious assault of a high and aggravated nature and one count of battery on an officer, after he allegedly struck a Toledo police officer with his pickup truck.

Truck hit semi


This road rage accident happened a while back in the state of Illinois. A truck collided with a semi truck and a taxi cab then flipped the cab over on the side of a hill leading to the freeway. The semi driver was able to escape the overturned truck by jumping out of the cab, when the truck rolled over and crashed. It's unknown whether or not he was wearing a seat belt at the time.

The semi driver, 24-year-old Matthew McPherson, was injured in the accident, but according to local police said he was able to walk away from the wreckage.

Other road rage accidents

I drove my bike yesterday. It was on a city street, and I saw a truck driving with its window down. At that time, the front end of the truck was in the intersection with a stop light on the left side of the street. As I approached the intersection, some cars were turning so close to my bike that you had to swerve left to turn right. I had never seen or heard of a vehicle causing a dangerous intersection by driving with its window shut before. I thought to myself that truck drivers, drivers who are not looking in any direction but the road, would understand.

The following is what I witnessed:I was heading home when I saw a truck parked next to a crosswalk a block from my home. In the video, the truck kept driving past the crosswalk. From the video of my stop sign, I did not see an intersection. As we walked up a small hill (100 meters away), several pedestrians were walking left to right in front of the intersection. No one got out of their vehicles and walked toward the truck. As we passed, one person got out of the truck and started to cross his arms before I could see him. I had time to take my camera out and start filming as I crossed across PubMed to avoid them. As I was crossing, a young girl who was behind me turned"
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Kelly Pless started gaining as a teen and weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest. Exercise and an ""eat to live"" eating philosophy helped her shed 95 pounds. Pless started out walking but now runs 40 miles a week. She is training to run two marathons this winter."," Pless, 27, is hoping for a second pro running career. She says her diet of vegetables and fruits and a low-carb, low-fat diet have helped her.

""I felt a lot of anxiety about losing weight,"" said Pless, who lives in Seattle. ""I wasn't sure if I was still good enough"" to complete a marathon, she said.

Pless is not alone; marathoners are often among the fatest members.

According to the nonprofit Health at Every Size, nearly half of American adults are clinically obese. Many people worry that having a healthy body is easy to look at on the outside — when they're actually more at danger of gaining it all off.

This week, HES released a video that is aimed at increasing runners' awareness of their condition. It featured runner and author Kelly Johnson, known for her blog ""Fit Mom, Eat Honey."" It also featured two popular YouTube users, who talked about their struggles with weight gain or other health issues.

Here is a clip of an account that is similar to Pless' story:

""Most people think, 'OK, no matter what, if you weigh 80 pounds you shouldn't weigh 200 pounds,' and they can probably just get into their car and go to their local grocery store or McDonald's,"" Johnson said in a new video. ""But that's all right, because of a system of food regulations, they can get away with it.""

Other health advocates have voiced concerns about a culture that makes it easier for people to gain weight and other risks to health.

""No matter how they get there — whether there's a sugar rush or something else — there's not a lot of information to help you, to educate you as to what it is and what its effects are,"" said Denise O'Dea the senior vice president of community relations for the National Eating Disorders Association, who has worked with a number of runners. ""What is known is generally bad,"" like high-calorie, high-fat food. O'Dea said that she feels runners' body image often influences how they feel about themselves, but that there is nothing wrong with weight gain.

""It's just a matter of perspective,"" she said.

The running community can do something about the perception that it is easier to gain weight than lose it.

This year, the Running USA Foundation, which promotes the sport, issued a list of suggestions on how to lose weight. For runners, that's ""don't go too fast or too easy"" through dieting and ""eat more fruits and vegetables,"" said Matt Johnson, chairman of Running USA.

The full story:


The Times' editorial page is often a mirror of public opinion, a place where the public reaches back, takes stock and looks forward.

On March 12, that's exactly what happened.

One day before, President Obama met with Genarlow Wilson on the Oval Office couch, where they talked about the challenges for minorities, who make up a disproportionate share of bothLearndoors in the federal prison system and in the nation's police forces. On Friday, the president will give one of these speeches.

As this column shows, readers have been eager to read that analysis. (It's also true that the Times did an awful and largely inaccurate job, and it has apologized. Nevertheless, it has made this editorial page a center of news interest. And you can read the actual speech here, via The Seattle Times.)

Still, when the president did the speech, readers felt compelled to reach out, expressing their anger at his words and their frustrations on the ground.

Here's the back page from The Times' story of the speech:


It was a long, long time coming.

In 2008 after receiving a life sentence for being a co-conspirator in a sexual assault he didn't commit, Wilson left public housing and moved in with family and friends.

When The Times asked Wilson last year about the decision to turn his life around, he replied with a simple answer: ""The best thing to do is to accept the consequences of your own decisions.""

So as a reminder for what Mr. Obama told the young gang leader, here's the President's remarks:"

*UPDATE*

NBC News has confirmed that the fatalities and injuries in the crash were all Utahns. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) announced Wednesday morning that the Utah Highway Patrol's (USHP) accident reconstruction team has completed its investigation into the crash that injured nine people.

The USHP accident reconstruction team, comprised of representatives from various agencies, determined that the bus collided with a vehicle when it was traveling between 32 and 40 miles per hour. The cause of the collision was a loss of control caused by operator error. One USHP trooper remains in critical but stable condition, and six troopers with minor injuries were transported to local hospitals.

USHP says they believe the bus driver may have been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash. However, the exact substance content of these beverages is unknown, and there were no reports of the driver having any medical issues to justify this being the case.

The State Fire Marshal's Office also responded to the scene and cleared the scene. Utah Division of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) inspectors were called out to the scene after the crash, after which OSHA recommended that the bus's driver receive a 20% time reduction in driving instruction and 15 hours of community service in addition to a license suspension. The crash remains under investigation by OSHA and USHP.

Utah County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Sherrie Whalen-Shallack says the NTSB is leading the investigation with the USHP and it's unknown at this time what led up to the accident. She says the cause of the accident will be determined once the investigation is complete.

Whalen-Shallack explains that there are two types of crashes in the US. ""Anywhere there is a bus going, there's a crash,"" she tells NBC News.

The NTSB has a special unit that investigates all type of vehicle-related collisions. The NTSB accident reconstruction team has worked in conjunction with the NTSB's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. The NTSB accident reconstruction team consists of members from the NTSB Office of Investigations, its Research and Training Division and the NTSB's Operations and Forensic Technology Division.

""The NTSB accident reconstruction team is dedicated to preserving and improving the lives of motor vehicle crash victims through its extensive accident reconstruction efforts. ""Through its exhaustive crash studies, the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) has found"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Rubbish is piling up on the streets of Naples, with municipal dumps full. Many commentators question the role of the local mafia in the award of contracts. More than $2.5B in emergency funds has been spent on the problem over the years. One dump was going to be a golf course -- residents furious it is being re-opened."," A local judge tells me that ""we could really use the money."" If this sounds like a country with a serious garbage problem, you're not alone: In the past few years, public outcry has given rise to a municipal service organization (MSNO), the city's municipal garbage collector. MSNO has become the go-to resource of many municipal departments and a major source of funding. I'm working as a writer on a film about the cleanup of the dump, called The Biggest Trash. I want to share what I've found about Naples' garbage problem with you. What I heard, learned, and saw while doing research in Naples is a story of corruption and bureaucracy. It's also a story of a nation trying to rebuild. To hear it properly, you need to know a little bit about the culture and history of the mafia. It's a story that is all too familiar in today's city of Naples. We're using a different name in Italian, in order to avoid naming people. And it will most certainly not be called Italy's ""dirty war."" What's wrong with us?


The mafia has never had much interest in waste disposal – it has other things to worry about. But they were willing to help out the city in the right way – and in some cases, to make huge contributions to it – because of money.


By the early 1800s, the Italian mafia controlled almost every level of government, from the police to the mayor. They were a wealthy and powerful people, with a reputation for corruption. They owned a wealth of property. They had extensive networks of criminals and thugs, who were at the city government's beck and call.

When you have this wealth of property, all the work was done to take care of it.

They were a major political force in Naples, even though they had an average political influence in other areas – such as law.

The Mafia helped make Naples a garbage dump, the reason they were allowed to keep the land it held. The most successful mafia bosses didn't do the dirty jobs (like garbage piling up). They did big garbage jobs.

It is widely known, on both sides of the Atlantic, that there was a conspiracy by the mafia to take over other governments in southern and central Europe. That did not happen in Italy, either, and Italy's government was much better able to combat it.


How is Naples's garbage problem still in the public spotlight? It's important, because of both its importance as an international city and because it's becoming a national conversation point, at least because of Italy's recent presidential visit to Florence (I've made the trip here also, but I won't say anything more about the mayor or his visit).


The biggest question I've received (I know there are a ton of others). The only thing missing for this story is where the garbage has all gone.


Let the garbage pile up, says people. But don't let it pile up on private property. Just give the mafia some jobs, because these guys know where everything goes. They are not going to mess with the mess, if it's important.

Well, as it happens, they certainly are not, which is one reason, so far, the mafia does not have a major role in the process to clear the dumps.


To understand what the mafia is really up to, you have to know about local mafia – and it exists just as it does in the rest of Italy. Its role is to clean up and bury garbage, and if you have a city of this size, you have to do it all.


In Naples, a town of 200,000 inhabitants, the population was just 12,300 back in 1981 (it is now about 400,000). As the old mayor of Naples, I've been involved in the management and construction of what for a half century was the largest dumping ground in Italy. It's the sort of city where most people aren't aware of the magnitude of the garbage problem.


I will admit that I am not a garbage worker, and that I didn't really have a hand in the operation. But I am an experienced journalist, and this is how I got into the story of the garbage problem, starting from the dump's origins. But let me tell you, I learned a lot here. Here are some quotes from the story:

There aren't enough workers to take care of the job, so the mafia hires them. And there aren't enough people to do the jobs, either.

This garbage dump's history goes back to the 1990s, when"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Ralph Lauren began as tie salesman from the Bronx. First design: Wide ties when others were narrow. Has designed high fashion for four decades. Goal: Glamorous clothing that is ""consistent and accessible"""," in a ""fashion world dominated by extreme extremes."" Says his first design is inspired by the classic black cocktail dress of the 1960s.

Singer-songwriter with ""Crazy"" hit ""Wrecking Ball."" He also was an original member of the '90s girl group TLC and has a new album due out Aug. 4. Born Randy Lyness in New Jersey, he is now 25.

""The other day in the grocery store it turned out that he was my cousin. I've known him since I was born. And I thought, 'Dude, maybe I'd like you, you look very nice and you're from a nice neighborhood.' But it turns out he came from the town. You know, I think he got kicked out of school after that when they tried to cut him up for doing drugs, which was a disgrace. It was a real shame, but he got in trouble anyways.

He's got this big mustache and he's not even wearing a tie. And he's wearing a black-and-white jersey, which is funny because he actually wears black and white jerseys and ties and turtlenecks now, I think. But I don't think that's him. I think that's his cousin or whatever. But it was really the sweater that inspired us. He said to just bring it to my house and put it on. So I'm thinking I want to do some cool sweaters but I actually wear all brown and gray, especially in those days.

So he comes over on Friday and he's wearing this sweater and it's really a classic jacket. And I say, 'What is that?'""

They have a quick moment and then he gets it over his head. But it doesn't seem too good. When I mentioned that the shirt reads ""Klown,"" he says, ""It means, like, kill him."" And he says, 'Do it.' ""

My dad is very politically incorrect. I think that's what is so interesting, you know, is how different he is from the people I grew up with, who have these very progressive principles in regard to how they look or what they wear. And my dad was so incredibly liberal, but he didn't really express it in that way. That says something because his values do have an underlying color, but it's not necessarily red and white.

When he came home from the wars, my mom would always say how he couldn't really have spent the time back in the states with those people like me who were so young then. He said, 'Well you couldn't be on TV, but you'd be a celebrity.' And my mom goes, 'Why would you be a celebrity?' And he says, 'Well, I don't have money' and she says, 'Well, you could have, but don't play games.'

I think because he was so comfortable in the public eye, he didn't really feel that much of the need to express his values the way he should have because he didn't want to draw attention to himself. He didn't necessarily agree with me, so that probably made it harder for him to do the things that were most important to him -- like go out to eat with his friends. Maybe he just didn't want to get into trouble. Or maybe he was just more politically incorrect and not into talking about himself or going out with all the people his friends were with.

Like you said, it's funny, because my dad would never bring the sweater home. But it did, of course, get mentioned in conversation once. If anything we did was in front of him. For a while we'd go out. And it would be funny, you know, because that's how we related to each other, Community-wise, so it was almost like a form of shorthand to talk about the people that surround us -- you know, the family.

Do you think that a lot of people associate the way you dress with the way that you present yourself? Or you've got to be really self-conscious of that, because you're playing a part in a bigger show and you're working on some major projects so it's sort of in the eye of the beholder.

You know, for a while we did go out, but I don't think that was because we took the sweater home. It wasn't really because we just wanted to be nice to one another, but because we knew that our families would find out. But it's not the same as going out and going to see the band playing and being like, 'Oh, we go out.' No, I don't think that's the point. That's not my job -- to"

The second-hand car market is booming. A 2014 study found that only 5 percent of Americans who are 50 and more can't find a new car within a year. This trend helps explain why the majority of Americans who want a used car—80 percent, according to an AutoTrader.com survey—choose new vehicles. What used cars and trucks are getting in the mix is an increasing concentration of desirable (and low-cost) cars, while a majority of buyers are opting for cheaper brands, like Mercedes-Benz to Porsche. The rise of used car prices has become a concern to traditional carmakers; it's not even the only problem. This year the Consumer Reports vehicle-mapping company estimated that $1,600 in new car-buying costs can be incurred due to the high amount that used cars are losing.

While car buyers may feel the weight of rising car prices, they may not see it as much of a problem. ""They are not always aware of the value of their car when they consider buying a used car,"" says J. David Siegel, a professor of marketing at the University of Michigan. ""In any given year, buyers will have a much better idea about a used car when they see it up close. When they look closely, however, it's not that different from what they are used to seeing.""

When looking at used cars, Siegel says, it's important to make a note of potential problems. ""Look for major, expensive problems,"" he says. ""Check for body damage, rust, excessive rust, brake rotors, air-conditioning and power steering fluids—everything else will hurt buyers' evaluation of the car.""

In the new-car world, Siegel says, consumers can be expected to do their due diligence before signing a sale contract with the seller. ""Look for signs of a problem. Buyers want to know that the car is safe—a quality-assurance inspection and an inspection or service are crucial part of the deal.""

If there's a seller in a low-ratio market, it doesn't put buyers off buying a car. It's just asking for one more thing to get a deal: the brand the car's been in. A buyer who has had a new caragin' with the seller's used car could be inclined to take the same route. It could be the only way for him to save some cash. And while there's a reason so many used cars are coming with significant scratches or dents, says Siegel, ""that's only an indication that the car isn't the original or has been altered for sale or trade."" If there is paint blemishes and other significant damage, he says, ""the car is likely to be worth less than the sticker price.""

A Used Car Is Usually Worth The Cost Of A New Car

Although this article focuses on used car prices in the new car world, the trend applies equally to used cars. The main difference, as evidenced by the AutoTrader.com study, is that a used car on the used car market typically goes for around half what a new car would. For sale in the late stages of production—with limited availability—a car can command as much as $1,800 more than an equivalent new car.

In the late stages of production, the sale price for vehicles is expected to be reduced significantly, according to Siegel. The lower production in many large American automakers means that used cars are not only selling at more affordable prices—they're selling at lower prices than new cars, too.

""The majority of used cars are getting an even better deal than new cars,"" says Siegel. ""The same car might be selling for $7,500 or $7,650. So a $1,750 used car on the used car market would be selling for $6,000 on the new car market. That's a 30 percent price reduction in a week."" The more cars available, he says, the more profit is to be made—which is why used cars are becoming easier to find.

On the used car market, it's not uncommon to see cars with all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-drive, and all-wheel-drive. Even though all cars have a certain spec, a certain ""brand ID,"" it's rare that we see used cars with an 8-liter engine at all. The majority of used vehicles now are sold with a 4-cylinder engine"

In the Florida Senate race, Democrat Patrick Murphy is trying to show how he's different from Republicans in that he's a Democrat who's been an elected official on Capitol Hill for more than a decade. He's spent 10 years as finance chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign arm. And his opponent, Jeb Bush, has said he's more concerned about his own presidential campaign than about trying to get things done. ""This is essentially a negative campaign that is basically just trying to tear Scott Murphy down and then run to the next Republican primary,"" Manley added. ""And if he can't win without the 'Breath' attack, as they call this negative campaign, how are you going to win with it? And that's exactly what they're doing."" In a recent ad, Murphy warns: ""This election doesn't just matter to Floridians, it matters to the country."" ""We're going to see a continuation of the status quo and a continuation of the same failed policies from the last eight years,"" said Democrat Tim Johnson, another former congressman and finance chairman of the GOP's campaign arm.

Marco Rubio of Florida is looking to stay in, having been the lone Republican to back the original healthcare bill that the House passed last summer. And in Nevada, Republican Dean Heller is battling former Gov. Brian Sandoval to be their successor. The two men, both considered competitive in 2018, were at odds earlier this year over a proposed fee on Internet companies to help pay for their broadband plans. Sandoval wanted to cap those fees at a percentage of the state's gross income. Heller said he wanted those fees kept low - about $2 per household. Sandoval proposed raising them to 4 percent of gross income. A poll released on Oct. 12 by Public Policy Polling had Heller holding a slim one-point lead over Sandoval over reelection next year.""I think we're going to see a lot more of this,"" said former President George W.

I believe we acted appropriately at all times. The State Department official, speaking on background, explains the need for Secretary Clinton's emails to be turned over.

The House panel also voted to subpoena James Blair, former chief of staff to secretary of state Colin Powell and later co-chairman of the presidential transition team for George W. Bush, for his testimony about Blackwater and Prince's company.

Powell testified to the House committee that he wasn't aware the company had any contract work in Iraq.

Prince testified to the committee that Powell told him to remove the words ""unarmed"" from the documents Blackwater submitted to the State Department and other documents. The State Department later discovered that the words ""unarmed"" were in a ""draft"" memo created on the weekend before the deadly Sept. 11, 2004, attacks on the World Trade Center.

Fact File

The story

A helicopter carrying four crewmembers lost power a few hours before sunrise Sunday on the runway at Aviano Air Base on the northern coast of Italy.

The helicopter had been on the ground for 10 days. It was carrying the Italian coast guard's search and rescue crew when it lost power on a day that also marked the end of Italy's summer season.

Italian officials say the chopper, carrying an Italian Coast Guard crew, was heading from Sardinia to the island of Lampedusa, the westernmost of Italy's three main Aegean islands. During Saturday's flight its oxygen system failed and passengers were forced to abandon the plane.

The plane had landed at Aviano, a short drive fromarguably the best skiing resort in the country, before taking off from its designated landing area around 10:10 a.m. local time.

Italian officials say four people died after the missing helicopter crashed into a mountain. Two others suffered some kind of serious injury.

Flight records show that the aircraft was in air for over 11 hours but lost contact with ground tracking radars with a maximum altitude of about 10,000 feet.

Italian media claim a white plane carrying four people was on its way to Aviano from Sardinia a few hours before it lost power.

The pilot has been airlifted to a private hospital in a Rome suburb.

According to a statement from the Italian Coast Guard:

""The search and rescue teams have so far reached five people injured in the crash but two survivors are in serious condition. A fire and smoke is still emerging from the wreckage, while the helicopter crashed in a mountain on the ground. The aircraft is presumed to have crashed in the middle of a storm.""

One Italian TV station reports:

""The missing pilot has been identified by the Italian Coast Guard as an Air Force lieutenant, aged 39, by his initials. The helicopter is believed to have landed around 10.30 a.m. local time on Sunday.""

Italian media reports say that the deceased were members of a search-and-rescue mission but the helicopter is thought to have crashed in the mountains. One Italian media report says a helicopter with 14 crew members was on its way from Sardinia on its way to the island of Lampedusa.

Aviano residents and local news agencies are reporting that the missing helicopter was a L-130 military transport plane.

The National Disaster Response Coordination Centre (CONRAD) said it had not received any distress calls. The agency said it was also working closely with Italian authorities on the search for survivors.

Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the tragedy ""a reminder of the risks posed by helicopters in dangerous conditions.""

""The Ministry has been in contact with the Italian authorities, and we are coordinating with air transport organizations to ensure that the necessary actions are taken,"" the ministry said in the statement.

Formal notification will be sent by Friday.

The Coast Guard helicopters are equipped with P3 Orion aircraft equipped with the Aisaka P3S-3 radar system.

Aviano is one of Italy's largest aerospace factories. It was the first to have helicopters in 1948."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: University of Memphis athlete Taylor Bradford, 21, was shot September 30. Three charged with murder in perpetration of attempted aggravated robbery. After player was shot, he got in his car, drove off and then crashed into a tree. The killing spurred school officials to temporarily lock down the campus."," Authorities called for the manhunt and the lockdown of the campus in all but name. The police also identified the suspect.

What We Know

Taylor Bradford, 21, suffered a gunshot wound to his chest. Three people were charged with first-degree murder in his killing. They were named as:

Cedric G. Foster, 20, of Memphis

Shawn W. Green, 20, of Memphis

Jordan E. Johnson, 19, of Memphis

Taylor Bradford was the student who was murdered. Authorities had a list of the names of some of the university's other students, but in this case the public has the name of each student who was killed. Those are listed below by school.

University of Memphis.

University of Louisiana at Monroe.

University of New Orleans.

University of Notre Dame.

University of Kansas.

University of Kentucky.

Wyoming.

Duke University.

University of Mississippi.

University of North Carolina.

University of South Carolina.

University of South Carolina, Columbia.

University of Texas at Austin.

University of Virginia.

University of West Georgia.

University of Toledo and University of Florida at Gainesville also faced charges in connection with Bradford's death.

The Memphis man is listed as 5-foot-5 and 185 pounds. Police said he has a small tattoo of the initials T.A.R.C.H. on his right shoulderblade. He was wearing light green shoes and a dark hooded sweats frog on his head.

He is in stable condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and is undergoing surgery.

Police said at the time that he had been shot in a nearby parking lot.

""I just want to tell everyone that we will continue to put this guy in jail and get justice for these people,"" said University President R. Bowen Loftin before the lockdown was lifted. ""He took a life and a student. We will continue to do everything we can.""

Police have the motive in Bradford's killing, which was first reported by WREG-TV.

According to police, the shooting occurred about 9:10 p.m. Sept. 30 in the 1000 block of North 3rd Street.

While the motive is still unclear, the University issued this statement on Sunday: ""We don't know what motivated (Bradford's) actions, but our priority at this time is to provide help and safety for those who need it.""


The shooting came one week after another deadly shooting occurred at University of Memphis. Police said the shooting happened about 9:22 p.m. Sept. 26 at the intersection of impression Ave. and 1st St.

The shooting also came after the release of a 911 call made by an unidentified man. That call was sent on Sept. 26 to the University of Memphis Police Department, and it included the shooting suspect's call to say he had been shot and was suffering from injuries to his chest and head.

According to the University, police had identified the man, but he wasn't arrested at the time, and there was no other evidence to link him to the shooting.

A witness told WREG-TV that he drove the victim home. The witness said the shooter had been involved in a recent incident at the University's football complex. The witness said he was surprised when police did not follow up on the story.

One thing is certain, however. The university is getting ready for what could be a busy holiday weekend.

Students who wanted to be a part of the lockdown would have to go to the University's Main Building, located on the east side of campus, which is near the football complex. Students will also have to pick up their driver's license, which will be valid until the end of the holiday weekend.

Police have been called to the campus and other areas on Monday for similar incidents.

Bail bondsman tells judge O.J. Simpson never paid him. DA says Simpson violated bail terms by leaving message for co-defendant.","

SUMMARIES

Simpson would have left a message for the co-defendant, Ronald Goldman. According to the Los Angeles Times, the call was made around 8:30 a.m. Friday and Simpson was later arrested on suspicion of failing to appear out of court or the Los Angeles County Jail after he was scheduled to appear for a bond hearing. The bail was set at $250,000.

""Mr. Goldman has cooperated with the authorities since his arrest. He has cooperated completely with the investigation. He's provided all the requested documents,"" said Lisa Bloom, an attorney for Goldman, in response to Fox's story.

Simpson would have left letters to attorneys representing both women.

SUMMARY

The case has been referred to Los Angeles County district attorney Jackie Lacey, who could file charges. Lacey's office said Simpson was held on $1.2 million bail pending a court hearing on Tuesday (Feb. 25), where his lawyer, Michael A. Ferman, and defense attorneys will argue that his bail should be increased because he didn't show up for a bond hearing on Friday morning either. The judge, U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert J. Fox, then reduced O.J. Simpson's bail to $25,000 for each of the two women in relation to a request from the prosecutor for a $1.3 million bond and then $250,000 bail for the first-degree murder trial.

Simpson is now being held on $250,000 bail in lieu of $1.3 million bail

The DA's office said their argument was ""unwarranted.""

""They should allow the defendant to be freed,"" Bloom said Monday night, ""without imposing a disproportionate sentence without the possibility of conviction.""

The DA's office also issued a notice saying that the next hearing on Tuesday will determine the amount of bail.

SUMMARY

The DA's office is currently prosecuting Simpson on a single count of first degree murder, for which if convicted he could face the death penalty.

O.J. Simpson has been arrested on charges of second-degree murder, for which if convicted he could face life in prison.

Simpson has made numerous claims that his friend and former fiancee Nicole Brown Simpson was killed in a jealous rage in June 1994 because of a ""loose commitment"" between Simpson and Brown. O.J. Simpson has always denied these allegations. The case has been referred to Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey, who could file charges.

The DA's office said Wednesday that there will be two hearings prior to the final hearing set for Tuesday in the case, in which they said they would argue that as the trial moves forward, the bail should be increased to $250 million. Bloom said her organization has made a formal request to Fox for an increase, which is set to happen in a few hours.

The DA's office believes Simpson should not be released on bail as the case is in the early stages and is also seeking more documents and depositions, as well as another bond hearing.

The DA's office added that they have received some information regarding a letter which was reportedly made by Simpson.

In the letter, allegedly written by Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, the two women allegedly accuse one of Simpson's former girlfriends, Barbara Corcoran, of threatening to kill Brown.

The letter said Brown left messages on Simpson's phone threatening to ""cut up"" Michael's and O.J.'s throats.

The letter goes on to say that Brown would ""pay [A.B.] $50,000 every week until A.B. paid [A.B.] to leave,"" and the two women had a heated argument in 2007. Brown had allegedly cut ties with Michael in 2005 over an alleged affair involving Michael, while Brown has continued to talk about having an affair with another man named Rudy Guede.

The DA's office said the letter could have come from Simpson's wife, which they said is the key argument against Simpson's release.

The DA's office also said that they believe they would have to show that the letter was written by one of Nicole Brown Simpson's relatives, like Simpson's first cousin or Simpson's former neighbor Mark Fuhrman, who wrote the letter.

Simpson's first cousin, Ron Goldman, told the Daily Mail he got the letter.

A CHILD OF A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST A CHILD A CHILD OF A MANWHO HAS BEENCHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST A CHILD

An affidavit filed by Chester County Prosecuting Attorney John M. Chidley says a mother ""in good faith"" believes that her daughter, a young woman in the care of a woman in Chester County, was sexually abused a decade ago.

It's the first known accusation against Trent Bayless, 33, since he was charged with raping a 3-year-old girl at a family home in September. Authorities allege Bayless inappropriately touched the girl while she was strapped into a backboard chair at a home in Cheshire Township. The girl told them she wanted to go out while Bayless was there and she told him she would ""never do that again,"" the affidavit states.

Family members have agreed that not having Bayless in their lives will help victims of sexual assault, and the mother has spoken openly about the issue, according to the affidavit filed by Chidley.

The mother first said on Sept. 23 that Bayless had abused his teenage daughter, then said there was a sexual contact between Bayless and his daughter that was more explicit.

According to the affidavit, when authorities came to the home two other girls had been tied into the chair, and those girls said they were tied too. At that time, the mother's ""attention had turned"" to whether Bayless had sexually abused the 6-year-old girl who was then tied into the chair.

A couple days before the abuse allegations came to light, Bayless stopped paying child support to a woman and was on probation for a previous probation violation, according to court records.

In fact, a police detective had even taken Bayless to jail when he had not paid child support. But by then he had changed his number and he was able to pay the child support.

In August, the mother asked Chidley to help investigate Bayless because she didn't have a source of income. Chidley said this was because she had no children of her own and she didn't trust Bayless to keep his word. Instead of filing a complaint, he thought it wouldn't help to wait, and filed a case with Chester County authorities.

When the allegations came to light, Chidley said his office was investigating Bayless himself. He said Bayless has been cooperative, but didn't comment Monday on whether he believes Bayless raped his daughter.

At the time of the abuse allegation, Trent Bayless's mother was living with the mother of Tylat Bayless, 24. Tylat Bayless also lives with his father, 24. The parents live in Chester County.

Tylat said his father met her at a party in Chester County. He said he met her at a party in Chester County"
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Sen. Hillary Clinton defends vote on resolution, saying ""it's not a law"" Sen. Barack Obama: President could use Iran measure to justify military action. Obama says Clinton's vote for resolution shows ""flawed"" judgment. Differences with Clinton will be clear in ""next phase"" of campaign, Obama says."," Sen. Bob Graham: Clinton says that Senate resolution ""tortured"" Israel by not imposing penalties on Iran, and by adding to the Iranian nuclear program to give the White House leverage over the Middle East.

The Washington Post is not normally the first newspaper to report something as significant as a resolution of a pending war. Most wars are more of a public relations event, like sending bombers to shoot things out behind enemy lines. This resolution was much more than that. It was an act of war. And not just against any foreign government, which is a far cry from any foreign country — it was an act of war against a country that the international community had never formally recognized, recognized as a member of the United Nations, the United Nations' flagship body. If these countries were to accept that they were now under attack from a second-rate regional power, then they were in peril of being labeled as so by the world. In fact, the whole point of the United Nations is to prevent that sort of ""bait and switch"" war.

There are many possible explanations for why Hillary Clinton opposed this resolution, but there are two that I see most frequently. First, it seemed politically expedient, as with Clinton's vote for the Iran treaty. And this was more of a decision made in the public sector than the private sector — it would have been preferable to let Clinton carry out that decision instead of having it made by the White House, as did the agreement made with Iraq, for example. And it was in the public sector, not the private sector, as the United States has no reason to trust the private sector, and it is hard to believe that the international community can trust the private sector with vital interests in their own countries. If you look at the history of foreign wars, it is pretty clear that there have been no good decisions made in any particular war.

Second, it seems to me that the vote was much more about Iran than it was about war. In general, when the United States attacks another country, we do it to stop the attack, not to try to win a conflict. The United States is not at war with Iran, as the media would have us believe. Iran is at war with Israel and will not accept war against its country. What matters is the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons, which is a very big deal. And so the votes were very clearly about the possibility of Iran developing nuclear power.

So the question is: why is Clinton saying that Obama is wrong about the importance of sanctions against Iran? On top of that, if they are so important, then why does the administration not have a good strategy around any such sanctions? I do not believe Obama is totally wrong about this, but he has clearly not done anything to try to build up the international coalition to challenge Iran. Moreover, the Obama Administration is at the same time engaged in a war with jihadists, which puts it at a strategic disadvantage against Iran, if not a disadvantage."

Overview: New York State's third-degree conspiracy statute defines ""third degree conspiracy"" as: A group, and in particular individuals, knowingly joins together to carry out a conspiracy and to commit acts constituting the offense; they intend to further the conspiracy to commit the offense. As the statute was written, it has three prongs, all of which together make third degree conspiracy a ""willing participation in the conduct of another,"" and three prongs (bodily harm and money laundering) that include one defendant. State v. Stork, 81 NY2d 891, 899 (2008).

First prong: ""Willing participation"" in the conduct of another is a necessary condition for ""willing participation in the offense,"" State v. Williams, 9 NY2d 668, 675 (""participatory participation""). The court found that there was no basis to conclude that Mr. Sues's intent with respect to the NYSMS (as the prosecution argued) was to contribute (his) efforts to the scheme, or not to attempt to assist Mr. Sues's plans. The relevant inquiry is not whether a certain defendant believed that if she or he joined the conspiracy others would participate in the intended activity, per sebags (see supra note 48), per se (see supra note 48), but rather whether the defendant actually was one of the plotters. Here, because we conclude that the prosecution failed to prove in this case that the third parties joined the alleged plotters to carry out some specific act, we interpret the statute as requiring participation in some specific and actual act.

Second prong: The relevant question is whether participation in the conspiracy was necessary to the intended activity; here, the court found that the NYSMS's participation was necessary to the scheme. ""[S]ince no specific action was committed, the conspiracy required [the Sues] and others to engage as conspiratories in the physical act of conspiring to steal certain goods. The evidence revealed that the New York New York group was aware of where to obtain such physical evidence [the stolen purses]. The possession of purses required the group's physical presence and participation, since [their possession] was a necessary element of the conspiracy to steal purses."" (State v. Leech, 39 NY2d 637, 640) (footnotes omitted).

Third prong: ""MONEY LAUNDERING"" is a ""willing participation"" in the offense and constitutes intent to use property for criminal means. (State v. Williams, 9 NY2d 667 [""willing participation"" in the crime, in that it ""involves an intentional attempt to deprive, or to attempt to induce others to deprive, another of property or services that would otherwise be protected by the law""].) Here the defendant's activity was actually accomplished without the defendant's consent by virtue of the accused's participation in the conspiracy. While the ""victims"" who were defrauded (as opposed to the purported ""conspirators"") were subjected to actual physical harm, they never actually lost property or services, and they neither gained, nor suffered the financial loss due to their alleged participation. Therefore, we reject the New York statute's interpretation in this case.

Summary and Decision: Under ""MONEY LAUNDERING"" as presented in State v. Williams, 9 NY2d 616 (""money laundering""), the third prong must have been met before the statute's three-pronged reading could be read to create a legal defense. As the court concluded there is no basis to infer that the defendants joined the conspiracy merely to gain possession of the stolen purses and other assets. Given this conclusion, the statute is not valid (and no appeal is necessary) and the defendant, in this case, should be required to face an indictable offense. That being the case, one needs to consider what one does if a third-party person or organization engages in unlawful activity.

Ninth Degree

Overview: The NY State statute is set forth as ""No Crime... in the New York State of... New York (as provided in [the statute, see N.Y.S.A. § 2-101(1)); and"" (N.Y.S.A. Crim. Proc. Law & Rule 1610). The statutes also allow for the imposition of a fine, up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the first offense, and up to four thousand dollars ($4,000) for every subsequent offense.

Monday

The National Hurricane Center releases the final forecast of Sunday night's storm, which is known as Matthew, and the tropical storm warning for the Florida peninsula. It also shares a warning for the Key West and Bahamas coasts.

Wednesday

The weather service releases Hurricane Matthew track information from its National Hurricane Center. The storm will pass over Key West, Key West, and Orlando during the morning hours and move southeastward along the east shore of South Carolina and Georgia. It could become a hurricane as it leaves southern Georgia and the Florida Panhandle at least until 10:30 a.m.

Saturday

After Tropical Storm Chan-hom continues to slow the movement of Matthew and the tropical storm warning is lifted. The NHC will begin issuing the final hurricane details Wednesday morning with the forecast track of Matthew.

Hurricane conditions will become more likely with Matthew's projected track westward through the Florida panhandle, the Florida Keys, and the southern Florida coast. Tropical storm characteristics will be expected between 6.5 and 10 a.m., with maximum sustained winds ranging from 64 to 70 mph.

The Florida Keys are expected to see tropical storm-force winds Thursday morning with portraying storm surge in the 15 to 30-foot range. The center of Hurricane Matthew is expected to pass off the Florida Panhandle and exit the state by Sunday afternoon.

While the entire state does not face hurricane-force winds, portions of the counties east of Naples and West Monroe already have seen gusts of 90 mph to the north and south of the center. The forecast indicates Matthew may continue moving to the north of this, pushing the forecast track even farther west.

Monday

The National Hurricane Center predicts Matthew will slowly track into Louisiana by Wednesday morning. Forecasts indicate the storm will strengthen to a tropical storm.

Tuesday

As Tropical Storm Chan-hom continues to slow down the movement of Matthew, the NHC releases the final hurricane track information. Forecasts indicate Matthew will continue to move west along the north shore of mainland South Carolina and Georgia, and weaken into a tropical depression next Wednesday.


Wednesday

The NHC provides a final word on the storm by releasing a hurricane bulletin detailing the projected tracks of Matthew from Thursday morning through Sunday. Tropical storm characteristics will be expected between 6.5 and 10 a.m. Wednesday, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. These conditions are considered severe by the NHC.

Thursday

While most South Carolinians are still bracing for more rain, the storm is expected to decrease in strength over the next couple days. By midday Wednesday, hurricane-force winds will rest near hurricane gusts. By 3 p.m., Matthew is expected to pass north of the Leeward Islands, and continue to weaken, with maximum sustained winds between 60 and 70 mph.

Friday

A tropical storm watch is again in effect from 5 a.m. until 6:45 p.m. for the Florida panhandle with a warning for severe storm damage.

The National Hurricane Center expects Matthew to intensify, with hurricane force winds by Sunday and tropical storm-force winds by Monday or Tuesday. At this point, hurricane conditions can still be expected all along the East Coast and central and eastern South Carolina. Maximum sustained winds will be near 65 mph.

Matthew is moving back toward the northwest along the mid-latitude coast as it moves northwest. The Atlantic Ocean is expected to become a bit more moist this week.


Saturday

By Saturday afternoon the storm has become a post-tropical cyclone. Forecasts suggest conditions will develop over the next week or so.

Sunday

The forecast track of Matthew is still the same as on Wednesday. It will continue to move west through the Florida Panhandle and Georgia and eventually eastward over the eastern Bahamas.

Matthew makes a landfall in or near the Bahamas between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. with a category 3 hurricane on Sunday.

The NHC will release the final tropical storm detail this weekend.

In one segment, CNN reporter Richard Quest asks, ""Did you get the memo?"" In a second, he adds, ""This thing is going to fly in the face of everything we were told.""
But, for most people, at least when I hear ""unless they get out on the street, I'll send them out of here"" I know that ""unless they go to prison"" is a thing that doesn't happen. So, I try not to look at CNN's reports.
The thing that I do remember is that when a reporterGoldMagikarp asked Paul, is he worried about R.E.M. having a ""dark album, no more light albums""?
Paul replied, ""If R.E.M. decides it wants more black-eyed peas-in-his-pea soup than it would to just sit at the desk and write good stuff, we'll be fine.""
That's why I'm skeptical when R.E.M. says they'll make a movie about the band. I thought it was a sign of something to get worked up over. And, Paul wouldn't know a thing about that sort of thing.
Paul got his degree in History of Science from Harvard as was one of the first blacks in the program at the university.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Government wants land for border fence; landowners refuse. Secretary Chertoff says he won't relent ""for a particular individual"" Eloisa Tamez says her property has been in her family since 1767. Border town mayor calls the fence ""a multibillion-dollar speed bump"""," Eloisa Tamez: ""Border communities have a choice. They can turn their backs on this wall, the border fence, and get their land back. This land belongs to us, not the government.""

Chertoff's statement was a direct attack on her land, and on the entire border community. Many of the people Eloisa Tamez lives next to are members of the Yoakum Yoakum people — the Yoakum people's homeland, in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico — who have been living in Texas for thousands of years.

It isn't enough for the border ""commission."" It just so happens that that commission is run by Michael Chertoff, one of the most celebrated civil rights attorneys of our time. The commission, and Michael Chertoff, are in the business of protecting government programs from lawsuits, and the people whose communities they are protecting are the citizens whose land is at risk.

In the wake of the recent Supreme Court ruling about the Yoakum people, many local officials in El Paso are saying they don't want to lose the border fence because of the Yoakum people.

But Chertoff says the fence ""means the Yoakum people lose their land.""

This is the same Michael Chertoff, the one who used to teach at Harvard Law School, who, in 2004, said that people in the Southwest could ""get a little depressed.""

His latest comment could only be a sign of his growing contempt for every person who lives just a few miles across the border without the protection of the border fence system.

But it isn't just El Paso that does not welcome the fence. The Mexican side in the Rio Grande Valley doesn't like it either. In fact, even President Felipe Calderon is moving in the opposite direction. He has proposed building a 100 mile-long border fence from Arizona to New Mexico. Not the 50 foot high fence he is currently threatening to tear up.

While Michael Chertoff and his cronies say the border fence has been ""worth it"" — giving ""its taxpayers the largest expense of any federal program,"" as Chertoff put it in his press release — they don't explain how that's fair.

Chertoff's claim that the $20 billion project will save ""the United States"" more than $5 billion in expenses is ludicrous. What are your calculations?"

Write a news article based on the following summary: Vick's September 13 drug test shows marijuana use. Pretrial release conditions tightened; must stay home from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Virginia grand jury indicts Vick and the three co-defendants on state charges. Vick already faces up to 18 months in prison after federal plea deal.,"

(In the first draft of the headline, I wrote ""U.S. Attorneys' spokeswoman says it does not use marijuana in testing, but says there is 'ongoing investigation and some possible charges relating to the marijuana issue' that were the subject of Vick's drug test."" Instead of writing diaper changes for children, a little better than I could have managed, I decided to go with Vick's sobriety test result and call it even.)

I'm not sure I could have changed the headline. ""Drug test results: Vick tested positive for marijuana."" I could have added: ""Plea deal: Vick pleaded guilty to marijuana count, got probation.""

But I did notice a very obvious typo: ""Drug test results: A grand jury indicted Vick and charged him with possession with intent to distribute marijuana.""

The grand jury ""indicted"" Vick and ""charged"" with ""possession with intent to distribute"" marijuana.

The correct headline reads: ""The pot charges against Vick: A grand jury charged Vick with possession with intent to distribute marijuana.""

The drug test results: Vick's Sept. 13 test showed he test positive for more than two-thirds of the prohibited drug in his system — just like that. And the grand jury indictment states that he ""possessed with intent to distribute at least four (4) pounds (12.8 grams) of marijuana.""

(Note, again, that I don't have any idea how old Vick was when he tested positive, but I can see no way he could have had that much marijuana in his system before he tested negative, or that he would have been able to get it at that store.)

(That last sentence is the key to the story. In reality, only six bags were distributed at the store where Vick's three co-defendants were arrested.)

The drug test results: The only thing that seems totally out of the blue is an apparent misspelling of ""potting,"" or potmuff-tee.

Vick was arrested at his home on Sept. 13, and immediately booked into Richmond City Jail. He was released eight days later on $15,000 bail.

Then, nearly eight months later, on Oct. 7, Vick's drug convictions were filed and vacated. The grand jury had returned no indictments at his original court date and no one else had been indicted at that time.

Vick's drug test result from September showed he had traces of the drug in his system for at least one hour before the test came back positive. That's about one-third of the total drug testing time he was actually allowed to be under federal probation and house arrest.

If any prosecutor would want to look at that drug test and decide whether or not to pursue charges, they have a number of options. The federal statute of limitations does not apply, so one would likely have enough time until he is again free to be a drug dealer. There are a series of ""administrative光 periods"" that can be used:

If the date of the scheduled felony was within six months of the date of the scheduled offense, the probation period expires on that date. If the date was within six months of the date of the scheduled felony and an indictable offense is pending, the administrative period expires seven years after the date of the scheduled felony. If the date was more than seven years after the date of the scheduled felony and an indictable offense is pending, the administrative period expires nine years after the date the indictment was returned. If there is no pending indictment, the law allows the court to consider whether the statute of limitations for the criminal offense would have expired after two years.

Or, as prosecutors and defense attorneys have been arguing since December — and Vick's lawyer has confirmed to me — Vick will be able to plead to one of two misdemeanors in connection with the drug possession charge that have a similar statute of limitations. In those two cases, charges are usually expiring more than seven years after the date of the scheduled offense.

Here's Vick's story:

Vick is in jail on felony probation and has been barred from possessing marijuana.

The prosecutor told me in court that the court would consider whether to file charges with a reduced prison term on Vick's marijuana case based on his ""misdemeanor-level drug charge.""

On Friday, Aug. 28, Vick is officially charged with a third-degree misdemeanor for possessing a ""concealed and open container of a narcotic."" That is an attempt to avoid registering a ""closed container"" drug as a controlled substance,"

After all, the band had a lot of the same challenges that they've faced since the Beatles broke up and their reunion with Harrison in 1970. ""I think everyone's different now,"" he said of his band. ""I didn't want it to feel like I had been in one group all my life. Everyone felt I was going to be playing things that I wasn't ready for in the new songs -- being a rocker I wasn't 100%. So all of a sudden, I had to let go a little bit. Now I feel just as comfortable as I used to be, which has been a huge relief. ""So it's been a great feeling.""

Former Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to make a political comeback later this summer after four years out of public view to seek his party's presidential nomination in 2008. (Reuters)

Former Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to make a political comeback later this summer after four years out of public view to seek his party's presidential nomination in 2008. (Reuters)

John Edwards, a former Democratic vice president and the party's nominee in 2008, has suspended his presidential campaign, his campaign announced Wednesday in a brief statement.

Edwards, 36, will remain on the primary ballot and compete in Super Tuesday states, his campaign said. The former Louisiana congressman will continue to run his Senate challenge to Democratic incumbent Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton before the November 2008 Democratic National Convention.

After four years out of public view, Edwards, a Democrat who lost the presidency twice to Republican George W. Bush, is a favorite to win the Republican difficulties that will come with the candidacy, the spokesman for the Edwards campaign said in a telephone interview Wednesday.

""We think that he should be able to compete, but we are taking some action right now in order to keep things moving in our direction,"" said Jonathan Safran Foer, Edwards' deputy campaign manager. ""While we have not decided yet if or when the campaign will end, we are confident in being ready for the nomination fight going into the summer and summer after.""

The announcement from Edwards' team came as the campaign appeared set to wrap up a critical weekend -- its final weekend in a bid to prevent President Obama's candidacy from growing. Early in the campaign, Edwards' advisers said they were counting on their former colleague with the CIA in the White House to help out, with help from New Hampshire, a state traditionally favored by Democrats.

Edwards suspended his campaign for the Senate last month. The last time he ran for president was in 2004, when he announced his candidacy for the Democrats' nomination then for Vice President. Edwards finished third in New Hampshire with 2.5 percent of the vote.

 population_small_pop_size.html New Hampshire political map.

After the end of his term as CIA director, Edwards made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 against then-Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, another U.S. senator from the early-voting primary who faced no opposition from the Democratic establishment.

Edwards' supporters were optimistic about his chances for a comeback this time around. They said he was having trouble with his fundraising after spending big in the past few years in an attempt to keep alive his presidential campaign, while supporters believed Edwards deserved a shot at president.

""We think he still has a good chance to win the nomination, but we Survivor-minded people can have a very, very close conversation about it over the next several months,"" said David Paleologos, director of the Tulane University pollster.

Edwards will ""still be in touch with our field in New Hampshire,"" the Edwards spokesman said. ""He thinks we're going to make a real run for the nomination, and that the polls are all in and he'll be back then. We might not agree on everything, but we'll be in touch.""

We do not need an ""expert"" to explain how things are for us. The news is the story. You need only hear it to believe.


Why are politicians so afraid of a word they can simply say? The only reason you hear that word so frequently in politics is because there are so many of them. And all too often that word means something bad, like ""bigot.""

The word ""communist"" doesn't mean anything. It's a synonym for ""loser"" that just doesn't sound convincing in today's political climate.

People who can't pronounce the word ""communist"" like to point to John McCain as proof that ""communism"" does not apply to the Republicans at all anymore. But it doesn't. And if anyone thinks this might be changing, they are mistaken. Just look at what the president's new policy in Syria will do! Nothing good will come out of it.

So who are most afraid of what a word really means? Democrats and people of color — people who are not exactly sure they want to hear anything that might upset them.

From a story in the Economist in the English-speaking edition, May 23, 2002:


In India, a woman has a 99 per cent chance of being sterilised after her womb is destroyed with a drug, according to an estimate from one of the country's most eminent experts. The doctor was quoted by newspapers as saying: ""Every woman who has a damaged womb is being sterilised.

""It is the only method now available. Otherwise she goes into labour and comes out of it with an intra-uterine injury. The obstetrician will perform sterilisation on the child. He will take a sample of the foetus to be tested for abnormalities and the mother will then be sterilised.

""Even if there is no abnormality, the chances are too high. And an operation is likely to be more invasive and potentially dangerous."" A survey of hospitals and paediatricians in six cities published on December 9th found one in three believed sterilisation carried a high risk of death. In addition, 1 in 3 had at least one child with a deformity requiring medical treatment. The surgeon, who did not want to be named, said more than half of the cases had to be cancelled due to poor recovery.

The American Center for Medical Progress published an undercover video in the Boston Herald on May 20th, 2004, showing employees and consultants working in India in which a man appears to be selling sterilised eggs. A doctor has called for a ""crisis in medical ethics for doctors treating disabled children."" A woman says, ""The way this was done, I am now sterilised. It is like being shot in the belly.""

... Dr. Rajan Grewal is the lead researcher for the Medical Birthrights Center in India. He has been studying the practice since the mid-1980s, and says that while some doctors here are eager to get children for their own use, the number seeking sterilisation as a way to avoid disabilities is growing. Dr. Grewal says there is no requirement for the procedure to be performed in India. ""They don't want it because you die sooner than you go to prison,"" he says. ""A little girl with a cystic birth defect who is going to die is a human being. That could become her next of kin.""

From a report in The Washington Post on April 15th, 2004, on the use of the drug RU-486 in the United States by gynecologists, who say there have been a series of serious cases of women seeking surgeries for conditions including cysts and uterine fibroids.


From the BBC article, ""Uterine fibroids: Where they're taking us"" published on April 30th, 2004:


Tory Mihlstedt, who lives at the northern end of London, went to university in Germany and is doing his medical practises in India. He has never found it necessary to seek surgery apartment for his patients because he was simply too busy trying to save the women who want a hysterectomy - even if it means sterilisation.

In Germany, Mihlstedt said he is ""not too worried"" because when a woman has just a cyst, she is not treated all that intensively. ""I see a cyst every year,"" he said. ""It is very rare indeed that a woman will need an operation."" His advice to gynecologists: ""Don't ask for surgery unless the patient asks for it. When you are going through treatment for an injury from childbirth, you need to be able to refer to your family doctor to discuss something in depth and discuss the possibility of surgery with that family doctor.""

Family of slain girl upset soldier wasn't sentenced to death, Reuters says. At least 11 people killed in mortar attacks in Baghdad, Interior Ministry says."," Iraq's Sunni mayor promises a third term.

A new Iraq war — which would extend Iraq's occupation by six years — may not come until 2003. ""We have no hope for 2004 either,"" says the Iraqi leader, Jalal Talabani. ""Our main focus is the 2005 election and a government prepared to do justice and stop our humiliation.""

In a sense, Iraq's elections are just a sign of things to come. Iraq's Sunnis have been seeking reform on the national level for 20 years, and they are unlikely to receive political concessions this time around. Instead, the elections are seen as an opportunity for Talabani's PUK, or Popular Mobilization Unit, to win power after the first round of elections in April. ""The election should be for our people,"" Al Abadi says. ""But to achieve that, we will have to work all our efforts and try every possible way of creating hope.""

The president isn't in the mood to negotiate easily. He sees the election as a chance to hold on to his seat until the election results are announced April 24. But to prevent the possibility of violence or coup, he says his government will be ""more aggressive, more effective and more firm in punishing the extremists until we bring this country back to democracy.""

The president won't be happy that a recent statement by the U.S. ambassador to Iraq was viewed by some as a betrayal. And the military leaders have become increasingly concerned by the government's failure to hold a single session of parliament, which they consider crucial for holding elections on schedule and for taking steps to disarm extremists.

As if to underline those worries, a suicide bomber killed three American soldiers on Feb. 15 — three days after the parliament session was set to begin.

On the first night of the first meeting of parliament, Talabani ordered every member to take their seats because the House had been declared vacant. During its first 10 minutes in session, it was called back as the speaker of the house had gone to hospital. ""I was concerned that if the houses were filled, we would be on for 10 more days,"" Talabani recalls.

The president's security men were out in force the next morning. Talabani had brought his own security officers dressed with the best suits of the period. With U.S. forces out of Iraq, the military came in. A week later, a top general was killed. The U.S. Embassy was bombed, the U.N. was overrun and Saddam Hussein was ousted.

While the president and his top staff are cautious about taking action beyond Iraq's borders, he is not backing down from any future war against militants or any threat to his rule. He will probably need the approval of other party leaders to initiate a second Iraq war, although he is not about to take any risks. ""There will be no second Iraq war,"" one former high official says.

As for the Sunni militants, Talabani insists that he will not use the current parliament to impose any kind of political settlement, but will take the necessary steps to ensure that justice prevails. He will not sign in power a new constitution that would give Talabani more power but also would not change the law. He will not agree to the return of U.S. troops. He won't accept the return of President Bush, but he will allow Bush to be a ""partner in the work"" and not a ""master.""

There's hope this time — just not long enough. The Iraqi parliament's session has come in for widespread jeering and protests, but there is, nevertheless, no sign of an immediate crisis on the horizon. The president is hoping that with a lot of hard work and commitment to the process, it will be worth the wait.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Thousands lined Beirut streets to honor anti-Syrian MP, killed in car bomb blast. Noted parliamentarian killed along with four others during Wednesday rush hour. Flag-draped coffin paraded through streets before burial in Christian district. Day of national mourning called, with schools, universities, public offices shut.","

We could go on, but I think this short overview covers an overview of the picture of this tragedy.

My hope is that there's news like this that causes all concerned to rethink the policy of what is happening in the Middle East.

When I first heard of this terror-inspiring attack I did some quick research on the circumstances.

It all seemed pretty standard: A vehicle was blown up on the road between two Christian neighborhoods with a huge explosion.

A man driving by got out of, but the explosion damaged his car.

There was a huge manhunt for him, and he was caught, but was released soon afterwards.

There was an explosion at a place known to be a Hezbollah-sponsored mosque of some sort along the street, which seemed to be a bit suspicious.

Police later said it was from a gas bottle.

There was a Hezbollah member inside.

But who can anyone really be sure?

It seems that the Hezbollah members were innocent bystanders who had no apparent connection to this act of terror. And they were killed in a kind of double-tap – killing on the road, but also in an ambush, on the way to the mosque.

The bomb blew up a few places around, so the body count was quite a bit higher than just the ones taken in at the scene.

I went looking for more information after that, but didn't find it any better than what I had before. (You can see that in a series of articles I did starting here and here.)

There were lots of conspiracy theories being circulated, some of which I agree with.

Here's one on the left – the U.S. Government was behind this attack.

What I don't agree with, is this one that I saw on Facebook.

Another version of this theory stated that Hezbollah had been ""neutralized"" after their ally Bashar al-Assad was deposed.

Well – I'm not a fan of anti-government conspiracy theories, so I won't deal with them here. And neither should anybody else.

But I am sure I'll see some people arguing about this as I search for anything else in the immediate aftermath.

UPDATE 22 July 2015

So it turns out that the death toll in this attack – which killed four Lebanese Christians – was actually less than that of the 2005 truck bombing which killed 241 Iranian diplomats in Beirut. (The same death toll was claimed by the so-called Islamic State.)

There were just 13 dead, not the 24 or 27 that were taken in by this terror attack. Most of the dead were in the Christian district.

The death toll in that attack was said to be 20, despite the fact that there were two different bombings: The first was a suicide car bomb against a bus carrying Iran's envoys. The second one targeted a Hezbollah ""training camp"" at the entrance to the area.

While the media were just beginning to cover the explosion in southern Beirut, there was also two other attacks against Christian targets in Lebanon.

Most importantly, the head of security for the northern district of Beit Lahiya had just been murdered.

The reason? Hezbollah supporters in that district tried to stop the head of security's murder, after they had heard that he was a Christian, in the street.

The story was that they fired tear gas canisters outside his home, and he got in his car and fled to safety. If you go to this YouTube video, if you can just imagine the man in that video sobbing, then you're in for one heck of a shock – he had just been murdered.

If you're interested, here's an original video of the man, with his body in the dirt where he lay, as a crowd has taken to chanting ""Death to Christians.""

The Lebanese media, though, have done nothing to cover this incident and, sadly, they've only begun to discuss it after it happened. (You can find the original story below, here.)

The New Daily reported:

The head of head of security for the northern district of Beit Lahiya has reportedly been murdered by his bodyguards, in an assassination carried out for unknown reasons, a local media report saidAaron Yalish, who was serving as head of security in the neighborhood of Beit Awwa, had recently been appointed as head of security of the region, which includes the Lebanese city of Arsal.The security and government officials of the region have not yet disclosed the reason for the assassination.

Earlier Sunday, officers found a shell casing and an orange plastic water bottle on a backyard of a home in the 1500 block of North Broward Road, according to the Miami Beach Police Department. The homeowner, whose name was not provided, said he was surprised to find the bottle, which he said he finds funny. Earlier Sunday, police said the investigation is focused on Rivera and the others involved in the fatal shootings. They said ""there are a number of leads that we are actively pursuing."" No charges have been issued against the teens involved in the shootings, police said Monday. Police said earlier that Rivera had been involved in a domestic dispute just a few days earlier. A witness told police that Rivera's girlfriend came to the man's home and began yelling at him. She pulled a gun and began pounding on the door to the home. He told the woman to stop.

Miami Beach Mayor Tomás Regalado said there is an effort underway to remove Rivera from his home. They will have to go through a process of removing him by court order if need be. ""The Mayor and the City of Miami Beach welcome and support the efforts of the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Fenrir Task Force,"" Regalado said in a release Monday. ""The Mayor is very proud of the fact that our crime rates have dropped as a result of the Fenrir Task Team. He is hopeful that the task force would be able to accomplish what was previously not even possible: make this community a safer community by making the arrest of these men."" Regalado said if Rivera is convicted and sentenced to less than 40 years, ""I would hope that he would serve less than his punishment."" No charges have been filed against the teens. Rivera is charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and possession of cocaine. The other teens are charged with murder. Rivera's family has denied any notion of a vendetta. They said it is an ongoing dispute between Rivera and his girlfriend's mother. She said he shot at her and broke their engagement. The incident occurred last Wednesday before midnight in the 2500 block of Sunrise Drive. The victim, 22-year publicity photographer Andrew Stahl, was found unresponsive on his bathroom floor with a gunshot wound to his abdomen. He was pronounced dead Monday at Broward Health North. The mother and her son had previously been involved in an argument with her son's mother when she tried to take advantage of him by inviting him to a birthday party for her daughter. ""That did lead to the argument that was going to happen at this residence,"" Regalado said. That argument ended with an attempted robbery, Regalado said. The two teenagers are being held on $3 million bond, which is about double the bail set for them last week. Rivera is a public servant, so when that happens, you have to question, what good is that? But he is going to have to answer to that. The 17-year-old is charged with aggravated battery in connection with the attack. The second teen is still under investigation and there is no information about his involvement as of Monday. McElroy said the trio is suspected"

Crew not allowed to leave ship due to federal law, says Coast Guard. Feds launch criminal probe; 58,000 gallons leaked and killed nearly 400 birds."," (AP)

A little bit of luck went a long way, and the crew was able to clear the bridge, but the incident triggered an investigation that led to the charges filed against the captain.

""We've learned and that's always great in a disaster,"" said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Zach Dzambierz, who served with Petty Officer 2nd Class Eric Shaffer on the busenai. ""The crew was there to take a lot of chances, and they got it right.""

What's unclear is whether any of the charges against Captain Ives could lead to the captain being removed from his ship in the first place and what consequences may be imposed by the Coast Guard and other U.S. military officers once a shipmate is tried and sentenced.

Feds say pilot flew too close to shore in crash near Hilo

""If the crew is guilty of any offense under the laws, then they will be prosecuted and convicted,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney John Fudenberg said at a press conference Thursday morning.

The Navy's Pacific Fleet Commander Rear Adm. Scott Swift said his navy was aware of the ship's accident and the charges and that additional investigation was underway.

""If (the charges have) been made into crimes that they are, we take it very seriously,"" Swift said.

The busenai's voyage had been supposed to be over when the Japanese Coast Guard and the U.S. Coast Guard arrived to assist when Coast Guard officials reported the incident on Dec. 31, 2014.

The Busan was sailing away from Hilo during a hurricane on Dec. 18. A pilot of the ship had an electronic failure, which caused a sudden increase in speed, and the pilot attempted to correct that by moving to the right, the Coast Guard said in a statement today.

Coast Guard pilots tried to avoid colliding with the ship's propellers and the result was a collision in which a Japanese ship went down, according to coast guard officials at the time.

The Busan was flying at about 100 knots, the speed the pilot should have been at when he went to correct the rate of speed.

The Busan crew was told to divert off the island of Kauai, where it had anchored two days earlier. As the boat was heading towards a beach about 1,000 yards off shore, it started to drift sideways and struck an island, U.S. officials said.

The wreck remains on the island, where the crew remains in custody pending a trial scheduled for January 2015.

Brett Stelter of the Stelter Report, in a May analysis of the accident, said it appeared the pilot had hit a reef."

4. Ask about the culture, history, or religion of the country you're looking to emigrate to.

Don't assume everyone knows everything. Your country's roots (and culture!) are probably as relevant to you as the names of every restaurant you're going to be eating at, even if yours aren't (and shouldn't be) native languages. Ask!

Don't be shy to ask.

5. Don't ask why the people of your country are so happy.

They'll probably just say they're not, or that you should check out a country closer to home if you're still interested in a more relaxed approach. If you want someone to tell you to check out something, it may be that they don't know and don't feel comfortable answering. That's alright though—it's easier to just wait and watch and get invested in a country whose people are so clearly so happy.

6. Don't ask what the country is famous for.

Sure, Switzerland is famous for cheese, but your first stop should certainly be somewhere with more cheese, then.

7. Don't ask, ""Are you from Australia?""

No, no, no, no. We mean no.

8. Ask, ""What's your favourite thing about the country,"" when you speak to them.

Even if they're in a foreign country speaking no English, you'll know you haven't been rude, even if they won't know (or even care, if you've already figured out how to ask them).

9. If they don't like a question, go somewhere else.

If you want to make a lasting impression on them, try doing something they really enjoy: go to a local restaurant, shop at a local bookstore, run a local race or participate in the local art festival, or whatever it is you like to do together when you hang out with them.

10. Don't try to force them to tell you their name before asking.

If they're already on the phone, try this: ""Oh no, this is from Australia. Tell me your name to see what I sound like."" That might work if they give you their international ID number, but it's not going to feel right unless they're really sure they know you.

9 Great tips for meeting people in every city

There are a few things every entrepreneur should include in their business strategy of meeting people. And of course, it helps if you've learned a few tips already.

1. Don't be a dick

Most people hate meeting people, but if you're genuinely interested in people, it's probably better to treat them appropriately. In a business-to-business conversation, you absolutely don't need to try and get people to talk about ""their"" idea, and try and find out why people have such strong opinions. If you're really worried about people feeling uncomfortable, consider setting up a meeting with a friend of yours or someone who speaks with the same background (if you can figure that out).

2. Don't make an excuse unless you have to
 vacancy, for a work interview, or for security reasons.

Everyone has been there. I've personally been there and back. And even if you haven't, that's ok. Just find somewhere to be quiet.

3. Try to find some ""fun"" things to do together

Here's what not to do.

You: ""This would be really fun, wouldn't it?""

Me: ""Yeah, I've always wanted to do this.""

You: ""No, you like it? Do you want to do it?""

Me: ""Not really… what do you want to do?""

You: ""How's your week going?""

Me: ""It's going great. I'm having a really good time.""

You: ""So you're gonna do this?""

Me: ""Yeah, it's a great idea.""

You: ""Great for you! Tell your friends!""

Me: ""No, I think it's too expensive for us to do it.""

You: ""Great! Sounds like a dream come true!""

There's no one-size-fits-all approach to meeting people and you shouldn't feel too pressured into following the same rules. Remember, everyone is different, your target market will most likely speak a different language, and you may want to play in the """

Cairo: Al-Azhar (Egypt's oldest and largest university, founded in 718 BC) on Sunday urged all international Islamic scholars in the Western world to support US President Donald Trump's ban on Muslims entering the USA.

The Islamic university at the end of the Grand Mosque in Cairo urged ""all scholars and students"" to ""form political pressure on those who oppose the decision"" by calling on ""all of those who support US policies to respect the sovereignty of the country they represent"".

Al-Azhar (Egypt's oldest and largest university, founded in 718 BC) and the University of Cairo, which belong to the same institution, said that ""this announcement is a victory for Islam, which protects the rights of others"".

Al-Azhar head Nasser al-Oteini said the decision to ban the admission of Muslim Americans to the USA ""has resulted in a large loss"" on Muslim families worldwide. He said no country had imposed similar restrictions on its citizens until now.

""The decision by the White House in the United States, which will affect people who are here in America, will take them away from their families and friends,"" Mr Al-Oteini said (IN). Saudi Arabia's parliament this past week approved a law that bars judges from expressing their personal opinions.

According to a report in the Saudi daily Al-Eqtisadiah on Saturday (October 11), a group of female judges, mostly clerics opposed to President Donald Trump's US immigration policy, received ""death threats"" for joining the Saudi community in the USA.

The report cited a judge in the Western city of Al Khobar who was warned on his Facebook timeline and warned on the phone by someone that his life will be in danger if he dared to support the President's anti-immigration policy. The judge had earlier refused to enforce the travel ban because of the threats he received.

The Saudi Arabia's official Arab News Service said earlier this year that more than a dozen judges had received death threats after they stood against President Donald Trump's executive order banning citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US.

Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir announced that two of three judges of the Kingdom's top administrative court, the General Civil Appeal Court, had refused to abide by a 2016 court ruling that ordered them to enforce Trump's anti-immigration policy.

The newspaper said that a court ruling in April 2015 had declared ""that a number of officials have interfered in the decision-making process in the courts… as a result of their belief that their personal beliefs should form the foundation of the judicial system"".

According to the newspaper, a third case in December 2016 was halted, however, because a judge refused to enforce the ruling of the same court declaring he must comply with Trump's ban.

According to one Saudi lawyer, one member of Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court, who is being held in an American jail in Washington, D.C., was sentenced to 10 years in jail for ""insulting Islam"".

According to RFE/RL's Arabic service (RIA), the Justice Department says at least two people are currently detained for ""promoting hatred against the United States"".

I'm sure this scenario will be repeated next Friday when news reporters in Virginia try to obtain information on who did the worst shopping mall shooting in U.S. history: the gunman was mentally unstable, had no criminal record, was a former member of an armed gang, etc., etc. I have no idea if I'll be on the cover of the next edition of Sports Illustrated. You'd think I'd be, considering how I feel about that magazine's readership.

I know that's a ridiculous question, since the whole ""I'm sorry you're out of shape"" thing only makes sense if you think it's entirely reasonable to expect every high schooler in America to be the world class athlete they are supposed to be, and to expect that every teenage guy from middle school to the age of 24, who once thought he couldn't commit a crime ever, will someday. The difference between a group of people who are well-dressed and well-behaved and one who is full-on psychopath or a group of people who are full-on psychopaths is so slight as to almost be inconsequential.

That said, we really ought to do a better job of teaching young people that no one is a ""normal"" human being and why people can be vicious, or mentally ill, or just completely unstable, in any given circumstance when they are not even trying to do anything wrong. If people think they're ""normal"" because they have nice cars and good jobs—and I don't blame them—then it's very likely they think that people like them who also have nice cars and good jobs or do good jobs are somehow more ""normal"" because they can just drive down a one-lane freeway with no accident-prone passengers and get right to work. That's just not how human beings work. There's an entire science class dedicated to understanding how social order is built and maintained.

I have a theory on why this is a dangerous misconception: it's like the belief that women are somehow somehow less intelligent, or less honest, or less loyal, or more prone to committing crimes. We're all just human beings, capable of anything in our wild nature, just like there are some animals that really don't want to go hunting and can't hunt at all. This is called basic moral reasoning. We're all, at times of great emotion, very likeable and likable, unlike some of the monsters out there.

This doesn't mean that I think people are all ""normal,"" but you probably wouldn't want to meet a member of my own species in person. I'm not going to sit by as that person shoots up a shopping mall full of people for no reason and nobody ever has to say ""Why did he shoot up that mall?! We didn't know?!""

The problem is that people can't understand what really sets someone high in their own estimation from someone whom they've never met anywhere; it's just not important to them. It's only important when they're facing some kind of judgment: ""He's so much better than me."" Or whatever.

To be fair to myself, I am pretty ""normal"" by human standards, if you prefer the word. I am a good cook, I play piano, I enjoy music. I'm not a doctor, but I can work in a hospital. I'm a successful writer. I do well in my career and have some pretty good relationships. I do all the things a person would want to do, but I also happen to like watching The Sopranos.

You'll find the information here. (And please note that we're Casnost-ing the story here; we have no evidence that any of these stories were published.)

A brief review of the evidence and possible ways of improving the system—in order of importance—shows:

1. The RFID tag system still appears to be a very complex system, but it may be more efficient than other options.

2. In the event of an accident with a baggage handler, airport officials would likely assign the incident to the Styrofoam container in which the bag had been placed. They could also be informed of the exact state of the baggage.

3. It remains unlikely the baggage tag tracking system would be able to identify the contents of each box quickly, so it would not be of much use in a rush.

4. In the event of a serious problem during the flight, the passengers would be notified by phone or postcard hegemony.

5. If there is any doubt about a flight's destination, or if a passenger needs goalie security, luggage tag tracking would be adequate.

If anyone has any further information relating to the accuracy of luggage tag tracking (or any other aspects of baggage security), or if you are interested in learning whether you are being targeted by those very people and their agents, we would love to hear it. It's all online here.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Telegram: King Hussein wanted U.S. strike on invading Syrian troops in 1970. Nixon White House urged Saudis to distance from PLO's Fatah organization. Papers also discuss Israeli acquisition of nuclear weapon. Documents among 10,000 papers released Wednesday by Nixon Library.","

The declassified government papers come amid a series of controversies relating to the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.

The documents shed light on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, which was key to the plot. The documents, released Wednesday in a massive set of papers released by the U.S. National Archives, include excerpts from the late King Abdullah's memoirs.

One portion of a handwritten letter dated April 17, 1969, notes that the United States should consider a potential strike against the PLO and warns of their influence over Iran.

Abdullah wrote, ""The PLO are carrying out activities against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps... with a view that we should be prepared to defend ourselves.""

The author of the note, which was written on behalf of Saudi Arabia's intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Qasim Saeed al-Zoubi, concluded that the United States should strike against Islamic militants in the Middle East. The letter, which was translated into Arabic, has been posted on the websites of several U.S. news agencies.

Nixon White House staff counsel John Dean said Wednesday the U.S. government had received a declassified copy of the Saudi documents earlier this year and had been provided with additional material for review.

""As we have said prior, this information should not be used to justify actions that are not already underway. As such, we are not at liberty to say any more than that some or all of these documents may present a topic of discussion for consideration by the administration,"" Dean said.

There was no attempt by the White House to remove the reference to the Islamic world in the secret U.S. government documents on Saudi Arabia, which were released after months of secrecy in an effort to clear up doubts about the Bush administration's account of the Sept. 11 events.

Many historians and researchers have long suspected that Saudi Arabia was a key ally of Israel, a claim that has been repeated by current and former U.S. officials who have testified under oath before committees investigating the events of Sept. 11, 2001.

The secret documents do not contain the detailed, detailed allegations that the Saudi government is behind the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because the Bush administration and the Saudis were in negotiations to declassify the files and that both countries had agreed during the negotiations that the Saudi papers should be removed, Dean said.

Nevertheless, he said, the new release of the Saudi files showed that there were problems with declassification.

""Anytime there are concerns with declassification, which we were aware of, and concern about the contents of these documents, it is something we have to deal with,"" Dean said."

WEEK 7

Week 7, a.k.a. a ""Monday-afternoon news dump,"" can be a real slog, with little news to report. However Monkey See's editors and reporters take advantage of a Thursday before Memorial Day (Saturday, April 30).

""In his inaugural speech, Eisenhower promised he would build the steel workers' peace,"" says Monkey See's editor Joe D'Aleo. ""He did and then some. The steel workers went on strike. He got the National Guard to go onto the field at night. The National Guard did what Eisenhower promised. They went out and arrested 200 marchers who were breaking into the office of the new Civil Rights Commission in Little Rock, Arkansas, and disrupting its work. They had a pretty good crowd, and the Commission was fired up. So they were pretty happy in the first week.""

But the Commission continued its work, despite the threat of a federal indictment.

""This was the only presidential election since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and you're probably wondering how it was done,"" Joe D'Aleo continues. ""The answer is in the middle of a labor dispute that was in the midst of a massive civil rights march. The Labor Department was trying to enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act. They wanted to make the railroad companies adhere to an equal-pay law, for instance. Some of the union members wanted to protest. The Department of Agriculture was trying to enforce the Fair Food and Drug Act, as well. They wanted to control their members' consumption of 'underground beer,' etc.

""A union leader had organized the marchers, for example. They were taking care of the marchers even though they had the support of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior and the Department of Labor. The labor leaders, too, were willing to risk jail to defend the marchers. Ultimately, because of the government's interference in the strike, the marchers won their right to picket. The strike was eventually ended peacefully, with no charges filed against the labor leaders. But if you're looking for one of the very rare presidential campaigns in American history when the media really didn't pick up the story, that is the week of June 3, 1964.""

It's also the week the U.S. Supreme Court, based on a controversial precedent written by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and upheld by Scalia himself, rejected an attempt by the federal government to enforce a voting registration law.

""The voter registration law had been a major focus in the March for Jobs and Freedom. And the Supreme Court had held that they were in fact valid, but the way that the law was presented to and enforced was unconstitutional, and the Justice Department had just issued a statement saying it was invalid. Now it was up to the states to decide whether to enforce it or not,"" says Monkey See editor David D'Aleo. ""Sixty-four of the 75 states did it.

""But the major battleground was Pennsylvania, and in Pennsylvania, the Justice Department made it impossible for any voter registration organization to get on the polls. Not a single one. Well, actually, they actually made it impossible for them to operate anywhere in the country. And that forced Philadelphia and Philadelphia in the heart of the Democratic Party to call a statewide election. It wasn't a very popular election, even though every other jurisdiction thought it was great. They sent mailers and handbills and hand-cards and talked to people on the street.

""So the Justice Department is being accused today of undermining the very essence of democracy. But the whole thing was a political stunt,"" says D'Aleo. ""The decision by an unelected court in 1965, after the most contentious election of anyone's lifetime in America, to effectively end the very foundation on which the United States of America had been founded was pretty shocking. It was one of the worst decisions in American history.""

That decision was also called the infamous ""Citizens United"" decision, which found, without a moment's hesitation, that corporations have the same rights to freedom of speech as individuals.

""That gave corporations the right to give unlimited money, unlimited money in a way the states couldn't touch. The Supreme Court had made it clear that corporations are people. If they can't spend money, the States can't regulate them,"" says D'Aleo. ""It didn't take long before the right wing, on the right, realized that this would really cause a lot of damage, which it did. Many major corporations donated millions to the Republican Party. That was the big donor group"

Write a news article based on the following summary: Justice Department must decide whether to pursue investigation. Former agent John Kiriakou talked about interrogation technique on TV. Kiriakou attorney says probe could cause CIA more problems. Administration summoned for court hearing on destroyed tapes.,"

A summary that does not mention any of the events in question is provided -- but it does mention Kiriakou having received a medal for his work in Iraq during an interview with ABC News correspondent David Martin.

He was also honored as an ""exemplary hero"" by The New York Times, which said it was the first time a journalist had received that honor.

The full account appears to provide no confirmation of the CIA's alleged involvement and could even indicate that there was no ""intelligence failure.""

Nevertheless, the document also states:

""In addition to this letter, Mr. Kiriakou has also submitted a letter of resignation from The Agency.""

The Obama administration appears ready to have a public debate about the use of harsh interrogation tactics, including waterboarding, after reports that the president asked CIA Director John Brennan a question related to the issue during a recent meeting.

The question, according to the Washington Post, was whether Obama and Brennan had ordered harsh interrogations at Guantanamo, a question that led to the resignation of then-CIA Director Leon Panetta.

""General Brennan told him he had not, in fact, ordered that and suggested that the discussion might now focus on the war in Iraq,"" the Post reported.

It is also possible, some officials privately say, that Obama is pushing to have a public debate so he can respond to the issue at a time when he is facing pressure from Republicans over his support for the CIA's ""enhanced interrogation"" program.

The question is whether the administration is willing to actually confront one of its own intelligence officials over the use of torture.

While the CIA does not often release the type of information included in the document, it was a list of names of the 11 former agents, with titles such as ""Rumsfeld's personal torture bag.""

Most of the names come from the book by Thomas Drake, who was CIA director from 2003-2006 and was the source in 2010 when he leaked a CIA estimate that al-Qaeda and other extremist groups were behind the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The CIA said that figure was an error.

The document appears to address a recent debate, particularly in the U.K., about whether the government should conduct further intelligence-gathering and interrogation activities, possibly including torture, after the publication of a report by the Justice Department inspector general finding that the CIA's treatment of detainees was ""ineffective.""

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Majid Khan's attorneys say he endured an ""aggressive"" interrogation program. Khan's allegations of torture redacted in court documents. Bush administration: Khan worked for 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. CIA: The United States does not conduct or condone torture.","

""I have no reason to believe that this is true,"" Bush said during an initial appearance before a federal judge.

A federal judge has ordered a new trial for Osama bin Laden's former attorney, Majid Khan, in the death of a former CIA employee. KHALED KHAN, son of a former CIA officer, is accused of providing false information to U.S officials investigating torture allegations against Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM). It just so happens that the father of his son, Majid Khan, also represented KSM's defense team before the 9/11 Commission.

Hazmi brothers

One of Osama bin Laden's sons, Salem al-Hazmi (a.k.a. Salem al-Hazmi), was detained in Italy in 2002 and has no intention of being extradited.

After his release, Salem spent six days in a U.S. prison, where there was an apparent dispute over his legal status. He has never been charged with a crime.

Abdulrahman al-Shehhi

The brother of Samir Khan and Abdulrahman al-Shehhi, Abdulrahman was detained after attempting to visit his brother on Thanksgiving 2004. He was charged in absentia with a visa violation and taken to a U.S. military facility in Afghanistan. According to The New York Times, he was released into U.S. custody the next day, despite the fact that he had no intention of returning to Afghanistan as a U.S. citizen.

The Post reported that the two men are thought to have had contact with each other prior to and during the invasion of Iraq. It's likely that the brother would have been released were it not for the fact that he was considered more dangerous than other detainees.

Included with this group were Khalid al-Midhar and Naji Abu Ghaith. Khalid was captured in Pakistan in 1998 and his brother Naji was detained following the 9/11 attacks.

Both al-Midhar and Abu Ghaith were released from U.S. custody without charges when they were released by Pakistani authorities. Osama bin Laden himself said in 1997 that he wanted them ""dead.""

Al-Midhar may have been tortured in U.S. custody. U.S. authorities claim that the detention center's interrogators subjected him to ""enhanced measures"" during his detention period. This is not a common practice and it's unclear whether or not the treatment was legal.

Alfred Abood

The nephew of convicted terrorist Mohamed Atta, Alfred is a Yemeni who was detained in Egypt. Alfred is known to be a member of an al Qaeda cell. He was released on March 17, 2008, after being detained for a second time in 2004.

Abood was released in spite of an Egyptian court ordering his extradition. He still faces charges of being an accessory to the murder of U.S. citizen, U.S. military contractor and Army major Tim McVeigh.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

Mohammad al-Mohammed is an al Qaeda and ISIS operative, which is to say, he's a long-term member of a terror organization. Mohammed has been detained for nearly a decade and has a long history of involvement with the terror cell that plotted the 9/11 attacks.

As Reuters reported earlier this year, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was arrested in March 2011 in connection with the vexing question of whether he was connected with 9/11. That's in spite of the fact that, according to Reuters's sources in the FBI and U.S. officials, Mohammed had no ties to the 9/11 attackers despite the fact that he was mentioned on the guest list at the hotel where most of the attackers were staying when attacks occurred.

Despite that, Mohammed is Harmony Jones' son.

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg ruled that Khaled Sheikh Mohammed can be extradited and that his son can stay in America if he so chooses. Boasberg's order is a win for U.S. officials who tried to obtain his arrest.

""This Court's decision today allows Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was born in Kuwait in 1970, to stay in the United States pending an extradition process that may never result in him returning to Kuwait, where he can be present at his son's sentencing,"" writes Boasberg.

In addition to Al-Mohamed, four individuals have been charged with being tied to the 9/11 plot: Khalid al-Midhar, Nabil Fadl, Mustafa al-Hawsawi and Adnan Far"

Write a news article based on the following summary: Judge: Lisa Nowak's statements and items in her car were unlawfully obtained. Nowak's attorneys have said her comments were made under duress. Former astronaut is accused of stalking and assaulting a romantic rival. Nowak has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted kidnapping.," Nowak claims she is being mistreated by the law enforcement authorities and the courts. [link to audio file and text file of audio file]

The above are not news; they are what you would expect in what appears to be a legal battle and civil dispute between an astronaut who may have ""exhibited emotional instability"" and an attorney who, in a somewhat odd twist of justice, is using a false accusation (made on tape) to gain political benefits (such as a seat on the nation's highest court).

What's particularly astonishing is that the accuser claims in several of her ""documents"", such as her legal complaint, that she has been unable to keep her ""secret,"" that all of her family was ""lucky"" that she remained in orbit and that, all in all, she ""could have been killed"" had she divulged the truth.

She alleges, according to documents released in response to a lawsuit she filed Wednesday, that the alleged victim, an astronaut stationed aboard the International Space Station, harassed her, punched her numerous times in the face, threatened her, and threatened to kill her.

According to Nowak's civil complaint, on two separate occasions on Christmas week in 2013, the victim allegedly ""went out of her way to annoy [Nowak] with profane, aggressive, and insulting language and gestures.""

These alleged actions, she alleges, resulted in a ""tampering,"" or attempt to falsify, of statements she made in her medical exam and personal statement forms:

""The statement form has an image on the front, which clearly is a female face, and that image is attached to the inside of another document that would appear to be another face. The image in the form includes a female face with hair,"" says Nowak. [emphasis added]

""She had the image with her for many months and in the medical form, as well as the interview with the doctor, one is required to answer a particular question about each face,"" Nowak alleges. ""She had never been asked about the other side, and at the start of the interview she said, 'Well, I have one side and you have another, but I am not going to take you seriously if I answer to you as if I'm not aware of my side of things.'"" In this case, Nowak claims that he asked her this question: ""Why do you go to so much trouble to lie? I mean why try to do it?"" In this case, she claims, he said, ""What are you getting me in for? It's not right."" She alleges that his response was, ""It would be right, I wouldn't think you would want to answer those type of questions."" [emphasis added]

""It's really hard to imagine why she thinks that she lied,"" says Nowak. The first time of the alleged incident, he says ""the victim seemed to be upset but that changed as time went on,"" and that during the second event in the alleged confrontation, the victim tried to strike Nowak ""with her hand"" but stopped.

This story is still developing, but it looks like Nowak, with help from a new attorney and an apparently high-paid lawyer, may get to show what she claims was the alleged victim's alleged ""lateral thinking"" moments in the courtroom yesterday.

""I believe that this court might be watching a very high-profile case go through this process and might take it as serious as it needed to be,"" said Nowak after the hearing.

She insists that she has cooperated with investigators and has not been denied her rights to a fair trial. ""I had four hours before this hearing, that was about two weeks before this last hearing and I believe I did everything that was supposed to be done.""

As for the alleged victim, now that she is claiming to have been harassed in her own home, Nowak says it sounds ""far-fetched"" that she would ""stalk"" an astronaut. Indeed, now that we have some word about the investigation underway, it hardly seems real.

There is no need to go any further into the details because, frankly, I don't know if she's got any here.

What I think she does have – and is reported as having had, as of 12/25/17 – are notes from a couple of interviews.

These notes were released by Lisa Nowak on December 23, in response to a lawsuit filed by the current ISS crew member, who claims, according to the notes, that a flight doctor warned her – and that NASA itself – of the alleged ""unethical conduct"" of Nowak and others"
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Sharon Long is forensic artist who creates faces from skulls. Fort Myers, Florida, police called her after they found eight sets of remains. Only two of the eight remains have been identified."," Her investigation into the case has led her to a small, wooded area near a town called Oak Cliff. She has found more skulls there.

She has learned that the bones tend to be buried in the sand, buried in a spot called the ""black-out zone."" She has discovered thousands of skull fragments, most of them very small. What she has learned makes her feel lucky.

""I've found human remains that are the size of a child's hand; not a human foot; nothing a normal eight-year-old child would want,"" she says. ""It's quite a beautiful, magnificent discovery.""

Long and her team of forensics experts have used the bones to create a portrait of a woman with a strange smile: a black-eyed, black-haired, black-haired smile with just one, tiny, white tooth. The same smile that appears in pictures of the children and children's bones.

In a news release sent to the public in December 2011, Long's lab confirmed the discovery of a skull with one or more human teeth with two of them missing. But the bones were not in the same location where the remains had been found. This indicates that the remains came from an unknown location. The news release says: ""The unknown location and lack of identifiable human remains means that the bone is most likely a child's or young woman's remains. However, it still appears that there was a child or young woman buried in the area."" This indicates the remains might have come from Southland in the 1990s and were buried in a different spot, probably less than a year before they were found in 2013.

The news release suggests that the bones came from a person with a ""wide nose,"" black eyes and hair and a ""muted face."" Some might find that intriguing. After all, a ""wide nose"" may indicate a strong-chinned person who is short and wiry.

The news release says we have identified the exact location of ""the likely resting place"" where a woman was found with ""two human teeth, one missing."" But this means that there must have been other bodies in that location, perhaps at a different point in time. Some could be in a different part of the city. And that's what's fascinating: Long's work suggests there were other people in Fort Myers at the time the remains were found, and they might have been in a remote location in the county in which they were found.

If there were other people in the area, there could have been some kind of ritual on the part of the people who buried the remains, perhaps about cremations or burials. If so, it is a reminder—and a reminder to others—of the darker side of Fort Myers. It's why it's called ""The Southland."" It's a place where people go, to make sure they're never alone."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Four-week-old polar bear separated from mother amid fears she would eat it. Nuremberg City Zoo's other polar bear ate its own two offspring earlier this week. Mother was showing signs of being upset and confused, zookeepers said."," Two cubs, the animals' polar opposites, were found dead near the polar bear's family dens. The other two cubs survived until they were captured by wildlife officials. Zoo chief Joachim Jaeger said the animals' mother must have caught one of the cubs by mistake, putting it in her mouth. The other cub was in great condition when it was rescued and is being treated by zookeepers. The zoo was evacuated with animals, and officials have since confirmed the species will live in captivity indefinitely, Jaeger said. This year the zoo issued aadoption request for the dead polar bears, but the zoo's staff never received this email and the mother never showed up at the Zoo. Zookeepers received a second email this week from the zoo's office saying that the mother likely went into seclusion early Tuesday morning as the zoo was closing for the night for a night of festivities that also included a surprise visit from the U.S. Coast Guard. It said the female bear stayed at the zoo after the last two cubs were orphaned. The staff had been told that the mother would probably return home for a short time after zoo reopen on Thursday, and the zoo sent the mother another email Wednesday saying she had been returned earlier that day. In the email, zoo officials said the mother's mother had been seen a short time before going into seclusion on Tuesday, and by that point the bear was missing for three days. In addition, zoo officials said the staff learned that the mother mother was suffering from medical problems and was having difficulty feeding two cubs. They said that in an email they received, the zoo's veterinarians had told zookeepers that the mother was ""suffering from a gastrointestinal upset that is likely due to feeding difficulties."" Jaeger, however, said the bear was found with no signs of illness and that she appeared to be fine.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Fran Townsend says she'll look for opportunities in the private sector. Townsend has worked in government and law enforcement for 25 years. Townsend will be on a panel searching for a replacement.,"

Write a summary based on the following details: Fran Townsend says she'll look for opportunities as a civil rights lawyer. Townsend is a partner at Skadden Arps and one of the co-founders of Black and Decker, now a federal public defender.

Write a summary about how Fran Townsend believes in civil rights and black values for a family audience of 1,000 or more.

You should note that if you are on the fence about writing articles about Fran Townsend's background, you still might read her opinion on NPR. You probably won't know any of it. That's because she's not the only civil rights lawyer with whom we spoke for this story. The person who hired Fran Townsend was none other than Eric Goldman, the CEO and co-founder of one of the largest hiring agencies in the country. He and Townsend hired each other. ""It's a very odd coincidence that we have the same background,"" he said.

The hiring of Emily Bazelon as the White House's first black employee has also been interpreted differently. ""I was asked to do it. This is the story,"" Goldman said. ""My personal view is that if the White House wanted to go in a different direction that's fine. But they had no authority to do it.""

That is true, but Goldman didn't believe Townsend was the right person to make that call, either. The White House should have consulted with its black employees and their allies to find one qualified and available to fill Bazelon's position. That person would then serve as the chief diversity officer and ensure that the diversity policy was in line with the president's long-term vision of equality. Goldman said that is precisely what the White House did.

""To me, this is about having a diversity officer in one of our senior offices, something that the Office of Government Ethics could recommend. I couldn't get on the phone with him.""

One is left wondering how the diversity policy and hiring process were ever implemented at the White House in the first place. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham wouldn't confirm whether it was under the original leadership of Tony Blinken or a new staff leader. She said the hiring of Bazelon was due, at least in part, to an overwhelming desire on President Obama's part.

""He's been passionate about it. He's been very activeintuitive it really was something he wanted to do."" Blinken, who has served as the chief diversity officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, said he knew when hiring a first black employee that it could take time. ""But, as long as he's engaged and as long as he does a good job, he's been very enthusiastic about it and it's been really refreshing."" Blinken said he didn't want to weigh in on the politics, but he does believe that when it comes to diversity, ""we've got to get beyond a culture of exclusion.""

""It's not just about having a bunch of white people sitting around a table and deciding whicharrett is somebody who deserves to be in there,"" said Blinken. ""In the long run, the American public will look at who they work with and if you get people with a diverse set of backgrounds, they'll work together.

""I've been impressed with the breadth, the ability -- it's not an intellectual field. Most of them just understand how to do their work. In the end, you're always looking for people with an ability to be flexible and be able to work on issues on behalf of the American people.""

Goldman said that the diversity policy, which does not require hiring interviews, would have taken 10 to 12 months. But that time might not matter, he said. In fact, he feels that a White House hiring office hiring policy would be better suited for organizations like the Center for American Progress. ""I think that if you look at the kind of people who go into those offices, they tend to have a broader perspective than you might typically find in that kind of thing. I certainly think they would be better suited for the policy part of it than the hiring part,"" he said.

However, he wouldn't say whether he thinks the diversity policy should continue past Bazelon's hire. It seems that her hire is indicative of a larger trend, at least on the hiring side of the political decision-making room. It seems that the White House staff does not need to bring in consultants from outside the government to do their diversity assessments and get recommendations from experts like Goldman or Bazelon.

""I will tell you that one of the things that I try not to think too much about is how many people we should bring in and how many people we should cut because they don't fit the culture we want"

""The government has asked me to get involved in the case, and I'm a lawyer,"" said Peter J. Fenton, partner at Zuckerman Spaeder LLP and a lawyer representing the plaintiffs. ""One of my concerns is that they've just made a very big and expensive mistake here.""


The case came to light as attorneys were preparing for the second year of a war over whether the Clinton administration and foreign governments were legally guilty of paying hundreds of millions of dollars to a Colombian military dictatorship and alleged human rights abuses. Critics of the case say it will be costly for the government of President Barack Obama to wage the war for the sake of the legal challenge against Clovis, a former Democrat. And even if the government settles, it won't be able to return the money.

The State Department declined comment.


The plaintiffs in the case are U.S. citizen Oscar López Rivera, who was arrested in Honduras on charges of taking part in a 2002 coup, U.S. contractor Alberto Nisman, whom officials allege killed himself after being threatened by a former National Security Agency official, and a Mexican national, Gustavo Alfredo Lopez Rodríguez, accused by U.S. prosecutors of participating in an alleged drug-farming ring run by Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, Fenton said.

[...] ""It's unfortunate that this case, with the amount it will cost, has emerged as it has,"" says Scott Drenkard, senior partner with BakerHostetler and a leading adviser to an ongoing State Department probe of human rights issues inside Cuba. ""It will make finding any violations more difficult and that's what should worry U.S. officials in Cuba and around the world.""

[...] In a statement to CNET News, the State Department said the Department ""firmly rejects allegations of criminal conduct"" and said ""The U.S. government has not used these entities in any capacity that may have violated the right to life, and has not tolerated the use of such entities for nefarious purposes.""


The case has sparked debate between attorneys for the plaintiffs and the U.S. government, with the latter asserting that the lawyers are biased.

[...] Fenton notes that the Colombian government has given the plaintiffs' attorneys a ""very limited number of immunity agreements"" and that many of those ""cannot be fulfilled.""

""If they can talk my child, they can also break my bones,"" said the mother in response to an allegation of beatings. ""Now we will go after them because the case is already under way."" The case was presented to a grand jury last month, where two dozen people, including several prosecutors and members Plants of Ohio, a social activist group, watched as the grand jury began to render its decision. The judge in the case, James A. McCray, is also hearing arguments in the case, which could last a year. Prosecutor John L. O'Connor said if prosecutors decide to file felony charges, it would allow them to move the trial to federal court. O'Connor said if Gamekeepers and Riley Ann's mother are found liable, it could lead to fines and restitution. In an order, Judge McCray instructed the defendants earlier this month to pay the city more than $40,000 in legal costs. ""Each defendant did not respond at trial,"" McCray wrote. ""I found this to be a complete failure of the Commonwealth's case and I am imposing a fine of twenty-five thousand dollars."" In addition to the $40,000 for costs, the judge ordered that Judge McCray require Gamekeepers and other defendants to pay Riley Ann's alleged attackers or face unspecified sanctions, including fines. O'Connor said the defense team has agreed to pay the city a $4,000 settlement from the trial, as well as pay for a new police car to be delivered each month to the plaintiffs' residence. The settlement will be submitted to Judge McCray by the end of March. After the city paid the settlement fee, Judge McCray said the plaintiffs had no further obligation to the city and that they had not incurred expenses from the case. The city's lawyers said the settlement agreement should never have been presented in court before it was submitted to a judge.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: ""He admitted playing with matches and starting the fire,"" says police report. Boy, whose name and age were not given, is home with his parents. Buckweed Fire burned 38,000 acres, destroyed 63 structures, 21 of them homes."," This story has been updated with more information.

By the author

In late-September 2004, a wildfire burned 38,000 acres in western Oregon. In the days that followed, nearly every community in the fire's path was asked for their help, sometimes with great fervor. People drove thousands of miles. Some called every county in the U.S. to volunteer.

As the flames reached communities in Oregon, Utah, and other states, families took to the pages of their calendars to mark the day. Some went as far as their communities' borders to help, and some took time off work to help. Everyone seemed to think the fire was their friend, and everyone got involved.

Nearly everyone has a story about how they managed to help those who suffered and were displaced by the wildfire. In the days following the fire, everyone was asking, ""Where were they?""

If you read the newspaper, you might have heard about a young man who helped get the fire under control in his own neighborhood. Or a firefighter who helped carry a young child from her bedroom door. Or a man who took the smoke alarm from a burning house and called an emergency call center to alert firefighters. Some people thought they were helping the people who had been evacuated in the past and would be there when the fires would die out.

Those are all typical of the stories people told in interviews while volunteering. The more surprising part of the story, I think, is seeing most of these people in their home towns.

For the week before the fire, in the days following it, I spoke about my experiences with volunteers. I wasn't asked any tough questions. I didn't have to explain why I couldn't come back. I knew that I couldn't. But I was glad that I wasn't asked to leave and help out anywhere other than my town.

In a time of war, we can never trust anyone. And that's especially true in a time of disaster. So people always volunteer and go. And we tend not to notice how people have been hurt.

What was happening in that town and the homes around it during and after the fire is not something we want to think of as bad people doing something good. But that's what happened in that town. That was their way to try and help the people who had been displaced when they could not, and in a moment of weakness as a nation, to take advantage of an opportunity.

People were calling in from all over the country. In Utah, some said they were volunteering at Burning Man this year to help burn out the trees. Even when people are calling in from all over, they don't think too much about who they are, and a lot of times they don't think about how they would ever see themselves on a scale of giving.

In these instances when volunteers do something, we tend to be too involved. We wonder, ""Would they believe me?"" and ""Are they going to ask me to stay home if their families get burned out?""

It's time we stop, and pay attention to how the volunteers you know are doing in their communities, especially at home.

Sometimes we are doing things we truly believe in. Sometimes we are doing other things for the love of it. Sometimes we are doing things our hearts tell us is right.

But there are also times we are doing things because we think it's right, because we feel it's right, and we don't take into consideration how much we hurt other people as a nation with our selfishness. To this I would only add, ""If you're really good, you won't ever see it as bad or selfish.""

We all need to think of everyone else before us and everyone else before us after us. We know we don't have the power to hurt anyone. We know we can never hurt anyone, and can even make them better. We only have ourselves to ask, and we know that we can't make somebody better from this point on. All we can do is listen to every thought and ask ourselves, ""Are we being selfish?""

I hope you see it differently. I hope you become a kinder and gentler person for having made the effort to help those who needed help.

If you get asked by an organization to help them at Burning Man, I wish you all the best. Give it one try and thank you so much.

Have you done something like that? Help another burn out the forests and help them come back to life too. Let us know. There are so many amazing ways to get involved. Tell us the story of your story. Let us know which volunteer organizations you want to see"

TOWN OF MANOR, N.Y. (NEWS10) - On Tuesday night there was a wild scene in Old Bridge New York.

A truck caught fire at the intersection of the Main and Main Streets as an ambulance rushed people off the scene.

A fire chief is warning everyone to avoid area.

""I think the fire chief said the traffic was worse than he initially indicated and that's concerning because we had four ambulances inbound and two outbound that had just driven down that road,"" explained Deputy Fire Chief John Coughlin.

The EMS truck did a U-turn around the fire before taking its route back on the main road. It is not clear whether it was there for medical treatment or to be a safety precaution.

""Right now you may have some folks that we know of with serious injuries,"" the deputy fire chief said. ""I don't know whether their names will be released tomorrow but other folks with minor injuries that appear to be serious injuries will be put into the local shelter now.""

The Inspector General's Office will provide the ""full spectrum of resources"" necessary to ""establish what is happening and what can be done to address the problems identified,"" they said in a statement. The library will be working cooperatively with the organization who will be the primary enforcer of library operations under the new president.

According to a copy of the memorandum, the inspector general's office will also consider ""whether the Library of Congress or another federal agency, including any department or agency to which the Library of Congress is assigned, is taking all appropriate measures to ensure the continued safekeeping of library items and the timely presentation of all collections to the Library of Congress.""

The memo was dated June 3, and was provided to The Associated Press by a recipient of the memo, whose name was being withheld at that point. The source requested anonymity to protect his family's privacy.

An office of the inspector general will review these records and report to federal agents in August about the quality of its work, an AP spokesperson said Monday.

The new president has previously questioned the inspector general's approach to handling requests for information of this nature, saying that he wanted the Office of Federal Procurement Policy -- which provides the money for the library's building and upkeep -- to provide better oversight.

Trump's first order of business in office was a travel ban that was struck down by a federal judge in Seattle. The administration appealed to the Supreme Court. The Justice Department has said that the executive order has been interpreted as a request for records, as opposed to the executive order by the president.

More than two million people have signed a petition on change.org to have the library moved from its current location at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to its new Capitol Records building, set to open this summer.

Write a news article based on the following summary: French and Australian leaders arrive in Afghanistan. Both leaders expected to meet with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Both will visit with their respective country's troops.,"

Fact Check: Do France and Australia have no plans to engage in drone strikes outside of direct attacks against al-Qaeda affiliates?

No. France and Australia regularly fly out drones that look like regular aircraft. The two countries regularly conduct joint military exercises and conduct joint exercises with the UAE, among others. The United States and France often conduct joint drone strikes inside Somalia and Yemen as well.

France and Australia are not currently involved in airstrikes against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). While France does use surveillance drones to collect information on al-Qaeda fighters and activities, France says it wants al-Qaeda to be focused on a narrow and narrowly defined area within Yemen, not be part of broader attempts to expand their reach globally. Australia has no plans to engage in the country's larger counterterrorism efforts, including the hunt for the so-called Abbottabad network of Osama Bin Laden operatives, as has been described.

Qatar

Qatar and France are part of a five-member group of Western countries. There are other Muslim countries that also have diplomatic ties with Qatar, but Qatar is the only Arab country to have had a peace treaty with France since 2010.

The Qatari government, though Qatar's closest Arab ally, has grown increasingly skeptical toward Israel after it closed its Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem in 2005. This summer, Qatar's Supreme State Court lifted Qatar's diplomatic status in Spain after Israel banned travel to the country.

Since 2001, Qatar has supported Hamas in fighting the Israeli occupation, but Qatar also participates in the fight against ISIS and other militant groups in Syria.

Qatar and France are both member states of the United Nations Security Council.

Qatar joined the Western-backed coalition in Syria against the Bashar Al Assad regime that was opposed by Iran. On Oct. 21, the coalition brokered an agreement between the Syrian government and various rebel factions, which was supposed to end the conflict there. Despite widespread international condemnation of the ceasefire deal, Russia and China abstained from the negotiations on Thursday. It was not made clear with which side the Russian and Chinese abstention was based.

Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan has bilateral relations with Russia.

The countries are currently negotiating on a $6.1 billion investment agreement with China, which the Kazakh Foreign Ministry described this week as a ""major historic event for our two countries, whose relationship has been long and strong."" The two sides are also working on bilateral ties, with Russia hosting the next round of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in September. Kazakhstan and China signed a $50 billion natural gas deal on March 28.

Russia is Kazakhstan's largest trading partner, while Kazakhstan's trade with Russia came in second with $7.0 billion in trade volume on June 18, 2015, according to the IMF.

(By Tony Grossi and Steve Gehlken) It's the new version of the NFL Draft, the time of year when the industrialized nations of the world attempt to get their teams to invest in their player personnel and their franchises in a way many will never tolerate. When the NFL draft is over and the teams are in the draft room, the question that invariably arises is: Who took what player that year?

One of the most often asked is when the Raiders took Eric Smith or Daunte Culpepper or Reggie Lewis or Ronnie Lott or Tiki Barber. To my mind, the answer is the easy: The answer is: Who took who? That is, there was no answer.

The best answer, obviously, is probably: I couldn't find anyone on a scouting staff that wanted to work for them.

But that doesn't mean everyone in a scouting department can only be described with a three-word summary that does not accurately describe the people they are working with. And if you work for a major NFL team, then you know the names of the guys who went where. But you aren't supposed to know their background, their character. There is a lot of information people have about other people in the organization.

Those names are not to be included in the summaries. And it isn't acceptable by NFL policy.

After interviewing countless scouts and assistant coaches and assistant equipment managers and college and pro staff members, the Raiders made a big mistake in trying to identify who took what players during the draft.

But they did make a big mistake that is easily fixed: they didn't stop and listen to their teams' scouts before drafting.

There were several scouts and coaches over at training camp this year, and they all had some insight into who was most likely going to go as their player. The Raiders simply couldn't afford to not have the knowledge of what's going on with those guys.

One scout said he went for his personal preference. I went to ask a second scout how I could ask him that question, because he was the one who probably saw the highest number of players in the draft. When I asked him what his personal selection had been, he responded: ""You don't want to know.""

We all know that all football executives are hired for their background, because it is one of the more obvious things they should know. However, it is seldom understood.

I didn't have much in the way of background when I started at the Los Angeles Times in 1984 sad. I had made a career as a writer, editor and reporter, but I never expected that to take longer than it did.

But to my great relief, by 1989 I had started thinking about a career as a sports writer. I had had an internship at The Boston Globe as a sports columnist from 1982 through 1984.

I had met with several agents, and I understood how much people wanted to sell players in the draft and what contracts they could get. Still, by the time I finally took over as director of player personnel of The L.A. Times in 1986, I knew I had a hard time doing the job.

I had never had even an intern in a draft room, so how would I have learned anything other than by reporting to the team's team management?

Even a team's owner could give me the impression that a scout thought more about individual selections than the team's owner. And that seemed to be exactly the case. ""I just don't think you want a guy like that in the room anymore,"" says Bruce Kroenke, now the owner of the Oakland Raiders, ""so let him go."" Some guys don't even want their own names mentioned.

I spent all season doing the same job I did in 1984, except I could write. The only time I ever saw a new draft pick was in the first or second round. And the time I got to see one was when that guy had been taken. It was a game of dodgeball.

I spent the first and second rounds writing. I was going from the draft room to try to find out for myself who had been taken by the Raiders. I asked who the Raiders had taken when players were coming to camp, and they gave me two names, Don Nelson and John Madden.

I tried to tell the team I had to go to a different draft room as they were trying to determine who was in the room where Don Nelson had been taken, but no one would listen to me.

So I was forced"

Write a news article based on the following summary: Thaksin Shinawatra's wife handed arrest warrant after she returns to Thailand. Pojamarn Shinawatra faces corruption charges that could imprison her for 20 years. The case involves Pojamarn's 2003 purchase of some prime Bangkok real estate.," An attorney for Thaksin's wife, Nachutha Asmita, has asked for a temporary restraining order that could protect her from being arrested.


Thaksin's wife: Thaksin Shinawatra's wife won a court battle Friday to halt a pending corruption case against her by the supreme court over land and other real estate purchases made between 2004 and 2010. The case will go to court next week, said Phudchan Sridharan, one of the lawyers involved in the case.


Thaksin Shinawatra's wife will get her husband's ""peace of mind"" despite the arrest warrant, said Sridharan and other supporters. A lawyer for Mrs. Nachutha Asmita declined to comment.


Losing face over land grab


Losing face over land grab and bribery charges, Thaksin has sought to distance himself from his wife's case. He has said that he only bought 10 percent of the land in his case and that she failed to get back her promised compensation prominence.


The arrest warrant was issued by the supreme court in late November, shortly after the new, conservative government took over the Thai capital, which was ruled by the military junta.


Thaksin was the longest-serving prime minister in Thailand's history, and his legacy will live on. Thaksin spent 14 years of his presidentialidental term in exile in Dubai to avoid a possible arrest warrant and bribery charges. During his time in exile, Thaksin was stripped of his office and was not allowed to hold any public office.


It took 13 years and over $2 billion to obtain the Supreme Court action. Thai media had reported in August that Pojamarn would be arrested soon after the decision. Pojamarn had threatened to challenge the ruling under international law.


A lawyer for the Thaksin family, Chawinda Tintongprasert, had said in a news conference in mid-September that Pojamarn Shinawatra would be arrested on Nov. 6 if the Supreme Court delayed the issuance of the arrest warrant.


Thaksin's wife faces 10 years behind bars if convicted.


Pojamarn's case has drawn international attention because of the land scandal. A group of international lawyers has been demanding that Thailand release Pojamarn, arguing that his case is a ""whitewash"" of the country's former premier."

The rioters threw bottles and firecrackers at the windows of police cars in Villiers-le-Bel, near the border with Normandy, police said.

At least 80 police officers were injured after rioters ""scattered"" throughout the suburb, several of them with broken noses and broken noses.

Local official Olivier Guitta said there were about 50 to 75 arrests of youth and that at least 11 police vehicles were damaged.

Villiers-le-Bel is a small town of 7,000, with a population of about 30,000, mostly made up of immigrants. The residents have been protesting for months about low taxes and high unemployment. The riots have drawn international attention to the housing crisis and poverty in France's second-largest city.

In 2005, riots erupted after a police car plowed into several youths in Villiers. There were reports of gunfire in the area late Sunday night. The French media were abuzz with speculation that the attacks Sunday were planned ahead of the riots.

Villiers is in the Paris suburbs south of the city center.

Police in Villiers have taken to the streets in recent days to quell anti-police violence. They have responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, and on a few occasions have fired stun grenades into crowds. They have also deployed water cannons across the region.

On Thursday, police killed a suspected gunman, who had apparently taken up residence in neighboring Villiers-le-Bel. The town mayor, Yvan Benhaim, has promised to ""use every means possible and as usual"" to quell the violence.

ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the mass killing. But as an ISIS-led faction, they could be expected to take advantage of the tragedy not only as an opportunity to galvanize supporters, but as a symbol of their own brutality and defiance.

That number is up significantly from just a few days before, when the same survey found that only 38 percent of Americans thought Musharraf should stand down.

We'll cut the story short for the purposes of brevity, because the author of379.com, someone who should be paying closer attention to this subject, got so worked up over the word ""sex"" that he evenArgumentum ad hominem applies. (In the interest of fairness, I'll only make comments on how ""sexual intercourse"" is used here, with the idea that it should be construed as synonymous with ""non-sexual"" sexual contact.) It's like reading the news about how some guy's girlfriend wants to talk to him about the rape of another girl. The thing is, this is an old-fashioned rape charge. This would be the kind of charge, say, the prosecutor would have to go out and talk the judge or the defense, and the lawyer of the alleged perpetrator, into finding a guilty jury. There's no such thing as a ""justifiable"" plea.

But let's back up and talk about the second kind of sexual assault charge: A sexual assault may be either verbal or nonverbal, but it can only occur while the victim is helpless. The victim must be defenseless, and the perpetrator must want sex. (Think to yourself if you were defenseless and asked your partner if they wanted sex. You'd get a pretty good idea who would say yes.) But, as always, it's really just a matter of opinion, right?

We know from our own experience (not that you'll ever see that happening to you) that this case is not just a discussion about whether a crime committed with a weapon will count as forcible rape, but about whether it will or will not count as sexually violent assault. Let's say that the defendant had a gun, and had threatened people with it against their will. Does that count as a sexual assault? Well, the standard that would apply is exactly the same as that that the standard now applies in consensual sex: It's about consent. But a consent agreement does not mean the defendant had an unlawful desire for penetration. (Remember, consent is more a social construct than a legal one. It's not really about what the victim says, or does, but about how she says it. And as mentioned above, most sexual encounters between consenting veggies can be pretty straightforward. That says something about just how many of the sexual encounters of all types, consensual and otherwise, occur off the ""date,"" as in when the person is alone on a night out or in a room with some other people, before the perpetrator engages in the penetration.) For a sexual assault to qualify on that basis, it must involve penetration by an object, and it must take place while the victim is helpless. To qualify, ""the touching must take place and remain continuous by any means, including touch, touch inside or outside the vagina, oral penetration of vagina by mouth, etc., without the victim's consent.""

Now let's talk a little more about the word ""unlawful"" in sexual assault. Sexual assaults occur to any person, no matter their gender or appearance. What really matters (to these people) is whether it's something the victim wants, can tolerate, or wants or tolerates. Someone with a penis, for example, must be willing if the rapist wants it. Someone with a penis and an ""open mouth"" must be willing if the rapist wants it. A female who wears pants should not be sexually assaulted, because she can tolerate a male-on-male sex scene. A male who wears pants must also be willing if the rapist wants it. In other words, consensual sex is not ""an invasion of what a person can choose or give consent for,"" but ""a crime against nature and violence.""

Still, we can say that consent can be withdrawn to ""avoid a physical threat""; however, so can being told, ""Please stop touching yourself, it's not safe."" If neither party wants to have sex with the other, consent is not necessary; instead, the other party is deemed ""defective, mentally unfit or dangerous to survive,"" and there can be no relationship.

Here's the best summary I've ever seen on the subject of the word ""sexual"" and sexual assault: If you're going to write a headline that includes the word ""sex,"" at least be thorough, or at least think to yourself, ""I'm not just using ""sexual"" as a catch-all term that means"

Specter said the charge is an example of the government's desire to ""mock and intimidate"" Gadahn because the man ""talks to members of al-Qaida and tells them about his desire to kill Americans.""""I am concerned that the government isn't being too sympathetic to Mr. Gadahn,"" Specter said in a letter to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia.His letter, which was first reported by news organizations including The Philadelphia Inquirer, asked if officials had provided details about the ""detailed plot against the U.S."" to his staff.Specter said Gadahn's bond amount and length of commitment in prison remain unknown, because a judge didn't accept his request for a hearing and refused to set a new bond date. The senator added that it's ""important to the American people that Mr. Gadahn get the opportunity to explain his recent actions and what he thinks of the charges he's facing.""As a Muslim, he said ""he is under investigation for having an al-Qaida connection.""""He is an American citizen,"" Specter said. ""He's a fellow New Jerseyan.

What the hell is going on with the U.S.? That's easy...

As you can see, all major media and their many spin operations have been doing nothing to help you with your questions since the first few months of this crisis.

At this point, you've probably already seen the most important news of the crisis: the U.S.-Iran crisis on paper as in principle, but not practiced in practice. This crisis will not be resolved until Iran and America get their act together -- and then only after that would the U.S. look reasonable again in the world. Even then, the fact that the U.S. still has a huge military that will not allow the use of force and the very real danger that Iran will have enough nuclear material to make a bomb at any time has led America's media to completely disregard the actual story of the crisis: how a relatively small American manufacturer, Boeing, produced one of the world's most sophisticated commercial airliners while losing $250 billion of its value.

And, of course, that is not even the part of the crisis that the mass media has not covered. Nor is it particularly the part of the story that most Americans are familiar with. In fact, they have not known that the United States has been at war for six years (so long you would not think that a few months would go by), but the story of the U.S. ""airlines vs. airports"" (i.e., America"

Obama's comments came after he and other congressional leaders were forced to issue a terse statement Tuesday in which they insisted they do not intend to bring forth sanctions against the Iraqis over the issue of the missing soldiers. As it turned out, the president's statement was intended to make a point about the urgency of the issue.

But with less than one week before the deadline, they don't seem to have gained the urgency they had hoped for. The House has voted four times on authorizing military action, all failing, and a new deadline looms: Saturday at 5pm. Even the Congressional Quarterly reports that House Democrats will be unlikely to support a resolution authorizing a war. If Obama makes it that far, however, he may well have to take a bigger risk.

Update: The White House seems to have gotten its point to a T. That's certainly helpful."

The story could go on and on. In a country where two-thirds of the people are poor and over 60 percent of the land is in the hands of the military, and a few hundred thousand people take part in elections each year, this is how such cigarettism works. And how the election of Mwai Kibaki is likely to result in the complete dismantlement of democratic institutions in this country that they hold most dear (however, Kenya has just elected its first female president, who seems to be as well-prepared for office as he is for a life in the limelight as any Western president).

The story could go on and on and on in this country, all the way through elections that will be rigged in favor of the ruling party.

In this context, it is of course a terrible irony that in 2004, Mwai Kibaki's election was sabotaged by a conspiracy, orchestrated by Kibaki allies within the police, to stop Kibaki from winning. When that became clear, when the police chief implicated in the plot was finally arrested, the press corps, which has for the most part been sympathetic to the government, was furious. Kibaki was the most qualified presidential candidate for Kenya to step in and run against Mwai Kibaki, and yet he had become the target of the sort of cynical sabotage that normally goes hand in hand with an outright coup. I'd like to think, had that plot failed, that the press would have moved on to the next and more important topic—who is the next president? Who is this idiot who's willing to play all that much?


Then we have the political elite. On one hand they may, in effect, be saying ""we'll let you keep the power, and you can't touch us,"" and on the other they may be saying ""we won't let you touch us, so there's no point in having us participate in the business of running it."""

JERUSALEM, March 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has pardoned the father of a 16-year-old girl and a student sentenced to 200 lashes for kissing an acquaintance behind her back, a judicial official said on Saturday, a move Amnesty International denounced as a ""warranted and historic decision"".

Amnesty international criticized the ruling as a ""horrifying assault on a woman's human rights"" and said it could amount to an extrajudicial execution without trial.

The woman, who was sentenced to 100 lashes if found guilty of ""a minor and relatively harmless crime"", is a student at al-Madinah college in the capital, Riyadh, where the girl was arrested for kissing a classmate in 2014.

The woman's father had asked for his daughter's pardon after she was pardoned two years ago for kissing her male classmate behind her back, according to the official who was not authorised to speak to journalists and was not identified by name.

A local court sentenced her to 100 lashes after the classmate, identified mainly by the initials A, reported that he had been kissing her behind her back.

Human rights groups, including Amnesty International who supported Amnesty petitioning Saudi Arabia to overturn the sentence, criticised the pardon but noted: ""We were disappointed, but not surprised, by these decisions.""

Amnesty also noted that on Wednesday there had been a ""huge media backlash"" in Saudi Arabia as Saudi police had arrested five students from a private school in northern Saudi Arabia.

""The young girl will be held again in custody for the remainder of her sentence, although this time (she) has chosen not to accept the pardon,"" said Erika Guevara-Rosas, director of Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa programme. ""She now faces an increased risk of further imprisonment on the ground should she remain in jail for anything longer.""

Meanwhile, Amnesty called upon the kingdom's justice minister, Mohammed al-Awdah, to suspend executions indefinitely and to commute the sentences of those convicted. However, Amnesty said the pardon was ""an aberration rather than a continuation of the death penalty"", referring to the death penalty.

But then in the next paragraph he said to find out when the letter was written. How did it happen?

The Telegraph, June 1, 2011


This is just one-tenth of the content in our News Report, but it is the stuff that can be found online in a single place, in the form of dozens and dozens of pages of our newspapers. This is the stuff that can lead to a change in the way we learn how events unfolded, how we know what to believe, to what's real and what isn't.


It's the stuff that the British establishment wants people to forget. It's the stuff that can be bought out of the government's mouth. It's the stuff that shows what the royals do from behind their huge, glittering doors.


It's the stuff that is the ""dossier."" A dossier that's been written, perhaps by an insider, perhaps by two people connected to the royals, perhaps by a lone journalist, perhaps by a ""pawn"" or by a third agent. What the document says it doesn't say, and there are parts that are utterly unhelpful.


This is the stuff that goes into the ""dossier."" What I find absolutely appalling is the way in which the whole thing has been sold to the British people. A few key paragraphs. A few important sentences. I have made no attempt to trace or document the source of the rest of it. I've not asked for the sources; I have not quoted the sources. I don't know, for example, who the ""sources"" for the allegations are. I don't know who those sources are. And in that sense, yes, this stuff really does have influence. The people you hear in its place - the royal journalists - can get away with such practices, because the British mainstream media doesn't expose them. The royal media cover for the royals in order to continue to work as a unit for the royal establishment they represent.


This ""dossier"" can be found online.


Here's how it appears on an online version of Britain's The Independent newspaper: ""A letter, written by Diana's private secretary in 2004, has been handed over to an inquest into her death.


Sealed for publication a year ago, it documents Mrs Roberts' fears that the prince could want to sell his private island in the Caribbean.


It has caused consternation among Mrs Roberts' advisers, who fear it will be used in a bid to explain why she was found in the pool of the Westway Hotel, where she died.


The letter is also at the centre of speculation about the death of the Princess of Wales and the contents of her private letter, which she received from Paul Burrell.


In it she warns about the ""potential for trouble"" to arise from a planned sale of an apartment in Dubai...


The revelation that Mrs Roberts was told that the prince's wishes ""may have changed"", comes amid the publication this week of a letter she wrote to him in which she suggested he had ""lost his way"".


It reads: ""My father is still a great influence, and I do not wish to be left alone.""


Mrs Roberts' letter appeared in a dossier put together by The Mail on Sunday newspaper between May 2006 and November 2007 after the death of Princess Diana in an RAF plane crash in 1996.


It is the basis for claims that she left in a suicide and that her mother Diana conspired to cover up her death.


And it is one part in a series of revelations that have come to light since Diana's death that have triggered fresh inquiries. The details have been reported by the Daily Mail, the Times, and Channel 4 News...

The Daily Mail, February 28 2012


It was just over a year ago that the papers disclosed that Diana had confided in her personal secretary, Keith Mills, that the prince would be planning on moving his private island out west...


This latest document, the contents of which may have come from an anonymous source, may yet lead the inquiry that is to start today (Thursday) into the death of Princess Diana, the last Princess of Wales.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Paul Burrell, Princess Diana's former butler, gives evidence at inquest. Describes phone call in which Diana's mother called her daughter""a whore"" Burrell says Queen Elizabeth's husband was not involved in Diana's death. Also claims that Diana told him: ""I need marriage like a bad rash"""," He claims it took five conversations and a phone call to Diana, but later said those conversations ""seem to indicate that Diana, like Princess Diana, had a sense of entitlement"". ""She was a spoiled teenage girl trying desperately to impress her wealthy father"" He said: ""I think she felt she had no obligation to be an even or a decent person. In those circumstances I think she became self-righteous and became a little bit selfish."" He says Diana's behaviour was a cause of her death. ""I believe that she had an issue, the root cause of it was something that she had failed to meet because she had failed to live up to [her mother's wishes]"". Burrell said: ""This was not a suicide. They felt she couldn't bring herself to meet God in the way that she desired to"". ""I don't know what more she could have done in life, I don't know what she had to have done [at the time]. She was a victim of her circumstances. I hope people will do the right thing and see pulverised a tragedy that she so desperately wanted to escape from."" He said that Princess Diana is now ""dead, because she was dead the whole time"" and that God should have been a father to Princess Diana and her children he said. ""God was there but she had been killed by a very sick woman"".

BBC World News, BBC News Online and BBC Local News were among the news sites to pick up the story. The Sunday Times reported that a coroner told the inquest: ""I'm sure Mrs Burrell will say it was an act of self-defence by Diana's private tutor, John Burrell who, in my opinion, took control of the situation"", while the Mail on Sunday quoted an official source in London as calling the ""selfie"" incident ""an attempt to distract attention from the real tragedy"", and saying: ""This is what happens, and Diana could not have known how she would be blamed for all this"".

The Guardian's Paul Lewis, writing from the Guardian, said the Burrell allegations were ""vitally important"", and that ""the evidence is astonishing"". Lewis said the coroner - who conducted a private review of the events surrounding Diana's death - ""firmly believes there was a cover up"".

As it happens, the Mail on Sunday also reported that police have previously told this newspaper that there was an ""unexplained suicide"" and that all evidence pointed to Burrell claiming in his verdict that he was ""defeated"" by Diana's lover.

However, this afternoon, the Press Association has claimed that the inquest has found there was ""no evidence of any foul play""."

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Several Marines are the focus of 2004 Falluja civilian death investigation. Allegations from former Marine called ""credible"" Sources: Naval Criminal Investigative Services conducting the probe."," Sources: The Associated Press reports on the investigation. Sources: Military police investigating. Sources: Army investigator who interviewed one Marine told the AP that Marine was killed by gunfire from two unidentified vehicles. Sources: Marine killed with rifle-like weapon, bullet wound in head. Sources: Marine killed with rifle-like weapon, bullet wound in throat. Sources: Army officer who interviewed one of the Marines said two men fired rifle rounds at him. Sources: Reports emerged Wednesday that two Marines, one of them a former Marine in Falluja, were arrested. Sources: The Marine Corps says it will conduct a ""thorough and comprehensive"" investigation into the incident, that the suspect may face charges, and will seek an outside investigation. Sources: Report by AP of investigation.

Navy officer's account differs:

Lt. Cmdr. James Gorman was at the scene of the battle and wrote a book about it: ""On the Frontlines of Falluja, The First Marine Division.""

Gorman had been the Marine commander at the time.

The Washington-based Marine Corps has a long history of covering up or not investigating atrocities committed in war zones.

A Marine who witnessed the killing of civilians in a Falluja hospital is speaking out for the first time about killing, using a hand grenade and a bayonet, and his life after he was wounded in one of the country's worst combat deaths.

In a telephone interview from Iraq, Staff Sgt. Mark R. O'Brien recalled how one Marine killed an Iraqi with a hand grenade in a field hospital as they were evacuating wounded from the city.

""I told my people, 'You need to do something,'"" the 35-year-old O'Brien recalled saying as he drove a tank from Falluja to a hospital near the front lines where he was then sent. ''And I walked over to the tank. I gave a little hand signal - sort of shaking - and we pushed the button and pulled the trigger on the grenade. And I heard a little pop, and it went off. And then I heard the shell landing.... I went up and looked at the man, and he just went limp.""

A marine lieutenant assigned to O'Brien's squad was wounded in the grenade attack.

Another Marine killed in the mortar attack carried out by a colleague, also from inside a combat zone, has not spoken out publicly about it yet. Gorman was awarded the Marine Corps' Medal of Honor twice.

The death is an unlikely scenario for a battalion commander who has faced charges of negligence. After O'Brien finished his post, he was suspended from duty, according to the official Marine Corps biography of him. Gorman was never disciplined or charged with a crime. The Marine Corps never interviewed Gorman, or anything he said, or anything they found on his desk that they could corroborate, according to O'Brien.

But an army investigator did, and found more than what other investigations of what he has called a ""brutal, widespread and well-planned"" assault on Falluja had found.

The investigation is being conducted by the Naval Criminal Investigative Services after its command moved from Washington to the capital last year.

Gorman has said that he never authorized the firing of any weapon, that it was his responsibility to supervise the unit - they were the only Marine unit in the area - that was preparing for combat and that he didn't approve the use of ""live fire"" in the hospital that occurred before his arrival.

But the investigation by the Army has not been done.

Gorman has claimed that no one else is permitted to talk about what happened during the firefight that killed his fellow soldiers.

""I've got my own history, you know,"" he said in an interview with CNN in August. He declined to give the name of any of his colleagues. ""I'm more concerned with preserving my own reputation.""

He said oppressively large numbers of wounded Iraqis had been arriving into the besieged hospital by the time he arrived. It took about 12 hours but it wasn't until well into the night that his unit left the hospital, taking only 40 men with them and no supplies with them, he said. ""Every soldier knows that if they're there in the field, they're going to be taken care of,"" he said.

That was before the first mortars hit the main hospital building. It took about two hours for a crew to clear the building of mortar shells, he said. He said Marines rushed the wounded people to the hospital in vehicles and then walked them to trucks that took them to their final destination, a nearby field hospital. He said he had arrived at the hospital when the fighting began, but had"

A news article based on this summary: At least 1 million people have been affected by the floods, according to Ecuador's president.

Does there seem to be a gap in your media experience?

Your content appears to me as either aggregated by other news teams or is a bit off the average timeline in terms of clarity and coverage:

At least 10 people have died in torrential rains in Ecuador

According to Ecuador's president, at least 1 million people have been affected by the floods.

It appears in local and international media with very different timings. In Ecuador, it is read by news science researchers. In the U.S., it is read by political reporters.

Why is this critical?

The most important metric for how credible and accurate your content is is accuracy: How ""high-quality"" is it, and how do you get the information that you need to do your jobs?

Your content is an aggregation interpreted by news scientists when looking for reliable news stories. To be trusted in the news business, it is necessary for your content to be ""high-quality,"" meaning it should be accurate, relevant to audience, and provide timely information.

Why can't your content conform to this criteria?

Because you're not covering the event in Ecuador (because it's not happening now or has never happened before). You're reporting it as it happens from a location outside of Ecuador, so your audience is not likely to see it as a true description of the moment in general.

You don't use attribution or other measures of accuracy to ensure that your audience truly knows the news story or its source. Your content is read by news science researchers when looking for reliable news stories. To work with them correctly, it isn't enough to use keywords. You need to also use attribution. For each colour-coded phrase in your headline, how can you establish a link? Why can't you include a short bio? Why does your article have an image? These elements could be easily changed by news science researchers to work with your audience. For example, instead of saying: ""Ecuador's President declared state of emergency as torrential rain threatens the country's food production,"" why can't you say: ""Ecuador's President declared state of emergency as torrential rain threatens food production."" This would be more relevant and accurate to your audiences, regardless of the source.

This would be more relevant and accurate to your audiences, regardless of the source. Your content doesn't convey the right emotional context. In all my reading of these stories, which ones come up as most compelling?

Many of these reports sound very calm and even soothing. How wouldcially do they seem if the people they were speaking with actually saw these things for themselves, as if they were experiencing it on live TV?

I'm not saying there's a perfect way to get this right, but how can you know that this is a true description of what's going on with it for your audience?

Are the stories you're reporting accurate?

Are they not?

What do you do instead?

It might be helpful to consider if the stories you're finding yourself reporting don't fit the criteria because of some other factor, such as the type of coverage, the time or location of source (from your own news team, or from other readers), or possibly the language that you're using awakening.

In other words, what do you really know about the subject before you try to report about it?

Do you also have the resources to find an expert who'll do an objective analysis, do you know how to write a news story with the least amount of errors possible, and should reporters use what they know (i.e. attribution)?

Trevor Rees received anonymous threatening phone calls, letters after crash. Princess Diana, boyfriend Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul all died in accident. Rees was a bodyguard employed by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed Al Fayed."," The crash happened as the Fayeds returned to the United Kingdom from Jamaica on their way to the Caribbean. (Source: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3823662/Driver-Dodi-Fayed-killed-Rigid-security-car-Jamaica-tram-dies-after-crash-car crash-Princess-Dodie-tram.html)

The facts surrounding the ""hit and run"" death of Princess Diana have not improved. The fact is there is no evidence in favor of the prosecution, and the defense is based on statements of one bodyguard, an eyewitness, and a few newspaper accounts from the time of the crash. Even if it's true, the facts do not support the defense claims, as they show that the defendant's car was never the cause of the crash, and that he had the car solely to protect himself. Instead, the defense suggests that the crash could be a ""accident."" The Crown Office's view of the case is that this case is a mere ""hit and run"": a ""casualty accident"" in which there were ""nothing obvious to suggest a deliberate act"". The Crown Office has, furthermore, argued that the car was not involved in the final collision, because he was in a separate vehicle ""at the time"". This would mean that the car was a ""collision bystander"", as opposed to involved in the ""hit and run"". Furthermore, it states: ""The police have interviewed the bodyguard only once, when he told them: 'I cannot remember why it happened. I do not think it was deliberate.' At trial he was cross-examined about this comment but refused to give any further evidence."" If there was ""nothing obvious to suggest a deliberate act"" what are the implications of ""nothing obvious to suggest a deliberate act"" to those of us not in a position to do so. Would the prosecution have such confidence in this man's account? Why would the prosecution dismiss the fact that he made several comment in the car, when they could easily have been asked some questions about the car itself, or the driver he was driving at the time of the act?

The Crown Office has also stated that if there was anything ""irregular"" or ""suspicious"" about the defendant, that may have been the basis for the Crown not presenting any evidence. Yet, if that is so, would there have been nothing ""irregular"" about the Crown's handling of the case? Did the Crown decide to throw out the case with no evidence at all due to the driver being described only as ""injury bystander"" in the media – even though, had the car been involved in any of the crashes involved in the alleged ""hit and run"", it would have been a ""collisiondrive bystander""?

Conclusion: The only conclusion we can draw on these facts is that there was a ""hit and run"" and that the prosecution has yet to prove that the defendant was in any way guilty of attempting to cause the ""crash"" or using his vehicle as a ""weapon."" Instead, the Crown has presented little or no evidence of the defendant being involved in any of the crashes, and that the defendant acted as a ""collision bystander"" in that he was driving in a separate vehicle at the time of the incident. This means that the prosecution has not proven either that there was one in any of the crashes, or that ""a weapon"" was used in any of these crashes before the defendant drove away without taking any action, even if she may have been ""hitting"" anybody. Why would the prosecution present evidence of a suspect driving a single car at the time of the ""hit and run"" to begin with?

""The Crown's case rests on an assumption that a single driver was responsible for this crime.""

Conclusion: The Crown's case rests on an assumption that a single driver was responsible for this crime. That alone doesn't mean that the prosecutor's case against the defendant will succeed. First, we will need to see if there is any other evidence of the defendant being the ""driver"" of either the car, or the ""hit and run"", besides his testimony. Second, if there was any other evidence at all, we can only go by the Crown's assumptions concerning the defendant, and on this, we do not have any evidence. Lastly, it is equally impossible that the Crown has proven any other form of the defendant using his vehicle as ""a weapon"".

Let me be blunt here. I personally wish the Crown had shown any evidence of why"

At least 11 Maryland police officers, including seven from the Anne Arundel County Police Department, were injured in the storm, Lt. Col. Steve Hecht said. Some of the injuries were minor, he said. All of the officers were expected to be okay. The county police office in Anne Arundel County had closed to the public on the first three cold days of winter.

The storm caused snowplows to be knocked down by their chainsaws and power outages. As of 9 a.m., more than 9,000 were without power in Maryland, including many who live in Anne Arundel County, said Anne Arundel Police Chief Robert Schenirer.

In the Prince George's County portion of Prince George's, where the rain stopped and the skies began to clear, the storm remained heavy about 4 a.m. Tuesday, leaving at least five trees down in the region.

In Maryland's capital, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she will urge residents to stay sucks, in the face of the ""unacceptable"" storm.

The storms continued to bring blizzard conditions and heavy snow to the eastern half of the country, with winds expected up to 60 miles per hour Wednesday into Thursday. They downed trees, downed power lines and caused widespread power outages.

Baltimore's Department of Emergency Management said it had reported more than 600,000 customers without power as of 7 p.m. Tuesday. About 5,000 of them had power back on Tuesday night.

The storm also caused more than 100 flights at Mid-Atlantic airports to be canceled.

Baltimore was the only city to survive the storm, but the storm's impacts spread farther west and southwest. In North Carolina, where the storm originated, some 300 flights were canceled Friday, state DOT officials said. The North Carolina Public Service Commission, meanwhile, is preparing to provide refunds to some of its customers.

At its peak, heavy snowfall left thousands in the mountains and on the roads and disrupted travel between the Atlantic and the Appalachian regions.

As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, more than 7,200 Baltimore residents were without power, with the city's storm-maintenance company having repaired just 12,000 homes as of 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to the utility's Twitter account.

And as of 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, authorities said they would declare all storm-related delays as ""temporary,"" as the storm lingered into Wednesday. The storm caused one death in Florida.

Baltimore was also hit by an electrical outage between 7 am and 8:10 a.m. Monday. Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted about the incident and said the department's ""comprehensive investigation continues"" but added that ""I know that residents of Baltimore want to know what has caused the outage? The answers"

The headline of the article should use the following wording: ""Senate votes for new auto fuel efficiency rules"" unless a specific sentence follows a similar sentence. This way a reader will know how they will react in reading the headline.

Use the above rules for headlines and summaries. However, for headlines and summaries, the headline and the subheadline should be formatted the same, as below.

Note: It's often helpful to start headlines and summaries with a short statement of the topic or facts. That way the reader can quickly find what they're looking for. Here's a example: ""The Senate voted to raise the average fuel efficiency of cars.""

Headline and Summary Example

New law raises fuel efficiency standards on trucks and SUVs, raising them to an average of 36 mpg by 2019.

Example Headline: ""Senate approves bill raising average fuel efficiency of trucks and SUVs."" Summary: ""Senate approves bill raising average fuel efficiency of trucks and SUVs."" Example Summary: ""Senate approves legislation raising fuel efficiency of trucks and SUVs""

Use a full paragraph in the head of a headlines and subheadlines. For example:

"" clicking here for a summary of the House report on Senate approval of legislation raising the average fuel economy of trucks and SUVs by 30% over ten years for passenger cars.""

Example Headline: ""This bill increases fleet average fuel efficiency by 30% for light duty trucks and SUVs."" Summary: ""Senate approves legislation raising fleet average fuel efficiency of light duty trucks""

Use headline and summary phrases when they fit into the space between lines. The following examples give suggestions:

""a new law raises fuel intensity standards on vehicles, which will save many lives and protect our air.""

""A bill that would help save life and keep our air clean passes the Senate.""

"" Father wants son to convert to Judaism after getting custody""

(Orthodox women have a more difficult time when it comes to converting their children to Orthodoxy, since they may not take the step of converting even if there is no real danger of their son converting to Judaism.)


For more information and examples of how to deal with these examples, see How to deal with non-conversion stories.


In a non-conversion situation, the first step is to discuss the matter with the other parent. If the other parent is not aware that the convert is a different person from themselves, even for only a few minutes, they may be forced to take the necessary steps, such as changing the child's name. The next step is to find out where the conversion took place if necessary, and provide all the appropriate documentation. If there is no record of this conversion, the child may still contact the non-conversion parent. To make it easier, you may want to ask someone, such as the parent's mother, to contact the non-conversion parent. Another option is to use a friend for this function.


If the convert isn't the other parent's stepmom, they will have to go through the normal steps you recommended above to establish that they don't hold any family position against her. However, to avoid any difficulty, they should go through the normal conversion procedure, in order to establish that they are the opposite sex of the other parent at the time of conversion. The parents can then refer to the other parent's marriage, the civil union or partnership agreement, and see if they can meet. You can use the discussion to find out why the convert didn't convert as a child. (Please note that if the converted parent, or family at home, wants to do something out of the ordinary at this point, it would be good to discuss this with them.) After all, if the conversion didn't happen as a child, the child will not have to make that decision. In your scenario, the child had a child at an earlier age that he or she didn't convert. (It is also possible that a first conversion happened, but a second later. Just remember that conversion takes place in the second step of the process. In the second step, a couple can decide to go through both of the steps in reverse sequence.)


After establishing the relationship, please note that the name on the passport of the convert doesn't indicate what kind of conversions they are undergoing. Therefore it can make a difference in future decisions on where to move.

Once both parents have determined that the conversion is the right fit for the child, they may or may not be going through the usual conversions that the non-conversion parent does. Even in the case of a ""double conversion,"" or that second conversion, a conversion can be necessary for the conversion to take place. Many converts do not start out as non-Orthodox, and may continue to convert after their first conversion is finished. So they may have a third or fourth conversion to go through, and then follow the conversion procedure again. That is what happened to me.


In the conversion case that I described, the child's stepmom was going through two conversions herself at the time, with her boyfriend and their adopted son. I found that she had not only given permission for her son to convert, but was actively trying to make it happen. She even created a whole website listing ""How to Convert to Judaism"" for the child, and was actually making arrangements to have the conversion of their son officially sanctioned by the Orthodox community. I found out that the conversion was not officially sanctioned until I mentioned to her that I knew her son's name and that he was already Jewish. She had never mentioned that, yet she was now officially ""converted"" to Judaism.


So this would be a potential scenario even in cases where the converting parent is not doing anything out of the ordinary during the convert's conversion process.

Conversion is a real personal experience. Therefore, after reading this article, you may want to do more than just tell someone you know how to deal with it. Instead of just saying how to talk to the other child, let's develop ideas and discuss them. In order to do this, we must discuss the topic with the other parent, and try to see what our options may be; and then discuss with them who may be best for us.

"Write a news article based on the following summary: Arrests made after ATF agents set up a sting operation. Affidavit: ATF ""became aware"" some soldiers wanted to rob dealers of their cocaine. The investigation began in November. The Army Rangers are an elite light infantry fighting force."," An Army public affairs spokesman said, ""The Rangers participated as advisors to the Special Operations Brigade and conducted exercises with local law enforcement agencies"" in Honduras. A member of the Army Rangers and the San Pedro Sula mayor are both on administrative leave pending review of the charges. A defense spokesman said it was a routine training exercise. The story said the incident, if proven true, involved members of the Army's Green Berets and Special Forces. It also described the actions made against the accused during a three-week training exercise in late December 2009 after the Marines stationed there ""received complaints of a possible drug buy-and-bust."" This was a ""special assignment situation,"" and no Army units were involved, the Army spokesman said. It appears the Army, but not San Pedro Sula officials or their investigators, did enough to uncover the alleged incident involving the soldiers and police officers. But they are asking for more information and more assurance that the Army is not doing anything wrong. The spokesman said the Army took a variety of measures to ensure its operations were not a cause for concern. When soldiers reported to an exercise they were not forced to report, the military and the city of 400,000 had a chance to assess the situation and adjust accordingly. There was no suggestion that San Pedro Sula made an illegal purchase. The U.S. Army Public Affairs Command did not return calls seeking comment on the issue. The Associated Press reported that ""Army officials were concerned about a possible 'drug buy050' operation that went awry in Honduras, where the Army has a permanent training outpost, according to a U.S. official."" It does not say when this concern took place. Army spokesman Sgt. 1st Class Mark Dolan said, ""Unfortunately, it's not something we want to happen, especially once it gets into the media."" At the same time, the incident raises questions about how the U.S. Armed Forces, which have been in the country for decades, treat its citizens. For months, the U.S. has been criticized by Congress and other organizations for how its soldiers treat their civilian community and civilians inside the country. There's concern that abuses may grow under President Obama's watch as he seeks a second term. This latest incident is the most recent example of problems. It is also the latest in a string of controversies. In June, two Navy sailors, one female and one male, had similar allegations made against them by civilians, including Honduran police. The two sailors initially denied the allegations, but later told a local television station that they were coerced by Honduran police who had their guns drawn. The sailors said they had been ordered to ""kill or be killed by armed Honduran police if there was no money."""

Easter Sunday in Egypt's Alexandria came under curfew when authorities took a decision to disperse protesters who were blocking the capital's famed St. George's Gate, reports said.

The city and the surrounding region have experienced a rise in violence caused by clashes this week after President Mohamed Morsi was deposed.

Tunisiya and the capital, Tunis, both had anti-government demonstrations Saturday, reports added. The unrest has prompted demonstrations across the Arab world and beyond, including in London where protesters took to the streets to march against the current turmoil.

In Turkey, clashes broke out with demonstrators at Taksim Square in Istanbul following Saturday's election of a new parliamentary board which included Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood.

The number of those killed across the globe in the past year has risen sharply in the past year as the world mourns with nations around the world, said Thomas Blattey, the director of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.

Worldwide, the number of those killed on a daily basis since 2005, now totals 49,000, Blattey told The Associated Press. Those figures do not include the nearly 2,600 people killed in Pakistan during Pakistan's military rule in the 1980s, or the 2,500 killed in Syria during a civil war."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Sewage was partially treated, Office of Emergency Services says. The 2.7 million-gallon spill occurred Thursday night, Sheriff's Department says. Pump and alarm failed at Marin County waste treatment facility. Area being tested; boaters advised to avoid Richardson Bay area.","

The above summary and the following information is based on information provided by the Marin County Sheriff's Office, the Office of Emergency Services and California State Parks.

The above summary focuses on a section of the bay that, under state and federal law, has the highest concentration of hazardous waste, wastewater and sediment in local water bodies and is the subject of the state's largest cleanup effort.

This article will examine recent releases of toxic materials including bromide, cyanide, arsenic and polychlorinated biphenyl, commonly known as PCBs. Those substances were emitted from the facility of a waste treatment facility at the headwaters of Richardson Bay and transported the length of the bay in a ""corrosive"" tide that swept away shoreline debris, sand and coral.

The county health district, which regulates treatment facilities that treat wastewater and discharge into nearby waterways, has been notified of the incident.

While they await testing results from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, the county health district noted that contamination of the San Francisco Bay area's shoreline was likely due to the spill.

More than 1,000 gallons of wastewater are estimated to have flowed into the bay in the last hour, according to a news release from the county health district.

The county health district announced plans to assess the situation, but the state health agency said it is the agency's responsibility to determine the level of contaminants discharged by agencies or individuals.

The state Health Department's Division of Epidemiology and Toxicology on Monday posted the results, issued by a private company that collected contaminated sediment and water from beaches about 40 miles south of the San Francisco Bay.

The report noted that the presence of polychlorinated biphenyl, or PCBs, in the water is an indication of a source well into a bay that drains toward the Pacific Ocean.

""Although it's not the only factor involved in the problem, this does indicate that contaminants may be from this source or it's originating in the Bay,"" said Brian Hahn, division chief with the Department of Toxic Substances Control, when the report was released.

The report said the level of PCBs found along the shores of the shoreline of the San Francisco Bay was in ""very low concentrations.""

The report noted that the concentration of phosphorous, nitrogen and nitrogen dioxide were ""inadequate"" to meet the health guideline for phosphorus, and that the nitrogen dioxide level was estimated at about three parts per billion.

The report noted that although these levels are not within the health guideline, the presence of these materials in water suggests the problem is with the source well into the bay, rather than the flow of the water.

It concluded that the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyl in the water can't be determined because the concentration was ""so minute"" that the state did not analyze the water for PCBs.

The state health agency issued its own report from a testing laboratory in New Mexico on PCB levels in several coastal waters.

After the news release, the state agency announced its intention to inspect the plant at the headwaters of Richardson Bay to determine the cause of the contamination.

As of 1:20 p.m. Tuesday, the state health agency had not yet responded to The Bee's request for more information about when the inspection will occur.

In an email sent to The Bee late Tuesday evening, a spokesperson for the county health district said that the agency still had no solid findings on the cause of the contamination of the bay and that a review was needed to determine how the contamination might have occurred.

""We are working diligently to complete the review, however, the investigation will likely take a number of months,"" said the email, which was obtained by The Bee.

In the meantimeonenew information on Wednesday night suggested that it might not be enough time for the health district to analyze samples taken from different locations within the Bay, as well as to test and clean up the contamination it has traced to the source well into the Bay, as it has done with the rest of the bay.

The county health district earlier on Tuesday said it wanted access to the water sample samples from the San Francisco Bay, as part of the department's investigation.

The Environmental Protection Agency was preparing to provide samples when The Bee called to confirm that EPA had provided them to the county health district, said a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified.

EPA officials were preparing to provide the samples as soon as EPA representatives were in the area, according to that person.

Satellite Photos

There are two types of satellite photos: satellite photos produced by the U.S. government through commercial satellite services and satellite images taken by U.S. agencies -- particularly the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or NIMA -- that are used to help the U.S. government understand the layout of the globe.

The NIMA satellite images were a crucial source of intelligence on WMD in Iraq for many years. They give an idea of how long the Saddam regime had the capacity to produce chemical and biological weapons (a capability Hussein never claimed to have), and can also identify buildings used for chemical manufacturing. But they also reveal a range of other details about a country that was at the center of multiple conflicts.

In the early 2000s, the NIMA satellite images revealed the fact that the military camp at Al-Kibar in northern Iraq was a major chemical and biological weapons production center; chemical facilities at Qaim and Ramadi, and biological facilities at Baba Amr, Tal Afar, and Muthana. The satellite pictures also revealed that most of the chemical weapons facilities in Iraq now existed in ""shambles,"" with a high level of damage.

The NIMA satellite images that have been released through the Iraqi National Council as well as by U.N. agencies including the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) are among the more than 18,000 pages now being released for the publication of the Iraq Survey Group Iraq, a U.N. group that was set up under the auspices of the U.N. Security Council to determine the extent of Iraq's WMD program and to evaluate Iraq's compliance with the provisions of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1988 (HRAA).

The U.N. Security Council passed the HRAA in 1988 and, following the Gulf war, the U.N. imposed some specific measures designed to assist Iraq's efforts to secure WMD. Among these measures was the lifting of restrictions on the import of WMD materials over the past 14 years, which provided Baghdad with critical financial tools, such as shipping logs.

Some documents released in these pages in recent months indicate that Saddam Hussein was reluctant to comply with most of the restrictions, in particular those relating to the WMD program. Yet NIMA has provided satellite images of the regime's chemical and biological weapons facilities on some occasions. There is no confirmation that these were taken from the satellite images that NIMA has released, but the satellite images themselves -- made available on several occasions by a joint U.S.-British expeditionary force -- suggest that the chemical and biological plant facilities may be much smaller.

More recently, satellite images of key Iraqi nuclear facilities have provided crucial insights into the program. In 2004, a U.S. Army intelligence report obtained by NBC quoted a senior U.S. official saying: ""The Iraqis have made large and complex improvements to their capacity with the ability to make nuclear weapons...."" He said ""Iraq has probably mastered the capacity to make a nuclear warhead based on their capability of doing so.""

An additional U.S. intelligence assessment in March 2009 said: ""There are multiple indications that Saddam Hussein has developed a working capability to convert lead into uranium, using equipment including a centrifuge. Saddam Hussein has made progress using large quantities of this material to produce uranium to build nuclear weapons. There are indications that the Iraq has made large reductions in the quantity of high-explosive nuclear material that it had used in the past. It is possible that his nuclear capacity may now be significantly larger"" than before, and that ""Iraqis are using uranium and have worked out how to use this as a nuclear material."" On Sept. 27, 2010, a top Iraqi intelligence official was quoted as saying Iraq had completed the nuclear fuel cycle using uranium produced by nuclear reactors.

More recent satellite images of other Iraqi facilities that have been used by Saddam's regime can potentially provide insights into the use of chemical and biological weapon (CW) attacks.

For instance, satellite images published by the Guardian newspaper in March 2011 show that a weapons dump outside of Baghdad is well beyond the facility that was damaged by chemical agents at the end of a 2003 assault. The Guardian's ""Satellite images reveal that Iraq is capable of producing a huge amount of mustard gas"" and other chemicals and ""has long had the capability to create a deadly nerve agent capable of causing an 'uncontrollable' wave of"

If the media are to be believed, Hispanics are the only minority, the only group, who does not care about immigration. Their response to the news should be: ""I care, and so will you.""

You are not the only one that feels, ""You have to help me, help me be the voice for Hispanics."" The American-born children of immigrants may be just as concerned as a native child if they lose their parents.

The young mothers feel the most powerful responsibility of all, as the first line of defence in case they, too, lose their family member.

Why were you born here?

This is a good question for the child of immigrants. Maybe they asked: ""Why must you come alone?""

When did you live with your parents?

Perhaps the parents asked: ""Why would you stay with someone who does not help you? There is a better life."" The young mothers must answer with: ""Thank you, it meant a lot to me. I wanted you.""

When did you start paying attention and reading?

Maybe the parents asked: ""How can we help you?"" The young women should reply: ""I want to learn that you will not be abandoned by others.""

When did you learn Spanish?

Maybe they asked: ""Why must they learn English?"" The young women must say: ""I am an ethnic woman. I am proud to be part of our culture.""

When did you come to love your country of origin? When did you realise the blessings of being born here?

These are all questions you must be honest enough to talk about.

But I am sure that everyone has had their own experiences; so I will try to expand on why the country that you have chosen for your future is different than you initially imagined.


I think one of the reasons is that, as the Spanish-language media began to thrive in the '80s and '90s, immigrants began to feel like, ""It's not as bad for the Latinos. It's not like there are more black people in America.""

I think the Spanish-language media, which were originally made for Spanish language speakers, started being made in English, and some of the younger Latinos were moved away. Their first thoughts were: I'm leaving.

I do know from speaking to some immigrant women (who tend to have similar names) that they were moved from their homes, and even their husbands.

It was a transition from the United States, to being a migrant.

Are you happy where you have already come from?

I live in a huge, beautiful, wonderful city in the country of my birth, and I feel, somehow, like I belong here. I do not want to be in some big community or a country I have not lived in for years.

Do you think that you are better off than you were in your home country?

I am happier here than I was back home. I'm not a native of any country. But I'm also not a stranger or stranger to these countries.

I feel that, unlike in other countries, I can make up stories in this culture that I will tell. And you are in a much better situation.

What do you wish from yourself as a foreigner?

You are happy. You are happy with yourself.

What do immigrants wish for?

Maybe you want to help them in their own way. Maybe there are cultural differences between groups, but they are very similar, which is good.

What do you think about the people you have met in the media?

There have been many good discussions with other non-native speakers.

And what about immigration? Aren't you biased? Or your thoughts?

I don't think so.

What do you learn from immigrants?

There are differences, but on the whole, I know there's a very universalist attitude; we're all doing the same thing, coming here with a lot of hope.

Do you believe that immigration and the integration of refugees is one of the most crucial issues facing our country?

It takes courage, to take a risk, which is one of the reasons for having a visa.

Have you felt like you have had enough time to become accustomed to a new country? Can you not afford to spend four to eight years (depending on the reason) in many different countries?

I have done a lot of travelling, including some on my own; so I had good experience.

So do I. I was asked to move from my native"
"Write a news article based on the following summary: U.S. Navy makes move amid a political standoff over Lebanon's presidency. The presence is important,"" says chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff. Lebanon's pro-Western majority in parliament struggles with pro-Syrian opposition.","

""We need to be ready for the possibility of a military situation,"" he adds. ""In other words, with the potential that there are other forces, including Israel, with a greater interest in maintaining a stability,"" he adds.

""We must be prepared for that and must take steps if necessary,"" he says, repeating the warning delivered earlier by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.

""The risk of war is very high because of these two factors: the military situation on our borders and the situation inside Syria and Lebanon,"" he says.

But he does not think it will happen without a struggle and it will be complicated because of the possibility of a ""Syrian-Israeli"" counter-assault through Israel, which is not yet sure that its ally Hezbollah will not get into a war with it.

Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon says that the Russian President's warnings come against a background of Hezbollah's growing involvement, which has been ""clearly recognized by the international community.""

Yaalon says that the U.S. and its allies are determined ""to not provoke the possibility of a war between Iran and the Arab states"" and that the U.S. stance has been ""tremendously correct in its actions"" to make the region less unstable. He accuses Tehran, Syria and Russia of being behind ""the most dangerous and aggressive actions that threaten Middle Eastern security and regional stability.""

""So we are clearly right to say that we will not get in a war with Syria and it would also be a mistake and a grave error,"" he adds.

""And then when we have such a possibility, when we have such a risk, we must not hesitate and are strongly committed to preserving and deepening the peace and stability – our main goal and main challenge – within Middle Eastern borders.""

The head of Israeli Navy, Vice Adm. Giora Eiland, also insists on maintaining ""a clear separation between security and military operations.""

He adds that Israel doubtless does not want to make an open threat because they have a ""clear and serious conflict"" with Hezbollah."
"Write a news article based on the following summary: Clinton wins in Ohio, Texas, CNN projects. McCain clinches GOP nomination; Huckabee drops out. Clinton wins Rhode Island; Obama wins Vermont."," Clinton wins New Hampshire. Clinton wins Montana.

Note the final delegate count: Obama 59, Clinton 43, Obama 41.

Now take that same formula and substitute the next four days:

Yep, it's the same exact formula as above. But this time instead of adding to Obama's delegate lead, he's adding to her delegate lead.

That's because, in a nutshell, I just told the election story the wrong way and people got it wrong. Instead of talking about polls as they used to, the media is talking about exit polls. Instead of talking about how many people I spoke to in Ohio, we should be talking about how many people who watched CNN's exit polls said I talked to at least 3.3 million people and that was their number. And instead of talking about how many people I spoke to who watched the Republican National Convention as their number, we should be talking about how many people watched the Democratic National Convention as their number. That's because instead of talking about the votes that went to Romney, we're talking about the votes that went to Obama.

I hope this article gets you to stop and look at what the media is doing to the story of the election, which is what really matters to people who want a president as well as actual voters. If you need to know how to fix this, stop reading. Don't spend time wondering what every little error might mean. Make a note to look at the original story or look up what I said that you should try to figure out later.

I'm not going to get into specifics about exit poll questions because, frankly, I don't care. I'm going to talk about the underlying problem with the media's approach -- a very simple one. It doesn't have much to do with the question CNN asked, the right way to do the poll question, or the right way to interpret exit polls. What it has to do with is the story. That story is how many people watched a candidate -- whether they voted for him or her, whether they watched a candidate speak in person or watched him or her speak online. It's all very well and good to explain this and why it's important to remember the math. That's fine. But what's not fine is ignoring the story of the election, about how many people actually took in the news, watched a candidate speak, and went to the polls on top of that.

And when the story is that many people watched, they watched. What that means is that many people who voted for Obama in 2008, many who voted for Clinton in 2008, and many who voted for Bush in 2000, decided to vote for Hillary Clinton on the strength of that story. It made all the difference this time.

To understand that story, you need to keep in mind a single statistic -- that this article did. Let's go back to the fact that there are 2,073,848 people who voted this morning, including 1,016,000 who did not vote yesterday, and who are counted in the polls.

But this isn't just a statistic. It's actually a story. It's a point against which any one person can be measured.

When an election is over, we begin to forget that you can be on the ballot in 40 states, at least two to three times, in 10 different countries, and in a state of constant war or violence, in a major country or two. If you don't remember those distinctions, which many voters do not, you're not a real American. No one really is.

So, on Election Day, voters are given a list of candidates they'll select, which they fill out and write on slip. Some of them are on the list because they're important. Some of them aren't. But many of those things matter to people who care about those candidates, like our own editor-in-chief in particular.

So on Election Day he writes the list from one candidate to the next, and he writes the candidates in a way that means you can tell him which one you would want to vote for if he were there this morning. Then, if he's on the ballot in your state, he's there to tell you his preferred choice. He'd vote for Romney on a first ballot; he'd vote for Obama on a second and for Gary Johnson on a final ballot.

You can see how voters are treated as part of that vote -- each voter is a person who would vote for Obama if they were there in 2008. And if voters go to the polls yesterday and they pick Romney, or they pick Obama, they aren't voters in general, as the news media would like. They aren't part of the ""base,"" the ""community,"" or ""country"" at large. They're"

"Write a news article based on the following summary: British counter-terrorism experts re-inspect Bhutto's vehicle. Bhutto's assassination was her own fault, says Musharraf in interview. He blamed her for standing up outside the safety of an armored car. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, wants a U.N. inquiry into his late wife's death."," An official probe is not expected until October. (CNN)

-- At a press conference, Musharraf apologized for Pakistan's ""horror"" that innocent civilians die at the hands of his country or U.S. troops, but offered a scathing critique of his own decision-making. ""I admit I didn't give them all the information with the full understanding of the situation. I will learn from this Kee Paa!"" he said. ""I have made mistakes with my judgment … a mistake of leadership has been made and I will regret ever taking charge of this country.""

Musharraf says his actions were an ""inadequate response"" and have only led to the current situation and deaths of innocent Pakistanis. (Mark Weisbrot)

-- An adviser to the Pakistani Supreme Court, a former military prosecutor and others said they believe that the U.S. has done, in fact, act unilaterally to get Pakistan's generals on side in their fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda. ""The United States is directly involved in this war and we are the victims of it,"" Justice Hasan Salvi said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday. ""The United States has a constitutional duty to consult with this court, [so] the court has to consult with the United States … we need to resolve the conflict. Now is not the time for talking between the United States and Pakistan like we used to.""

-- On U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan, Michael Daniel, the former chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, said he finds it absurd to claim that strikes only help prevent the Taliban from infiltrating into the country because it also ""re-enforces the ideology of extremism in Pakistan."" He adds that ""the government should be taking a hard look at the impact of these strikes on civil society and on the rule of law in Pakistan, as well as on the rights of the Pakistani people.""

-- The U.S. Air Force is investigating the circumstances behind Bhutto's death and has told Fox News that it is trying to ""get to the bottom of the truth"" behind the alleged foul play in Bhutto's convoy. From The Washington Post's Anne Gearan: ""If there's a pattern, it's the same pattern of incompetence and ineptitude,"" Maj. Gen. Dave Lapan, commander of U.S. NATO forces in Europe, told Fox News, referring to the air force's internal investigation. [A U.S. military spokesman said that the aircraft was not involved in an ""interdiction"" at any point, but that the pilot and co-pilot ""inadvertently"" flew within sight of the crowd.] And, in the face of mounting international pressure to investigate Bhutto's death and explain her failure to notify authorities about the presence of the suicide bomber, a military official stressed that she still has a long way to go to restore public confidence in her government. He explained, ""the fact that we have now identified [a suicide bomber] and have identified it as a suicide bomber, that alone does not mean that the security situation in Pakistan is improving.""

-- A military officer said that the bomb placed by the suicide bomber in the convoy was the same type of explosive that was used at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- an indication that the Taliban is preparing for a possible renewed wave of U.S. bombings. ""He [the suicide bomber] said it was a device similar to the one used in Kenya,"" said the officer, an anonymous official close to the Defense Department. ""We have no reason to think it would not be so in Afghanistan."" Two U.S. officials familiar with the investigation said that there is ""no evidence"" so far that the suicide bomber was on his way to target civilians. (Politico)

-- U.S. authorities in Bangladesh are questioning a Bangladeshi maid who died in the U.S. Embassy siege.

-- The White House said Obama will brief Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari about the decision not to seek an arrest warrant for bin Laden earlier this week. ""We are taking this opportunity to brief the Pakistani president on the specifics of these events, including the military operation underway in Afghanistan,"" said Joe Lockhart, a spokesman. ""The president expressed American support for the sacrifices that Pakistani troops have made in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and as such is open to cooperating with Pakistan on a wide range of counterterrorism issues.""
