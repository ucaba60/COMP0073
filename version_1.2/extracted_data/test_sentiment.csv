"Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? Answer: Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.",0
"Question: Landolt C and snellen e acuity: differences in strabismus amblyopia? Answer: Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.",0

"Question: Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through? Answer: Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.",0
"Question: Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women? Answer: The effects of the intervention were most pronounced after the first intervention. Compared to usual care, telephone counseling seemed particularly effective at promoting change among nonadherent women, the group for whom the intervention was developed. These results suggest that telephone counseling, rather than tailored print, might be the preferred first-line intervention for getting nonadherent women on schedule for mammography screening. Many questions would have to be answered about why the tailored print intervention was not more powerful. Nevertheless, it is clear that additional interventions will be needed to maintain women's adherence to mammography. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): mammography screening, telephone counseling, tailored print communications, barriers.",0
"Question: Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting? Answer: DBE appears to be equally safe and effective when performed in the community setting as compared to a tertiary referral center with a comparable yield, efficacy, and complication rate.",0
"Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement? Answer: Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.",0
"Question: Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Answer: Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.",0

"Prompt: All apprentice mages are required to visit the five high temples located around the world before graduating. The temples rarely stay at one spot for long, however. Story: Jeffrey ran across the mountain's crest. His calculations had been right the Temple of Wind was right there floating idly at the end of the steep mountain slope tethered to it with large chains. Jeffrey quickened his pace, though he most likely had enough time to walk he didn't want to leave anything to chance. Clutching his pocket watch and staff in one hand and gripping the strap of his alchemist bag in the other he rushed with billowing robes. Suddenly a great creaking sound that shook the mountain to it's core echoed through the mountain range. *Bugger* Jeffrey thought and tried to push his sprint harder than ever. He could see how the chains tethering the temple were starting to come off the cliffside and dragged back into their giant harpoons. Just as the temple started turning from the mountainside Jeffrey leapt aboard the steps. An old piercing voice called from up high ""Apprentice, find something to hold on to."" Jeffrey quickly rummaged through his bag and fished out his enchanted climbing gloves and gripped a statue of a griffon has tightly as he could. A great wind started to envelop the temple, Jeffrey's feet started to ease off the ground from the violent draft. The temple started to slowly spin around and around, faster and faster until the world around it was a blur. Just as suddenly as it had begun it stopped and Jeffrey was presented with an entirely different view. That of a cliffs over a stormy coast. He loosened his grip and fell exhausted onto the floor. He sat there for what felt like hours taking in what had just happened, but the voice from before interrupted him. ""C'mon boy, don't lay about like a lazy ox. Come up here and we will begin.""",0
"Prompt: Write the same story twice. One as a drama and the other as a comedy. Story: He walked down the street, the birdsong hitting his ears like a barrage of bullets. Pain erupting with every step. He could taste alcohol and vomit on his lips. He shouldn't have gone to the party, that was clear. But the events of the night were not entirely his fault. At least that's what he was telling himself. His drink must have been spiked. That's it. That's why he did it. But he knew the truth. He couldn't handle his alcohol. He remembered the screams of dismay, the knife, the pink skin punctured and leaking as it was all a dream. He paused to vomit again in a passing bush.'I wonder whether I should move to Alaska' was his last thought as he dropped onto the grass and the sweet oblivion of unconsciousness. He woke to a text from his friend. He knew that she hadn't been at the party, so the news must have spread round to everyone in town by now. He rolled over, landing face first in a pile of his own vomit. Wiping his face on the damp grass he crawled over to shade of the trees and read her message again. **Comedy** *What did you do! You need to come to my house and we can talk it over before you speak to anyone else. But seriously, stabbing that giant pool inflatable? Tim's mom is so pissed. * **Drama** *What did you do! You need to come to my house and we can talk it over before you speak to anyone else. But seriously, stabbing Tim? Tim's mom is so pissed. *",0
"Prompt: There was an angel caught in the power lines. Story: It was my first day on the job, and the first time I ever smelled burning angel wings. I was shadowing Mike Fenwick, an old hand at wildlife and pest control and one of the best in the business. After twenty years working municipal, he'd gone independent with his own company, Fenwick Animal Control, and soon scored a corporate contract to supply animal control services to General Electric. His job was to patrol their southern Illinois facilities looking for evidence of vermin and pests, respond to calls regarding nuisance animals, set traps and remove captured animals, that sort of thing. Business was good, and he'd taken on several technicians to help him manage an expanding workload. I was the latest. I was fresh out of a Wildlife Biology degree, and expecting to spend my days wrangling possums, raccoons, mice and the like. The one thing I hadn't expected to be wrangling was angels, but we got the call at 11:20am, an angel trapped in the power-lines south of Pittsburg, and Mike set me straight on the way over there. ""Most sixty percent of our work right now is angels,"" he told me. ""Clients like to keep it on the down low, so you don't hear about it so much. Not good PR to have pictures of an angel getting cooked in your UHV line on the the six o'clock news, or smeared on the grille of one of your fleet trucks. But it's a real problem, for them anyway. For us it's gravy."" ""But where do they come from?"" ""There's a big nest down Shawnee way, somewhere in the national forest they reckon but they haven't figured out where. Sometimes you get whole flocks of them coming out at once. Quite a sight if you get to see it."" ""Yeah, but where do they *come* from,"" I said. ""Do you know? Everyone tells a different story."" ""Well,"" Mike said, ""All I can say is I know a story too. Can't say it's for true for sure, but I've discussed the matter with some important folks over the years, and they've said the same thing."" ""What's the story?"" ""Well, just a moment, we're here."" Here was a spot a indistinguishable from any other in the endless, flat landscape of cornfields through which we'd driven. Only Mike's GPS could tell us we were in the right spot. The power-lines were a ways off from the highway, so we'd have to walk a bit. ""I hope it did't get stuck up there,"" said Mike, ""I don't fancy doing live-line work."" He grabbed a large bag of gear from the back of the truck, which he then handed to me, and we started walking. ""The story I heard,"" I said, after a minute or two, ""is that it was some evangelical pastor, who was also a genetics genius. Thought he'd create his own army of angels to help bring God's kingdom to Earth."" Mike just let out a chuckle at that. ""Kid, I met a few pastors in my time, and not one of them was a genius in any sort of science. No, that story's mostly horseshit, I'm afraid. There's a grain of truth to it, but just a grain."" By then we'd reached the base of the transmission tower. Scattered around there was a welter of white feathers, but no sign of the angel itself. Looking up, we could just about make out the shape of something, lodged into the tower's girders. ""God damn it,"" said Mike, ""Don't suppose you've got any experience climbing these things?"" ""None."" ""Well, we'll have to do something about that, but not today. Guess I'm going up there."" He started rooting around in the pack for various pieces of protective equipment, and donning them. ""Angels are genetic splices, that much is right,"" he said, as he was getting prepared. ""But it wasn't some crazy pastor or lone genius, it was Apple."" ""Apple?"" I said. ""The computer company?"" ""That's right."" Without explaining further he clipped a hot stick to his back and began climbing. I watched him for a while, then began sweeping up some of the stray feathers into a duffel bag. After five minutes, I looked up again to see he'd reached the object trapped in the tower. I could just about make out him poking and shoving it with the hot stick. Suddenly, something dislodged from the tower and fell. For a moment, my heart was in my mouth, thinking it was Mike. But it wasn't. Eighty pounds of charred and smouldering angel carcass crashed to the floor beside me in an explosion of dust, blood and feathers. I let out an involuntary cry and leapt backwards. From up above, I could hear Mike laughing. Once I got my nerve back, I approached the thing. I'd never seen an angel this close before, dead or alive. Besides the stench of the burnt wings and flesh, what I noticed was how *weird* it looked. From a distance, angels looked the part, with smooth pink flesh, white-clad bodies, and great feathered wings. Up close, you could see how freakish they were. Like a strange cross between humans, birds and pigs, with big wide eyes and strange puckered mouths half way between beaks and lips. Mike got down quicker than he'd gone up. ""What are you gawking at,"" he said when he saw me examining the angel. ""Get it bagged up."" It took us a good twenty minutes to collect all the feathers and pieces of the carcass into sanitary containers, then we hauled it back to the truck. Once we were done, Mike lit a cigarette and we stood watching the corn waving over the endless fields. ""Get a good look at it then?"" Mike asked. ""Yeah,"" I said, ""I didn't realise how fucked up they were."" ""That's the DNA splicing. About ten different animals in there: birds, pigs, mice, you name it."" ""Humans?"" ""Nope, that'd be illegal. And believe it or not that thing was created legally."" ""By Apple."" ""By Apple. It was for a product launch. Their iHolocube, about twelve years back, remember it? Well they wanted to make a big splash at the reveal, and it just so happened they had a skunkworks gene splicing lab. I mean, all the big companies did back then, before the government cracked down. Someone had the bright idea of making angels, actual angels, by splicing bird and mammal DNA."" ""See the idea was to only create a few. Maybe a dozen or so. They'd be released into the air at the event, where they fly around like they were trained to do. Nobody would get a really good look at them, enough to see the seams, so to speak, and then they'd be put back into captivity. I guess they'd be kept as pets for a while, or just disposed of. Except they never even made it to the launch. There was an accident at the lab, and the whole flock escaped. What's more, they weren't sterile, like they were supposed to be. They bred. And bred. And now they've spread all over the country, but particularly in the midwest. For whatever reason, the climate here suits them."" ""That's a crazy story,"" I said. ""It is,"" Mike replied. ""But it's what I've been told. In a way there's a kind of poetry to it."" ""How so?"" ""Well, scripture says God in heaven created the angels, and then created man. Then the first species we create all on our own is an angel. Makes you wonder what those tech boys might cook up next."" With that, he finished his cigarette and we climbed back into the truck. ""It's about time for lunch,"" Mike said. ""I know a decent diner not too far from here. Say, you ever eaten one of these things?""",0
"Prompt: Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. Story: I first met her when I was 5, at a playground my mother used to take me. I knew right away that I want to be with her for a very very long time. Her glorious halo of golden hair that frames her majestic face made her look like an angel. We went steady at a pretty young age and got married soon after we found out about baby Agnes. But baby Agnes did not join us. She was only 7 months old in her belly when baby Agnes's heart stopped beating. We were very sad, even though our 22-year old faces didn't show it. But we were there for each other, we held each other up so we could be stronger together. The drinking helped too. The first time I was hospitalised after falling down the stairs was after the day I celebrated my 24th birthday. It was entirely my fault, I shouldn't have been shouting so loudly at her, she didn't mean to elbow me when she turned around. I only broke a toe at that time. She looked so beautiful trying to apologize to me, when it's obviously just an accident. We started putting knives away when we had another accident a year later. We were doing one of our silly arguments again when I was being too stubborn to understand what she's trying to say, and in her excitement to show me, she accidentally hit one of the knive's hilt that caused it to fly through the sky and hit me in my eyeball. I started wearing an eye patch after that, and went around calling myself ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" for the kids in the neighbourhood. When she started talking to me about leaving, that's when I realised that I've pushed her away too far already, and I really need to change so I can always be the best for her. I got a new job that made her happier, spent more time at home and tried to do more chores at home. In fact, I was so determined to show her how I've changed, that I stopped drinking soon. I told her that it's all hers to enjoy, since she was always happiest after a good session of drinking. I lost her to a disease soon after that. The doctors said it was too late to do anything for her, with the amount of poison in her. I didn't understand it at all, we tried to eat carefully and always brushed our teeth after every meal. How could she get sick so quickly? ""I said, my name is Adriana. What's yours?"" I snapped back to the playground I'm in, I'm still sitting on the see-saw and she's still standing in front of me with her hand in front of me, waiting for me to shake. ""I'm Jack."" I said proudly. Then I showed her my Tonka truck, and when she squealed happily at that, I knew we were going to be best friends forever.",0
"Prompt: You get a deep cut for the first time in your life, instead of bone or muscle, you see wires. Story: So I was working with the saw and I was tired and slipped and before I knew it, I had a huge gash on my forearm where blood wasn't pouring out. When the initial shock had worn off and the lack of any mind-numbing pain had convinced me that something was *off* about this, I started looking at the wound and that's when I saw it. Wires, shiny copper wires everywhere. There wasn't any more blood, apparently in deep cuts like this there wasn't enough blood to properly bleed. So I tried to clean it out myself which was really hard since touching those wires felt good. I had to resist the urge to pull some of them out. I bandaged my arm and then took some painkillers and went to sleep. The day after I woke up, once I remembered my new situation, I opened up the gauss pad to see if it had gotten better, but instead, it had gotten much much worse. The skin around the wound had started to melt as if it was no longer alive, the smell was horrendous, so I called my good friend Kyle, the doctor, and asked him if I could have a private appointment. From the sound of my voice, Kyle obviously knew something was up, so he told me to swing by his clinic at ten pm. Once I arrived, I told him to grab a seat and told the truth. It wasn't until I showed him the arm that he said ""Geeze, I thought you were having a psychotic episode or something, but this.... this is real isn't it?"" Then after examining the wound, he confirmed that which I already knew, that the skin around it was dying and that it was spreading fast. He then told me he'd need a sample of those wires to know what they were. As he looked at me, I felt a surge of strange thoughts start to course through my head, but I simply nooded and he got to work on getting one of those out. As he started pulling, I tensed up and he tried to ease up on the procedure. After it was done, he apologized for being so blunt and that he didn't know they were that sensitive. I could again only nod at his words. But he'd been wrong about the pain, what I had felt when he pulled it out was a pure and unbrideled sense of exctasy. It was absolute bliss to have it pulled. So while he went over the microscope, I was trying to hide my sudden erection under my coat. It had literarly been one of the most fundamentally rewarding and satisfying feeelings and sensations I'd ever felt in my whole life. But I was interrupted in my thoughts by a strange gurgling sound. When I looked up to where Kyle was standing, I could see that he was bleeding from a hole in his neck, as I watched him he slumped over on the floor and a big blood puddle started forming under his body. Then I saw the wire come crawling out of his body and I knew that it had killed him to protect itself. Now I'm sitting here in a corner in the building, waiting for the police to show up, I've told them everything and even if they don't believe me, they still have to come here and investigate. The wound is spreading more and more over my body, but I don't care about that anymore because of the feeling the new exposed wiring is giving me, it's like the air is singing to it. As more and more of it vanishes, I start feeling more alive, more in tune with my new self a self that only wants to pick... pull... pick and pull... Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire OooooooOOOOoooh... here we..nnggg.... go again......",0
"Prompt: In a world where lying is immediately detected by a phone app, you go into a bar and tell your friends you 've had the worst day in the history of mankind. The app detects you 're telling the truth. You proceed to tell them about your day ... Story: I open the pub door. Smells of beer, pub food, and warm bodies hit me. I step over the threshold. I become aware of the petite woman with too-dark makeup laughing. She's leaning on the chest of a man who could grace the cover of a muscle-mag. I force myself to look past them. This couple's holding hands, frilly drinks forgotten. The brunette with the long hair brings the hand of the short-haired woman to her lips, kisses each finger while staring into the other woman's eyes. On my left, a man with broad shoulders and well-defined muscles wheels his chair towards a table, grinning as he greets the attractive redhead waiting there. She blows him a kiss and puts down her phone. I wind my way through the tables, looking for Heidi's tumble of blond curls. There, with Chace by her side. I must have really freaked her out. She waves at me as I pass the last few blissfully unaware patrons. “ Heidi said you claimed you had the worst day ever, and that our app didn't work. ” Chace's head tilts forward and his eyes are almost black. The last time I saw that look, it was right before he threw my ex-boyfriend out the door. I'd been right to call Chace and Heidi over that night. The ex had broken in, threatened to kill me. And after the last few weeks, Chace's hostility is understandable. “ Hi Chace. ” I swallow. “ I understand your … response. ” I pull out a chair, sit down. I shiver in my coat. I meet his eyes, see them narrow. “ You're ghost white, Laurel. This has gotten to the point of crazy. I'm seriously considering calling the mental health crisis line. ” Heidi slides her delicate hand onto his forearm. I fold my hands on the table in front of me. Strong hands. That's what Heidi's mother had said. I shudder and grimace, clinch my hands into fists. I force out “ I'm not surprised. I've considered calling them myself. ” As Heidi leans over the table, I realize I'd whispered. Heidi wraps my fists in her hands. I flinch. She's in mother-mode. “ Have the dreams gotten worse? Last month, it was Pompeii. And then last week, the first world war. ” She moves next to me, wraps her arm around me. I hunch away from her. “ You- you don't want to be close to me. ” Heidi puts one hand on my shoulder, keeps the other on my hands. “ Nonsense. You'll talk about your day, whatever this worst day in your life is, and we'll have some drinks. We'll move past it same way we did when Chace tossed The Creep out. ” The truth alarm from her phone silences the conversations throughout the pub. Chace fumbles with her phone to clear it. I close my eyes. “ We won't ever forget this, Heidi. ” I look at her. The confusion and shock distort her normally peaceful face. I've always been troubled, and her face typically calms me. I'd never see that calm again. “ I dreamt of Hitler, the peace of the early 21st century. ” I finally break. I cover my face with my horrible, strong hands. I smear my eyeliner as I try to regain my composure. I desperately look from Heidi to Chace. He meets my eyes, holds my gaze. I know he'll figure it out. I force myself to look at Heidi. “ Heidi, I'm sorry. I… ” I take a deep breath. “ I saw your great-grandparents. And then your parents. That's when -- that's when I started to figure it out. ” “ No, no. You never met them. ” Tears stream down her face as the horror of her parent's death floods back. “ You never met them! ” She stands as she yells, knocking over her chair. The pub goes quiet again. I manage to whisper, “ I saw their pictures in your house. I… I've seen other things. Heidi, I saw Napoleon killed. I saw the Moradabad riots, the Rwandan genocide… ” I helplessly look at Chace. He holds Heidi's phone, ready to quiet the alarm. His voice helps ground me. “ Today you realized you're seeing the pain of humanity. Every time you sleep. ” I nod. The alarm never sounds. I force myself to form the words, to verbalize the fear. “ What happens after I see today? ”",0
"Prompt: The monster under your bed, the monster in the closet, the monster tapping on your window, the monster hiding in the basement, and the monster living in the attic all try to compete with each other to give you the biggest scare. It 's become less scary and more annoying. Story: I awoke to the sensation of warmth on the back of my neck. My vision still blurry and my mind not fully awake, I turn over to see a creature with jet black eyes, orange skin, and the mane of a lion staring back at me. ""Good morning, Frank. You know that hasn't scared me in years. The breath was a nice touch, though."" ""Yeah, but I thought maybe the change would be enough. I don't really care for the prize this time, anyways."" He wasn't very enthusiastic this time. I put on my slippers and my glasses and headed downstairs to the kitchen. Upon opening the fridge, a small monkey-like creature jumped out and hissed, it's hands raised in the air. I let out a chuckle. ""Hello to you, Marcell. You didn't drink all the milk, did you?"" I already knew he had. ""Man, I was really hoping I'd get a scare out of you this time. At least a twitch."" He sounded disappointed. ""We've got a really cool pocket knife up for grabs this time."" I turned and headed for the living room, so I could turn on the news. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Jerry the Yeti in my driveway, climbing under my car. He's never been very inconspicuous. After a few failed jump-scares from the guys, I started getting ready for work. Their little game runs until I leave, unless no one scares me. I usually just pretend to be scared to the last one, but I just wasn't feeling it today. They'll have to try again when I get home. My drive to work consisted of me listening to Jesse the Imp trying to conceal his breathing in my back seat. Oddly enough, he never jumped out at me. Probably fell asleep. Poor thing. While I was at my desk, I found myself struggling to remember what life was like before my monsters. They can be annoying at times, sure. But they are just trying to find some fun in this life. Can't blame them for that. I must have dozed off at my desk, because the next thing I knew, my boss was shaking me. ""Wha.... What's the deal..."" It seemed difficult to talk. His voice sounded so far away, and so urgent. I thought I heard him saying something like, ""coming back to us"" and ""it's working"". I have things strange little episodes sometimes, though. They always pass after a few minutes, and this one was no different. I'll probably have one or two more episodes before I leave work, and get to go back home to my little monsters. Oh, and I have to buy more milk. Dammit, Marcell. [ Edit: This is the first thing I've written in about 10 years, and I would love some helpful criticism from anyone that happens to read it. ]",0
"Prompt: '' That 's it! '' shouts the DM, `` You say I 'm too easy on you as a DM? Well I 've got the dungeon of bullshit all lined up, none of you fuckers are making it out! '' Let 's see the in game perspective Story: The party approached the cavern where the Great Beast lay, the promise of gold and riches lifting their spirits as they stopped before the mouth of the cave. ""I think we should do an equipment check,"" said Erik, looking warily at the darkness beyond. ""Remember when I stood on his shoulders,"" Buckthorn the Axe-crazed said to Ragnar, gesturing back at the rogue, ""and scared off the kobolds?"" ""Yeah,"" said Ragnar dismissively, ""but remember when I punched that naga in the face?"" The self-proclaimed ""ninja barbarian"" flexed his arms. He looked in to the cave. ""I see.... nothing. Man, it's dark. Let me try again."" He squinted and thrust his face forward, muscles tense with concentration. He nodded. Buckthorn looked into the cave, as well. He, too, nodded. Erik looked at them expectantly. ""Well?"" They looked back at him blankly. ""What do you see?"" ""Rocks,"" said Ragnar. ""A floor,"" said Buckthorn, grinning. The half-elf sighed and looked into the cavern himself. He saw nothing which stood out to him; no signs of movement, no traces of life. ""Alright, so I'll go in and check for..."" He trailed off as Buckthorn and Ragnar entered the cavern, arguing about who was going to lead the party. Erik rolled his eyes and followed cautiously. Their voices echoed as they walked deeper into the cave. The darkness swallowed them. Ragnar stumbled on a low stalagmite and fell on his knees, grumbling angrily about how he should have been able to see it. ""Who has a lantern?"" asked Erik. The darkness continued ahead of them, and even he was just starting to have troubles with the dim light. ""I do,"" said Buckthorn. There was a cacophony of noise as he rummaged around in his pack. More noise followed as he struggled to light it. ""Why isn't it working?"" he said angrily. ""We used it a lot when we were tracking those slavers,"" said Erik. ""Which could have made us a lot of money, if we had just sold them,"" interjected Ragnar. ""And?"" prompted Buckthorn. ""Did you ever get more oil?"" ""Oh, come on!"" exclaimed Buckthorn. ""Of course I would have gotten more oil! We were in town for days. I must have..."" he trailed off. ""Well,"" replied Erik, ""obviously not."" ""Hold on,"" said Ragnar. He pulled a flask out of his pack. ""Put this in it."" ""Alcohol? Really?"" said Erik as Buckthorn took the flask. He backed away while Buckthorn added the liquid to the lantern and lit it. A low flame ignited and Buckthorn and Ragnar both exclaimed in triumph. A green flash was all that alerted them before the displacer beast attacked, silently striking out at Ragnar with a tentacle. Buckthorn dropped the lantern in surprise. They fought by the dim, flickering light. The displacer beast got in a couple strikes before their weapons were drawn and then the party began fighting back. ""What are you doing?"" yelled Erik as he dodged a tentacle. ""Trying to hit him in the eye,"" roared Ragnar, missing again as he poked at the displacer beast's face with his greatsword. Suddenly, a roar shook the cavern. Erik spun and saw an owlbear entering the cave. ""What the hell?"" he yelled as the creature ran at them. He engaged the owlbear while Ragnar and Buckthorn tried to fight the displacer beast. Buckthorn stumbled against a stalagmite as he dodged. He moved to leap back into battle, but instead fell flat on the floor. Looking back, he saw gray tentacles wrapped around his ankles, and an eye slowly appearing in the stalagmite. ""What the fuck is that?"" he cried as a mouth began to gape beneath the eye. He reached for his axe as it began dragging him back. Ragnar had finally given up the finesse and was hacking and slashing as the displacer beast danced around him, lashing at him with its tentacles. Ragnar got in a couple lucky shots, but he was slowing down. Something from the ceiling dripped on his head. The displacer beast froze, looking up. Ragnar took advantage of the pause and got in a good strike. The beast howled and disappeared. Ragnar raised his sword in victory and something wet and sticky enveloped his hand. Looking up in surprise, he saw a long tendril of gray ooze wrapped around his fist. He tried to yank his hand down, but the tendril held firm as it slowly crept up his arm. Buckthorn screamed as the tentacled stalagmite began to constrict his body, its tentacles covering him from shoulders to feet. It lifted his small, heavy body toward its mouth and ended his screams. Ragnar was lifted toward the cave ceiling as the ooze continued to envelope his body. He slashed ineffectively at it with his dagger, cursing and yelling. His voice became muffled as the ooze pushed him into its core. Erik tried to run from the owlbear, desperation fueling his exhausted feet. His battered, bleeding body stumbled across the cave floor. He was hit in the back by the enraged owlbear and crumpled into a heap against the wall.

She never talked back, or talked at all. I could unload my opinions, and her expression would match my own exactly. It was satisfying, empowering. My ex-girlfriends used to tell me I had a massive ego, a textbook narcissist. But they paled in comparison to Ms Mirror-for-a-face. I love her eyes, which were just like my eyes, reflected back at me. She smiles whenever I smile, we're so in sync. Whenever I talk about my politics, my religious beliefs, Ms Mirror-for-a-face always agrees. At least, she seems to. Sometimes she just sits beside me, saying nothing for hours. She doesn't eat, merely stares at me with images of my own eyes. I wonder in those moments whether I'm truly alone. Only for a second, I doubt her. But then she'll hold my hand, a reassuring touch from skin as cold as glass. I love Ms Mirror-for-a-face. Of course there is nothing wrong with our relationship. There's nothing wrong with me, I've found a true love that you will never know. A love without ever having to be challenged, a love without sacrifice, a love without needing to share, without that crawling creeping feeling of loneliness like you've let a lovecraftian horror into your house with an arcane power over you that you can barely understand, let alone fight. I'm not talking of Ms Mirror-for-a-face of course. she is just like me. In every way. And its.... perfect.",0
"Prompt: Write a story reimagining a character from another piece of fiction as down-and-out/washed up/past their prime. Story: He sat in his new office, still amazed that it was finally his. He had fought his way tooth and nail up the corporate ladder, and now it was finally paying off. All the suit wearing, meeting attending, hand shaking, and ass-kissing had finally payed off. ""If only my teenage self could see me now,"" he thought. ""He'd hate me. But what did I know? I was a teenager."" He still remembered those awful boarding schools he had been shipped off to and subsequently kicked out of. He was such a rebel back then, getting in fights and skipping class, he didn't care about anyone but himself. No one except his sister that is. God, when was the last time they'd talked? Christmas? Had it really it really been that long? He'd been so focused on getting this promotion that he hadn't really thought about it. Perhaps he did still focus on himself too much. And he thought about himself then: his past self. The time he skipped school and ran off to New York. The times he'd go to watch the orchestra play with his parents, and the timpani player who was the only one there who seemed to be enjoying what he did. The worn orange hunting hat and bloodstained sweater that he refused to let go of that now sat in a box in his basement. And now here he sat, in a big office, at an important job. A phony. He had become a phony. He even had a name tag on his big phony desk, telling everyone who saw it that Holden Caulfield was a phony.",0
"Summary: One dead as hundreds of thousands flee rising floodwaters. About 80 percent of the city of Villahermosa is under water. Tabasco and Chiapas states hardest hit. Authorities say 700,000 affected and 300,000 still trapped by flooding. Article: Heavy rains and flooding have forced hundreds of thousands of people from homes in southern Mexico's state of Tabasco over the past four days, with nearly as many trapped by the rising waters, state officials said Thursday. Officials say about 300,000 people are still trapped by the worst flooding in the region for 50 years. The Grijalva River pushed over its banks through the state capital of Villahermosa on Thursday, forcing government workers to evacuate and leaving up to 80 percent of the city flooded, Gov. Andres Granier's office told CNN. About 700,000 people have seen their homes flooded, with about 300,000 of those still trapped there, Granier's office reported. One death had been blamed on the floods, which followed weeks of heavy rain in the largely swampy state. Tabasco borders Guatemala to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the north. The Associated Press reported that thousands of people clung to rooftops, huddled inside waterlogged homes or hunkered down in shelters in an attempt to survive the worst flooding the region has seen in 50 years. Weather forecasters predicted more rain in the coming days. The flooding was not related to Tropical Storm Noel, which was pounding the Caribbean. The Grijalva River, one of two large waterways ringing Villahermosa, has risen 6.5 feet (2 meters) above its ""critical"" level and gushed into the city's center, according to AP. Authorities said some of the rivers were continuing to rise. President Felipe Calderon visited the area on Wednesday and promised the federal government's full support. Non-governmental organizations throughout the country asked people to donate non-perishable goods or cash, AP said. Copyright 2007 CNN.

"Summary: Study finds opium makes up half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product. Agency pushes NATO forces to attack skyrocketing problem aggressively. Drugs funds insurgency; poppy trade unchecked in Taliban strongholds. U.N. drug chief advocates providing income alternative for poppy farmers. Article: The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy. Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007. The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. ""Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,"" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. ""Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source."" James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. ""We share the U.N.'s concerns,"" Appathurai told CNN. ""Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation."" He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. ""The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,"" Appathurai said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. ""Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,"" the U.N. drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. ""You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,"" he said.",0
"Summary: David Nalbandian won Madrid Masters after beating top seed Roger Federer. The Argentine triumphed 1-6 6-3 6-3 against the Swiss defending champion. He became third man to beat world's three top players en route to a title. Article: David Nalbandian battled back to stun world No. 1 Roger Federer with a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory in the final of the Madrid Masters on Sunday. David Nalbandian celebrates after upsetting Roger Federer in the Madrid Masters final. The Argentine, ranked 25th in the world, repeated his 2005 upset win over the Swiss star in that year's season-ending Masters Cup -- also an indoor event. Defending champion Federer, playing in his first tournament since winning the U.S. Open six weeks ago, made 38 unforced errors. Nalbandian became only the third player -- and the second this year after Novak Djokovic in Montreal in August -- to beat the world's top-three players en route to winning a title. German legend Boris Becker was the first to perform the feat 13 years ago. Nalbandian ousted second-ranked Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals and then Serbian Djokovic in Saturday's semis. The 25-year-old, who lost in the Madrid final in 2004, claimed his first triumph on the ATP Tour since May, 2006, on clay in Portugal. He spent a year without a coach, but has revived his career since teaming up with Hernan Gumy. ""I'm extremely contented to beat the world number one,"" Nalbandian said. ""Roger and I have a long history and I think that influenced the match. ""It was an extremely hard first set. But I tightened the teeth and I began to play more strongly. Things came out fine, I played incredible, and that of course that helps."" Federer added: ""He served well, I was quite surprised with how well he served. ""He came back strong and played well in the end. ""He was a better player all in all. I was struggling after the first set to play aggressively, for some reason. He played tough and didn't miss any more. I couldn't play way I wanted to. It was a pity, he played a great tournament.""",0
"Summary: Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 in South American qualifier for 2010 World Cup. Juan Roman Riquelme nets twice as Argentina win third successive match. Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez quits after 5-1 loss against Paraguay. Article: Juan Roman Riquelme scored twice as Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 to notch a third successive victory in the South American qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup on Saturday. Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi to cap off a match in which captain Javier Zanetti made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Argentina. Argentina next travel to Colombia on Tuesday, when winless Bolivia have an away clash with Venezuela. In other South American qualifiers, Colombia beat Venezuela 1-0, and Paraguay routed Ecuador 5-1. Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez, a Colombian, quit after his team's loss saying: ""I have taken the irrevocable decision to resign.""",0
"Summary: John Edwards calls for immediate withdrawal of 40,000-50,000 troops. Sen. Hillary Clinton says withdrawal of 30,000 troops by July ""too little, too late"" Sen. Barack Obama calls for an immediate start to troop withdrawals. Article: Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday criticized President Bush's plan to withdraw roughly 30,000 troops from Iraq by next summer, with Sen. Hillary Clinton labeling it ""too little, too late."" Sen. Hillary Clinton listens as Gen. David Petraeus testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. In an open letter to Bush, Clinton said the troop withdrawal ""is simply too little, too late, and unacceptable to this Congress, and to the American people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home, and end this war."" Bush on Thursday is expected to endorse the recommendations of Gen. David Petraeus that the troop levels in Iraq be lowered to 130,000 by July, down from the ""surge"" level of 160,000. ""As commander in chief, you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, and to bring so many more troops home so much faster,"" the New York Democrat said. ""I strongly urge you to choose this course of action."" In an interview Wednesday with CNN, one of Clinton's chief rivals for the 2008 nomination, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, said the president is returning to an earlier, failed policy. ""We now are still in the same position as we essentially were in June 2006,"" he said. ""We are in the same levels of violence; we are at the same levels of dysfunctional when it comes to the government in Iraq, and the American people at some point have a right to ask from their leadership in Washington and from the president: When is enough enough?"" Watch '08 Dems weigh in on war in Iraq ». Obama presented a new plan for Iraq on Wednesday afternoon in Clinton, Iowa. It calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month, to be completed by the end of next year, according to excerpts released before his speech. A brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers. Obama recommended a new constitutional convention for Iraq, a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the country's humanitarian crisis. ""Let me be clear: There is no military solution in Iraq, and there never was. The best way to protect our security and to pressure Iraq's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops,"" Obama said in his speech. Presidential candidate John Edwards, who has been pressing congressional Democrats to take a more confrontational stance against President Bush, called for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops. In a prepared statement, Edwards, a Democrat from North Carolina, said Obama, Clinton and Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who recently called for a withdrawal to begin by Christmas, have ""a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster, to force the president to change course."" Edwards also called Obama's plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the president's plan. ""Sen. Obama would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year,"" said Edwards, ""which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer."" In a statement, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Connecticut, said Wednesday that it was useless to debate tactics when ""the underlying policy is a complete failure."" ""I call on my colleagues to do what needs to be done to end our involvement in this civil war and help restore our national security by clearly and directly declaring that they will not support any Iraq measure without a firm, enforceable deadline tied to funding for the completion of redeployment of troops from Iraq,"" Dodd said. Democrats lack the votes in Congress to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position. Congressional Democratic leaders are meeting with Republican lawmakers, who want a change in war policy but are unwilling to cut funding or set a timeline for withdrawal. Privately, congressional Democrats concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in Iraq. The Democratic presidential candidates, particularly the five in Congress, face pressure from liberal groups such as MoveOn.org demanding that they directly confront the president. Obama said it was unlikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline. ""You know, we are going to have to evaluate what's available, but it appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise, short of Congress forcing him to accept a shorter timetable, and, absent that, we are essentially engaging in a bunch of symbolic action there,"" Obama told CNN. ""What we need is a clear message from the Congress that it is time for us to change course, and it's time for us to do that,"" he said.

"Summary: ""Inspiring Impressionism"" looks at Old Masters, other influences on modern art. Featured are works of Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, Cassatt, Morisot. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" runs through January 31, 2008, at the High Museum. Denver Art Museum and Seattle Art Museum get the show next. Article: It is an irony of contemporary art-museum management: Sometimes the museum that creates an exhibition doesn't get to premiere it. In a treatment of a Bridgeman Art Library photo, the High shows visitors Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery."" This is the case this week, as Atlanta's High Museum of Art couples its public opening of a second year of Louvre-fueled shows from Paris, France, with an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" is organized by the Denver Art Museum. It opened Tuesday at the High, to run there through January 2008. With the backing of Northern Trust, the show will then travel to Denver February 23 to May 25, 2008, and then on to the Seattle Art Museum from June 19 to September 21, 2008. Why not start in Denver? That museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year Louvre Atlanta series of exhibitions. Like priceless dominos falling, these shows roll around the country and the world, globalization dictating galas, super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest winners. See a gallery of images from 'Inspiring Impressionism' at the High Museum of Art ». Another unintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another. It should be interesting to learn whether showing ""Inspiring Impressionism"" at the High on the same time frame as the second year of Louvre Atlanta pays off. Do all the boats in Monet's ""Autumn on the Seine, Argenteuil"" float? Smart museum-goers will see it all. ""The Louvre and the Ancient World"" and the companion show ""The Eye of Josephine,"" after all, look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvre's vast holdings. See a gallery of some of the highlights of the Louvre Atlanta shows ». The fit is comfortable, in a way, the Impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in French artists. The emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne. One very distinctive connection from the Louvre Atlanta opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at the Louvre, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's ""The Beggar Boy"" of around 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in Western art's modern history. From the outset, visitors to ""Inspiring Impressionism"" are reminded of the Louvre treasures all around them at the High: The Impressionism show's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of Louis Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery at the Louvre"" from between 1850 and 1870. In that original painting and color lithograph that followed, Arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the Louvre's chief exhibition space that runs along the Seine in Paris. In fact, even older-era echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at Louvre Atlanta's ""The Tiber"" marble from the first century A.D., you're reminded that Michelangelo himself was aware of that piece, influenced by it, presumably inspired by it. So a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums (the Louvre, the High, Denver, Seattle), the viewers of art in Europe and the United States, and the artists themselves in France, in the U.S. and elsewhere. High director Michael Shapiro calls these synchronicities ""visual evidence of connections."" His colleagues Timothy Standring of Denver and Ann Dumas of London, England, have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions, glimpses of Old World craft from Titian and Velasquez to Fragonard and Rubens -- and the ""moderns"" who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate. Don't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High. Degas may have said it most honestly: ""No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters."" Joining Northern trust Corporation in funding the exhibition are the National Endowment for the Humanities, and support is also provided by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.",0
"Summary: Nemanja Vidic plays in Man United's Champions League tie at Dynamo Kiev. Serbian defender sat out 4-1 win at Aston Villa with after-effects of concussion. United started group campaign with wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma. Article: Serbian central defender Nemanja Vidic has convinced Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson that he should play in Tuesday's Champions League clash away to Dynamo Kiev. Vidic clashes with Roma goalkeeper Gianluca Curci during the UEFA Champions League Group F match. The former Spartak Moscow player sat out Saturday's 4-1 victory at Aston Villa after suffering concussion during the Premier League win over Wigan immediately before the international break. However, he has made a good recovery and will now partner Rio Ferdinand in the heart of the United defense. Injury-plagued French striker Louis Saha definitely misses the tie with a long-term knee problem and fellow casualties Gary Neville and Owen Hargreaves also stayed behind. England striker Wayne Rooney, who scored twice against Villa and was also on target in England's Euro 2008 defeat against Russia in Moscow last week, will partner Carlos Tevez in attack. A third successive victory after 1-0 wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma would virtually guarantee United a place in the knock-out stage. United flew to Kiev a day earlier than normal, taking their own chefs and dieticians with them. ""The travel is always the biggest worry in these situations,"" said Ferguson. ""Ukraine is further away than most other journeys around Europe."" Senegal defender Pape Diakhate, Guinea forward Ismael Bangoura and Ukraine midfielder Taras Mykhalyk are expected to return for Dynamo, but former Tottenham forward Serhiy Rebrov is an absentee. Dynamo warmed up for Tuesday night with a 1-0 win over strugglers Zakarpattia on Saturday in the Ukrainian Championship. But Kiev are bottom of Group F after losing their first two games -- 2-0 at Roma and 2-1 at home to Sporting. Glasgow Rangers are without Jean-Claude Darcheville and Brahim Hemdani for their formidable home clash against Barcelona on Tuesday. Darcheville is still struggling with a hamstring problem while Hemdani misses the Group E tie in Glasgow with a groin problem that kept him out of the weekend's 3-0 win against Celtic. UEFA Cup favorites Bayern Munich will probably have to do without midfielder Franck Ribery for their group game against Red Star Belgrade on Thursday. The French international hurt his thigh in Saturday's 2-1 win at Bochum that saw Bayern extend their lead at the top of the Bundesliga.",0
"Summary: Milan goalkeeper Dida is partially successful against two-match UEFA ban. Dida misses Wednesday's home Champions League tie against Shakhtar. Second game of ban suspended for one year freeing him for return in Ukraine. Article: Milan goalkeeper Dida has been cleared to play in next month's Champions League match at Shakhtar Donetsk after partially winning his appeal to UEFA against a two-match ban. Dida has had one game of his two-match ban suspended for a year following an appeal to UEFA. Brazilian Dida was also fined 60,000 Swiss francs by European football's ruling body following an incident involving a supporter during the Champions clash against Celtic in Scotland on October 3. The 34-year-old Brazilian was initially banned for two games for his theatrics following a Celtic fan's encroachment onto the pitch during the 2-1 defeat at Celtic Park. ""Following Monday's appeals hearing, Dida is suspended for two matches, but one of the matches will now be deferred for a probationary period of one year,"" said a stement on UEFA's Web site. Dida sits out the home tie against Shakhtar on Wednesday after an inquiry based on Article 5, paragraph 1 of the UEFA disciplinary regulations (Principles of conduct), under which ""member associations, clubs, as well as their players, officials and members, shall conduct themselves according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship"". However, Dida will only serve the second match of his ban if he commits a similar offense -- a theatrical over-reaction --during the next 12 months, freeing him for the trip to Ukraine. UEFA said that their Appeals Body ""took note that Dida expressed his sincere regrets as regards his conduct during the match."" AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani was satisfied with UEFA's decision. ""I believe it is fair -- I was against the two-game suspension but one seems OK. ""Dida has made a mistake but his error did not hinder anyone, not Celtic, nor any player,"" said Galliani.",0
"Summary: South African reggae legend Lucky Dube killed in attempted hijacking. Dube, 43, killed Thursday in Johannesburg after hijacker tried to steal his car. Death casts shadow over South Africa's preparations for rugby World Cup final. Article: Reggae legend Lucky Dube, one of South Africa's most famous musicians, was killed in an attempted car-jacking as he dropped his children off at a relative's house, his record label said Friday. Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans. Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday after someone tried to steal his car, Gallo Record Company said in a statement. Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds. Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend. News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days. Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris. Gallo Records called the death ""senseless and random,"" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was. South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked. ""It's very sad,"" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. ""He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists."" Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York. His record company said Dube leaves ""a great void"" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans. Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named ""Lucky"" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies. Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career. Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss. ""Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,"" Haarburger said. ""It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically."" Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle.

"Summary: Nationwide Airlines pilot dumped fuel until he landed plane Wednesday. An object was sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground. 100, including crew, were on the plane; no one was injured. Plane passenger: ""Everyone started panicking"" Article: Brendon Pelser said he saw pure terror in the faces of his fellow passengers after an engine fell from a wing as it took off from Cape Town, South Africa, Wednesday. Men were sweating profusely, women were crying. ""There was fear on their faces,"" Pelser said. ""Everyone started panicking."" But the pilot of Nationwide Airlines' Boeing 737 Flight CE723 was able to fly long enough to dump fuel and make an emergency landing at Cape Town International Airport. Including crew, 100 hundred people were on the plane that departed at 3:50 p.m. on an hourlong flight to Johannesburg, South Africa. No one was injured. The jet had only been in the air about 10 minutes before the engine fell. ""We heard something crash and bang, the plane veering left and right. A person on the right side said the engine was missing -- had broken clean off,"" said Pelser. Watch Pelser describe how the flight crew told passengers to ""prepare for the worst"" ». ""They flew us in very slowly. We were all prepared for the worst. We went into the fetal position, head between the legs,"" he said. ""Then we hit the runway."" ""I did kind of pray. I didn't want to die. I'm not really ready to die,"" the 33-year-old said. An object had been sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground and officials are trying to identify it. The engine-to-wing supporting structure is designed to release an engine ""when extreme forces are applied,"" to prevent structural damage to the wing, Nationwide said on its Web site. The airline described the incident as a ""catastrophic engine failure."" As the nose wheel lifted from the ground, ""the captain heard a loud noise immediately followed by a yaw of the aircraft (sideways slippage) to the right,"" the airline said in a news release. The flight instruments showed the No. 2 engine on the right side had failed, it said. Pelser said he spent the night in Cape Town, then flew back to Johannesburg where he lives, on the same airline. Nationwide said the engine had undergone a major overhaul in March 2005 at ""an approved Federal Aviation Authority facility in the U.S.A."" and had flown only 3,806 hours since then. ""These engines typically achieve 10,000 hours between major overhauls,"" Nationwide Airlines' press release stated.",0
"Summary: FEMA doesn't face utter devastation as in Gulf Coast in 2005. Victims can escape in own vehicles on open roads. Communications infrastructure remains intact. Agencies learn from Hurricane Katrina mistakes. Article: Federal Emergency Management Agency officials know the agency's performance in the California wildfires will be watched closely for comparisons to its failures in Hurricane Katrina. A volunteer distributes donated food and supplies to evacueesTuesday at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium. FEMA Director David Paulison promised on Tuesday ""a different type of response than the federal government put together for Katrina."" Paulison said Katrina ""was a wake-up call"" and that ""this is a new FEMA."" President Bush signed a federal disaster declaration Wednesday, freeing up federal funds for families affected by the wildfires in seven counties in Southern California. ""I will continue to make sure that our efforts are coordinated, that we are responding to the needs of people, but most importantly I want the people in Southern California to know that Americans all across this land care deeply about them,"" he said. The action follows an emergency declaration by Bush on Tuesday morning for the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. He said he's ""looking forward"" to his visit to the region on Thursday. According to a statement from the White House, the federal disaster declaration will allow for federal aid that ""can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster."" FEMA and other relief and rescue services face significantly different challenges in the fire zone than they did on the Gulf Coast in 2005. For example, the fires aren't covering every square foot of the region, as Katrina did. The devastation in California is intense but not universal. During and immediately after Katrina, the destruction was so complete that relief personnel and supplies -- even the U.S. Army -- could not get within miles of the disaster's epicenter, New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward, for several days. By contrast, roads in Southern California have remained open for residents to get out and help to get in without delay. Residents there are generally more affluent and are able to use their own vehicles to escape, whereas many of Katrina's victims were poor and had no means of transportation. Victims in California are not stranded on rooftops without food or drinkable water, but are able travel the relatively short distances to safe places. One of those safe places is San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is not endangered by the fires. FEMA and other relief agencies are able to stage supplies and meet victims' needs in an organized way. New Orleans' Superdome, on the other hand, sitting in the center of the disaster zone, was severely damaged by hurricane winds and threatened by rising water. What had been a shelter devolved into a trap. Katrina also wiped out the Gulf Coast's communications infrastructure, crippling the coordination of relief efforts -- even for the military. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff acknowledged Tuesday that the government's response machinery had benefited from the Katrina experience. ""I think there's no question that [there were] a couple of the lessons from Katrina which we have put into effect here,"" Chertoff said. ""First of all, planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges, so that we have worked together and planned together with the Defense Department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis. That's been a big help here,"" Chertoff said. ""Second, we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue,"" Chertoff said. Chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have FEMA ready, ""and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent, and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent, we sprang into action yesterday. ""So we've been monitoring the situation continuously. The president's been on top of it. We've been on top of it. And we're going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can."" Chertoff said Tuesday that he hadn't waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance. ""We have been moving cots, blankets, other supplies into the area of San Diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity,"" he said. ""We've also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire, once the winds begin to die down."" People left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at www.fema.gov, Paulison said. Watch Paulison discuss the ""new FEMA"" ». He denied suggestions similar to those made in the aftermath of Katrina that the federal response was hampered because National Guard equipment was in short supply because of the Iraq War. ""I just haven't seen that,"" he said. The U.S. military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires, including 11 Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant. More than 17,000 National Guardsmen have been made available; 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego; and 12 Defense Department firefighting teams, were engaged.",0
"Summary: Vince McMahon: WWE has one of best drug-testing programs. Wrestling boss tells CNN that individuals bear responsibility for actions. Critics say WWE penalties for drug use are not harsh enough. Wrestlers still can get drugs if they have prescriptions from doctors. Article: The late Chris Benoit idolized the Dynamite Kid, who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying, acrobatic moves. Chris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June. The Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs. They were quick, agile and muscular, and in 1986 they won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship. Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington. At the beginning of his career, Benoit adopted the Dynamite nickname and copied his idol's signature moves. In June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself. Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in Chris Benoit's body, Georgia's chief medical examiner said a month later. When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, ""It can make you aggressive, the steroids. But personally I wouldn't, you know, kill no bleeding kid, or wife either."" Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England. He has lost the use of his legs. A pin sticks out from one of his toes. Billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body. And from the steroids, he said. Billington told CNN that the steroids came from doctors, from friends, even from steroids meant for horses. He took them all, took a terrible pounding in the ring, and like his partner (who died at age 39 in 2002), began taking extensive amounts of painkillers. Benoit's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, and the man who has ruled wrestling for years, Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon. McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: ""Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family. How did we know Chris Benoit would turn into a monster."" Read a full transcript of the McMahons interview. Vince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show. ""Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy,"" McMahon said. Critics say McMahon pushes his stars and non-stars, works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling. They say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business. His businesses are quite successful. About 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows. Two of their cable programs -- ""Raw"" and ""Friday Night Smackdown"" -- are weekly ratings giants. Pay-per-view specials generate an average of $100 million per year. When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena. ""If someone passes through our organization, it is not our responsibility for someone's personal activities,"" he said. He also said there isn't ""any organization in the world, be it entertainment or be it sport, that can tell you that they are totally drug-free."" Watch as a WWE wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong ». The McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes. Since the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organization's wrestlers have been suspended, including two since CNN's interview with the McMahons. David Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning. But Dr. Gary Wadler, a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough. ""It certainly falls far, far short of where it needs to be,"" he said. ""And there is a gold standard, and I measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard. And [the WWE is] miles apart."" Wadler, a longtime critic of McMahon, was referring to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in Colorado Springs, Colorado. U.S. athletes training for the Olympics are randomly tested and, if caught just once, face a two-year suspension from competition. If caught a second time, they can be banned for life. Black's programs test wrestlers four times a year. The first is a ""baseline"" test, according to the WWE. Black then tests for ""nonmedical"" uses, meaning that if an athlete has a prescription, he is cleared. ""It's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program,"" said Travis Tygart, who heads the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids. He says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years. Watch one of the new WWE stars talk about being ""straight edge"" ». ""There's an expression in our business, that here is where you make your money. It's your face, it's what you do with it,"" he said. ""It's your personality, it's what you do with it. It's your delivery, your elocution. It's storyline, it's things, all those things that are theatrical as well as athletic in the ring."" CNN's Drew Griffin contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Justa Grata Honoria plotted to kill her emperor of Roman Empire. When first plot failed, she offered to marry Attila the Hun. He failed to annihilate Rome, or marry her. She then suffered the fate she dreaded. Article: Everyone goes through a rebellious phase. And, if you're lucky, you'll be able to look back on those years and laugh. If you're less lucky, you spent those years on a reality show, so for the rest of time, millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead. In modern times, cats frolic among the ruins of ancient Rome. But, hey, it could be worse. You could be responsible for the fall of Western Civilization, just like Justa Grata Honoria, the Roman princess whose wild ways and (literally) naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the Roman Empire. Barely regal. Smart, conniving, and ruthless, Honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a Roman emperor, except for that pesky Y chromosome. As a young girl, she watched as her dimwitted six-year-old brother, Valentinian III, was crowned emperor of the Western Roman Empire, while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage. Hardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life, Honoria rebelled with aplomb, sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens. Although her after-hours habits caused quite the scandal, they failed to satiate her need for attention and power, so Honoria set her eyes on the throne. Employing her ample charms, she seduced her brother's royal chamberlain, Eugenius, and together, they plotted to murder Valentinian and seize power. But, alas, their scheme was soon exposed. Eugenius was executed, and Honoria was sent to a convent in Constantinople. Life as a nun was a fate worse than death for Honoria, but even that couldn't quell her ambition. She spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another. Finally, out of sheer desperation, she turned to sources outside the empire. Her savior would have to be powerful enough to defy Valentinian and risk open war with Rome. Only one man fit that description: Attila, king of the Huns. Attila the hubby. Honoria got the barbarian's attention with a mutually beneficial proposal: If Attila would rescue her, she would marry him, and he would get half of the Western Empire as her dowry. Of course, Honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the Roman Empire. But she was betting that after marrying her, Attila would conquer the whole Empire, and she'd become queen to boot. Attila had secretly been planning a move against Rome for years, and Honoria's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike. Wasting no time, he told Valentinian that he planned to marry Honoria, and demanded the dowry he'd been promised. Naturally, Valentinian refused, and Attila used his status as a ""wronged husband"" to invade Roman territory in 451 C.E. The Hun armies quickly swept through the Empire, destroying everything in their path, and eventually they arrived in Rome. Like all the other cities before it, Rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the Huns during the invasion. Rome survived Attila's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe, the Visigoths, but the Western Empire never recovered. Within a generation, the armies of the Goths, Franks, and Huns had overrun the area. The Princess bride. Ultimately, Honoria became neither Roman empress nor a Hun queen. Attila never rescued her, and she was eventually sent back to Rome and left to her brother's justice. Not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed, and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again, Valentinian settled on a suitable third option. After years of struggle, Honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along: She was married off to an elderly Roman senator, and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history.
