1. Introduction {#s0005}
===============

Plants undergo autotumour development (AATD) or programmed cell death (PCD) as part of normal development, a growth-regulating mechanism controlling leaf initiation, expansion, and developmental termination. Cellular processes related to tissue necrosis and apoptosis have not been observed in plants [@b0005], [@b0010]. PCD takes three main pathways: the intrinsic pathway, in which the apoptotic pathway is regulated by mitochondria; the extrinsic pathway, which involves the death receptors; and the secretory pathway, in which an inflammatory response is triggered by the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [@b0015], [@b0020], [@b0025], [@b0030], [@b0035]. AATD and PCD are found in several plant species. For instance, leaf senescence in *Arabidopsis* and rice involves ROS production in chloroplasts and mitochondria resulting in the release of cytochrome c followed by activation of caspases and endonucleo-tidase [@b0040], [@b0045], [@b0050], [@b0055], [@b0030], [@b0040]. Moreover, loss of mitochondrial function, e.g., in *Arabidopsis* mesophyll cells, results in an activation of apoptotic-like pathways with mitochondrial release of ROS and the activation of caspases [@b0080]. On the other hand, the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm is a common pathway in mammalian apoptosis [@b0085], [@b0015].

Mitochondria play a key role in the apoptosis process through the release of a group of apoptogenic factors, including pro-apoptotic, such as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis binding protein with low pI) [@b0010], [@b0085], [@b0090], [@b0095], [@b0100], and anti-apoptotic, such as Bcl-2 [@b0100]. The latter is a B-cell lymphoma 2 protein that interacts with pro-apoptotic proteins and blocks their interaction with anti-apoptotic proteins. This interaction results in the blockage of cytochrome c release [@b0100].

Mitochondria contain some of the most important enzymes in the programmed cell death of *Brassica oleracea* L. cv. Grande Ronde (AATD) [@b0015], [@b0040], [@b0105]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to be involved in AATD by the activation of a plant caspase, but it has not been previously demonstrated that mitochondria play a significant role in AATD processes in plants.

In this work we show that the interaction between mitochondria and caspases is a common mechanism in AATD in a model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*. We demonstrate that the release of components from mitochondria into the cytoplasm is likely involved in the AATD of lace plant leaves. In lace plant leaves mitochondrial release of ROS is involved in the AATD of the leaves in conjunction with the ROS-induced mitochondrial membrane permeability. Furthermore, we suggest two different cell death pathways in lace plant based on the experimental evidence of mitochondrial involvement.

A full version: What are the causes of infantile water-induced urticaria: A retrospective analysis of medical records of patients with this condition, for period of 5 yr, is provided. This study included 16 infants: of them, 14 had a positive history of fever during the preceding 1-3 months, 4 were under-weight babies, and 9 presented with the generalized form of disease. They all used soap (7 infants) and shampoo (9) before bathing, and suffered from the generalized form of the disease. A positive histamine reaction on skin prick tests and wheals on intradermal water tests was found in all. The positive response to antihistamine was detected in seven of them. A history of wheals in infants with the generalized form of water-induced urticaria should raise suspicion of a histamine reaction during bathing.",1
"Question: Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through? Answer:  Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through comparable to those of the transabdominal pull-through?

Objectives {#Sec1}
==========

To compare a new transanal TTS-pouch procedure (TTSP) with a classic abdominoperineal pull-through (APT) regarding the rate of failure to achieve the primary goal (a continent continence rate (CCR) of 75% or more), late morbidity (including anastomotic strictures, fistula formation, and the need to perform secondary procedures) and long-term quality of life (QoL).The primary objective was to compare the CCR at 6 years of patients undergoing TTSP or APT. Secondary objectives were to compare the other morbidity and QoL data.

Methods {#Sec2}
=======

We performed a systematic review of studies from the last 10 years, which involved the TTS-pouch, comparing it with the classic APT. Articles were extracted by two independent authors and included in a database (COSMOS software). In order to be included in the analysis, only studies that reported at least one of the outcomes (CCR, anastomotic strictures, fistulas, readmissions, quality of life) had to be retrieved. The last search was performed in February 2016. The CCR was defined as the CCR at last follow-up, after completion of the initial 3 to 6 months of healing. Anastomotic strictures were defined as any stenosis of the anastomosis, or as a dilatation which required a subsequent operation, the time of which could be described. Fistulas were defined as a spontaneous discharge of urine or faeces. Any late follow-up was included, regardless of the follow-up period. We included articles that met the inclusion criteria and could be read in full by one of the reviewers. The data were collected from included studies, and the reviewers did not have access to the study\'s complete data set. Only articles written in or translated into English were included.

The primary outcome was the CCR, because the only study with primary outcomes that compared these two methods did not perform a statistical analysis of this comparison \[[@CR1]\]. Secondary outcomes were defined as late morbidity (anastomotic strictures, fistulas, reinterventions), and QoL data. Late morbidity included anastomotic strictures, fistulas, reinterventions, adhesions around the bowel, and any kind of surgical intervention required for a problem linked to the initial operation. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using the EORTC QOL-C30. QoL data were collected at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up, and it included data from one or two questionnaires. One questionnaire was the generic EuroQOL questionnaire, in which the patient had to grade from zero to three the degree of difficulty in carrying out activities of daily living; if zero, the patient had either no problem or a great deal of help, and if three a very great deal of trouble or even impossibility. In the second questionnaire, the I-QoL questionnaire, the patient had to grade from zero to four the degree of difficulty in performing the physical, social, mental, and spiritual aspects of his/her life; if zero, the patient had neither problem nor great deal of help, and if four a very great deal of help or impossibility \[[@CR2]\].

Because there are only two studies that compared these two methods of repair that reported long-term results, the outcomes were reviewed by the two reviewers as to their representativeness and accuracy, and they were only included if there were no concerns raised about them. In a multivariate analysis, the CCR of patients undergoing APT was used as a historical comparator, to determine the effect of all the TTSP variables and their interaction effect. However, a subanalysis was undertaken between procedures and the two reviewers had a consensus. For the remaining outcomes, subgroup analyses by anastomotic level (low versus high) and type of anastomosis (high or low) were undertaken. All analyses were considered statistically significant when the *p* value was \<0.05.

The data for this review were extracted from 2 studies that were selected from 8 studies that included data of patients operated on with both procedures \[[@CR1], [@CR3], [@CR4]\]. A review of the bibliographic databases used in those original studies (Embase, Cochrane database, Medline, Pubmed) did not identify any other studies, in which the TTSP",1

You may have to collect data on more than one patient, if the patient agrees. Read the first section of the protocol carefully and select one of the following approaches:

1. A prospective cohort study will randomize 300 patients from a large, urban HMO in San Diego County, CA to receive (1) a mammogram referral with self-care information on the EMR or (2) no mammogram referral with self-care information on the EMR. The study will be carried out in primary care clinics that use electronic medical records (EMRs). Screening women ages 50 through 75 will be randomized to receive (1) a mammogram referral with self-care information on the EMR or (2) no mammogram referral with self-care information on the EMR. Self-care information is tailored to patient age, previous mammogram receipt, and breast cancer risk as calculated by the Gail model. The study will also provide self-collected breast DNA testing at randomization. To protect confidentiality, a masked clinician will determine the genetic mutation status in the EMR. The genetic mutation status will influence the referral information, but not the actual referral. Breast cancer risk status will determine where in the EMR the information appears and whether the patient receives a mammogram or gets the Gail model information. The EMR will be modified so the patient can receive either referral immediately or be sent back to the chart so the clinician can decide later whether to recommend a mammogram. Outcomes for patients in the intervention group will be compared to those in the control group at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after randomization.

2. The same study will randomize 300 non-mammography-eligible women, ages 50 to 75, who use an HMO in Sacramento, CA to receive (1) a breast cancer risk assessment, self-care information, and referral to a breast cancer screening decision aid or (2) no self-care information but an equivalent written decision aid. The decision aid will be developed based on the results of a conceptual model that identifies the cognitive processes that influence decisions to obtain mammography and links the model to the clinical context. It will contain a table that categorizes the estimated risk of breast cancer according to a patient-perceived risk score, followed by a table that presents the Gail model risk for each score category. Inclusion criteria include enrollment in the HMO, a referral for breast cancer risk, age 50 to 75, English proficiency, and no prior mammogram.

"Question: Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting? Answer:  How is double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) performed and its outcomes in a non-academic hospital, and what is the long-term success?

Background {#Sec1}
==========

Endoscopic techniques for the evaluation of small bowel disorders began in the 1970s \[[@CR1]\]. Initial interest centred on determining the site of bleeding, diagnosis of polyps, assessment of villous morphology, detection of celiac disease (CD), characterisation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication-associated complications, and treatment of obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (OGIB) \[[@CR2]--[@CR4]\]. Currently, over 150 procedures are available for the evaluation of GI disorders, and this has been a source of great enthusiasm among gastroenterologists and surgeons \[[@CR5], [@CR6]\].

The double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) procedure was developed in the early 1990s by Goss et al. and allowed direct visual inspection of the entire small bowel \[[@CR7], [@CR8]\]. DBE offers direct access to the entire small intestine and can provide diagnosis of CD as well as evaluation of small bowel lesions. These procedures are commonly performed in the setting of CD \[[@CR9]\], OGIB (including patients with angioectasia) \[[@CR10]--[@CR12]\], and evaluation of a patient at high risk for recurrent CD \[[@CR13]\]. DBE also allows direct biopsy of lesions to make a diagnosis based on histopathology. Furthermore, patients undergoing DBE have been shown to have a higher rate of complete small bowel evaluation and fewer adverse events compared to push enteroscopy \[[@CR14]\]. In a meta-analysis of 7 studies, Tosi et al. found that DBE was associated with a 1.2% perforation rate and had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 92%, 84%, 84%, and 93%, respectively, for the detection of CD \[[@CR15]\]. The DBE procedure has also been shown to be a useful diagnostic tool for the evaluation of a number of other non-neoplastic causes of GI bleeding, including GI angioectasia \[[@CR10]--[@CR12]\], vasculitis \[[@CR16]\], portal hypertension \[[@CR17]\], and achalasia \[[@CR18]\].

Given its diagnostic and therapeutic value, DBE became a common procedure performed in many endoscopy units across the country. While this procedure continues to evolve, DBE has been shown to be very effective in the hands of experienced operators \[[@CR10]\]. The majority of published studies have been performed in tertiary endoscopy centres or in academic hospitals where highly trained personnel are more readily available in the event of complication. It is unknown how the performance of DBE in a community-based setting compares to that in tertiary care centres and whether this is a safe procedure in such settings and in the hands of less experienced operators. We hypothesised that outcomes of DBE in community gastroenterology practices would be similar to those in tertiary endoscopy centres in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of DBE performed by gastroenterology fellows and faculty in a single community hospital. Secondary aims were to assess endoscopy success rates, complications, procedure performance times, and duration before hospital admission.

Methods {#Sec2}
=======

This retrospective study was approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board. Chart review was completed between November 2017 and August 2018 and was exempt from IRB approval given that chart review was performed on nonprobability, anonymous samples.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Adult patients over the age of 18 years presenting to the gastroenterology department for DBE during the study period; (2) patients referred from primary care for evaluation of recurrent or chronic OGIB requiring DBE for evaluation and/or treatment of lesions; (3) patients referred from the emergency room or other subspecialty services for DBE; and (4) patients receiving DBE on an emergent basis or urgent/intermediate-urgency basis. Patients treated primarily as an outpatient by their primary care provider were also included. Those patients who required DBE for diagnostic rather than therapeutic purposes were excluded from this study.

Patients were excluded if they (1) had any complication from the procedure such as bowel perforation, incomplete small bowel evaluation, or inability to place a therapeutic tube; (2",1
"Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement? Answer:  “30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement?”

Introduction

Patients suffering from trauma from gunshot wound, stab wound, and blunt trauma are usually brought to the emergency department (ED) by paramedics for stabilization. These patients are transferred for further management to the operating room (OR) to be performed by the operating surgeon.

Emergency general surgery (EGS) is the broad scope of surgeries performed by Emergency Surgeons (ES). As part of our educational and investigative activities, we reviewed the outcomes of EGS laparotomies in the OR to determine the morbidity and mortality of such an endeavor.

Materials and methods

Two hundred nineteen consecutive adult patients of 18 years and older who underwent EGS (excluding vascular and orthopedic cases) in the OR were studied during the last four years. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients suffering from trauma from gunshot wound, stab wound, or blunt trauma; (2) patients in whom laparotomy was performed by elective procedure; (3) patients in whom the interval between injury and surgery lasted less than 24 hours. Emergency Laparotomy were also excluded (a) patients in whom vascular and orthopedic surgeries were undertaken; (b) post-trauma cases in which bowel injury had been established (e.g. small bowel obstruction, acute mesenteric ischemia etc.) by contrast radiology (plain abdominal films and computed tomography) (Figures 1A to 2C); (3) penetrating injury to the abdomen. In our series, the mean and median age of the patients were 39.7 years and 42 years respectively whereas mean/median ISS were 25/30 points. Average hospital stay before surgery was 5.5 days.

Results

Surgical findings demonstrated: multiple organ failure (MOF) in 22(10.2%) patients, massive colectomy in 10 (4.66%), extensive bowel necrosis in seven(3.15%), and small bowel obstruction in three(1.36%) (Table 1). The leading cause of death was MOF (37 (17), followed by complications from wound infection and multiple organ failure (25 each (11.6%), respectively, and small bowel obstruction in five (2.3%) (Table 2). In the last three years, the outcome appeared to be somewhat poorer than in the first three years (Figure 3). Thus, morbidity and mortality of EGS laparotomies in the OR remained relatively unmodified over the course of 4 years.

Discussion

Despite the technological advances in emergency medicine, surgery, and anesthesia, EGS is still associated with high morbidity and mortality. This is mainly due to delay in proper diagnosis as the disease progresses and the use of inappropriate, or simply inadequate treatment plan prior to surgery. Therefore, EGS represents the frontier of modern surgical care.

In our series, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality was MOF. This was observed more in the patients who underwent emergency cholecystectomy.

Inappropriate management is a common problem in EGS, particularly among the lower socioeconomic groups of society. There are many barriers, including:

1. delay in the decision to operate on the critically ill trauma patient;

2. time-sensitive nature of surgery due to the need to resuscitate the patient;

3. lack of a surgeon, anesthesiologists, and other surgical personnel available to perform emergency surgery immediately, in most instances;

A large number of patients were diagnosed to be suffering from multiple morbidities, including injury to major vessels/organs, and thus treated in the OR.

Most of the patients of gunshot injuries are brought to the ED by paramedics in extremis. On arrival, resuscitation in the ED is undertaken. It was observed that many patients failed to progress clinically during the period of resuscitation, and thus had to be taken up for EGS in the OR.

Loss of time prior to surgery has resulted in progressive organ failure. The delay in making a diagnosis of injury to major vessels was found to be a key factor in the deaths of more than half of the patients who underwent surgery.

Anesthetic, surgical, and medical support in the OR during EGS are limited. Emergency laparotomy is the surgery of last resort in cases of multiple trauma. It is therefore of paramount importance to identify the patients who require emergency laparotomy early in the course of their illness. However, it is also important to identify the patients who can be managed by other means, and thus avoid EGS entirely. The majority of gunshot and stab wounds, and almost all blunt trauma can be managed non-operatively.",1
"Question: Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Answer:  Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders?

Question (continued):Is adjustment for
reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? What are the results of the
study (if any) that suggests otherwise? Why do we need such a study? Would not
just repeating the same study in an updated meta-analysis provide the same result?
What evidence do you have that the heterogeneity in the various methods of
assessing sleep would necessarily be overcome by combining the results of
different methods, a practice now considered common in psychometric
interpreters?

Question (continued):Is adjustment for reporting
heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders?

Answer:

The answer is NO. We do not have to adjust for reporting heterogeneity in
assessments of any single sleep disorder per se (i.e., sleep-disordered
sleepwalking, insomnia, parasomnias including sleep terrors as they stand).
However, we would need to consider adjusting the results of our studies of such
sleep disorders should the heterogeneity of methods of assessment become
heterogeneity of assessment. For example, should the heterogeneity be the
result of difference in the duration of the sleep study or the number of stages
assessed, which may result from differences in the way that the study is
designed and the instructions given to (1) the study participants, or (2) the
treater, i.e. the person doing the sleep study.

Such adjustments would need to be done for all (heterogeneous) sleep disorders
when one group of people used a certain method of assessment, and another group
of people used another method. The purpose of an adjustment would be to insure
that everyone in our studies used the same method of assessment, and the same
standard of measurement when conducting the study. This can be assured by
having very specific instructions given to all (1) study participants and (2)
the treater as to how to conduct the assessment.

That is why one of the most important issues with sleep assessment today is the
divergent methods of assessment. This is problematic because of the large
hitherto unpublished, but potentially important studies that have already been
completed. It is clear that sleep has a significant influence on certain
biologically mediated diseases—diseases that have a long latency period (e.g.,
cancer, obesity, and some autoimmune diseases (1, 7)). Therefore, these sleep
research findings need to be known about—and the methodological concerns
addressed in a standard, objective way so that meaningful assessment will result
from future research.

As we try to learn more about sleep and health, particularly in humans, it is no
surprise that various methods of assessing sleep have been employed. Some
people do sleep laboratory studies in which they sleep under laboratory
conditions. Others do home monitoring studies. Still others do studies that use
clinically trained polysomnographic technicians working in sleep centers. These
technicians work with some of the most recent hardware as well as the newest
algorithms for both recording and analysis. Finally, there are no-longer-
employed people who have studied sleep and have used their own, sometimes
informal, means of assessing sleep as defined on their own criteria. This last
form of research has been in the majority for many years but also the least
studied.

There have, of course, always been published research reports that have used
these various methods of assessing sleep. However, few of the studies have
employed standardized laboratory procedures, and the use of objective measures
of sleep was seldom the main research interest. In more recent years, there has
been very little attention paid to the methodological issues (especially how to
define “sleep” or “sleep” itself). Moreover, most of the studies have been
unpublished. Some of these studies are at the research phase but have been
completed and are only awaiting publication, while others have only been
completed but are awaiting publication.

In fact, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of ongoing clinical and
administrative sleep research studies being conducted in the United States.
Some are being funded by grants, others are funded by contract, and others are
being funded without an explicit funding source (e.g., research done without a
contract or grant) or are being funded by an unspecified agency. In addition,
many of these studies have been initiated without obtaining IRB approval or
without obtaining written informed consent procedures. There are literally
hundreds of studies of sleep going on in one way or another at present, and
their findings and methods are virtually untapped. These are",1
"Question: Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness? Answer:  Does mutation of the PCSK9 gene cause reduced levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and hence increased carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT)? You can choose among the following three different models: In the first model, the gene for the mutant (mutated) PCSK9 protein is present in all cases; in the second model, the gene for the mutant (mutated) PCSK9 protein is present in some cases and for which the presence of the gene for the mutant (mutated) PCSK9 protein is only due to a low level of activity of the PCSK9 gene. In the third model, the gene for the mutant (mutated) PCSK9 protein is not present.

Solution Description

Answers will be graded according to the nature of the models used. For the first and third models, the paper is a successful one in that it has been constructed for the purpose of writing a paper. For the second model, the paper is a failed one in that insufficient thought has been given to the construction. Answer the Question in 3 parts:

If the gene for the mutant (mutated) PCSK9 protein is present, then
(i) How is the gene for the mutant (mutated) protein regulated?

(ii) How is the PCSK9 protein that was made in the liver from the gene for the mutant (mutated) protein then shuttled into the peripheral blood?

(iii) In the presence of the gene for the mutant protein, what is the proportion of PCSK9 protein that is made?

For the first model, the gene for the mutant PCSK9 protein is present in all cases
Answer the questions posed by (i) and (ii) above. You'll need to develop the answer in terms of the following parts: a discussion of how the gene for the mutant protein is regulated, an answer to the Question on how the low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are modified and the answer on how the level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood is reduced. For the second model, the gene for the mutant PCSK9 protein has a low activity; in other words, there is a low level of activity.

For the second model, the gene for the mutant PCSK9 protein is present in some cases and the presence is due to a low level of activity of the PCSK9 gene.

In the third model, gene for the mutant PCSK9 protein does not exist
In the third model, gene for mutated PCSK9 protein does not exist

Solution Explanation: Answer the Questions posed by (i) and (ii) above. The paper has failed.

In the second model, the gene for the mutant (mutated) PCSK9 protein is present in some cases and the presence of the gene is due to a low level of activity of the PCSK9 gene

Answer the following questions posed by (iii) above. You'll need to develop an answer.

Can a different mutation be created that does not have a gene for an enzyme that causes low density lipoprotein cholesterol to be converted back into low density lipoprotein cholesterol? Can this mutation be so created that it does not have the PCSK9 protein? Why not?

If the PCSK9 protein is not present, what is the effect of the mutation?

In a gene, mutation means a change. The same mutation that produces a new protein produces also the same new gene, in addition to a different protein. In the case of the PCSK9 mutation, the gene for the PCSK9 protein is a different mutation from that for the other PCSK9 protein. The low density lipoprotein cholesterol is in part caused by the PCSK9 protein. In the case of a mutation of the PCSK9 gene, there should not be a reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Does the mutation of the PCSK9 gene cause the reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol?

How can a mutant form of PCSK9 prevent low density lipoprotein cholesterol from being oxidized by a reaction of the enzyme lecithin acyltransferase (LAT) to give low density lipoprotein cholesterol? If this form of low density lipoprotein cholesterol will not form then will low density lipoprotein cholesterol still be oxidized by LAT for the formation of cholesteryl esters and fatty acids? If not, how is low density lipoprotein cholesterol made?

Why can this mutated form cause the oxidation of low density lipoprotein cholesterol for the formation of cholesteryl esters and fatty acids?

The PCSK9 protein is found only in the liver, not the heart or any other tissue. It",1

Abstract

Background: Short and 23-hour wards are often seen as effective ways of caring for acutely sick children. This study was a preliminary survey of short stay, 23-hour wards. The authors attempted to collect primary data from clinical and administrative staff to answer a basic question: do these wards effectively support the delivery of high quality pediatric critical care? Methods: Twenty three-dimensional questions were developed to measure the critical aspects of clinical care: ""How do we care for sick children?"" and ""How do we use our resources to the best advantage?"" The three-part survey method was utilized to address the ""How do we care for sick children?"" aspect of the question. This survey was administered to critical care attending pediatricians, critical care attending and fellow house staff, and nurses on three short stay, 23-hour wards in three New York City metropolitan area hospitals. Questions included the ""Why and How, What, and How Much"" of the care process. Survey data were transcribed onto a data sheet for management purposes and analyzed for inter-rater reliability and for statistical significance using the Fisher Exact T-Test for 2 X 2 cross tabulations. An analysis of the mean and standard deviations was performed on the ""How much"" responses. Results: A statistically significant correlation was found within each group of respondents on all three short stay, 23-hour wards regarding the measures for the ""How to deliver quality pediatric care,"" the ""Why we do it, and the ""How much of it."" The correlation coefficient for inter-rater reliability of each ward ranged from 0.66 to 0.79 and was statistically significant (p<0.001) according to Fisher Exact statistical test. The responses for ""How much"" varied from 20-50%. For each ward, ""Why"" and ""How"" responses were also correlated. These measures ranged from 75-100%, indicating a highly significant correlation for each ward. Conclusions: This study demonstrated there is a strong correlation of medical practice on adult and pediatric short stay 23-hour wards. In addition, the results of ""Why and How"" question categories were also correlated. While all three facilities varied in ""How much of How,"" all three wards consistently addressed ""Why"" in their responses. These results may support further work on the effectiveness of short stay, 23-hour wards as models of practice and for the development of further clinical and educational interventions.

"Question: Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful? Answer:  Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful?
A 38‐year‐old obese lady presents to your hospital with a one‐month history of nausea, vomiting, and dark‐colored stools. Her stool tests are positive for occult blood: the guaiac‐ and faecal‐elastase‐1‐dye‐test results are positive (indicating a recent bleeding tendency), whereas the haemoglobin level and MCV have normal values. She reports having only a few alcoholic drinks but denies any drug intake.
A routine stool examination is also performed and positive for occult blood. In addition, a physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant with an enlarged liver.
Based on these findings, you decide to treat the patient with prednisolone (30 mg twice daily) for the next two weeks. If any improvement of abdominal symptoms occurs, the prednisolone dose may be tapered. However, no improvement is noted after two weeks.
Questions
1. What further investigations would you perform?
2. What is the most likely diagnosis?
3. What is the appropriate treatment?
Answer
1. A stool culture, serologic tests for viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (anti‐smooth muscle antibody and anti‐mitochondrial antibody), as well as a colonoscopy and possibly an ultrasound will all be performed.
2. An alcoholic steatohepatitis is one of the most common etiologies of acute and chronic liver disease in the Western countries but this can be difficult to distinguish from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a much more common cause of liver disease in the Western world. These conditions are often termed “fatty liver”, indicating fat deposits in the liver. Alcoholic steatohepatitis is characterized by the presence of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning of hepatocytes, frequently accompanied by necroinflammation (hepatocyte ballooning and neutrophil infiltration of the portal tracts) and fibrosis. The inflammatory foci of alcoholic steatohepatitis are more frequently present near the portal tract than in the parenchyma. If steatosis is extensive, the inflammatory infiltrate appears less pronounced. In the setting of more fat droplets, the inflammation also has a lower concentration of inflammatory cells (predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes); hepatic fibrosis is much less frequently observed and may be restricted to zone 3. This pattern may indicate the effects of “futility”, i.e., the effects of alcohol on the liver are so great that the liver cannot function further. A biopsy for histopathological analysis is therefore not necessary but a high alcohol ingestion does predict the development of cirrhosis, portal and lobular inflammation, fibrosis, and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma [9].
In NASH and alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), the main histopathological manifestations are (a) steatosis (>5-15% of hepatocytes): accumulation of fat in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in the form of a “micro‐abscess”; (b) ballooning of hepatocytes with macrovesicular steatosis: the cytoplasm of liver cells is expanded and foamy, and the cell nucleus is squeezed out from the cytosol; (c) inflammation: a variable number of inflammatory cells (including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells) is present; (d) fibrosis: variable degrees of hepatic fibrosis with architectural distortion in the portal regions and bridging fibrosis; these features represent the most important pathological changes. In addition, fibrosis in ASH is usually diffuse and involves the entire liver. In contrast, as previously illustrated, steatosis and inflammation can be focal, particularly lobules, and may be confined to the hepatic triad (portal and central veins with hepatic artery). Ballooning hepatocytes are also more often localized and do not usually involve zones 3 and 2 of the liver.
3. A prednisolone tapering (a very common treatment in such a clinical setting) is clearly suboptimal as this would induce further liver injury by increasing liver inflammation.

Q: What is cirrhosis?
A: Cirrhosis is the end stage of hepatic fibrosis and scarring of the liver due to inflammation and scarring of the liver from alcohol

"Question: Prompting Primary Care Providers about Increased Patient Risk As a Result of Family History: Does It Work? Answer:  Prompting Primary Care Providers about Increased Patient Risk As a Result of Family History: Does It Work (specifically addressing the efficacy of screening)? In this paper, do not provide the details of how this works. We will do this for you, with guidance from your dissertation chair, a professional research assistance with advanced graduate degrees and a writing consultant.

Please describe how you will answer the Question: Prompting Primary Care Providers about Increased Patient Risk as a Result of Family History: Does It Work? Your answer should include an explanation of your quantitative methods. Give reasons for your quantitative methods (e.g., sampling).

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether screening for at-risk family members of patients with CHD, in response to a direct question asked by primary care providers (PCPs) concerning possible familial risk for CHD, can be implemented to improve CHD awareness among patients and their families.

This research involves the implementation and evaluation of PCPT (Primary Care Provider Treatment) by community-based primary care providers that address patient at-risk status for CHD. This pilot study focuses on how providers treat patients with increased risk for CHD in the context of their primary-care clinic visit

The study is intended to answer the two-fold research question:

RQ1: Does the direct question about increased risk for CHD in at-risk patient families increase patients’ and their families’ awareness about cardiovascular health risks and potential prevention strategies? (The research plan is depicted in Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 RQ1: Patient and Family Awareness of Increased CHD Risk

RQ2: Is patient risk status changeable (RQ2: does the answer to RQ1 affect subsequent patient or family counseling (RQ2).

Fig. 2 RQ2: Change in patient risk from baseline (prior to PCP’s direct question) to follow-up (after PCP’s question)

Fig. 3: RQ2-RQ4

The research study builds on: 1) CHD risk communication models; 2) the Medical Home; 3) the Patient Centered Medical Home.

Chronic Heart Disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death among US adults between the ages of 35 and 84 years (1.7 million deaths in 2001).

Among CHD patients, cardiovascular events (heart attacks and strokes) are the leading causes of death (1.5 million deaths during 2001) (2). In addition, CHD is a major source of disability. For example, according to the 2000 US Census, more than one million people aged 16 years and older (4% of the adult population) were limited in daily activities as a result of heart conditions (3).

The risk and severity of CHD can be significantly impacted by the risk profile of other family members (a person’s spouse, first-degree relative, second-degree relative, etc.) (5). Family members, and the immediate caregivers of those at-risk persons, often underestimate the risk of future health conditions. However, those at-risk family members can often be identified in the course of routine, regular, primary care visits. Thus, we propose improving CHD awareness among at-risk family members and providers, which may facilitate better care for these patients, and ultimately, improve health outcomes (6).

In the study design, we are targeting patients who present to an internal medical office primary care practice with possible cardiovascular (CHD) risk. In contrast to our prior work with cardiac specialists and in-patient cardiovascular clinics, this project intends specifically to address the need to create effective CHD risk awareness among patients and their families, as part of the standard of care for patients and their families, when PCPs are the first-contact for assessment of CHD risk-related conditions (7,8). Our prior work demonstrates that PCPT was effective in improving awareness of cardiac events among patients with CHD, as well as among patients and their families, their caregivers, and their families. Although this project does not attempt to establish a comprehensive protocol for the management of these patients, we anticipate that a PCPT model that includes a direct-questioning method, an assessment of patient risk level for familial CHD, identification and counseling of at-risk family members and provision of risk information and/or resources, will positively affect the treatment of patients with increased risk for CHD.

Eligibility criteria include the following conditions:

Patients must be aged 16 or older who have not had a MI within the past five years, and who do not have another identified risk factor that confounds CHD risk.

We are also using an approach for CHD risk assessment that includes consideration of additional factors that confound",1

=======

General search strategy and search method for literature: The general search strategy aimed to identify all publications in the English, Spanish, Italian, German, French, and Dutch languages that had been published prior to 12 May 2010 and used the same terms as in the Cochrane database, for example, Patient-Controlled Administration, patient self-administration, patient controlled. The following databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, CNKI (China national knowledge infrastructure, <http://www.cnki.net.cn>) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The databases were supplemented by examination of all relevant references, abstracts, and websites.

**Results**

The search process generated 1425 articles, which subsequently underwent examination for relevance and for double inclusion. Only 10 trials were found relevant to the Question using search terms Patient-Controlled Administration. Of the 10 studies, 4 were excluded (see Fig. [5](#F5){ref-type=""fig""}).

**Patient-Controlled Administration (PCA)**

Background: PCA is the administration of intravenous opioids by a patient with a palliative care team for symptom management where patients are trained to self-administer and titrate their doses of opioids themselves.

Methods: There is a lack of agreement in how to define PCA and use of this type of administration, which is associated with high doses of opioids and the use of benzodiazepines.

Results: A total of 6 trials were identified comparing PCA to conventional administration in palliative care: 3 investigated morphine, 1 buprenorphine, 1 oxycodone, and 1 methadone. A statistical pooling of data from the 4 morphine trials, which had a moderate to a high risk of bias, showed a statistically significant reduction in breathlessness with the use of PCA \[n = 119 (PCA n = 75, conventional n = 44)\]. Three of the 6 trials assessed patient satisfaction, which showed a positive effect. There were more treatment-related adverse events (e.g. nausea/vomiting, dizziness), especially when opioids were used with a high dose (PCA vs. conventional administration). Three PCA trials \[n = 535 (PCA n = 316, conventional n = 219)\] evaluated pain intensity and found that when opioids were used with PCA, patients had a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity \[n = 461 (PCA n = 291, conventional n = 140)\].

"Question: Do patterns of knowledge and attitudes exist among unvaccinated seniors? Answer:  Do patterns of knowledge and attitudes exist among unvaccinated seniors? Use this assignment as a basis for a paper that includes your analysis of unvaccinated seniors who are part of the Boomers generation and their attitudes about the flu and vaccines.

Question: How much do parents know about influenza? Do parents know whom should be vaccinated against the flu? What do parents think may be the most effective route of administering the flu vaccine to their children?

Question: Where has the greatest risk for contracting the flu been during the past year? What steps can the pediatric community take to mitigate risk for influenza in their patients?

Answer: Since 2001, deaths from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have ranged from 449 to 689 [1]. H1N1 has been responsible for at least a dozen deaths each year since its emergence in 2009 [2, 3]. Many of these cases are in patients with underlying medical conditions. A significant proportion of deaths from the H1N1 strain have been in the pediatric population as well [3-6]. Most commonly, pediatric patients with underlying medical conditions are exposed and later develop severe influenza. During the 2003-2004 influenza season, several large outbreaks of pediatric community-acquired influenza resulted in substantial outpatient and hospital morbidity and mortality [7-14]. Because these viruses often caused more serious disease in children than in adults, particularly among children with underlying medical conditions [4, 9-12, 14], the CDC initially recommended vaccination of children 6 months to 18 years of age, especially those with chronic pulmonary, cardiac, renal, or neurologic problems. However, many primary care physicians had limited experience with pediatric vaccines during the 2003-2004 season, and they focused only on vaccinating patients 6 months of age and older [15, 16]. After a number of pediatric deaths during the 2003-2004 pandemic, the CDC modified the recommendations, recommending vaccination of high-risk persons 2 years of age and older [4, 12, 15, 17-19]; these recommendations were reiterated in the interim guidance document as of January 2009 [20]. The CDC recommendations were updated again for the 2010-2011 influenza season, recommending that children [3, 4, 6], pregnant women [6-12], children 2 years of age and older [5, 7, 9],[14, 17], and adults 60 years of age and older [4, 8, 9],[14] receive the influenza vaccine as well. This last set of guidelines is the document that will shape vaccination protocols for the 2012-2013 influenza season as well. In addition, children are advised to get two doses of an influenza vaccine by 6 months of age to provide longer-lasting protection [5,6,7,13,17].

In the United States, influenza vaccine coverage in the general population has been increasing. Influenza vaccination coverage, measured by vaccination status and influenza test results, has been as low as 40% in previous seasons [18-20]. High rates of vaccination among older adults may help in the prevention of influenza and are recommended by many organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [14, 17]. CDC and Medicare published a letter to healthcare professionals urging them to encourage patients in the Medicare insurance program to vaccinate against the flu, including older adults [7]. Unfortunately, only about 2/3 of seniors know whether they need the flu vaccine or not [5, 12, 17]. To assist physicians in counseling patients, the CDC has also produced a brochure, which includes many of the risk factors recommended by both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [5] and the American College of Physicians [2]. The most effective route for vaccination with available vaccines remains the intramuscular (IM) route of administration of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [5, 11, 13, 14, 17]. To date, most information about the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccines in the elderly has come from randomized studies designed for prevention in nursing homes and for prevention of complications in frail, medically compromised persons, including persons with chronic heart and lung disease [14].

However, even among those who receive influenza vaccines, there are still substantial percentages who do not respond fully to vaccination. The effectiveness of the vaccine may be determined by measuring the number of individuals who experience symptomatic influenza infection. A recent randomized efficacy trial among seniors in the United States indicates that although immunization does not improve the risk of developing influenza, immunization may lessen symptoms and complications of infection [21]. This study also indicated that an additional measure of effectiveness of the vaccine is how well it prevents others, or the “herd effect,” from developing influenza.

Although these data are from a controlled trial population, the overall impact of immunization on both vaccine and nonvaccine recipients might be similar to that of a natural outbreak, in which everyone has been exposed to the infection",1

"Question: Cardiovascular risk in a rural adult West African population: is resting heart rate also relevant? Answer:  ""In a study of people in West Africa (SSA), how relevant is resting heart rate for predicting cardiovascular risk?""

Objective:
The objectives of this investigation are to compare cardiovascular risk in rural adults (RA) in Ghana (GHA) compared to adults living in Nsuta, a rural community in Ghana and to examine a possible correlation between BMI and the heart rate (HR) of both the RA and non-rural adult controls in a Ghanaian adult West African population.

Methods:
The anthropometric and blood pressure measurements of the study population are documented in two groups: rural adults in Ghana (GHA) and a rural community of Ghana (non-RA) and compared to an adult age-matched population of controls living locally in Ghana. Cardiovascular risk is based on the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Scores for both groups in the GHA and controls and the National Cholesterol Educational Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) scoring in the adults in the Ghanaian rural community. Finally, the HR measurements and resting blood pressure of the GHA and non-RA subjects are compared to their respective values obtained in the control population.

Results:
Cardiovascular risk is higher in the adult GHA population compared to the non-RA controls in the group locally residing in the community. There was a statistically significant difference in age, gender, height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference. There is no significant difference in resting blood pressure between the GHA adults and their age-matched controls, but the HR of the GHA adults is significantly higher. There is no significant difference in any of the parameters of cardiovascular risk used between the non-RA adult controls and the GHA adults.

Conclusion/Clinical Implication:
The HR is significantly higher in the adult GHA population compared to their age-matched and age-adjusted controls, thus it is a significantly higher risk factor in the GA adult population, which needs to be addressed and investigated further to help mitigate and improve the CVD risk in the community. The GHA controls and non-RA controls have a lower risk for CVD, both at the Framingham and ATP III risk scores, and thus the GHA community does not have a higher risk for CVD as the non-RA controls do; but the risk for CVD according to the Framingham and the ATP III CVD risk scores, is significantly higher in the GHA adults than the non-RA adult controls residing in the same community. The GHA adult have a significantly higher mean resting HR than GHA controls at 71.9 bpm compared to the non-RA controls at 54 bpm. This difference has clinical significance over time. It is important to note that the adults in the non-RA controls and the adult GHA controls are from the same ethnic group and of the same geographic area.

1. INTRODUCTION

Awareness of heart disease in developing countries is low, mostly due to low health literacy which may result in a lower degree of understanding of the importance of early detection of cardiovascular disease. It has been reported [1–6] that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality among the adult population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for the majority (60–70%) of the more than 19 million incident CVD cases and the major cause of death in many countries. In Ghana, the burden of CVD mortality, although falling, rose slightly from 11% in 1974 to 11.5% in 2000. This has been attributed to the steady rise in the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in the country; and to the aging populations, which together make up a large proportion of the deaths due to CVD. There is no published study that determines how to help people to reduce their CVD risk. The aim of this study is to compare cardiovascular risk (CVR) patterns between adult adults living in a rural area of Ghana and adults residing in local communities. To investigate, the heart rate (HR) is also to be determined and the relation between HR and body mass index (BMI) will be compared in both groups. The CVR is used to identify and follow the development of CVD in the early stages of a person who has low or intermediate risk; it then helps to develop and maintain effective treatments. One of the major risk factors that have been identified by the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Scores and the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) for prediction of CVD is the body mass index (BMI) [7, 8]. The BMI is a good indicator of both the total fat and body fat mass of a person that helps to determine the degree of weight and body fat in a person. This correlates",1
"Question: Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted? Answer:  How can Israeli hospitals improve their preparedness for MLCIs from terrorist attacks?

How is the distribution of serious injuries changed when a hospital is dealing with a multiple casualty incident (MLCI) from terrorism? More specifically, will this distribution of serious injuries change if a hospital is involved during a massive terror attack? The main motivation for this research is the possibility of finding the characteristics behind the distribution of serious injuries in order to predict future trends during such incidents.

The study will examine Israeli hospital resources and the distributions of serious injuries during the attack of May 31, 2004. The study will focus on the effects of the mass casualties on the distribution of injuries. This study will examine whether a relationship exists between the number of casualties and the distribution of injuries and will try to identify the characteristics behind the changed pattern. The findings will support planning of emergency resources in hospitals and increase the level of preparedness for the future in cases like these.

Methods

To begin, data from Israeli hospitals, and the number of survivors from the attacks on May 31, 2004 will be presented. An Injury Severity Score (ISS) will be used as the severity of injury marker and the distribution of injuries will be described. The statistical procedures used will examine a correlation between the number of survivors from the attacks on May 31, 2004 with the distribution of injuries in the hospitals that treated casualties during these attacks. In addition, the study will examine the correlation between the number of casualties in hospitals and the distribution of injuries.

Results

The findings show that the severity of the injuries in a hospital significantly changes when a number of casualties occurs. Specifically, it can predict the number of injured people inside a hospital and improve its planning for the future.

Significance & Impact

In a hospital setting where the number of affected people is significantly large, a major injury is more likely to occur. For instance, after the bombings of September 11, 2001 in the US, the injury data for the US hospitals showed that the most commonly affected hospital was the Los Angeles County hospital with over 60 percent of the casualties treated.

In this study, we will examine the effects the number of injured people has in their severity and on the distribution of injuries in a hospital, and we will try to detect the characteristics that cause these effects. The study findings will improve the preparedness planning for emergency resources and show a correlation between the number of casualties and the change in distribution of injuries during emergency events to enable a hospital to increase its preparedness. Therefore, this study will help hospitals improve their preparedness for emergency conditions like terrorist attacks.

Israeli health insurance institutions are obligated to pay hospital bills for all insured victims of terrorist attacks, regardless of whether they have chosen to declare themselves uninsured, or whether the hospital has declared a bankruptcy procedure. During these events, Israel is obligated to pay for the treatment of casualties and victims of terror attacks. In accordance to the Israeli court ruling, health care providers and hospitals pay a fixed percentage of an amount depending on the number of injured.

This fact is being used by hospitals during massive casualty incident (MLCIs). MLCI is defined “as a situation in which many people (a mass casualty incident) receive health care from the same or several hospitals over an extended time period due to a sudden or continuous event, or because of an unusually large number of patients who require a particular type of medical care” (Benabou and Kastler, 2001).

MLCI is a type of accident where a high proportion of victims are injured, requiring health care, and is usually accompanied by the destruction of the hospitals and healthcare facilities. In Israel, in such situation, the health care institutions (i.e., hospitals) pay a fixed percentage based on how many casualties they treat. For instance, if a terrorist attack causes 40 deaths, a rate of 0.5 percent, then a hospital will be forced to pay a fixed amount of $500,000 for treatment of the casualties.

While we know that the casualty distribution in hospitals has an impact on the treatment of casualties, we also assume that the hospital management changes the decision making process during a terrorist event in the hospital. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the casualty distribution on the treatment of the casualties when a hospital faces a serious terrorist attack. Specifically, we will examine whether the hospital is being used as effectively as it should be, and the factors leading to the allocation of casualties. We will also compare the pattern of casualties before and after the emergency in order to determine whether the casualty distributions in hospitals are changed by large scale terrorist attacks and if these changes continue or cease. We will also examine the correlation between the number of casualties and the distribution of injuries to determine whether there is a correlation between both and to predict future casualty distributions in hospitals faced with M",1
"Question: Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome? Answer: 

What is your opinion on the following? If you think it's worth reading it at all:

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is seen in about 20% of children with cancer requiring ICU admittance with a respiratory failure \[[@b1-anntransplant-23-284]\]. The mortality is between 30% and 60% \[[@b2-anntransplant-23-284]\]. It is a severe, life-threatening illness associated with high morbidity and long-term complications.

The pathogenesis of this syndrome in children with malignancy is complex. It seems to be multifactorial:

1.  \- Immune: severe illness, malnutrition, and infections with respiratory viruses may cause a hyperinflammatory reaction resulting in capillary endothelial damage with the following:

2.  \- Acute respiratory failure

3.  \- Alveolar epithelial oedema

4.  \- Acute lung injury with high morbidity and mortality.

The risk factors for developing ARDS in children are:

1.  \- Increased age

2.  \- Malignancy

3.  \- Infection

4.  \- Inotrope therapy

5.  \- Corticosteroids

Patients with cancer may be more susceptible to develop ARDS due to the following changes:

1.  \- Intravascular growth, with thrombosis or vascular narrowing

2.  \- Immune dysfuntion

3.  \- Malnutrition

Acute respiratory failure leading to ARDS can be classified into 2 syndromes:

1.  \- Nonseptic or viral induced ARDS

2.  \- Secondary to pulmonary metastases

ARDS after cytotoxic therapy for hematologic malignancies most commonly occurs after remission induction or consolidation therapy \[[@b3-anntransplant-23-284]\].

Some studies have identified ARDS as an important risk factor for reduced overall survival and an increased risk of secondary malignancy in pediatric patients receiving intensive therapy for acute myeloid leukemia \[[@b4-anntransplant-23-284]--[@b6-anntransplant-23-284]\].

There are no published, prospective, randomized studies to document the clinical significance of early recognition of ARDS and initiation of appropriate intervention.

In clinical practice, there are published guidelines to recognize the clinical signs of ARDS but there is no consensus about the management of the syndrome \[[@b7-anntransplant-23-284]\]. ARDS is usually associated with an increased use of organ support systems. This leads to increased resource utilization with no clear benefit in outcome. There are no publications on the impact of early management on outcome.

Most studies document mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients with either solid or hematologic malignancy. The mortality rate for all patients with malignancy has been reported to range from 37% to 53% \[[@b2-anntransplant-23-284]\].

One retrospective study from a single center had a higher survival than expected and suggested benefit from the early identification and subsequent initiation of lung-protective ventilation for patients with malignancy and hypoxemia \[[@b8-anntransplant-23-284]\].

The other retrospective study identified that early recognition of respiratory failure by respiratory therapists is of vital importance. This study showed beneficial change in management and improved outcome for patients \[[@b9-anntransplant-23-284]\]. To answer the Question, I suggest:

In children younger than 16 years with malignancy/metastatic tumor:

1.  A.  ARDS can be predicted and managed using lung protective strategies.

2.  B.  These patients can be treated early as there is no definitive impact on outcome.

3.  C.  However, there is no mortality benefit from the early management.

4.  D.  A large multicenter randomized controlled study is needed to examine this hypothesis.

"Question: Secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for significant health disparities? Answer:  Second-hand smoke risks in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for significant health disparities? (500 words, or fewer) You will have until Feb 3 to read to find the best ones.

 Children exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS) are more likely to be diagnosed with asthma and have altered respiratory and cardiac disease outcomes compared with children exposed to only household smoke. Little is known about how these respiratory and cardiovascular disease outcomes evolve over time following hospital discharge among children discharged from an NICU. We hypothesized that children discharged from an NICU would have significantly higher SHS exposures by age 8 months compared with baseline (when they were hospitalized for NICU care), and that respiratory illness would be the highest cause of hospital readmission. We assessed health status and exposure to SHS in children at age 8 months following hospital discharge from an NICU. A matched case-control design was employed to assess differences in clinical outcomes between children exposed (mean SHS exposure of >5 min/day) and not exposed (at least 10 min/day). Primary exposures were time since NICU discharge and SHS exposure. We found no difference in SHS exposures and respiratory outcomes. Infants exposed at 8 months had significantly higher odds for a history of hospital readmission, especially for respiratory illnesses. Children discharged from an NICU have higher odds of hospital readmission for respiratory illness by age 8 months compared with baseline, when they were still inpatients. Further study is needed to determine the temporal relationships among early NICU discharge, respiratory illness, and subsequent health outcomes at later ages.

Please respond to the following:

(a) What are the key findings from your study?

(b) What do these findings mean for NICU practice?

(c) What are the implications for medical or operational research?

(d) How will results be disseminated?

Please respond to the following:

(a) What are the key findings from your study?

Key findings

This retrospective cohort study suggests that infants discharged from an NICU who had higher exposures to SHS, both during and after their NICU stay, have increased odds of hospital readmission, especially for respiratory disease.

Nurses in our unit routinely screen families prior to hospital discharge, with a special focus on children who have been exposed to SHS while hospitalized. We recommend that health care providers should be actively involved and regularly ask families about their child’s environment, and about their own SHS exposures.

How can these findings improve the care of children and families?

This suggests that infants discharged from an NICU with higher exposures to SHS, both during and after their NICU stay, have increased odds of early hospital readmission for respiratory disease. If parents or caregivers are unable to protect their infants from SHS during and after hospitalization, early discharge may not necessarily improve their outcomes and should be critically evaluated in conjunction with medical and psychosocial issues.

Are there any safety concerns? What are appropriate precautions of this technique?

Although this is a retrospective cohort study, none of the studies used in this research were safety critical or involved the use of vulnerable individuals, children, or those with physical or mental health status issues. In fact, this research is the first study to investigate the impact of SHS exposures after NICU discharge on children’s health. This is a retrospective cohort study, which suggests a positive association, but does not definitively prove causation. Children discharged from an NICU were likely exposed to SHS both during and after their hospitalization and therefore increased the chances of early readmissions. Future studies with a pre-post design and a randomized controlled trial would be needed to definitively establish a cause-and-effect association.

What is the study's most important strength? Weakness?

This study was based on retrospective medical record review. This means that we collected data on study outcomes as documented in patients’ medical and administrative records. We had no direct measurement or verification of SHS exposures between admission to discharge and, hence, no data on the timing of exposures in the weeks following discharge. Therefore, we cannot know whether an early discharge resulted from SHS, the disease, or both. Furthermore, despite regular screening, we could not always tell whether parents were informed appropriately about reducing SHS exposures. We attempted to control for some of these differences using an intent-to-treat approach. However, further studies specifically designed to capture this important information are needed. Because this was a case-control study, we can’t be certain that the exposed group didn’t have other health issues (such as pre-existing chronic conditions or environmental exposures) that may have influenced readmission.

What were the potential limitations? How might it impact the generalizability?

"Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?

Question: The nomogram in Figure 3A and Figure 3C are of the worst possible quality. They don’t address specific risk factors, but instead rely on age, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and Gleason grade in predicting failure. A good example of how a nomogram (Figure 3B) is constructed would be an excellent start to this challenge.

Question: I am having a hard time believing an article is written this well for a journal I never heard of. The writing is clean, the references are easy to find, and the figures are very professional. Can you explain the story behind it? I suspect that the article has great potential but I need more details of how you came to the project.

Question: How do you know the nomogram in Figure 1 in reference 5 worked? Why isn’t it used in the real world and why is the nomogram in Figure 2 in reference 5 used in real practice where the nomogram in Figure 1 hasn’t been proven to work?

Question: Please refer to question 3. I have added more comments above to indicate why the first nomogram (in Figure 0 of reference 5) has better quality. (Also comment that there have been other methods, such as “the k-Nearest Neighbor method” and “the logistic curve method” to do this as well.)

Figure 0. (A) Figure 0 was not published. (B) Figure 0 was published in 2002 in Prostate 22: 755-767. A nomogram (shown) was created to predict the likelihood of BCR among 200 men (including 10 patients with metastases) within 5 years. The nomogram (top) is in close agreement with clinical decision making (bottom).

Figure 1. Is the nomogram (Figure 1) by “Cheng et al.” a good example of a nomogram? It is only nomogram to predict biochemical failure (BIF), and does not predict disease recurrence, disease specific death, life-expectancy, or organ-preservation, which are all important predictors of death and survival.

"Question: Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation? Answer:  Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation?

Methods

This case study was conducted in patients referred for management of chronic oro-facial pain in the Oro-maxillo-facial (OMFS) clinic at Nottingham NHS Healthcare, UK.

Results

Twelve subjects presenting with long-standing pain and/or a mechanical dysfunction (e.g. referred mechanical hypoesthesia [meshoma]); with the pain considered persistent and in a pre-treatment phase were included within the study. Four subjects had failed previous treatment, five had failed current treatment and three had no previous treatment but had been clinically monitored in a research setting and responded to treatment.

All cases (100%) had significant relief with the use of electrical current (current acupuncture) over a 12-week period, with the majority continuing to experience benefit a year after. Three of the four cases which failed treatment (two had received acupuncture and one had received a facial trigger point block) showed symptom relapse following discontinuing the therapy. The remaining eight cases without a previous history of acupuncture, demonstrated long-lasting benefit. The benefits were sustained and continued long after pain management had ceased, with the benefit in all cases lasting more than 16 months. This study was supported by a grant from the Nottingham Regional Health Authority.

Results

Long-lasting benefit from pain management has been observed in chronic oro-facial pain with a possible mechanistic basis in the brain. This pilot study suggests that current acupuncture is likely to have a place in the management of chronic oro-facial pain.

Question: Is it essential that both a patient and practitioner believe in the benefit of the therapy for the results to be effective

Methods

This case study was conducted on patients referred to the Oro-minimal-facial (OMFS) pain clinic from the University of Nottingham, UK. Eleven eligible chronic oro-facial pain sufferers who were referred to the pain clinic agreed to participate in the study. These consisted of the following: (1) facial pain syndromes and fibromyalgia (4 patients), (2) cranio-facial pain syndromes (2 patients), (3) post-traumatic pain syndromes (5 patients).

Results

All (11 patients) were referred because of significant discomfort associated with their pain syndromes and were receiving treatment from a number of other professions, including the Rheumatology Consultant and the Orthodontic/dental staff, or had been advised by their dentist or general dental practitioner to see an OMFS dentist. Pain (usually located mainly at the trigeminal face area and temporal area in response to a stimulus) of varying severity, together with a number of other features (i.e. localised tenderness, mechanical deficit, referred hypoesthesia (meshoma of the face and temple) and allodynia), was observed in these patients. Despite being treated in a number of different ways, by various disciplines and with varying medications, all symptoms persisted for a long time, in some cases up to three years.

The results of an acupuncture treatment series given to 11 patients, each treatment consisting of four treatments, three times a week for 12 weeks, are summarised below.

Results

It can be seen that the 11 patients had improved symptoms, some markedly, in several cases. The results of the treatment varied depending on which aspect of the syndrome was targeted at treatment, the most significant symptom improvement being in those patients who showed a response to the use of electrical current. The treatment also had a marked effect on patients with “trigger points”, a feature characterised by the presence of pain, allodynia and referred hypoesthesia when a trigger point was stimulated.

Question: Is it essential that a facial pain patient has two or more chronic pain-related somatic symptoms, in addition to the main oro-facial symptom which is the focus of the pain clinic

Methods

This case study was conducted in patients referred to the Oro-minimal-facial (OMFS) pain clinic from the Nottingham University Hospitals (UH). Thirty patients referred to the OMFS clinic from January to August 2000, with a diagnosis of chronic oro-facial pain, which was felt to be central in origin, were eligible for the study. An additional group of 8 patients were referred following an initial assessment with the OMFS Pain Clinic. The patients referred following an initial assessment were asked to participate in the study if and when treatment of the main symptom (pain) failed.

Twelve patients were included in the study, 10 were female and two were male. All patients were referred mainly because of their facial pain, eight patients also had a variety of other chronic",1
"Question: Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent? Answer:  Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent?

Answer: Visual loss can be permanent depending on when treatment is instituted.

References: (1), (2), (3)

Aims and Questions

1. When can visual impairment be said to be permanent?

Many experts in the field believe that amblyopia is permanent if there has been no or suboptimal treatment for it, but the following criteria are used to determine whether a particular case of visual dysfunction is permanent:

There has been no or suboptimal treatment.

The patient is now stable. (There is likely to be variability in the patient’s condition depending on other factors such as the degree of strabismus and its magnitude, which may be influenced by other factors such as how well the ocular alignment is corrected by the corrective lenses and treatment (particularly with patching), and whether they have worn their lenses continuously at night for the required duration of the treatment, which would not be known unless they have regular follow up examinations from their optometrist or specialist. If an ocular alignment is poorly corrected it can, and often does, become worse as the patient wears their lenses with their glasses and/or contact lenses, and is therefore stable.)

The underlying cause of the vision alteration has not been corrected, or may need ongoing treatment such as patching, in order to maintain the existing condition, or prevent further deterioration of the condition (such as, for example, when strabismus is corrected and maintained over the long term).

If a treatment that is not associated with the permanent loss of vision in the affected eye is instituted in cases of amblyopia, and that treatment is still effective in producing an improvement in vision in the affected eye, a subsequent examination of the visual functions of the eye reveals that the condition is stable.

If the treatment prescribed to treat a child’s amblyopia has not been effective in restoring vision, in some cases it could be necessary to determine whether there are physiological or developmental factors that may play a part in explaining the visual impairment and that if these factors are corrected, there might be a reduction in the severity of the vision impairment.

3. What are the long-term visual complications secondary to amblyopia?

The main complications for adults with amblyopia include:

Diplopia and convergence insufficiency which can affect binocular vision.

Visual field limitations, affecting the use of the ‘visual field’ such as with strabismus, refractive errors affecting central acuity (eg, anisometropia), cataracts and opacities which may affect the eye at any stage in life and therefore make the visual functions even more difficult to test and monitor; and

There are also potentially debilitating effects on mental health, such as with depression and anxiety, and on social interaction, such as with social phobia. Many adults with amblyopia do not realize that they have a visual disturbance until they have been identified initially by an optometrist or ophthalmologist or other eye health professional and are referred to an ophthalmologist for a thorough eye examination at which time the diagnosis of amblyopia is typically made. If not treated early, amblyopia can lead to the problems listed above. Patients with persistent amblyopia, either unilateral or bilateral, are the second most common referral to an ophthalmologist in children and adults.

What is known

When amblyopia occurs in children, it has a number of potential long-term consequences. Some of these will be permanent, and others are likely to be either transient or progressive.

1. Vision impairment, due to amblyopia, can be either present at birth (crowded form of amblyopia) or develop later on (uncrowded form of amblyopia). It is important for the vision of children with amblyopia (and other visual conditions) to be monitored so that any long-term vision problems can be detected early. A high prevalence of children with amblyopia appears to be associated with several environmental or genetic factors.

2. Children with amblyopia often experience developmental problems, such as with learning and motor skills, due to the associated vision impairment. This is an area which needs further research. This condition may have a significant impact on an individual’s physical and social wellbeing, particularly in children who struggle with academic performance from which their peers may not notice their visual difficulties.

3. Children with amblyopia have an increased risk for learning and social problems compared to their peers. These problems may not manifest themselves in adolescence if treatment is appropriately instituted in childhood.

4. Children with amblyopia may be at greater risk for developing psychiatric problems such as anxiety, depression and a low self-esteem, as well as for the",1

"Question: Does HER2 immunoreactivity provide prognostic information in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy? Answer: Does HER2 immunoreactivity provide prognostic information in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy?

Background {#Sec1}
==========

Despite the development of several treatment modalities, including surgery, intravesical chemotherapy, radiation and systemic chemotherapy, overall treatment outcomes for locally advanced bladder cancer (BC) remain poor because of high rates of relapse and metastasis.

In this regard, the HER2 gene is known to be amplified in approximately 20 to 25% of BC, and has an established role as an oncogene in the progression of urothelial bladder cancer (UBC), although the exact mechanism is unclear \[[@CR1]\]. Moreover, the HER2 gene has been shown to be associated with aggressive disease and survival outcomes in some molecular subtypes of BC. Among the BC molecular classifications, HER2 overexpression is present in approximately 15%--50% of genomically classified urothelial carcinomas \[[@CR2]\]. The HER2-negative and positive tumors also showed a significant difference in cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group. Moreover, patients with HER2-negative tumors tend to gain longer overall survival (OS) than those with HER2-positive tumors \[[@CR3]\].

Molecular targeted therapy using trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of HER2 and blocks the tyrosine kinase domain, is a new and promising treatment modality for patients with BC. Neoadjuvant randomized trials have shown that trastuzumab is effective in patients with HER2-amplified BC (pN+/HER2+) and pT4 BC \[[@CR4], [@CR5]\].

The authors attempted to evaluate the role of HER2 overexpression as a predictive biomarker in patients who underwent neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (M-VEC) for the treatment of invasive urothelial BC using the FISH-uTumor assay and analyzed its prognostic role in cases of advanced urothelial BC.

Methods {#Sec2}
=======

The present study was conducted using the medical records and surgical specimens of patients with an invasive disease. Patient records were reviewed retrospectively. For the inclusion criteria patients, tumor tissue was required from a diagnostic biopsy specimen taken before treatment, FISH for HER2/neu amplification, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for HER2 expression. HER2 positivity was defined as a strong (3+) IHC staining based on current recommendations \[[@CR6], [@CR7]\].

The clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated by transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) or cystectomy 4--8 weeks after discontinuation of chemotherapy and the surgical specimen as well as the pathology report were reviewed.

HER2 status was evaluated using the FISH-uTumor assay. After a urothelial carcinoma was diagnosed on a TURBT case, the region with the highest number of cancer cells (cancer island) was selected for analysis after marking the area with a skin marker. Genomic DNA was extracted under the guidance of the manufacturer's protocol, and the assay was performed with fluorescence in situ hybridization using the PathVysion HER2/CEN-17 probe and a Spectral Imaging DAKO fluorescence microscope (CK2600) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The presence of a HER2/CEN-17 ratio of at least 2.0 was defined as HER2 amplification and interpreted as positive for positivity. FISH-negative tumors were defined as tumors with HER2/CEN-17 ratios within the normal range (1.2--1.5) \[[@CR8]\].

The clinical and survival outcomes were recorded at follow-up. Follow-up examinations were performed approximately every 3 months in the first 2 years, followed by semi-annual examinations thereafter. CSS rate was defined as the time from neoadjuvant chemotherapy to clinical stage progression to either local recurrence or distant metastasis or bladder cancer-related death. DFS was defined as the time from neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the disease recurrence. Patients underwent cystectomy at least once during the follow-up period or were treated with M-VEC (Vacicyte) up to the time of data censorship. Tumors recurring in the neoadjuvant treatment area were treated with",1
"Question: Is halofantrine ototoxic? Answer:  Is halofantrine ototoxic?

A:

Summary:
For example (as in the Wikipedia article), if you're treated for one month with 15mg per kg or more, you can suffer permanent side effects. A small study indicated that the compound is toxic towards the inner ear cells -- something which seems to have caused a great deal of the hearing problems in people that had been treated during a cholera epidemic in London in 1852.
However, this is all speculative. There are several different possible mechanisms (including the formation of a metabolite) that may be responsible, but the precise mechanism has not been established and is not well understood.
Background:

First hearing, the sensory organ that distinguishes tone sounds and speech in humans (Hochberg, 1993). Hearing is one of our first senses that is involved in the regulation of other activities (e.g. sleep) and in this respect is a key factor for normal maturation of the brain. The study of the basic functions of the inner ear is difficult because of the complexity of the inner ear structure and the lack of a good mammalian model. In spite, studies of inner ear morphology and function have revealed major contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for sensorineural hearing loss.
Ototoxicity.
[...]
The ototoxicity of many drugs in adults is well established (Zhou and Zhang, 2008). Many drugs and chemicals can enter the auditory structures of the inner ear in varying degrees when they are given systemically. These toxins may be ototoxic due to a toxic metabolite or through another physiological mechanism. One such metabolite has been a primary contributor to the ototoxic properties of chlorpromazine

"Question: Visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level: can it represent visceral adipose tissue volume? Answer:  ""What is the relationship between the area of a measured level of visceral adipose tissue and the volume of visceral adipose tissue at different levels?""
(Abstracts of studies about measuring visceral adipose tissue area vs. visceral adipose tissue volume to demonstrate/prove the relationship)

 To determine whether measurement of visceral adipose tissue at the L4 vertebra can be used to represent the volume of visceral adipose tissue. The authors hypothesized that if there is a relationship between measurement of visceral adipose tissue at the L4 vertebra and volume of visceral adipose tissue measured at a different level in the abdomen, an agreement between the measurements at the L4 vertebra and the measurements in the different abdominal regions would be expected. Inclusion criteria were as follows: women with and without hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 115 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 75 mm Hg), obesity (≥ 30 kg/m²), overweight, and age between 20 and 80 years. After exclusion of subjects with diabetes, hepatic or renal dysfunction, morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] and weight in the highest quartile), cancer, and previous surgical procedures involving the abdomen, visceral adipose tissue at L4 vertebra and different compartments of the abdomen were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Visceral adipose tissue area at the L4 vertebra was significantly associated with visceral adipose tissue area measured at four abdominal regions (L2-L5 and umbilicus, waist circumference [WC] and/or waist-to-hip ratio [WHR], and total body fat [TBF]), with the greatest correlation for visceral adipose tissue area measured at the L2-L5 region. Visceral adipose tissue area at L4 also corresponded strongly with visceral adipose tissue area in the four abdominal regions, and this correlation was stronger than for visceral adipose tissue area measured at L2-L5. There was a significant association between visceral adipose tissue area at L4 and visceral adipose tissue volume measured at the four abdominal regions, with the weakest relationship for the L2-L5 region, also indicating a stronger relationship with the measurements of body fat mass and waist circumference. Visceral adipose tissue area measured over the L4 vertebra can be used to estimate the volume of visceral adipose tissue between the L2 and the L5 regions, but not at other sites of abdominal accumulation of visceral adipose tissue.

Full Text:Introduction

Overweight, defined as a BMI of 25-35 kg/m², and obesity, defined as a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², have been associated with an increased risk of several cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.1,2 To detect overweight and obesity earlier and more easily, new criteria and indices are being proposed.3,4 Recently, the International Society for the Advancement of Medicine (ISAM) proposed five obesity criteria in its Obesity Task Force (OTF) criteria for the diagnosis of obesity.3 All five criteria, including L3-L4 or L4-L5 spine-to-femoral length ratio, must be below the fifth percentile.3 This is in contrast with the criterion that defines over 10% of excess weight as being overweight in which case a ratio above the 90th percentile must be fulfilled.3 When a definition solely based on the L4-L5 ratio (with or without correction for height) was applied, the criteria for the diagnosis of obesity were fulfilled by 7.4% of the women and 4.0% of the men in the study sample.3

The importance of having appropriate cut-off values when defining obesity is highlighted by the fact that the sensitivity and specificity of a waist circumference (WC) ≥ 102 cm to predict the metabolic syndrome and abdominal obesity may not be optimal, when using the criteria proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Society for the Study of Diabetes (ESC).3,6,7 A better performance is suggested by the ISAM criterion (L3-L4 or L4-L5 ratio).3 Nevertheless, measurement of WC and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is still widely used to define abdominal obesity but requires manual measurements that can pose problems.7,8 New indices that are more practical and easier to measure have been proposed.7

Recently, López et al. reported on a simple method using three variables to define obesity.7 This method, which included measuring WC and spine-to-femoral bone ratio (SFBR), has been applied in the majority of recent population studies and has been shown to have a high sensitivity and specificity to define obesity.9 In most studies the L4-L",1
"Question: Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy? Answer:  Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy?

ANSWER: Thank you for your question. There is now some evidence that hyperbaric oxygenation therapy is effective for the treatment of the rapidly spreading necrotizing fasciitis. Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy is the only treatment proven effective in three large clinical trials against the deadly disease. The trials have been published in the Journal of Trauma, Acute Care Surgery and the Annals of Emergency Medicine.

There is evidence of the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygenator therapy in a randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted in 2005 where patients with rapidly progressing necrotizing fasciitis were randomly assigned to standard therapy (placebo) or hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The researchers found better outcomes with hyperbaric oxygen when given in the first 72 hours of hospitalization and during the first 72 hours of standard treatment.

In one of the earlier randomized trials from 2001, researchers found hyperbaric oxygen therapy helped patients with necrotizing fasciitis have greater survival rate.

There is also published evidence from the National Center for Biotechnology Information that suggests that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be more effective in patients whose wounds were contaminated or have no known source of infection. And hyperbaric oxygen therapy does not appear to cause more harm than standard treatment. Finally, the evidence suggests hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be administered without requiring surgery.

The best evidence for using hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis comes from a large, randomized, controlled trial from 2001 that studied 442 patients who had wounds that were contaminated or showed no evidence of infection. It concluded patients with necrotizing fasciitis who received hyperbaric oxygen therapy were able to go home sooner than other patients. Hyperbaric oxygen reduced the number of deaths and complications for patients hospitalized for necrotizing fasciitis.

While it makes sense to use hyperbaric oxygen to treat a potentially grave and deadly condition, one must balance treatment with potential harms and the cost.

The treatment is well tolerated, has few side effects and does not cause additional harm. At this stage, the evidence provides sufficient reason to consider hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an important therapy in treating patients with necrotizing fasciitis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy shows promise and offers many potential benefits.

QUESTION:
A 30-year-old healthy woman, gravida 5 para 0, with no family history of pre- or trabal pregnancy, has been having irregular menstruations for two years and has been increasingly worried. Her menstrual periods range from 10 to 14 days with a light period that ends in six days of amenorrhea. She had a cycle at 27 weeks and had bleeding, but she received no prenatal care from then until her spontaneous labor and delivery. She has had two normal, spontaneous vaginal deliveries, the first one by vacuum extraction at 28 weeks and the second one without any further intervention by a midwife or other professional. The child was 9.5 kg and had no anomalies and an APGAR was 8/9. She had vaginal bleeding after the labor and after vaginal delivery of a 4.5-kg, healthy neonate with no anomalies after an uneventful pregnancy. She was discharged on day seven after the spontaneous, vaginal delivery, but returned to the hospital six days later with a fever of 38 degrees C for approximately 48 hours. She has a diagnosis of urinary tract infection with symptoms of vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her last menstrual period was at 32 weeks with heavy vaginal bleeding. She also reports an episode of vaginal bleeding at 30 weeks. The cervix was not visualized within 30 minutes of pushing with a digital examination. She has not had a pelvic examination in the last three years. At admission, she complained of generalized abdominal pain with radiation to the pelvis. She has no vaginal bleeding, no abdominal pain or distention, and has not had fevers during the last ten days. On examination, she was awake, alert, afebrile, with no signs of peritonitis, and well-developed, healthy female newborn (weight 3.2 kg) with no respiratory distress, no skin lacerations or evidence of jaundice, no umbilical abnormalities, and no anemia. The head is vertex and the rest of the examination is normal.

Is a cesarean section indicated? Can you provide the indications for a cesarean section under these circumstances?

ANSWER:
There were no maternal infections or pregnancy complications to indicate a need for early cesarean delivery. A vaginal breech delivery can be performed safely if done within three hours of an intact membranes. Most vaginal breech deliveries are done without any maternal complications",1

"Question: Is a mandatory general surgery rotation necessary in the surgical clerkship? Answer:  Is a mandatory general surgery rotation necessary in the surgical clerkship? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question. Answer: No. The surgical clerkship is not a mandatory general surgery rotation. Many programs offer limited electives in surgery. One may also be able to opt-out of the surgery rotation. I would certainly encourage programs that do offer it to have a general surgery rotation as a required clerkship rather than being optional. A mandatory option would allow more time for a surgery rotation and would allow for a better understanding of the surgical patient. With greater time spent in general surgery, residents would learn more, would be more confident, and would be more eager to learn the surgical skills of laparoscopy, endoscopy, and advanced endoscopy.

We have been able to successfully perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy without the benefit of laparoscopic expertise, even in the most inexperienced surgical fellows. This has been our experience in more than 100 laparoscopic cholecystectomies since the summer of 1991. Our approach can be summarized in the following manner. The patient is positioned supine with a small left lower quadrant (LLQ) incision using a Veress needle in place rather than a standard laparoscopic ""Hass"" abdominal trocar and carbon dioxide insufflation. After the Veress needle is inserted, the abdominal wall is grasped using a Maryland forceps by the left hand of the operating surgeon. Using a right-handed Veress needle holder with the sharp extremity on the patient's left, the needle holder is positioned with the blunt end into the patient's right lower abdomen over the epigastric region and over the site of the cystic duct and cystic artery, which should be punctured. With the needle holder placed, the needle holder is removed from the Veress needle and inserted into the cystic duct and cystic artery approximately 5 cm from the incision in the epigastric wall. With the needle removed, the blunt extremity of the Veress needle is then placed into the patient's lower right abdomen and used to penetrate the fascia and musculature of the rectus abdominis muscle down to the peritoneum. The operator is positioned so that the liver is lifted using a Maryland forceps by the left hand of the operator, and in this position the operator can more adequately reach the anatomy and identify the cystic duct and cystic artery. The gallbladder can be visualized in relation to the cystic duct and cystic artery, and it is often possible to identify the cystic duct without resorting to biliary scintigraphy or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). After visualizing the anatomy, a laparoscopic stapling device is placed into each of the cystic duct and cystic artery and the peritoneum is closed with running sutures until the abdomen is closed. The laparoscope is withdrawn and the abdominal wall is reapproximated with interrupted absorbable sutures. Subsequently suture placement can be carried out in the same manner as in an open cholecystectomy. The gallbladder bed can be prepared for cholecystectomy by applying small pieces of Surgicel and placing large pieces of CMC on it if needed in anticipation of bile spillage. After cholecystectomy is completed, the abdominal wall is repaired with interrupted absorbable sutures.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely by trainees under the close and ongoing supervision of an experienced operative surgeon. With the experience of a surgeon with more than 200 laparoscopies under his or her belt (and who performs only a limited number of those cases on a monthly basis), the trainee should be able to complete at least 20 cases before becoming ""independent."" There are no anatomic or surgical landmarks that should interfere with a successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A large LLQ incision in the skin with a small left lower quadrant surgical incision will provide adequate exposure for an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The major anatomic risk associated with a LLQ incision in cholecystectomy relates to the left common hepatic artery and left inferior phrenic artery, which lie at the lateral aspect of the left liver lobe. The risk of injury to these vital structures may be minimized by retracting the liver with Maryland forceps during the insertion of the Veress needle, and by having the abdominal wall grasped only with one hand rather than two. One risk of bile duct injury relates to the proximity of the cystic duct to the cystic artery. This risk is minimized by having the cystic duct punctured with a Veress needle in an area anterior to the cystic artery. This is a safer alternative to first puncturing the cy",1

1. Voice and acupunctureThe relationship of phono traumatically induced vocal cord dysfunction to acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medical practice, was first investigated in 1966. According to the TCM, acupuncture is used to release a disease and restore health. Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is an example of the application of acupuncture medicine by ancient and modern Chinese physicians. Currently the literature shows that acupuncture is effective in improving vocal cord vibration [@b38--0030]. One of the earliest Western studies was described by Strahler [@b39], who found that auricular acupuncture can reduce the intensity of dyspnea and asthmatic symptoms. Many clinical research studies further reported that acupuncture is useful for treating a variety of different types of disorders of voice and voice physiology [@b40]--[@b42]. It improved the function of vocal cords, making it easier for a vocalist to sing at a high level and reducing fatigue and tension [@b43]. These studies showed that the improvement seen by patients who were treated by acupuncture has been associated with some physiological changes, including changes in the muscle tone and electrical activity of the vocal fold mucosa.

2. Objective evaluation of the voiceThe treatment of patients with voice disorders is very complicated, because objective voice measurements are indispensable to the voice rehabilitation process. There are many methods that are used for the treatment of the voice disorders, but they are still in the experimental stage. Objective voice measures of vocal performance are important not only for treatment, but also for determining the severity of the patient's condition. Acupuncture treatment appears to have positive effects on changes in the electrical activity of the mucosa of the larynx and improves the ability to sustain a phonation in these individuals. Many studies have suggested that acupuncture can improve and maintain the function of the oral and laryngeal tissues.

Voice disorders are a common issue that affects daily life [@b44]. According to studies, the most common problem experienced by patients who have voice disorders is difficulty with speaking [@b45]. The cause of voice disorders is a very complicated and controversial one. Currently no satisfactory treatment exists for the majority of voice disorders, which causes great stress for the patients who suffer from them. The treatment options are a combination of voice therapy, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy and surgical intervention. Treatment methods may vary according to the type of the voice complaint. Acupuncture offers an attractive new addition to this repertoire of treatments. Its efficacy appears clearly justified by the scientific facts. It has shown benefits for the patients suffering from voice disorders. Most patients find that acupuncture is an effective, nonpharmacologic treatment. It does not result in side effects, except for local reactions at the points used. For this reason, the use of acupuncture is considered to be safe, and there have been no reports of the adverse effects.

3. The concept of voice therapyMany voice therapists consider the quality of the voice to be essential to overall health. It has been estimated that an important part of the care of voice patients focuses on teaching patients how to better communicate and avoid the damaging effects of their illnesses. The most important areas of a voice patient's therapy include diet, swallowing, speech, language, and psychology. Voice therapy emphasizes a holistic approach. The fundamental premise for this discipline is that the entire person is involved. In fact, the therapeutic strategies are more likely to benefit the whole person when applied to the individual patient. Voice therapy aims to improve the symptoms, vocal quality, and the ability to communicate freely with the patient and family. The patient/client needs to understand, accept, and follow",1
"Question: Is aneurysm repair justified for the patients aged 80 or older after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage? Answer:  Is aneurysm repair justified for the patients aged 80 or older?

Aneurysm in 80s
==============

Aneurysms commonly occur in the cerebral arteries (80-85%)^[@B1]-[@B3]^, and when untreated they can cause cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage^[@B2],[@B4],[@B5]^. Some studies have shown that the risk of intracranial hemorrhage after aneurysm rupture is significantly higher in the elderly^[@B6]-[@B9]^. Moreover, the incidence of cerebral vasospasm is increased in the elderly^[@B10]-[@B15]^. In elderly patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or poor neurological conditions, surgery with microsurgical clipping may be too risky because of underlying diseases, and surgery with endovascular embolization and stent-assisted angioplasty with or without clipping may be insufficient for large aneurysms^[@B16],[@B17]^. However, few reports have investigated the outcomes of endovascular treatment (EVT) for the aged, and their outcomes are quite different to those of younger patients^[@B18]-[@B22]^. The purpose of the present review of these reports was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of EVT in patients aged 80 or more. First, we performed searches using PubMed, and included 11 retrospective studies from 1988 to 2009 that were matched in terms of age (\<80 or ≥80 years old). The outcome of aneurysm treatment in the aged was evaluated in terms of the rate of aneurysm complete occlusion on angiography (CROC) and clinical outcome. An analysis of these reports was performed to determine (1) which factors associated with endovascular treatment for ruptured aneurysms in the aged and (2) the effectiveness of EVT in the aged. Second, another 16 (16-25.8%) studies from 2010 to 2015 were included in this review. The outcome of EVT was compared among three age groups (80 plus years old, 70-79 years old, and \<70 years old) according to the age. These articles mainly included large case series with low methodological quality, but some retrospective studies reported very encouraging results. The purpose of this review was to show the safety and effectiveness of endovascular technology for unruptured aneurysms in the aged. The rate of EVT is increasing worldwide^[@B23]^. To further clarify the safety and effectiveness of EVT in the aged with SAH or poor neurological conditions, a higher quality prospective study with a multicenter design is needed.

Neurological status on admission
================================

Before EVT, patients older than 80 years had a lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission than younger patients ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=""table""}). There was no significant difference in Hunt and Hess grade between patients older and younger than 80 years, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was significantly worse in older patients. Among patients older than 80 years, only one patient had vasospasm, but it was severe (GCS 3-4) and developed on day 11 after SAH.

Outcome of endovascular treatment in the aged
=============================================

In patients older than 80 years, the rate of CROC was 75.4%, and mortality before discharge was 24.6% ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=""table""}). In the aged, as-a-rule, EVT is safe and effective. When performing emergency EVT, the rate of CROC had decreased in patients older than 80 years between 1988 and 2009, while mortality of EVT had increased (from 34.5% to 52.0%) ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=""table""}).

The outcome of EVT in the aged according to the age (\<80 years and ≥80 years), period (1988-2009) and risk factors (patients who were not treated in 1988 and patients who had poor neurological condition)

### EVT in the aged according to the age (\<80 years and ≥80 years)

During the two eras, an analysis was performed according to age (80 plus years, and \<80 years). In 1988-2002, all patients with EVT were aged \<80 years and there was higher CROC and lower mortality in the aged than in the younger patients in the both eras ^[@B24]^([Figure 1](",1

"Question: Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring? Answer:  Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring? (maximum 4,000 words, double-spaced using Times Roman 12-pt). Read and understand the following papers available on this website: http://pollen.udel.edu/pollen/index.html. Analyze and interpret the literature references cited in the papers. Be sure to fully understand the article before submitting.

Aerobiologists need to better understand and use the information that will be obtained by the more intensive pollen samplings. Specifically, aerobiologists should include the sampling design into the pollen forecasting process, be able to recognize errors and biases that will occur, and communicate pollen information in ways that help to resolve the public health dilemma.

INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

Most allergenic pollens have a relatively short duration of viable seed. The period of peak pollen release and pollination varies daily and annually, and is also known to vary with seasons. Typically, pollination is highest when the period of high temperature is beginning and lasts a few hours or days. Then, pollen will fall, and a significant population can remain for about 1 wk to 2 wk after the initial peak. The pollen grains continue to germinate in the soil. While there is some variation in specific times and days of pollen release (1), several general guidelines can be offered. The duration for a pollen type to remain effective ranges from 1 to 30 days or, for a few pollen types, less than 7 days. Pollens can remain viable for several days after falling from the plant. The number of viable pollens in the air is relatively small and will probably drop very fast within 24 hours of the pollination. The wind speed may have some influence on the rate of pollen loss, but it is not certain whether pollen loss rates differ significantly during light or heavy winds.1-3 If air and precipitation samples are collected and pollen grains are identified to subspecies level, the viability of most pollen may be determined within a day to two after the pollination. However, pollen grains often retain their viability longer.1,4

Although there have been several efforts to forecast the occurrence and duration of pollen release, forecasts based on atmospheric data alone have not been accurate and may not provide useful information for human health.5-12 The pollen counts at most forecasting sites have consistently overestimated total pollen concentrations and the probability of high pollen concentrations in spring and early summer.5-8 Other efforts have tried to combine pollen data with meteorological data, including temperature and pressure. A number of forecasting algorithms, including the European Forest Service’s “AERONET-HEPPO” have predicted pollen concentrations more accurately than other methods; however, this success has largely been from the use of advanced computer models including sophisticated meteorological data inputs.6-11

These weather forecasting efforts have improved through the use of pollen counts; however, a number of other factors may have an important bearing on whether or to what degree this information can be used. While there have been many attempts to quantify the health risk from airborne particles,11-15 few studies have attempted to quantify an allergenic component of that risk. These are summarized here.

Cells of Pollen Grains

The cells of airborne pollen grains have been quantified indirectly through the use of a viability stain, which stains cells red for microscopic observation.16,17 These cell counts have been used as a measure of the total pollen grain concentration and can also be used for determining plant families and pollen sources, which can be determined by examining the stained spores.18,19,20 The information obtained is indirect and pollen grains may be “masked” by plant species that have similar pollen grains, or the information could be masked by other pollen types.

In the case of pollen allergies, many asthmatic patients have developed an immune response to pollen extracts, possibly as an effect of the patient’s own immune response.21 A number of skin tests have been used for the in vivo evaluation of the immune response that develops.21-24

Skin reaction sizes have been classified by many allergists through the use of the Wheal, Flare and Urticaria Efficacy score system (WEFS).21,25-27 The reaction to the skin test correlates with the level of the immune response of the patient to pollen and could be used as an index of allergic response rather than a measure of allergenicity.21-25 In fact, the skin test has been reported to be a better means of testing for allergies than total pollen counts or pollen spectra because of the greater patient information obtained.24,25-27 Thus far, most research has focused on the evaluation of pollen extracts, not whole pollen.

"Question: Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer? Answer: 

Answer: It does not play a crucial role due to the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and negative predictive value.^[@r1]^ FDG-PET has the best sensitivity (100%), while MRI has the best specificity (96.2%) in the detection of cervical cancer. This is in agreement with the literature.^[@r2]^

Answer: The authors have used the terms ""biological and clinical significance"" to define the difference between the performance of FDG-PET and MRI. While referring to the ""biological significance"" in the title of their study, they have quoted another study for the first two concepts on the left-hand side of the Figure - namely, the ""biological"" and ""pathological"" ([Figure 1](#f1){ref-type=""fig""}). However, they have not mentioned the ""clinical"" and ""diagnostic"" meaning of biological significance.^9^ The ""biological and clinical significance"" of FDG-PET is to show the superiority of a modality over another one in terms of ""biological"" (metabolic) or ""clinically"" (tumoral) aspects (biological imaging).^[@r1],[@r2]^ The ""biological"" aspects of cancer imaging are classified into metabolic, proliferative and receptor imaging. While referring to the ""pathological"" aspects, they have given the term ""pathological"" instead of ""clinically significant"". The ""clinically significant"" term refers to the changes in anatomical structures, which are associated with histopathological changes by using pathological modality.^[@r1]^ These changes are not seen in the biopsy specimen of the cervix (the gold standard modality). However, these changes can be observed on contrast-enhanced CTs, MRI and PET-CT images.^[@r3]^ Hence, the ""biological"" and ""clinical"" significance can be considered equivalent.

Figure 1Difference between the performance of FDG-PET and MRI.^[@r3]^ FDG-PET = fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging.

Answer: After the first mention of the authors, FDG - PET is mentioned for the first time in the middle of the paragraph right above ""Figure 1 of the Abstract"" section. Here we would request the authors to change the location as ""Figure 2 of the Abstract"" due to the above reason.

Question: How has the PET/CT compared with MRI in terms of sensitivity in the diagnosis of cervical cancer?

Answer: It does not correlate with the sensitivity results reported in the literature.^[@r1],[@r4],[@r5]^ However, the superiority of PET/CT over conventional imaging modalities, especially MRI, in the head and neck region was reported. For example, in our study, we found a sensitivity of 97.2% in comparison to 61.3% for MRI. It was also superior to MRI in the evaluation of the cervical lymph node involvement.^[@r1],[@r4]^

Answer: In this case, the authors had referred to the Figure 2 in the beginning of the Discussion section. However, they have taken the words ""sensitivity and the positive predictive"" values, which are related to pathological results rather than sensitivity, in the first paragraph of the Methods section. Hence, this should be changed as mentioned above.

Question: Why has the performance of ""other PET tracers"" not been analyzed in the comparison study? Are all the cervical cancers positive in such tracers?

Answer: In our institution, FDG - PET is performed for most of the patients due to its affordability and availability. Therefore, the usage of other tracers is not sufficient. However, there should be a separate research group to perform this study, as ""other PET tracers"" is mentioned as a research objective in the title.

Answer: This study was presented in the European Society of Echocardiography meeting 2018 May.^[@r6]^

Question: In a related article, authors have stated that it was not an independent study. However, the same study was cited in these two articles. It is very important to cite the previous findings of your study. As a matter of fact, authors do not have the details of previous study. Any more details about methodology of that study would be welcomed, as this question will be more clearly understood.^[@r7]^

Answer: This is a review article involving previous findings. However, the study did not involve previous findings. Therefore, this can not be considered as a study using our current knowledge. Hence, this is a review article.",1
"Question: Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis? Answer:  Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question.

Answer: Advanced surface ablation (ASA) versus sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (S-BK) for the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of the cornea are analyzed. After ASA, the corneal deformation increases, and the cornea is stretched from anterior to posterior. The anterior epithelium is partially removed following ASA, and the epithelial wound healing is delayed. In contrast, although the deformation and the stretching also occurs in S-BK, the epithelium is almost not removed. No signs of tissue atrophy are observed under the Bowman's layer after S-BK. The epithelial wound healing is also delayed. However, the cornea is not deformed in S-BK. According to the results, the biomechanical damage of the cornea after ASA and S-BK is different.

Question: What is your opinion with respect to the use of the wavefront system in the treatment of myopia? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question ""What is your opinion with respect to the use of the wavefront system in the treatment of myopia?

Answer: Wavefront vision-correction surgery was recently introduced to correct myopia or hyperopia. There are several benefits of WFS surgery, and the main ones are the better prediction of the effective monochromatic point of corneal ablation (Pupil-Sparing technology), the reduction of the ablation zones, and the higher stability of the treatment. Therefore, the WFS approach is useful for the correction of myopia or to treat myopia following radial keratotomy. Further studies will be necessary for its widespread clinical application. According to the results of the present studies, WFS surgery is also effective in myopia treatment.

Question: What are the possible complications of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and LASER keratectomy for the treatment of myopia? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question.

Answer: After PRK, the stromal bed tends to thin. Thus, in myopia cases treated by PRK, the thickness of the residual stroma was lower than that in the cases treated by LASER. Therefore, after PRK, the cornea became weak and prone to postoperative erosions and complications such as de-epithelialization and haze occurred. After LASER, the wound size and ablation area were much smaller than those in cases treated by PRK. Thus, after LASER, the cornea became stronger and scar formation was less. In cases treated by LASER, the scarring was not observed. The possible complications are summarized, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Possible complications of PRK and LASER therapy for myopia

Question: Describe the visual outcomes obtained and complications observed with each of the laser refractive methods currently used for myopia or hyperopia treatment. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question.

Answer: PRK is a well-established myopia therapy which has proved to be effective and has relatively low complication rates. Currently, PRK is considered to be the gold standard surgical treatment. LASER is the newest surgery for the correction of myopia and hyperopia. Currently, it is under active experimental phase testing in South Korea. In hyperopia patients, LASER is useful, when the target refraction is achieved within ±0.5 D. In myopia cases, the treatment with the target refraction of -3.00 D or more showed excellent clinical results with the complication rates similar to those obtained with the conventional PRK. The treatment with the target refraction of less than -3.00 D shows unfavorable results.

Question: Which laser has the best safety and efficacy for the treatment of myopia? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question.

Answer: The LASER is an effective laser treatment for myopia, especially LASER-assisted in situ keratomalysis (LASEK) and LASER-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK), but it may be associated with increased risk for haze and haze. Currently, it is under active study phase in South Korea. PRK and LASEK are more popular refractive laser treatments for my",1
"Question: Does radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer affect prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer? Answer:  Does radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer affect prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer?

Pelvic exenteration (PE) for recurrent rectal cancer (RRC) represents a major surgical challenge in modern oncologic care. The results of PE have been reported as excellent by many research groups, especially when the initial treatment had been radical resection \[[@B1],[@B2]\]. However, the data are scarce regarding radiotherapy prior to surgery in RRC.

The optimal time for preoperative radiotherapy in metastatic RRC is unclear, because few trials have been conducted in this setting. The available data indicate that preoperative radiotherapy (PRT)-alone is superior to surgery with postoperative radiotherapy in terms of local control and overall survival (OS) \[[@B3]-[@B7]\]. Other studies, however, also presented data that were not statistically significant \[[@B8]-[@B12]\], while the studies that investigated PRT were inconclusive \[[@B13]\].

This study was designed to evaluate the impact of PRT on the outcome of PE in RRC.

Materials and methods
=====================

Study patients
--------------

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all PE procedures that were performed between 1993 and 2003 at the Department of Oncologic Surgery, University of Heidelberg.

RRC was defined as a recurrence of rectal cancer within 6 months from the completion of radiochemotherapy (CRT). The primary tumor was considered to be radiation-resistant, if it was initially T3, and/or had lymphatic invasion. In contrast to the primary, recurrent tumor was considered to be radiation-sensitive, if the irradiated area had a macroscopic radical status before primary CRT and the radiation dose was \>45 Gy \[[@B14]\].

All patients gave written informed consent for operative therapy after complete explanation of the procedure. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Heidelberg.

Preoperative management

In terms of preoperative management, we followed our standard protocols in the treatment of RRC. The patient was referred by the oncologists and given a CT scan of the abdomen and chest, as well as an endorectal ultrasound and an assessment of the primary tumor and the regional lymph nodes. The clinical staging, as compared with the preoperative CT, was confirmed if patients underwent a contrast-enhanced rectoscopy. The T and N classification, according to the TNM classification (Union International Centre for Cancer Control 1997), was reported for all cases.

All patients were evaluated by a gastroenterologist or radiologist before the operation to establish the feasibility and the operative procedure. During the operation, only patients with a technically feasible and curable resection were taken for the reconstruction procedure including a mechanical anastomosis. The remaining cases were discussed during a multidisciplinary tumor board.

Eligibility criteria for PRT were a tumor-free margin of \>2 cm, an irradiated area of \>75% and a macroscopic non-infiltrating situation before irradiation. In all cases, the primary tumor was excised with an intact mesorectal fascia as well as at least two resectional lymph node stations and resection of regional nodes was performed on a systematic basis \[[@B15]\].

Radiation therapy prior to surgery was described in Table [1](#T1){ref-type=""table""}. The irradiated target volume (IGTV) was defined as the GTV plus one margin of 2.5 cm.

Statistics
----------

Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time interval between the date of diagnosis and the date of first local failure, as documented by an endoscopist or surgeon. PFS includes all patients with RRC, regardless of the type of treatment they received, their initial disease status or their T or N classification.

OS was measured from the date of operation to the date of death by any cause or to the latest follow-up information available for surviving patients. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and all *P*-values were obtained by the log-rank test. The influence of the following characteristics on survival was assessed by means of the Cox regression model: gender, age (\<72 or \>72 years), histology, tumor T classification (T3 or T4), radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer (yes or no), metastasis-free local nodes (yes or no), irradiated volume (IGTV in cm^3^), radiation",1
"Question: Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably? Answer:  Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably?.

INTRODUCTION
------------

Lymphedema is a chronic, debilitating condition caused by abnormal lymphatic flow. It can result from breast cancer treatment, which often causes the lymph nodes in the affected area to be destroyed, impair lymphatic drainage, or cause lymphatic stasis ([Figure 2](#f2-wjem-21-822){ref-type=""fig""}). Lymphatic stasis creates a pathological reduction in the capillary network and lymph flow along lymphatic vessels. Both the lymph vessel walls and lymph capillaries get thin and lose functionality as a result of increased interstitial pressure, fluid extravasation, and inflammation, which lead to swelling, pain, and skin changes.[@b1-wjem-21-822]--[@b3-wjem-21-822] In addition to the cosmetic impact of lymphedema, the condition can cause other complications. Some studies have found increased venous reflux and chronic venous disease to occur in lymphedema patients.[@b4-wjem-21-822]--[@b9-wjem-21-822] Lymphedema affects approximately 1--5% of breast cancer patients.[@b7-wjem-21-822]--[@b9-wjem-21-822] This is a costly public health problem as patients are not only affected by the chronic sequelae, but also experience an additional 3 to 29 years of disability related to disease recurrence. The cost of lymphedema-related morbidity is estimated to be \$1 billion.[@b10-wjem-21-822] The annual medical cost of patients with bilateral arm lymphedema is estimated at \$7,000.[@b10-wjem-21-822] Additionally, the annual disability cost associated with lymphedema-related morbidity is \$3,000.[@b10-wjem-21-822]

Early detection of lymphedema can prevent progression, reduce the duration of treatment, and improve function and quality of life. Unfortunately, lymphedema is insidious, symptomless, and requires extensive treatment before patients seek medical assistance. Lymphedema can progress silently over years of treatment until the patient experiences considerable tissue loss ([Figure 3](#f3-wjem-21-822){ref-type=""fig""}). Many of those affected by lymphedema are not even aware of this problem because they cannot detect early lymphedema. Additionally, those seeking medical assistance often have a long history of symptoms. Patients may seek medical advice and treatment more than a decade after cancer treatment because of these factors.[@b4-wjem-21-822],[@b11-wjem-21-822] As a result, patients often have limited treatment options, long waiting times, and a high rate of misdiagnosis. It is important for the practicing clinician to be able to detect early lymphedema to inform the patients early and intervene before advanced stages of the disease set in and treatment becomes limited.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
---------------------

*Question: Can a practicing surgeon reliably detect early lymphedema?* Answer: Yes.

*Question: How can practicing surgeons help to detect early lymphedema?* Answer: The first step to detection of early lymphedema is the appropriate physical examination to identify the patient's symptoms.

The physical exam involves visual inspection ([Figure 4](#f4-wjem-21-822){ref-type=""fig""}), palpation ([Figure 5](#f5-wjem-21-822){ref-type=""fig""}), and range of motion evaluation ([Figure 6](#f6-wjem-21-822){ref-type=""fig""}) of the affected arm. The clinician's goal is to identify signs such as swelling, asymmetry, or changes in the skin. These early signs should raise the concern for lymphedema.

*Can practicing surgeons identify early lymphedema reliably?* Answer: Yes.

*How can practicing surgeons help to identify early lymphedema reliably?* Answer: First, the appropriate physical examination should be performed with the patient. Second, history should always be asked as the lymphedema signs are difficult to identify with simple observation of the patient. Third, treatment should be initiated when treatment is recommended.

Historically, the physical exam focused on the evaluation of tissues in the immediate area of the affected limb,",1
"Question: Colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases: does global management at the same centre improve results? Answer:  Colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases: does global management at the same centre improve results?

How do you define global management?

What interventions have you applied, and can you compare and contrast the effectiveness of the local with the global approach on overall survival?

We used the PORTEC-3 trial as our starting point for this work; it is the only phase III study with a randomised control arm that looked at hepatic management versus radical resection. It showed a benefit from global management but it is not clear whether this relates to differences in the way the two centres were run; was the study biased towards more active management? We were interested in how well international and national data would match, so we also ran a secondary analysis of all randomised studies with survival as the endpoint. We were especially interested in determining whether or not the benefit was seen in the randomised studies, as well as which of its findings were most robust, as these would indicate which centres are doing the best and which do the worst. For this we used, amongst other criteria, the P value for interaction which represents the difference in overall survival between randomised arms of the phase III studies and therefore tells us whether or not there is a difference between centres that is significant; and also looked at whether or not there was a benefit on overall survival for the two arms of the randomised studies, so we could see if the results were in line with the PORTEC-3 results, using their definitions of ""true"" and ""false"" global and local management.

The answer to the Question lies in the Answer. In other words it is both complex and straightforward at the same time. The complexity lies in the question and the answer both require the same skill set to answer. If you have not picked up on this skill set yet ask your colleagues to explain the difference between randomised and non-randomised studies, you may need to work on this with them.

The answer can be stated very simply by observing that there is good evidence that the choice between local and global management in patients with colorectal liver metastases is important for survival. In fact there have been so many studies looking at the effectiveness of the local or global management approach that anyone with an interest in the topic cannot fail to be aware that there is a significant survival benefit to either option. There are also many randomised trials of patients who have received pre-operative treatment which have shown a significant benefit in survival to both a local or a hepatic based treatment option. In contrast, there are fewer studies comparing the results of care between countries. What we would like to know is which centres and which countries do the best and the worst, and at what point does the difference become significant?

There are many factors that might cause an apparent difference in results between centres, such as differences in expertise within surgery teams, in the skill and experience of the surgeons performing the operation, in the selection of patients for the treatment option, and in the quality of pathology services, and in the ability of the patient to comply with after-care requirements in each centre.

Differences in how well different countries have performed in research projects may also account for differences between centres. These differences are mostly in the form of publication bias, where studies are not published that show no benefit or harm from management options. It is possible that randomised studies that show a survival benefit to one management approach are more likely to be published and, therefore, more likely to have a survival benefit as an endpoint.

To assess all this we chose a meta-analysis to look at the different studies in the international literature. We first searched the literature for English language published randomised studies. We then searched the literature for randomised studies that had been published in the English language. We then screened the papers to see if they were randomised studies. The review involved a series of studies using a series of electronic searches, hand searching the references from the studies, and searching the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the European Society of Medical Oncology and the British Journal of Cancer for relevant papers. The studies were excluded if they looked at primary liver metastases, if they were reviews which only covered phase I, II or III studies, or if they were only published in foreign languages. The articles selected for this review were the meta-analysis from the six randomised studies that included survival as an endpoint, as the studies with a longer follow up period showed differences in survival between the treatment groups.

We identified the studies meeting our inclusion criteria with a P value for interaction below 0.05. This indicated the effectiveness of the two randomised management options, as an interaction between the treatment arms was significant, and the difference between randomised arms was significant. The studies we selected had an average P value for interaction of 0.",1
"Question: Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality? Answer:  Is the deficit in motion perception in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality?

The authors present the results of a pilot study in which a patient with chronic schizophrenia and the same age, gender, education, and ethnicity as the participants performed the visual-motion paradigm used to examine motion perception. The researchers used an eye-tracking tool to collect eye-tracking data regarding both gaze location and point of focus to reveal evidence of an inattention blindness deficit, or a blindness to self-generated motion, and a deficit in processing visual-motion information. The abstract reports findings of a patient with schizophrenia who showed evidence of being unaware of her own self-generated motion. The authors write of their study in the manner of a hypothesis, in the introduction and concluding sections of the abstract, and in the text used in the conclusion of the abstract section.

How can it be that the deficit of motion in schizophrenia can be attributed to eye-tracking abnormality? The answer to that question is: There could be several explanations for the deficit in perception of motion in schizophrenia. First, the patient may be experiencing psychotic symptoms, including thought insertion and thought withdrawal. Second, the patient may be experiencing auditory hallucinations and visual illusions. Third, the eyes may be misaligned or incorrectly positioned because of abnormal eye position or eye movement. Fourth, the patient may be experiencing visual processing deficit in spatial and temporal domain [2]. The current study has only established correlation between the deficit of motion perception in schizophrenia and eye-tracking abnormalities. The authors have used a correlation and have not studied if the deficit in the visual-motion perception of schizophrenia is responsible for any pathological conditions that are being experienced in the patient. However, the authors have not explained why this patient was unable to perceive her own self-generated motion.

It is not surprising that schizophrenia can induce psychotic symptoms. However, when psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia result in eye-tracking abnormality, it is expected that the deficit in eye-tracking abnormality results in an inability, or at least reduced ability, to notice any of self-generated motions.

A large fraction of the patients presented in this pilot study had eye-tracking abnormalities. It is possible that the patient presented with a motion perception deficit as a consequence of eye-tracking abnormalities. However, this is not surprising. The literature on motion perception in schizophrenia shows that in the presence of schizophrenia, motion perception in many visual channels was hampered and people were unable to notice self-generated motion even with the aid of eye tracking [2]. To the best of my knowledge, at one instance this pilot study has used only one patient with schizophrenia who had such an eye-tracking abnormality. If studies had used several other schizophrenia patients, the deficit in motion perception due to eye-tracking abnormality may have been more pronounced. Hence, the deficit in motion perception in the schizophrenia patients may be accounted for a factor other than eye-tracking abnormality.

Eye-tracking studies have been conducted in the research of schizophrenia. One of these studies has shown that there was a significant difference in the amount and time of looking of participants [3]. However, in this study, the differences in eye-tracking were considered a consequence of cognitive abnormalities [3]. The deficit in eye-tracking due to eye-tracking abnormalities and not a consequence of the deficits in motion perception is being supported in this abstract in several ways. First of all, the author wrote of the patient's eyes, “She had no eye movements during the test” (page 3). Secondly, she wrote of her task, “She was asked to maintain her gaze at one of the three red, green or blue squares presented on the bottom of the screen for 500 ms, after which the screen turned off and a blank screen appeared for 1500+ ms (to ensure that participants could not count how long she looked at the squares), followed by the appearance of a target square that was either the same colour (invalid condition) or different from the two squares shown before (valid condition)” (page 3). Also, the author wrote, “The target square appeared randomly either left, right, up, or down.” The target square appeared from the bottom of the screen, and was presented in all the quadrants of the screen so that the patient should have noticed it. These explanations all indicate that the patient may not have noticed the self-generated visual motion. She may have only been aware of the screen itself and not of any self-generated image.

“The deficit of motion in schizophrenia that is observed in several neurophysiological conditions is a well-recognised symptom, for instance, in the case of a right temporal lobe damage, the perception of visual motion is severely impaired (Raffin et al., 1988.

Abstract {#j_iss-2019-2016-9999_s_001}
========

Innovative technologies such as gastro-endoscopy allow more and more patients to undergo surgery, which is usually combined with laparoscopic technique.

Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy is a novel endoscopic procedure, wherein a splenic incision is enlarged to provide access for endoscopic instruments and enables a safe laparoscopic splenectomy with the same advantages. Several case series have been published regarding this emerging endoscopic splenectomy technique.

Our single-center, prospective study shows the feasibility of the transgastric endoscopic splenectomy regarding safety, feasibility, and the reduction of open conversion. In this case series, all patients had a median follow-up of 14.8 ± 9.4 months.

Case Report {#j_iss-2019-2016-9999_s_002}
===========

All patients gave informed consent for endoscopy and surgery for treatment of spleen disorders and for the publication of their data. All patients provided consent to surgery.

All procedures were performed using a standard upper endoscopy with endoscopic linear cap-assisted access and CO~2~ insufflation. The same two experienced surgeons were involved in the cases.

Patient demographic and operative data are summarized in [Table 1](#j_iss-2019-2016-9999_table_001){ref-type=""table""}. The indication for surgery was hypersplenism. The mean spleen size was 4.3 ± 1.6 cm \[3--7 cm\] and the mean total operative time was 171 ± 58.5 minutes \[90--350\]. The mean operative time of the transgastric endoscopic approach was significantly shorter than that of the conventional approach (mean time of the first access/splenic incisions: 67 ± 21 minutes vs. 105 ± 42 minutes, P=0.0001; mean time of the last access/splenic closure: 58 ± 21 minutes vs. 86.5 ± 39 minutes, P=0.0003). This was partially due to the fact that the transgastric approach needs only one incision and is performed in a relatively short time, because of the laparoscopic technique. There was no difference in mean operative time in the TAS group (81 ± 20 minutes) and the TES group (168 ± 32 minutes). The conversion rate of the TES was significantly lower than that of the TAS in terms of bleeding (4% vs. 15%, P˂0.01), size of the spleen (4% vs. 12%), and total operative time (0% vs. 15%, P˂0.01).

"Question: It's Fournier's gangrene still dangerous? Answer:  Should the Fournier's gangrene still be considered a significant threat?

The Question:

It's a gangrene that can only be described as a disease, because it affects a large portion of the body's surface.

Gangrene is:

A severe or necrotizing bacterial infection. A disease characterized by the presence of a nonviable, noninfectious area of dead tissue. The loss of the function of the area affected by the disease.

Fournier's gangrene is:

Fournier's gangrene is a rapidly progressive infection, typically involving scrotal, perineal or genitalia. It often involves pelvic structures and can spread across all structures of the groin.

Question: Is it still a treatable disease? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is Fournier's gangrene still a treatable disease?

A disease that involves loss of the function of the entire organ or part of the affected tissue should be addressed urgently. Gangrene is a severe bacterial infection that is difficult to treat and can lead to death. Despite new and more effective diagnostic tools and broad-spectrum antibiotics, mortality remains high. However, the incidence of Fournier's gangrene in the USA has declined significantly since 1980 and treatment options have greatly improved since the 1980s, but mortality and morbidity remain high.

Question: What are the differences between Fournier's gangrene and necrotizing fascitis? What do you know? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers your Question: What are the differences between Fournier's gangrene and necrotizing fascitis?

A

Gangrene involves large areas and occurs when tissues or organs are destroyed by ischemia, ischemia-reperfusion [decreased blood flow to the body's vital tissues] or infection.

Necrotizing fascitis is a necrotizing cellulitis that may also invade the deeper layers of the skin.

Question: Is Fournier's a true bacterial infection? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is Fournier's a true bacterial infection?

Answer:

Fournier's gangrene is a severe infection of the scrotum, perineum or perigenitalia caused by aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that form a biofilm on the skin. It is characterized by rapid spreading infection and high risk of death.

Fournier's gangrene is a term that was first used by Fournier in 1910 to describe a necrotizing fasciitis secondary to bacterial infection, particularly in male genitals.

Historically, this disease was most common in young, male alcoholics, and it was described in relation to the consumption of local alcohol via abscess-induced necrotization or infection, often due to infection by Staphylococcus aureus. Alcohol use, also commonly known as alcoholism, is associated with poor wound healing and increased risk of gangrene.

Other associations include diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, cirrhosis, and trauma, but any condition that allows bacterial invasion of the fascial plane, including a recent surgical procedure involving a large wound opening, can lead to Fournier's gangrene.

Although the mortality rate for Fournier's gangrene is usually high, its incidence in the USA has declined.

Question: What are the causes of Fournier's gangrene? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers your Question: What are the causes of Fournier's gangrene?

The causes of gangrene include:

Bacterial:



Bacteria invade tissue

Microorganisms proliferate and colonize

Bacteria become embedded in connective tissue, causing a biofilm

Bacterial agents invade via traumatic wounds or through an open skin sutured in a contaminated area

Immunocompromised:

Diabetes

HIV

Cirrhosis

Multiple Trauma

Hormonal/endocrine

Steroid use

Chemotherapy drug (e.g. vincristine)

Bacterial toxin-producing bacteria (streptococcal species)

Anaerobes

Clostridium septicum

"Question: Is it appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients? Answer:  Is it appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients? Provide evidence that your work is unique and is a contribution to a better understanding of the problem being examined.

Answer:

The purpose of this analysis is to describe our experience with patients from the National Kidney Registry who were more than 65 years of age at the time of transplantation and compare their survival with matched cohorts of younger patients.

Cohorts:

Group 1 : A group of patients receiving an ECD kidney who were older than 65 years at the time of transplant by at least 3 years (n=527).

Group 2 : A group of patients from the National Kidney Registry who were more than 65 years old at the time of transplantation and whose donors were less than 65 years of age (n=6,069).

Cases:

A case-control study was undertaken on 1,000 patients from National Kidney Registry with at least 5 years of follow up. This study compared recipients whose donors were more than 65 years old at the time of transplant with those in whom the donors were younger.

Analysis:

Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of recipient age at the time of transplant: age less than 65 years, age 65-74, and age 75 or older.

Results:

1.1% of transplants occurred in patients who were older than 65 at the time of transplant, compared with 18.8% in those who were younger than 65 at the time of transplant.

Analysis of causes of death:

The number of deaths in patients older than 65 who underwent transplantation relative to all deaths in patients in this age group was less than 50% of the cause of death among younger patients and a similar distribution of diagnoses.

Discussion:

Patients more than 65 at the time of transplantation have a survival advantage over younger patients which is explained in large part by selection of healthier older subjects.

Conclusion:

A majority of older patients waitlist for a transplant when younger individuals do not. These older patients do not receive a transplant until they are in poorer health, have more comorbidities, and usually are transplanted with a higher level of HLA mismatch. Selection of healthy older individuals for transplant has an overall survival advantage, and transplant results and HLA match are better for elderly patients than the general population

"Question: Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Is it always necessary? Answer:  Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a disease that causes the median nerve to become trapped in the wrist. The median nerve and the branch that it supplies are the muscles that bend the wrist and the fingers. The median nerve begins at the base of the neck inside a protective sheath. At the wrist, the median nerve becomes larger and thinner. The condition occurs when a nerve is compressed and irritated. Symptoms can include numbness, pain, weakness of the arm, and even difficulty moving the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome can be diagnosed by looking at wrist and hand movements. The symptoms usually appear when the patient is in her 40’s, and the condition can be diagnosed when the patient is in her 20’s. People who work on their feet, especially nurses and those who do repetitive activities, such as secretaries or cashiers, may develop this disorder. They can avoid this syndrome by wearing hand-support cushions to protect the hands. The National Institute of Health has a great website that shows common questions and answers about carpal tunnel syndrome. Click here to visit their website. What would you do if you discovered that your client had a problem with carpal tunnel syndrome and was scheduled for surgery? Would you want to perform the surgery? If you answered “yes,” then think again. As a podiatric surgeon, you should be concerned with the foot anatomy, not just the ankle or the knee. If you notice that your client is suffering from the symptoms related to carpal tunnel syndrome, you as a podiatric surgeon should provide her a thorough assessment. Many times, the carpal tunnel syndrome can be treated by wearing a wrist pad during the day. If that does not work, then another surgical option is used. Some of the options used in carpal tunnel surgical procedures can include: 1. Medications. These options often work by making the individual’s arm and hand muscles more rigid and less susceptible to muscle spasms. 2. Orthotic devices that support the wrists above the elbow joint. 3. Cortisone injections. Surgery to release the pressure on the median nerve is sometimes used. Most patients recover within several weeks with normal results and function, although in some patients, the recovery is slower. The National Institute of Health does have a great website that gives more info about carpal tunnel symptoms. Click here to visit their website. If your patients are experiencing pain in their legs or feet, are they experiencing foot pain? Foot pain can be related to many problems, including toe stiffness, diabetes, kidney disease, neuropathy, heel spur disease and ankle pain. All of these conditions can be found in podiatric surgery. With all these syndromes, you may consider a cortisone injection (bursitis cortisone injection) to reduce the pain and inflammation. If you determine that your patient has suffered a car damage accident, then you should do more than just treat the patient, you should seek legal representation. You may ask your client’s family doctor or the accident attorney to help in the case. Most car accidents are resolved after a simple investigation of the case. To find an automobile accident lawyer, you might ask your local bar association. It is the professional association for all lawyers in the community. Most attorneys that represent personal injury cases are listed in the phone book. You must have experience to handle the personal injury case. It is good to know in advance that the personal injury law firms offer contingency fee plans. This means that whatever you win, the attorney receives the contingency fee. If the settlement is not what it should be, then the attorney will not need to receive a percentage. This is an important distinction to know as a podiatric surgeon. Your goal might be to settle the case while the insurance carrier cannot find out who the claimant is if there is a monetary settlement. To achieve this, the attorney must know the details as to how the case was presented. If you have the accident attorney’s contact information in your own hand, then you will have the details immediately so that you can be in a better place to settle the case. If you are unable to work, then you deserve compensation. To get it, you need to find a legal firm that can handle your case. The National Board of Podiatric Medical Associates suggests that you hire an attorney that you are comfortable with, to handle your case. If you can’t afford an attorney, you can seek advice from your local bar association. The accident attorney should be capable of handling your situation and not your family member or friend. Most states require that the law firm work on a contingency fee, in other words, the attorney earns a percentage of all money that is collected for the claimant. This percentage is paid upon completion of the litigation. It may be that the attorney does not collect anything. Even when the attorney",1
"Question: Should direct mesocolon invasion be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer? Answer:  ""For gastric cancer patients, is direct involvement of the mesocolon by the tumor the most important factor for lymph node metastasis (node-positive), or is the degree of tumor penetration the main factor?""

Introduction
============

Lymph node dissection (LND) for gastric cancer patients is essential for the accurate staging of disease and the identification of positive nodes. LND provides a more accurate information on lymph node metastasis that reflects the clinical significance of lymph nodes. Several investigators have tried to evaluate additional lymph nodes after LND to determine the status of micrometastasis in the dissected nodes, especially in node-negative patients and patients with a low risk of LNMs \[[@b1-crt-2016-084],[@b2-crt-2016-084]\]. Although the results of these studies were not consistent, several investigators reported that they found submucosal (SM), intramesocolic, and mesocolic (M) nodes in a high percentage of gastric cancer patients. These studies suggested the possibility of additional nodes and also the inclusion of M nodes in the LND for the clinical use, and some investigators have recommended M node dissection \[[@b3-crt-2016-084],[@b4-crt-2016-084]\].

Liu et al. \[[@b5-crt-2016-084]\] compared the status of the invaded LN to the presence of lymph node metastases and reported that the presence of invasion did not predict the absence of metastasis. For their opinion, they questioned whether M node invasion is as reliable as the presence of lymph node metastases and proposed that M node invasion might be an additional factor to consider when deciding whether to perform additional LND.

The purposes of this study were to evaluate the LNMs in gastric cancer patients and to define the significance of the involvement of M nodes.

Materials and Methods
=====================

1. Study population and data collection
----------------------------------------

The subjects of this retrospective study were consecutive, first-time surgically treated gastric cancer patients who visited Korea University College of Medicine Gil Medical Park (GMP) between January 1996 and June 2013, were examined with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the gastroenterology department within 1 week before their operation, and had pathologically proved gastric adenocarcinoma. Data on patient age, sex, body mass index, pathologic findings, operative procedure, and staging as well as complications and treatment results were collected from the electronic medical records of the patients. For the analysis of LND, the degree of LNMs was defined according to the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (JCGC) \[[@b6-crt-2016-084]\], and the LNMs were classified into four categories as follows: R0 (negative); R1 (1-2 regional LNs with positive metastasis); R2 (3 or more regional LNs with positive metastasis); and N+ (nodal metastasis regardless of the regional LN status). LND was judged as complete if a LND was performed at all stations. When LNMs were not detected in the operation, LND was considered as negative in the analysis.

GMP has a gastric cancer database with the records of all surgically treated gastric cancer patients. The Korean government requires that any patients operated on at GMP get a minimum follow-up. Thus, follow-up data were collected from medical records and phone calls. Patients were followed up every 3-6 months during the first 2 years, every 6-12 months during the next 3 years, and annually thereafter. If any recurrent case was found, treatment for recurrence was followed and the overall survival was considered as the outcome.

2. Surgical procedures
----------------------

The surgical procedures were standardized and consisted of total gastrectomy (TG) plus en-bloc resection of the esophagus, at least 14 lymph nodes with a ratio (the number of LNMs divided by the number of dissected nodes) of 3:2 or more of positive per LN that had been histologically evaluated. Extended LND was used when tumor invades beyond proper muscle but not extending into the lymphatic channels. According to the extent of invasion of the LNs, LND was classified into four groups: LNDI, TG without LND and extended LND; LNDII, TG and extended LND, LNDIII, TG without LND, LNDIV, TG and extended LND. Incomplete LNDs were not included.

"Question: Do Surrogates of Injury Severity Influence the Occurrence of Heterotopic Ossification in Fractures of the Acetabulum? Answer:  Do Surrogates of Injury Severity Influence the Occurrence of Heterotopic Ossification in Fractures of the Acetabulum?

Answers

It would be a good idea to know beforehand what kind of hip dislocations are the most severe. This would help to decide if one would need to do a more severe injury to the patient's hip just because of the severity of the injury. The more severe the injury, the less mobility of the hip it will have; with very severe injuries the pelvis bones will be pushed out of line or the femur head will be forced off. Depending on how things work out the patient's hip is usually reduced internally with a traction or externally in a pelvic clamp. There are some cases when it may be necessary to perform an arthrotomy to help with fixation.

One thing to consider when reducing a fracture is that the femoral head may be reduced off; especially in a case like this one. It is imperative that something be done to hold it together because the patient is still unstable. If it does come off there are a few things that can be done but if it is off it is gone.

The patient has a very good chance of not developing HO, but if she does she will need some sort of orthopedic intervention for the symptoms she will experience.

Most Orthopedic Surgeons agree that the acetabulum heals in a different manner in a patient that is pregnant as compared to someone else. In pregnancy the labrum will get loose and start to tear. Also, the femoral head will start to erode and not be protected by the labrum any longer. This usually results in labral tears, which will start to occur immediately after delivery, and continue to occur throughout the period of time the woman was pregnant with the baby. This will end up leading to chalenge hip joints, and other complications for these women and their babies.",1
"Question: Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke? Answer:  Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke?

Statin therapy, that is, medical therapy with cholesterol-lowering drugs has been recommended for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) for many years. Statins are effective in lowering cholesterol levels and their benefit in patients without CHD is uncertain.

Since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, statin therapy in women has been controversial. Because this was an ancillary study to the randomized clinical trial WHI, it was underpowered for many endpoints, even though the endpoints were carefully chosen to include important clinical and public health issues. Nevertheless, the data from the ancillary study raise many questions about the use of statins in the prevention of CVD events in women. Most importantly, the data show that there is no benefit from statin use in women. The recently published Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) Collaboration reports similarly negative data. This is an important and timely study because the United States has recently passed legislation to include sex in the Medicare prescription drug benefit formulary.

Since the publication of the CTT study, statin prescribing for prevention in women has also decreased. In a commentary published in the British Medical Journal in April, the authors note a change in the direction of prescribing, suggesting the authors have been influenced by the CTT study results.

In the CTT study, the overall effect of statins on coronary and cerebrovascular events was small and the effect was seen primarily in participants with high-risk lipids. Even after excluding people who were already taking an alternative statin or those who had a high-risk event in that trial, the statin group was still not at a significant cardiovascular risk reduction. The CTT pooled their data from all trials, regardless of the specific lipid ranges of their participants. They excluded women who might benefit for cardiovascular reasons and women who already had a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) to avoid a statistical analysis of women who already were receiving cardiovascular therapy.

In addition, although all trials had used the same statins, the dosage and dosing frequency varied and, thus, the potential efficacy varied based on drug dosage. Overall, the CTT pooled all trials and compared the pooled data for their cardiovascular endpoints. Because of the lack of individual patient data, the authors were not able to account for the dose variations across the different trials, which might have been different in women and men. However, even the WHI study, which was conducted without a statin-placebo comparison, did not show a significant event reduction in women, even in those with the highest-risk lipid levels.

Statins are widely used in the prevention of CVD in women for a number of possible reasons, including (1) lowering the risk of CVD in women, especially in the context of an estimated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) 10 times higher than in men (1). (2) As a class, statins have been associated with adverse side effects, including atorvastatin, lovastatin, and cerivastatin, which are the first-line statin medications in the Prevention of ASCVD with Statins of Different Effects (PASTE) trial; muscle toxicity and possibly liver toxicity and statin-associated diabetes are concerns, even though these adverse effects have become less frequent as statins have gained widespread use over the past 15 years. (3) Lipids are different between and within men and women. For example, even though women have an elevated ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol compared with men, triglycerides are higher among women. (4) Women of reproductive age, including pregnant and postmenopausal women, have a higher percentage of the small dense-lipoprotein particle, which is associated with higher triglycerides. Small-particle cholesterol has been associated with plaque growth and plaque instability, resulting in higher risk of CHD and stroke, even though women have a much better lipid profile in terms of triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. (5) Statin therapy is not associated with any reduction in risk of breast or ovarian cancer in women.

In summary, the CTT reported results from an analysis of 22 individual studies, including 13 placebo-controlled statin studies with statin doses of 10 mg of atorvastatin (6), 40 mg of atorvastatin (7), 20 mg of pravastatin (8), 40 mg of simvastatin (9), 80 mg of simvastatin (10) in healthy women, 7 mg of atorvastatin (7), 20 mg of rosuvastatin (11), and 10 mg of atorvastatin (12). Study protocols were chosen to exclude women who were currently taking a statin or those who had",1

"Question: Sternal fracture in growing children : A rare and often overlooked fracture? Answer: Sternal fracture in growing children. You may include a case report, as you please.

Discussion {#sec0001}
==========

This study evaluated the prevalence of blunt chest wall injuries in pediatric trauma patients presenting to our level 1 pediatric trauma center. These patients were treated and cared for in the pediatric emergency department, were managed for these injuries at the discretion of the treating physician, and had no other system deficits to suggest the injuries were secondary to a ""hard"" trauma event. Of the 21 cases with sternal fractures, all of them occurred in children between the ages of 4 and 13 years, with a male predominance. The majority of injuries were secondary to motor vehicle accidents, falls, and sports-related activities ([Fig. 1](#fig0001){ref-type=""fig""}). Interestingly, none of the patients in this series met the American College of Surgeons criteria for operative management.[@bib0012]

Blunt injury to the chest wall in young children may be more extensive than previously thought, and as in our series, may include fracture through skin, soft tissues, pleura, and lung parenchyma [@bib0013], [@bib0014], [@bib0015] ([Fig. 2](#fig0002){ref-type=""fig""}). A retrospective chart review at a level 1 pediatric trauma center revealed a higher prevalence of isolated sternal fractures in children under the age of 5 compared with those over the age of 5. The authors theorized that the lower prevalence found in the age greater than 5 group may be due to a protective effect as children get older against these types of injuries.[@bib0016] One of the cases in our series involved a 2-year-old who may have been protected by this effect. While there is currently no information on the mechanism of injury for this fracture in children, we can infer that this injury is often related to accidents that involve falls and vehicular accidents in young children.

This study shows that while patients less than 5 years old are less likely to suffer sternal fractures, sternal fractures should be considered as a cause for concern in young children who have been injured following a motor vehicle collision or fall from a height. Although none of these patients required operative intervention and only one had a concurrent pneumothorax, we recommend that follow-up studies and investigations be performed in the pediatric emergency department so that early detection and prompt treatment can prevent morbidity and mortality in these patients.

"Question: Is there a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women? Answer:  Is there a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women?

I am a graduate student who is conducting a project on sexual desire in women. I have read that the hypothalamus controls sexual desire in men and women. The hypothalamus is believed to be located by the back of the brain above the pineal gland. Would you please provide me with some information on how hormones, both naturally and through birth control/steroid replacement therapy, may affect sexual desire in a woman? More importantly, how could I collect the data to prove how androgens may affect sexual desire? Thank you in advance for your response.

Dear Laura, it is hard to give you precise information without knowing exactly what you are looking for. I was wondering whether a certain hormone, e.g., testosterone, may affect sexual desire. If so, the hypothalamus is not located in the hypothalamus but rather at another place in the brain which is called hypoxia-induced factor. This region of the brain, the right dorsolateral preoptic nucleus in the diencephalon, responds to sex hormones and is responsible for the generation of sex steroid hormones. In humans it is known as the periventricular nucleus or anterior hypothalamic nucleus. In the female, estrogen is necessary for the stimulation effect of testosterone on periventricular nucleus.

I do not know how you expect the androgens to influence your question. I am sure you will come to an interesting new result!

Laura,

I have one question for you. If a woman’s sexual desire increases when she is on estrogen-only contraceptives, it is logical to assume that sex drive decreases when she takes testosterone-based contraceptives. In other words, does the decrease in sexual activity correlate with the decrease in testosterone?

Regards

Laura,

Dear Dr. De Leener, I am glad that you took the time to see what I have been trying to find someone who might be interested in my study. My problem is that I do not know what kind of data I would need to prove my hypothesis (if any). I need specific data on the androgens that decrease or increase the sexual desire in women (and how it relates to the sexual desire). If my hypothesis is correct, I would think that there is a great deal of research on the topic, since it is a common problem among women.

I have no problem collecting data myself, since I have access to a large (female) student population at the institution closest to my house. For this project, it is imperative that a data set be available with the proper control. I feel that in order to gather the kind of data I need, the study would be a great deal more expensive of time and money than if you were to collaborate with me.

Could I just ask if you are interested in this project or if I could simply pass on an e-mail to someone at your office that might be interested? I would like to get this study done before applying for a job.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Laura,
I would consider the project if you were to follow my advice. First, I always advise to obtain permission from the ethics committee of my country if you plan on working in this field. Second, there is nothing wrong in working on such a project without the involvement of a co-author. You would have done something for the scientific community. Third, you should obtain permission to work on the project from either the principal investigator or the department’s ethical committee. In this case, you should ask permission from the faculty members that supervised your masters research:

Dear Dr. De Leener, It’s hard not to say how happy I was to find the post and the question you wrote in your post. Thank you for taking the time to look at my research. While I cannot give you any concrete information on whether and how you can help, I thought you would be interested in the project. I do not necessarily have anything to contribute to the study, however, I am certain the data collected would be of great value, as I doubt anyone else has been able to research on this topic as deeply as I have. As for my thesis advisor, however, he has other studies to focus on, so maybe he can give you suggestions on the best way to get some sort of data set on this project?
For you to fully understand, please look at this diagram of the endocrine system and hormone levels in human sexual desire.

As I described before, the levels of sex hormones are related to sexual desire. To prove my hypothesis that androgens (like testosterone) are a crucial factor for increasing a woman’s level of sexual desire (and subsequently have a high rate of sexual activity), it is crucial that we have data in which female sexual desire and activity increases after",1
"Question: Does immediate breast reconstruction compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy? Answer:  Does immediate breast reconstruction compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy? The Question addresses the topic of (a) mastectomy and/or (b) reconstruction after mastectomy. The Question is appropriate for a Question-and-Answer forum, which contains articles on the use of a technology or a procedure for solving a medical problem, as well as the medical/surgical rationale for prescribing or performing that technology or procedure. Articles in which the use of breast reconstruction after mastectomy is reported should include rationale regarding breast cancer treatment, e.g. radiotherapy, timing of chemotherapy, tumor biology, patient comorbidities, and/or quality of life.

Topic Background: Anastomotic leak is the most feared complication of breast reconstruction. The purpose of this article is to review the various modalities of anastomosis and discuss their utility in breast reconstruction.

Key words: breast reconstruction, mastectomy, immediate breast reconstruction, anastomosis, prosthesis, flaps, implants.

This review article focuses on the current techniques and concepts for a successful breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Anastomosis between the donor and the recipient site is a crucial component of the reconstructive process. The two types of anastomoses studied herein are the free flap and the skin graft. Each method has its own merits depending on the type and the needs of the patient. Therefore, each technique and method is discussed in detail.

Free Flap for Skin Grafting

A free flap for skin grafting can be considered for use after total mastectomy, when the breast mound is preserved. Many free flaps can be used for reconstructing the breast mound after a standard or modified radical mastectomy, with or without immediate reconstruction. The indications for this type of anastomosis are: (a) wide exposure after a skin-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction; (b) thin skin (\<1 cm) to facilitate closure under tension without suturing the deep vessels; (c) reconstruction in the presence of infection or a wound with skin loss; and (d) reconstruction of large defect \[[@B1]\].

Free flaps for skin grafts come in 5 forms: transposition, chimeric pedicled or free TRAM flap, myocutaneous or fasciocutaneous free flap, pedicled perforator flap, or microvascular free flap \[[@B2]\]. In the UK, the National Free Breast Reconstruction Audit Project Report \[[@B3]\] in 2011 indicated that the majority of breast reconstructions after mastectomy were performed with the transposition and chimeric perforator flaps. The chimeric perforator and free TRAM flaps are frequently used when the breast mound and skin are preserved, and the breast skin is thin and healthy. The transposition flap is more desirable when the entire breast mound is absent due to prior therapy \[[@B4],[@B5]\]. The free perforator flap (FPFL) for skin grafting can be elevated as a transposition flap or as a chimeric perforator flap; a chimeric perforator flap requires elevation of a separate flap for the lateral thoracic artery perforator before dissection of donor perforator \[[@B6]\]. When the defect is located in the breast-conserving setting without prior cancer therapy, mastectomy skin flaps or latissimus dorsi muscle transposition flaps are preferred over free transposition flaps, which can be associated with greater morbidity \[[@B7]\].

The chimeric type of free flap is preferred over the purely free flap (a free musculocutaneous or fasciocutaneous flap) when there is not enough recipient skin to cover the defect. The breast skin is the largest graft in this situation and can be transferred with a chimeric free flap to the area between the donor and recipient sites. This graft can have an optimal fit, while being thin enough to close under minimal tension \[[@B8]\]. Free chimeric flap is the most versatile flap for use in this setting, as there are no recipient vessels for anastomosis. The advantage of a flap, which is vascularized through only 1 pedicle, is that the donor-pedicle is only 1 blood supply. Thus, there is no potential for compromised perfusion to the flap when it is brought to a recipient area.

The FPFL is the most versatile free flap for reconstruction after mastectomy with good postoperative results, but has a short-term postoperative length of hospital stay and is associated with increased postoperative pain \[[@B9]\]. The ideal donor site of the FPFL is in the lower part of the back close to the spine, and the ped",1

Key Takeaways

For the past 15 years, the American Academy of Ophthalmology has included among its goals a reduction in visual impairment, defined as visual acuity of 20/40 or worse, due to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), as a strategy to save lives and relieve quality of life.

However, over the past few years, the POAG rate has leveled off at 4% to 6% of the population and the number of people with sight-threatening POAG has remained the same from 2000 to 2014.

One contributor to this plateau?

The high proportion of asymptomatic people with POAG, which is defined as eyes that do not have any changes in ocular examinations due to glaucoma, even though they have risk factors indicating the disease. Ophthalmologists have known since the middle of the past century that these ocular examinations could detect individuals with early signs, which can be treated and prevent future cases of POAG.

Another contributor could be the growing evidence that a substantial number of the cases in the general population may be due to inherited, age-related, or systemic risk factors, and that the contribution of primary or secondary acquired risk factors is probably small.

However, it is still likely that patients who experience ocular problems from age-related conditions such as age-related macular degeneration may find that new treatments for POAG may be especially beneficial for their eyes.

Although the eye-preserving treatments are still a little complex, many people who do lose their sight or their ability to function can now benefit from a surgical treatment, which gives them their best possible chance to regain independence.

Questions:

If the number of people diagnosed with POAG is leveling off, how can ophthalmologists explain this?

How can the POAG rate be reduced, both among the asymptomatic population and as treatment continues to advance?

Could the high and steady number of POAG cases for so long now be an indicator of the impact that a preventive eye screening program, using a POAG risk test, would have on the population?

What is POAG?

Granulomatous inflammation in the anterior chamber of a patient with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is observed in ophthalmologic examinations of the eye.

Progression to secondary glaucoma, such as the closed-angle glaucoma that develops after cataract surgery, is associated with the presence of an inflammatory reaction.

Glaucomatous progression is the result of increased intraocular pressure (IOP), which can only occur with intraocular inflammation, increased production of fluid in the eye, or both.

Granulomatous inflammation and closed-angle glaucoma. IOP is maintained at a reduced level by filtering aqueous fluids out of the eyes as the fluids enter the circulatory system.

How does the immune system recognize an organism as an invader, and how is it prevented from reacting against the host? These questions have been answered most completely in the world of bacteria, but similar mechanisms are involved for all organisms, including viruses.

The human body recognizes bacteria and viruses as “invaders” by recognizing the proteins, peptides, or carbohydrates of the microorganisms and activating an immune response, including inflammation. The recognition molecules of the human immune system were identified in 1989.

The mechanisms that are employed by the immune system to defend the body are called the innate immune response and include antigen-presenting cells, such as monocytes and B lymphocytes, that have the ability to identify antigens and “display” them through the T-cell receptor (TCR) system. These antigen-presenting cells, together with innate effector leukocytes, promote the destruction of invading microorganisms and prevent the spread of infectious agents over the organism.

Questions:

Where do the cells of the innate immune response come from and what are their roles in the body?

Do the innate immune response cells come from tissues in the body or from germ-line cells in the bone marrow?

How is the immune system capable of distinguishing between bacteria, viruses, and other “invaders” of the body?

Age × 10 + Temperature (in degrees F) + Respiration (in breaths/minute) + Systolic Blood Pressure (in mm Hg) + Heart rate (in beats/minute) How are the APACHE II score and PRISM score related?

Age is similar, although age and PRISM use degrees Fahrenheit whereas APACHE II uses degrees Celsius

PRISM's points and calculations for each category differ from the corresponding APACHE II category

What is PRISM III?

An updated version of PRISM. Calculations are weighted according age in days in the past, with the older the age (in past calendar days) used, the fewer the points.

APACHE III

How are APACHE IV and V scores calculated?

See

What does the APACHE score look like?

The APACHE score is comprised of four different components and uses an additive point total.

Acute Physiology Score

Age component

Respiratory System Score

Circulatory System Score

Hepatic System Score

How is the APACHE score calculated?

The age component gives 1 point for each day of age above 5 days. The respiratory component gives 1 point for each of the following: Minute Ventilation below 6 L/min, PaCO2 > 35 mm Hg, PRISM score, PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 50, SpO2 < 90%. The circulatory component gives 1 point for each of the following: Hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90%), tachycardia (heart rate of > 180 beats/min), bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min), PRISM score, Jaundice. The hepatic system gives 1 point for each of the following: Biliuria, PRISM score, Platelet count less than 90,000.

APACHE scores with lower integer values are for less acute medical conditions and those with higher integer values are for more severe medical conditions. Is a patient really sicker if the APACHE score is low?

No. The concept of mortality prediction (and APACHE scoring) was intended to be population-representative. It tries to capture what is expected without being overly affected by the acute illness or by special circumstances of the subject patient.

In APACHE II scores, an individual's predicted mortality is simply the sum of the 4 different component values. This value ranges between 0 and 4.3. A patient's individual predicted mortality is the number of points a patient has based on his or her age.

What is PRISM Score and what is its use?

In PRISM the value 0 is used to indicate normality, and any value > 0 indicates disease.

The PRISM score is a statistical score derived from the APACHE II mortality prediction method. However, it is a continuous score (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and higher) that does not need to be converted to a percentage. There are four APACHE II components used in the PRISM scoring process: Acute Physiologic (A) component, age (P), Respiratory (R) component, and Temperature (T). The components have the following formulas: P = 1 for age less than 5 Days, P = 1/365 for age 5 to 14 Days, P = (1, if 1 to 9 Days old; 9, if 9 to 14 Days old; 1, if 1 to 4 Days old; 1 if 9 to 11 Days old; 1, if 1 to 7 Days old; 1, if more than 7 Days old), if Temperature < 38°C and age < 5 days, R = 1, PRISM < 20 points, T = 1, PRISM > 5 points, A = 1 for all ages.

APACHE III has a continuous integer score between 17 and 124. The predicted mortality is a calculation based on the four APACHE score components age (P), physiologic (A), acute illness (R).

Currently, there are two basic approaches to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) that have been developed: a ""pre-stent"" method, in which a balloon-expandable valve is placed inside a self-expanding stainless steel stent prior to implantation to create an integral rigid scaffold to serve as a frame for implanting the valve; and a ""fully-deployed"" method, in which a valve without a stent is implanted without predilatation \[[@CR1], [@CR2]\]. The goal of the first approach is to use the stent as a rigid frame, similar to stent-based balloon-expandable aortic valves. The stent and valve are delivered into the aorta through a ""valve-in-valve"" technique that does not require predilation of stenotic valve orifice \[[@CR3]\]. In the second approach, the valve, which is self-expanding, is not constrained by any metallic frame. Because of the potential differences between these two approaches, such as the ability to deploy the valve more accurately and the possibility of avoiding injury to large arteries such as the iliac, popliteal, and femoral arteries, a comparison of these approaches is warranted.

This literature review aims to compare the current two approaches of TAVI, with special focus on the valve-in-valve approach and its potential advantages and disadvantages, as well as to discuss the factors that should be considered before adopting this method.

Methods {#Sec2}

This systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA checklist (Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type=""fig""}). The PubMed database and the [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov) trial registry were queried and searched for ""transcatheter aortic valve implantation"" between October 2018 and August 2019. The following MeSH terms were used in the PubMed search: (prosthesis OR prosthetic OR valves OR valvular) AND (transcatheter OR transcatheter) AND (implant OR implantation OR implanting OR implanted). The articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria and that were related to the topic of this review (Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type=""table""}) were selected, their tables and/or figures were collected, and their corresponding data were evaluated \[[@CR4]\]. This systematic review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines \[[@CR5]\].Fig. 1PRISMA flow diagram showing literature search and selection approachTable 1Key inclusion criteriaInclusion criteriaPatients were adults (older than 18 years) with symptomatic aortic stenosis of moderate to severe stage, in whom the transcatheter intervention was considered as the treatment of choice.\
Transesophageal echocardiography was used for pre-procedural planing and assessment.\
Transapical approach was used in almost all casesProcedure involved delivery of a de-risked/de-calcified valve into native aortic annulus (either pre- or post-valvuloplasty) in the setting of self-expandable valves.Valve size is a suitable one for the native annulus with normal anatomy and no aortic annular remodeling\
Vessel preparation for transapical approach is done in terms of valve positioning. Valve should be ""paravalvular"" (off-axis, non-parallel to the plane of mitral valve) and ""peripheral"", that is not attached to tissue of aortic annulus or the ostia of coronary arteries\

Question: Autoerotic asphyxiation: secret pleasure--lethal outcome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Which is more harmful, autoerotic asphyxiation or regular asphyxiation?

Background {#Sec2}
==========

Sudden cardiac arrest due to strangulation or asphyxia, although relatively rare, is associated with significant mortality \[[@CR1]\]. Autoerotic asphyxiation is the deliberate self-induced asphyxia of the self, as opposed to being an incidental form of asphyxia \[[@CR2]\]. It involves manual or ligature-assisted asphyxia for self-gratification. Most often, the ligature is a noose, but occasionally a ligature may be a strip of cloth, wire, string or rope, and it may be a suicide, suicidal or homicidal form of asphyxia \[[@CR2]\]

We are aware of 16 cases in the literature \[[@CR3]--[@CR18]\] of young men who have survived autoerotic asphyxiation with or without resuscitation and with varying degrees of morbidity. However, all reports except three have the patient alive and the victim and/or his family consent \[[@CR3], [@CR7], [@CR11], [@CR13], [@CR17]\]. The literature on this topic is small and further reports of autoerotic asphyxiation deaths are needed. An autopsy can sometimes aid clinicians in understanding what happened. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the case of a victim who survived an autoerotic asphyxiation suicide attempt, with the hope of raising awareness for better identification of suicidal behaviors to be able to intervene or offer more appropriate counseling.

Case summary {#Sec3}
============

During April and April 2018, a medical-legal autopsy was performed on the body of a 44-year-old man who had been arrested in his family home and was later found still inside the bathroom of the apartment. There had been a report of domestic abuse 5 years before: The police stated there had been an arrest of the suspect for domestic abuse. However, no further charges were filed according to police.

On January 28, 2018, at 11 p.m., the man was found dead under the bathtub. He was found by a woman inside the apartment. He did not respond to the woman, who had opened a door to enter the bathroom. On examination, the man was found to be in cardiac arrest with asmall entry wound on his forehead on the top right-hand side (Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type=""fig""}). The body was clothed in a green T-shirt and gray sweat pants (pants). He was in the prone position with the right arm on the bathtub. The hand was in a position that would indicate that he was hanging by it with the palm over the right nostril and fingers over the right eye, blocking the breath passage and asphyxia, and without a ligature. No suicide note was found. An autopsy was performed, and he had no recent or previous history of heart disease (Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type=""fig""}). The autopsy was performed by Dr. M. Naveed. Toxicological testing on blood and urine was negative.Fig. 1Figure was made of a photograph taken by the pathologist during the autopsy Fig. 2Post-mortem examination of the body

Examination of the neck revealed a single, small, penetrating entry wound on the right side of the neck in the back of the chin. This was a small wound with a slightly oval entrance, 3 cm long, 2 cm wide, with edges radiating from a central point. The wound had a blunt entry. There was no evidence of skin or muscle bleeding inside the wound. The skin around the wound had been stretched, due to the force applied to the neck and/or as a result of strangling. There were some tears in the soft tissue over the anterior aspect of the mandibula. There was no significant hemorrhage inside the wound. Under the skin, there was a soft, yellowish, and shiny wound inside the neck, and the epidermis on the outer surface had a blueish discoloration. The larynx was enlarged. The epiglottis, the right arytenoid muscle and the soft palate, both the right tonsillar pillar and the base of the tongue were edematous, oedematous",1
"Question: Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence: Does comorbidity lead to poorer outcomes of depression? Answer:  Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence: Does comorbidity lead to poorer outcomes of depression?

Answer: This is one of many examples of a question that could be answered in a study examining the question, “Is co-occurring depression and ADHD in children more severe?” If the question in your case is “Is youth with comorbid depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence more likely to make an alcohol withdrawal symptom-free?” Then the answer would be “YES”.

Depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence are common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. However, very little is known about the overlap of these diagnoses in adolescence, particularly with regard to the relative severity of the two conditions. In one study that examined treatment outcomes for youth with both depression and alcohol use impairment, a diagnosis of both disorders improved outcomes for depressed youth, and not as predicted by the researchers, for youth with alcohol use disorder. However, in that study, only 30 percent of adolescents with comorbid depression and alcohol use impairment received treatment and of that 30 percent, over half did not have complete resolution of symptoms. Therefore, many youth remain severely impaired. Another study found that children with depression and alcohol use were more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications for depression in the future than alcohol use disorders alone, and a third study suggested that adults with comorbid depression and alcohol use disorder had poorer outcomes for depression than the depression alone group. All studies were cross-sectional and only controlled for severity of symptoms. To date, no studies have examined the association between comorbidity of depression and alcohol use disorder with treatment outcomes. The current study seeks to bridge this gap.

Research Question: Do adolescents with comorbid generalized anxiety disorders-major depressive disorder (GADmd) and panic disorder (PDd) have poorer treatment outcomes of anxiety than adolescents with anxiety without other diagnoses?

Answer: This is one of many examples of a question that could be answered in a study examining the question, “Does comorbidity of generalized anxiety disorder-major depressive disorder-panic disorder increase in severity over the course of treatment among youth with anxiety disorders?”

A recent meta-analysis of several studies found a higher prevalence of PD in both community and adolescent samples (Rihmer, Keuthen, & Keitel, 2011). It also suggested that only PDd has a significant clinical significance. There may be some research to support this, but not nearly as much as is stated in the abstract. One longitudinal study found that PDd in adolescence was associated with higher rates of anxiety disorders in adulthood, even when adjusting for the presence of anxiety symptoms. Yet another longitudinal study showed that in youth who have PD and an elevated score on a measure of hyperarousal at presentation, PD is more likely to resolve over the course of treatment than if it is not elevated. The above suggests that clinical intervention for PD should be considered in those patients who present with elevated hyperarousal. Additionally, PD may serve as a phenotype or “substantially risk factor” for the later development of an anxiety disorder in youth who do not have an anxiety disorder at baseline.

Research Question: Is adolescent depression associated with alcohol use, alcohol use relapse, and related outcomes?

Answer: The author proposes that an examination of the relation between alcohol use and depression may lead to a better understanding of the relation between co-occuring disorders and outcomes of both conditions.

The aim of this review is to assess the current evidence regarding the co-occurrence of depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescents.

A recent study examined the relations between alcohol use and depression and found positive linear associations with higher depression scores for alcohol use and positive quadratic associations with lower depression scores for alcohol use. These findings suggest a dose effect for mood and alcohol, that is, for every step of alcohol that youth consume. The author suggested a dose-response effect of mood for alcohol use in adolescents, not unlike the dose-response effect he found in adults. One study, however, examined the relation between alcohol and anxiety symptoms in adolescents and did not find a relation between these variables, possibly because of the small sample size. A study using mixed methods found that in a community sample of adolescents who used alcohol, depression symptoms were correlated with problem drinking, and also suggested that the effect of depression on drinking increased in adolescents as they progress through high school and their mood improves. A study examining the comorbidity of alcohol and depression among older adolescents found that alcohol use disorder had a stronger relation with depression than the reverse relation. A smaller study, however, found a positive correlation between adolescent depression and high-risk drinking, suggesting that drinking may be a risk factor for later depression. Finally, high-risk college freshman who use",1

"Question: Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method? Answer:  Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method?*

This study presents a mathematical model for measuring the mesopic pupil size optically at the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The model is validated using high-speed video imaging by comparing the mesopic pupil diameter measurements obtained using both a digital caliper and the model. The model provides a measurement of mesopic pupil diameter with sub-millisecond accuracy and with a high degree of precision and accuracy. The model's accuracy and precision are both high. The model can calculate the pupil diameter optically at a high pace, which will make it applicable to image interpretation as well.

P.I. Prof. P.K. Leung from the Department of Physics & Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong is the corresponding author of this study. Prof. Leung's research focus is on image processing. Prof. Leung proposed this study with Prof. Chun-Yan Yeh from the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco.

This study describes a mathematical model that can accurately measure the mesopic pupil diameter with the high-speed imaging system equipped with a cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy system[@b1-opth-12-1201] ([Figure 1A](#f1-opth-12-1201){ref-type=""fig""}). The cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy system is used as the pupil imaging technology for this study. It is able to capture the image of the pupil of the eye under cobalt blue light illumination up to 1,000 frames per second (fps). In the course of conducting this study, we also developed an image processing-based method to convert the digital still images generated by the high-speed imaging system into time-series images with a resolution of 1,024×768 pixels (or 768×1,024 pixels). We then applied two methods to measure the mesopic pupil diameter, one of which is based on the iris segmentation method[@b2-opth-12-1201],[@b3-opth-12-1201] and the other based on the method proposed by the authors.

Method
======

The mathematical model ([Figure 1B](#f1-opth-12-1201){ref-type=""fig""}) for measuring the mesopic pupil diameter is based on the following assumptions: An iris point of the subject's eye is located at the center of the cornea ([Figure 1B](#f1-opth-12-1201){ref-type=""fig""}), and the cornea shape is circular.[@b4-opth-12-1201]There is no image acquisition noise in the image acquisition system.The iris is perfectly round.

The mesopic pupil diameter *D* ~M~ can then be mathematically expressed as: $$D_{M} = \frac{R_{s} - \left( {R_{f} + R_{c}} \right)}{4} + K^{*} \cdot \left( {R_{s} - R_{c}} \right)$$where *R*~f~ and *R*~c~ are, respectively, the corneal radii of curvature in the front (*R*~f,~) and rear (*R*~c~) directions perpendicular to the light path within the cornea ([Figure 1B](#f1-opth-12-1201){ref-type=""fig""}), *R*~s~ is the radius of the cornea center, and *K*\* is the proportionality constant.

The mesopic pupil diameter was calculated using either of two approaches: An iris segmentation and edge tracking method or a pixel-shift-based method. The procedures for the iris segmentation and edge tracking method and the pixel-shift-based method to measure mesopic pupil diameter *D*~M~ are summarized in the flow chart presented in [Figure 2](#f2-opth-12-1201){ref-type=""fig""}.

The Question

Should circumcision be performed in infancy?



Abstract



Abstract

Surgical male circumcision (MC) is commonly performed for phimosis, balanitis, and prevention of urinary tract infection, and sometimes also for health benefits. Evidence shows that in industrialized countries, MC is mostly recommended for medical purposes. The World Health Organization recommends MC as a preventive measure against many conditions and disorders that affect men, including urinary tract infection. MC is associated with fewer adverse events and less pain than adult male circumcision. However there are some concerns that MC may have adverse health effects, although those have been disputed. Circumcision-related trauma to the penis has been suggested as a contributor to the development of adult-onset prostate and cervical cancers and penile conditions. In infants, circumcision presents a clinical dilemma and it is often debated whether circumcision should be performed or not. The IUGA Task Force on Circumcision published a consensus statement regarding circumcision in children in 2008, stating that MC should not be performed, except when medically recommended. For non-medical reasons, infant MC is not commonly performed. The risk of serious complication or death after being circumcised in infancy is extremely small. Recent data suggest that MC is unnecessary in cases of phimosis or balanitis in infancy, but not in infant circumcision for non-medical reasons (circumcision for non-medical purposes, i.e. for cosmetic reasons).

Keywords: Male Circumcision, Medical Male Circumcision, Health-Related Male Circumcision, Infant Male Circumcision, Non-Medical Male Circumcision.





The Evidence

The practice and prevalence of infant circumcision has changed significantly over the last two centuries, as shown in the following summary of studies conducted over time. More recent medical evidence suggests that in most cases MC should not be performed. However, there has never been a study directly assessing whether infant MC is medically or harmlessly superior to delayed circumcision. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies comparing MC with either delayed surgery or no surgical intervention suggested that there is good evidence for medical benefits in adults (e.g. prevention of UTI), but no such benefits for children. There also is some evidence of a medical advantage of MC as part of pediatric reconstructive surgery, but the studies were of small size and were not primarily designed to determine MC’s potential in this setting. One study did find potential medical benefits for girls, but there’s no scientific consensus on whether MC is an essential component of pediatric sexual and reproductive health programs in low- and middle-income countries, where the majority of child circumcisions occur.



How Should We Decide?

Infant circumcision for non-medical reasons is not supported by the medical evidence. Although there’s some evidence of potential benefits, we do not know if they outweigh the potential for complications; moreover, non-medical circumcision in healthy infants can be performed with an increased risk of complications and is a cosmetic surgery at the extreme.



For medical reasons, circumcision should not be performed in infancy. Based on the available medical data, circumcision is likely to have a small beneficial effect if performed in the neonatal period for prevention of UTI. If an infant with phimosis develops repeated UTI in the setting of poor hygiene, circumcision to treat the condition may actually be beneficial.



In all other circumstances when male infants may develop a circumcision indication, parental request is necessary. A discussion with a baby-specific urologist, the family, and the parents is warranted before performing newborn circumcision, for all the reasons above.



In the IAP, it’s generally not ethical to consider circumcision a prerequisite for female genital examination (FGE), since almost all women in the world have intact genitalia. However, in settings where circumcision prevalence is low, and where the prevalence of UTIs is high, FGE with circumcision may be considered to further prevent UTIs. This should be discussed with the parents and the infant.



The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend routine circumcision. The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists recommends considering circumcision only where the benefits of circumcision outweigh its potential harms.

"Question: Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management? Answer:  Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management? *Colitis 2014;24(2):89-94*

Abdominal pain is one of the main reasons for an out-patient or in-patient diagnosis. About 20%-60% of these patients are discharged within the first 48 h of their admittance. Patients with a suspicion of an episode of diverticulitis may undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen to exclude complications which can usually be seen in the acute or subacute setting. This is particularly helpful if the patient is at risk of malignancy or of perforation. In our practice, we have come to prefer routine ultrasound examination whenever a CT scan has been omitted. It does not seem to be able to improve the diagnostic yield of the CT scan. The risk of missing a perforation if the CT scan has a very typical appearance is a well-recognized risk \[[@B1]\]. It may be very helpful in these patients, where surgery might be life-saving, to perform the ultrasound with intravenous contrast administration.

In this week's question, we would like to ask you whether performing a colonoscopy is really helpful for the patient being managed for diverticulitis.

*Keywords:* Colonic diverticula, diverticulitis, colonoscopy, ultrasound, CT scan, management

Question: What is the best strategy to assess for perforation or fecal spillage following conservative management of perforated diverticulitis?

Perforations are infrequent in patients treated conservatively for acute perforated diverticulitis and are usually managed by laparotomy or laparoscopy.

There is little literature addressing the optimal perioperative care to prevent subsequent fecal spillage. Some authors have suggested that a diverting stoma should be avoided in these patients. However other authors have suggested that diverting stomas might not be detrimental to these patients who have often had multiple previous operations.

*Keywords:* Diverting stoma, perforated diverticulitis, conservative management

Question: Is surgical intervention for complicated diverticulitis necessary in all patients, or can the procedure be delayed until the symptoms resolve? If the perforation is not recognized during management of complicated or uncomplicated diverticulitis, is it prudent to perform a second operation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is surgical intervention for complicated diverticulitis necessary in all patients, or can the procedure be delayed until the symptoms resolve?

The majority of diverticulitis can be treated with supportive measures, such as intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. If there is a risk of complications, or the patient continues to have symptoms despite supportive measures, the surgical management may include sigmoid colostomy or partial colonic resection. This approach has been shown to reduce the need for reoperation and also to restore bowel continuity without adverse effects on mortality.

The most common early complication following diverticulitis is sepsis, as reported in 30%-55% of cases but the most serious complication is stricturing or tissue damage, which may lead to recurrent diverticulitis. The exact incidence of recurrent or delayed bleeding is unknown but is possibly as high as 25 per cent. After one episode, the risk of developing diverticulitis in the other part of the colon that is asymptomatic rises by 20  per cent. Some guidelines suggest that every episode of complicated diverticulitis requires surgery, but other authorities recommend only treating a patient who has a second or third attack of diverticulitis. As in acute diverticulitis, complications like perforation, obstruction, free or adherent faeces, blood clots, and diverticulitis in the other parts of the colon are common complications of complicated diverticular disease. These patients require close follow-up, for several reasons:

A second hospital admission is more than twice as likely if there is a perforation \[[@B2],[@B3]\].

There is an increased risk of recurrence and of developing new disease in the other parts of the colon \[[@B4]\], for example, a higher risk of diverticulitis \[[@B3]\], bowel obstruction \[[@B5]\] and bleeding.

A third or greater attack of diverticulitis predicts recurrent diverticulitis and/or complicated disease. \[[@B6]\]

A third or greater attack of diverticulitis predicts recurrent diverticular disease and complicated disease \[[@B6]\].

"Question: Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up? Answer:  Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up?

Background: Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL and IADL-C; Figure 1) include all activities involving managing one’s own daily life. We used the IADL and IADL-C to measure IADL because prior studies have mostly used them in relation to clinical diagnoses of dementia, as opposed to mortality. These activities are among the functions on the Lawton IADL scale, the most frequently used instrument. The IADL and IADL-C also require different levels of effort (IADL) and complexity (IADL-C), and thus have different degrees of sensitivity for predicting dementia. Also, the IADL and IADL-C differ with regard to the length of recall period. Thus, it is necessary to determine the predictive value of the IADL and IADL-C with respect to dementia incidence and to determine whether the predictive value differs for the IADL and IADL-C.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Osaka University. All study participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study that was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. To guarantee confidentiality, study participants’ full names will not be provided in the paper.

To verify the effectiveness of the Lawton IADL scale in predicting dementia incidence in a 10-year follow-up of a cohort of community-dwelling seniors, this research examined IADL and IADL-C. Also, we examined the risk factors for incident dementia and tested whether IADL and IADL-C can be predictors of dementia in participants in whom incident dementia occurred or did not occur. Finally, this study examined the predictive value of IADL and IADL-C with regard to the severity of dementia in longitudinal follow-up.

An international meta-analysis showed that there is a dose-response relationship between cognitive function and the duration of follow-up in studies conducted in the community setting [ 2 ]. The IADL-C are associated with dementia risk among the Lawton IADL, including those who are in need of more assistance with the IADL-C (ie, more dependent).

According to the Lawton IADL scale, IADL-C were classified into three groups: low (score, 0; 7.1%), moderate (score, 1; 16.0%), and high (score, 2 or more; 77.9%). For the classification of dementia severity, we used the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) [ 6 ]. CDR 0 indicates no dementia, CDR 0.5 indicates very mild dementia, CDR 1 indicates mild dementia, CDR 2 indicates moderate dementia, and CDR 3 or more indicates severe dementia.

For a 10-year follow-up of the Ooba cohort, the IADL and IADL-C were evaluated using the Lawton IADL scale, which has high test-retest reliability [ 2, 36 ]. For each of the IADL assessed, participants’ ability to perform the task was classified into three groups: low (score, 0; 100%), moderate (score, 1–29; 61.2%), and high (score, 30–100; 27.7%). The Lawton IADL scale has a length of 30–50 minutes and is completed with the participants’ assistance [ 2 ]. The IADL and IADL-C were dichotomized into those in need of assistance (IADL+; score, 0 or 1) and those not in need of assistance (IADL-; score, 2 or more).

According to a Japanese longitudinal study of 989 community-dwelling individuals aged 75 years and older, dementia was found in 48.0% of the study participants; this percentage had increased in every 5-year age stratum, and those aged 90 years and older had a 50.0% dementia rate (95% confidence interval (CI) = 46.0%–53.5%) [ 13 ]. In the USA, the dementia incidence for participants in those with IADL+ was found to be twice that of those with IADL- at the ages of 81 to 85 years and over [ 8 ].

In Japan, it has been estimated that the incidence of dementia will increase from approximately 3 cases per 1000 people in 2010 to 4.2 cases per 1000 people by 2040 [ 12 ]. However, since the exact number of people who have been diagnosed with dementia remains unknown, it is difficult to accurately predict the future burden posed by dementia. To provide accurate predictions and contribute to early intervention programs, it is",1
"Question: Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection? Answer:  Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection?

Shunt infection is a relatively common complication of implantable cerebrospinal fluid shunts in children.^[@R1]^ The majority of shunt-related infections are caused by contiguous organisms that are introduced through the surgical opening either directly from the skin or through a breach in a dressing. The majority of other infections are due to infection in adjacent sinuses or skin and subcutaneous tissue. The most common organisms that colonize CSF shunts are coagulase-negative *S. aureus* (CoNS) and *Staphylococcus epidermidis*.^[@R1]^ Most of these organisms colonize and reside in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, which may act as a reservoir for subsequent shunt infection. In addition, other contiguous organisms, such as streptococci, *S. aureus*, and *Enterobacter*, may invade subcutaneous tissue and subsequently enter a functioning shunt reservoir.^[@R2],[@R3]^ Other, noncontiguous bacterial organisms, such as aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative rods and various gram-positive bacteria, including *Streptococcus*, *Firmicutes*, and *Actinobacteria*, colonize the reservoir, which can then become infected.^[@R3]^ *Hemophilus influenzae* is an uncommon isolate from shunt infection in children and is likely limited to the cerebellum and brainstem. *H. influenzae* is not usually recovered from peritoneal dialysate fluid.^[@R4]^ A few reports have suggested that *H. influenzae* can be carried on the hands of personnel who have had contact with a child with infection.^[@R5]^

Infections that can occur with a functioning shunt include meningitis, septicemia, arachnoiditis, abscess formation, and ventriculitis. Infection manifests as shunt malfunction, elevated intracranial pressure, and neurological dysfunction. Shunt infection is most frequently seen in patients with congenital or acquired shunt failure. There is a predilection for this complication to occur in younger children (particularly those \<1 year of age).^[@R1]^ Incidence has been reported to be as high as 5% to 10% in children with a functioning shunt. In a recent prospective randomized-controlled trial of patients undergoing ventriculoperitoneal shunting, the overall infection rate was 3.1 per 100 shunt-months.^[@R6]^ While the majority of infections are secondary to contamination of the surgical sites, some have been considered to be a consequence of ventriculoperitoneal shunting itself.^[@R7]^

A functioning ventriculoperitoneal shunt creates an artificial reservoir connected to a subcutaneous abdominal space. Shunts in the central nervous system (CNS) are the most common and most prone to infection.^[@R8]^ Common sources of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections are infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, contamination of the peritoneal dialysate fluid that circulates from the abdomen to the shunt reservoir, and contamination of the shunt reservoir by the peritonitis in those who have had ventriculoperitoneal shunting before.

The incidence of shunt infection can be reduced by meticulous aseptic techniques at the time of the subcutaneous insertion of the shunt reservoir and by maintaining aseptic techniques in the care of the patient. Most infections occur within the first several days to weeks after insertion.^[@R1]^ Shunt systems should be flushed or drained every 72 or 96 hours depending on shunt manufacturer's recommendations to remove bacteria and particulate matter, as well as cerebrospinal fluid that may potentially have been contaminated with bacteria.^[@R9]^ Most infections can be diagnosed and treated before clinical manifestations occur. If a shunt infection is suspected, then it should be confirmed by obtaining cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricular catheter by needle and sterile needle or aspirate or biopsy for microbiological studies.

The use of real-time imaging during the initial stages of shunt insertion has been shown to be of benefit in reducing the incidence of CNS infections.^[@R10]^ This review will focus on the use of the neuroendoscope during subcutaneous placement of shunts that form artificial shunts. It will also include articles published in the electronic",1

Sclerosis disease

Question: What is the cause of multiple sclerosis? Write an essay in which you examine all aspects of the problem including its diagnosis, pathophysiology and epidemiology. An introduction should be included that will help the readers understand the problem and a thesis statement that will summarize the important information and conclusions. This is a typical writing task:

Write about the causes of multiple sclerosis. Give an introduction which will describe the disease. Support your conclusion with well-organized information from the facts you found.

Possible questions that could help you write this essay: Who is most likely to get multiple sclerosis? What are the signs, symptoms and causes of the disease? How is multiple sclerosis diagnosed and treated?

The causes of MS are unknown. We do know that the disease does not cause the death of the brain cells. The cell death occurs later. So the cause is not a direct cause. It is more a result of how the cell dies (neurodegeneration). There is very good evidence for the role of the immune system and also for the role of certain viruses that can cause infection associated with the disease.

One of the problems for scientists is that the immune system and the virus are both part of us the body. One of the problems for clinicians is that it is hard to prove that the immune system and the specific viruses that are associated with MS are what cause the disease. One issue with this disease is that there is too many forms with too little information. We cannot use the data from any one condition to tell us what will happen in another condition.

Questions:

Are the various forms of the disease caused by a different illness or the same illness?

What specific viruses are associated with the disease?

Is there more than one cause of the MS?

What would happen if there is no treatment or the treatment is not effective for MS patients? How do we know?

How do we prevent or decrease MS recourses?

What do we know about the etiology and pathophysiology of the disease? Does this information help us design new approaches to treat or prevent the disease? Explain in detail.

What does it mean to know that the disease is a result of neurodegeneration? What effect does that have?

Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis?

Answer: There is some relationship. About 10 to 12 percent of cases of MS are thought to have an infection associated with it, and one of the most common suspected microbes is group A Streptococcus. Some of these streptococcal infections are a complication when someone has diabetes. And I know some of these patients get an infection after they have a viral infection.

Streptococcal bacteria are normally found in about 40 percent of the population but are not usually a problem. Some people develop antibodies which fight the streptococcal bacteria and keep them from getting into the blood. After the fight the blood can become sterile. People develop specific antibodies because the immune system is working to fight them off. This is why some people have recurrent streptococcal infections. If this doesn't happen, or if we don't do the fight, the streptococci can get into the blood. We have a much higher rate (about 10 to 12 percent) of multiple sclerosis patients with streptococcal superinfection after getting a normal virus infection in the stomach and intestines. Some have died.

The link is not as clear in adults. It can be associated with the development of MS, or it can be more like the streptococcal infection of infants.

If you suspect streptococcal infection, we use blood cultures to screen for the presence of streptococci. If streptococci are found in the blood they are usually treated with antibiotics, like penicillin. Since this is a condition in the mouth more often in the middle of the day, we have to wait for the results of the blood cultures to know when to treat the condition.

The antibiotic choice depends on the clinical findings, so if we are not sure, we use amoxicillin or penicillin V to treat the condition so we don't kill streptococci that are already there or kill the good bacteria. It is important that we get a result on these cultures the day after they take the blood cultures. It is important to have it done at a time when people are not ill. We don't have to get this culture in the",1
"Question: Is the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer? Answer:  The use of low dosages of 2-methoxyestradiol combined with chemotherapeutic drugs, in the treatment of human ovarian cancer, may lead to decreased dosages of chemotherapeutic agents due to their synergistic interactions with 2-methoxyestradiol, without affecting the efficiency of treatment.

Answer:

Novel drugs that are capable of interacting in a drug-specific synergistic manner with standard chemotherapeutic agents (so-called ''synergistic agents'') can effectively inhibit the growth of tumor cells and therefore provide a breakthrough in the treatment of cancer. A study with ovarian cancer cells showed that the administration of 2-methoxyestradiol, alone, at nontoxic doses, causes downregulation of the expression of genes encoding matrix metalloproteases-2 and -9, two of the key enzymes responsible for the degradation of the extracellular matrix of tumor cells and tissues. This result suggests that 2-methoxyestradiol could interact with certain chemotherapeutic drugs, resulting in the suppression of the invasive potential and aggressiveness of cancer cells. Previous studies have shown the ability of 2-methoxyestradiol to regulate the expression of genes for the key components of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan core. (J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 4897). When combined with the DNA demethylating agents that inhibit the growth of tumor cells, such as decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine; Dacogen, a registered trademark of Pharmacia and Upjohn) and decitabine riboside, 2-methoxyestradiol reduced the expression of genes encoding for interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), the membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMMP-9) and the major fibroblast-secreted proteoglycan core protein (aggrecan), as determined by real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcriptionase-polymerase chain reaction) (Oncogene, 2002, 19, 7791). These results provide new possibilities for the combination therapy of estrogen-dependent cancers (oncosimicrosarcomas) with drugs that act synergistically with estrogen, but at nontoxic doses.

Chemotherapeutic drugs are generally safe drugs, with relatively low toxicity (even at high doses), but their efficacies in the treatment of cancer can be compromised by a combination with drugs with a toxic effect on normal cells. This is particularly common in the treatment of human breast cancer, and can be explained by the frequent presence of estrogen receptors in breast tissues, which are the preferred target for some of these medications. A case-study with an estrogen-dependent cell line, MCF-7, indicated the synergistic interaction between tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and 2-methoxyestradiol.

These results open up new frontiers for the design of combination therapies to effectively treat estrogen-dependent breast cancer with nontoxic doses of 2-methoxyestradiol. A new area of research in cancer treatment is aimed at finding synergistic drugs that could interfere with the mechanisms of the growth of tumor cells and reduce their overall aggressiveness and invasiveness, without diminishing the effect of currently used drugs. However, no general agreement exists yet, as to which drugs are likely to lead to effective synergisms when combined with chemotherapeutic agents. This fact is not surprising, since the molecular interactions that generate synergistic cell death (cell death produced through the action of two or more distinct pathways) differ in terms of the drugs involved, and the molecular mechanisms that generate cancer cell death can vary according to the drug used. Synergy, the combined action of molecules or cells, can be classified as: additive and synergistic, antagonistic and mixed. The type of interaction between two or more agents can be calculated using pharmacological indexes. The interaction is considered as additiove when the ICs (the concentration of the drugs required for a certain effect) of each drug, alone, are greater than the ICx for the combination, if it is less, its interaction is considered synergistic and indifferent if they are the same. (J. Biochem., 1995, 108, 901). In the treatment of cancer, the synergy index (SI, also called the combination index) should always be considered, however, it is only for some cases that the concept of synergy is used (J. Biochem., 2001, 130, 843). A study with tamoxifen in the therapy of estrogen-dependent breast cancer (Cancer Res., 1998, 58, 5856), showed that the synergy index (SI) was larger than one",1
"Question: Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery? Answer:  Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery?

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of an objective means of assessing the joint line position during revision knee surgery and to apply it intraoperatively to control joint line position. During knee revision surgery, the joint line was checked using the contralateral knee radiograph to achieve objective evaluation when there was instability of the joint line and to compensate for a technical error, and by using this procedure as a guideline to correct joint position. We evaluated 34 patients (44 knees) from the study subjects treated by revision knee surgery. The joint line position was assessed according to the K-L classification ([@CIT0011]). The preop. and postop. values of radiologic joint line positions were classified and compared using the paired t-test to evaluate the differences in the joint line position using the knee joint contralateral radiograph. Finally, we considered the use of this technique as a guideline for joint line position correction during arthroscopic surgery of the revision knee.

The purpose of this study was to propose a revision surgical method with the use of joint line assessment using the contralateral knee radiograph. The method was devised for the evaluation of joint deformity of the distal part of the tibia and femur caused by the development of a chronic infection; for the evaluation of the progression of knee osteoarthrosis; for the correction of an incorrect tibial cutting plane during revision surgery; and for the preoperative evaluation of joint position so that joint position can be compared with the planned joint position during revision surgery ([@CIT0006]).

For intraoperative assessment, surgeons needed a reliable objective assessment for comparing joint line position in every anatomical position before taking surgical steps. No study has been found in the relevant literature that has assessed the joint line position in the same manner during revision knee surgery ([@CIT0003], [@CIT0004], [@CIT0008]). In our first experience with the joint line assessment technique, we found that the tibial cut position was not consistent with the planned position in 12 of 44 cases (27.3%) ([@CIT0006]).

A new simple method has been described for intraoperative assessment of knee joint line position using the contralateral knee radiograph. The evaluation method is based on measuring the position of the distal femoral cut on the tibial plateau contralateral to the unstable knee. The method can be applied during all types of knee revision surgeries, and in our opinion it is time-consuming and cumbersome. Further studies should be performed to determine the accuracy and reliability of this technique when compared to other techniques, such as a navigation system for intraoperative assessment.

Joint line positions were classified by the K-L radiographic assessment method ([@CIT0011]). This study found that the contralateral knee radiograph was a more reliable tool for the assessment of knee joint line than the ipsilateral knee. Furthermore, all the results in our study were consistent with the results determined by the K-L classification system, which confirmed the validity of the contralateral knee radiograph in our patients. Furthermore, the measurement using this method proved to be a convenient and reliable method of assessment for determining joint position.

After measuring the joint line position using the contralateral knee radiograph, surgeons can compensate any technical error in the original joint line position before the final surgical procedure. The joint line position can be easily adjusted simply by modifying the planned joint line position.

Assessment of joint line positions in our patients showed that the planned joint line position was better than that achieved intraoperatively. On the average, the final position was not achieved by a change of 7.11 mm in the tibial joint line position and 7.21 mm in the femoral joint line ([Table 1](#T0001){ref-type=""table""}). However, because of the different results recorded before and after knee arthroscopic surgery, arthroscopic surgeons do not always adjust exactly for planned results. A surgeon\'s first choice is usually a modification of the original joint line position.

Abstract

:To determine whether the design and alignment of the tibial component of unicompartmental knee replacement in varus affect the mechanical alignment of the tibial component using computed tomography. The alignment of the tibial component of 11 patients from one surgery team was determined with computed tomography and compared with computer simulated radiographic measurements. The alignment was determined by measuring the angles of the tibial component relative to the mechanical femoral axis, mechanical medial joint space axis, and the proximal tibial medial reference point. Patients were assigned to one of three groups based on the shape of the tibial component (stacked or angled tibial tray) and the location of the tray in relation to the medial joint space, which was either anterior, posterior, or medial. We found no correlation between the measured angle or rotation and the computer simulated measurements. Furthermore, angle and rotation had no correlation with the severity of tibiofemoral disease or with the size of the medial joint space, weight, or height of the patient.

Question

:Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement?

1. Introduction

The first unicompartmental knee arthroplasty was performed by Jameson et al[1] in the mid-1960s. The technique has undergone extensive development and remains the primary treatment for unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee.[2, 3] A tibial component that has been studied extensively is the stacked or angled tray with the tray secured directly onto the natural tibial plateau. This technique allows for a high degree of accuracy with regard to the mechanical alignment of the tibial component, and several studies have indicated positive clinical outcomes.[4–8] In theory, a properly aligned unicompartmental knee arthroplasty has been suggested to restore the kinematics of the native knee and thus lessen tibiofemoral load. Several studies have compared the alignment of a correctly aligned stacked vs an improperly aligned nonstacked, or angled, tibial component and have found no significant difference in clinical outcomes.[4, 9]

We hypothesized that improperly aligned tibial components affect the mechanical alignment of the component after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty; furthermore, we suggest that the resulting malalignment can lead to pain. Several studies have shown a low prevalence of pain after tibial component replacement surgery.[10, 11] In contrast to previous recommendations,[6] we designed an analysis with four main questions. Does the mechanical alignment of a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, as measured by computed tomography, affect the mechanical alignment of the tibial component? Does the design of the tibial component, in particular, tray shape, affect the mechanical alignment of the tibial component? Does the amount of remaining tibiofemoral cartilage affect the mechanical alignment of the tibial component? Does the severity of tibiofemoral disease affect the mechanical alignment of the tibial component?

2. Methods

2.1. Subjects

We examined patients who had tibial component replacement and had preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging or spiral computed tomography) available for analysis. A magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed because computed tomographic scans cannot be performed on a moving patient.

This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.

2.2. Methods: Mechanical Axis and Location of the Tibial Tray

We analyzed the coronal and sagittal planes of preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic scans for all patients. The mechanical axis of the femur was defined as the line from the center of the lesser trochanter to the center of the femoral shaft.[11] The mechanical axis of the tibia was computed as the line perpendicular to the mechanical femoral axis. The preoperative and postoperative mechanical angle (relative to the femur) and rotation of the tibial component in the coronal and sagittal planes was computed ([Fig. 1](#FIG1){ref-type=""fig""}). The angle and rotation were measured relative to the mechanical tibial axis ([Fig. 1](#FIG1){ref-type=""fig""}). In the",1
"Question: Is tumour expression of VEGF associated with venous invasion and survival in pT3 renal cell carcinoma? Answer: 

2. You want to show that VEGF is expressed at a higher level in tumours that have evidence of venous and collecting system invasion and that the level of VEGF expression is associated with reduced survival in these patients.

3. You collect serum samples of patients with pT3a and pT3b tumours that are later staged according to the 1997 TNM classification.

Answer:

The results found that the VEGF level in the serum of pT4 patients did not differ from level in patients with pT3a disease. Serum VEGF level was not significantly associated with overall survival. Serum levels of VEGF in patients with T3b disease did not differ from those in patients with pT3a disease. VEGF was not independently associated with venous invasion in the multivariate analysis. However, tumour expression of VEGF correlated significantly with tumour stage and tumour grade.



Introduction and study design The angiogenic factor, VEGF, is involved in the growth of solid tumours and is overexpressed in a variety of tumour types. Little is known about the potential role of VEGF in T3 tumours. We undertook this study to assess the relationship between clinical features and serum VEGF expression, investigate angiogenesis as a prognostic indicator and provide a direct comparison of VEGF expression and prognosis in pT3a and pT3b tumours.

Patients and methods This study included patients with pT3 renal cell carcinoma who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy from 1990 to 1997 at the Vancouver General Hospital. Clinical details including tumour grade, patient demographics, tumour pathology and surgical data, as well as angiogenesis-related data were collected. Blood samples and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were collected from each patient. Serum and tissue expression of VEGF were assessed by indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively. Association of serum VEGF expression with clinicopathologic features and angiogenic factors was assessed by univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis.

Results The median baseline VEGF level in T3a patients was lower than for T3b patients (1.97 and 5.11 ng/ml, respectively; p=0.008). In patients with pT3 lesions, median serum VEGF was 7.4 ng/ml (range 1.9-25), and median intratumoral VEGF was 1.6% (range 0-36). In patients with pT3a lesions, median serum VEGF at follow-up was 7.4 ng/ml and median intratumoral VEGF was 3.7%. In patients with pT3b lesions, median serum VEGF was 2.1 ng/ml but median intratumoral VEGF was 1.6% (p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, the median serum VEGF level was higher (p=0.02) in T3b tumours (n=15) [median 5.10 (range 2.11-27.6)] compared to T3a tumours (n=10) (median 2.15 (range 0.97-4.86) ng/ml).

Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate that serum VEGF is associated with local expression in primary pT3 renal cell carcinoma, with a lower serum VEGF level in patients with pT3a lesions. Tumour stage, tumour grade and lymph node involvement are independent prognostic indicators of RCC.

Question: The author lists the following as limitations of this study

1. Since pT3 patients with venous invasion had a lower baseline VEGF serum level, the VEGF value in the survival analysis is confounded because it is higher in those with poor prognosis. This confounder could be addressed by analyzing the association between baseline factors, including angiogenic factors, and survival.

2. The study was an open-label study which did not involve blinding. The choice of the chemotherapeutic agents may have confounded the statistical outcome in this subgroup analysis.

Answer:

1. Patients with pT4 disease had a higher level of VEGF expression than patients with pT3 disease. However, there was no difference in the VEGF expression level between patients with venous invasion and patients without venous invasion in the pT3 subgroup. Therefore, this result does not mean that VEGF can predict the outcome in these patients.

"Question: Injury and poisoning mortality among young men--are there any common factors amenable to prevention? Answer:  What were the common factors in the two countries?

Introduction {#S1}
============

Aging (life at the top of the life table) of the population leads to an increase in incidence of injury-related deaths. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), injury is the third leading cause of death globally, after cardiovascular disease and cancer, and it has been projected to surpass infectious and parasitic diseases even among children ([@B1]). Of these two, injury deaths are considered to result from individual behavior; they are also seen at a broader societal level as the result of urbanization (the increasing migration from rural to urban/developed areas); rapid technological modernization leading to more motor vehicles; and unsafe work conditions, which are likely to play a prominent role in the United States where the burden of injury is greater and is increasing ([@B2]). A recent study showed high mortality for traffic injuries among young men in the United States ([@B3]); however, it found no significant change over time. We therefore undertook a more systematic analysis of injury mortality among young men by country and time of analysis (to see what temporal trends were detectable). Because the focus of our analysis lies in the United States, we analyzed injury mortality among males aged 15--24 in the United States and among males (and females) aged 15--17 in Finland. From these analyses, we identify several important risk factors.

Materials and Methods {#S2}
=====================

Injury deaths in the United States were analyzed using the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Mortality Database \[National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\]. Using the data reported by NVSS, we examined the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) *International Classification of Diseases, Chapter X, Injury and Poisoning* (ICD~10~ code W00--W19) mortality rates (15--49 years) and death counts by race/ethnicity (i.e., Caucasian, African American, Asians, and ""Other"") and age group (i.e., 15--24). These data were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) *International Classification of Diseases, Chapter X, Injury and Poisoning* (ICD~10~ code W00--W19) mortality rates and death counts by race/ethnicity (i.e., Caucasian, African American, Asians, and ""Other"") and age group (i.e., 15--24).

In Finland, injury mortality was analyzed from the Finnish Centre for Paediatric and Juvenile Health (CAPHO) database, covering injuries between the years 1990 and 2010. Each case was individually checked to identify injury mortality, and death certifications with injury as the cause of death were selected. The injury data were coded according to the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10). Only deaths caused by an external cause were used as the basis for the analyses. We analyzed age-standardized incidence rate (AS) and mortality rate for all injuries and by injury mechanism.

Results {#S3}
=======

In the United States, the injury mortality rates were 4.21 (3.48--5.06) per 100,000 for all injuries among young men and 2.59 (2.02--3.24) per 100,000 among 15--24-year-old males aged 15--17. In other words, male adults aged 15--17 account for two-thirds of the deaths among young men in the United States. The injury mortality rates increased throughout the study period by a factor of 1.7 for all injuries and by a factor of 1.6 for external causes among 15--17-year young adults (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}).

To reduce the fatality risk in an injury event (mortality rate), it is essential to prevent the occurrence of the injuries ([@B4]). For example, preventing the initial injury is one of the most critical factors in reducing mortality rates as it minimizes the chances of serious injury. This requires changing the behavior of persons who are prone to injury, including those of violent behavior (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}). One of the major factors influencing the occurrence of injuries is the motor",1

Question: What is the appropriate body mass index cut-off to identify patients that have a significantly higher risk of having obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?

Question: How long should the patient continue CPAP therapy if we can determine, by clinical score, that there is no increase in the AHI?

Question: A 59-year-old woman presents for initial CPAP prescription. After a brief history, in particular noting her recent weight gain of about 45 pounds, an examination reveals a BMI of 42. Is it appropriate to prescribe CPAP in this patient, or should it be discontinued?

Question: How much weight loss should an individual patient with OSA, obesity, or morbid obesity lose prior to CPAP therapy (or another continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment) and can we predict the success of a new CPAP user based on our current knowledge?

Question: When an individual is prescribed CPAP therapy or BIPAP therapy, should they be prescribed CPAP or BIPAP? If you choose CPAP, use a pressure that will be tolerated by the patient.

Question: How many CPAP machines do you have? Do you have enough for OSA patients? Has CPAP saved lives by treating or preventing death or morbidity? How effective is OAHI in predicting complications?

Question: What other factors should we consider before prescribing CPAP therapy in obese patients?

Question: Obese patients often present to the sleep center for evaluation for CPAP adherence or prescription for CPAP. What should one consider when recommending CPAP to an obese patient?

Question: I have had a full overnight PSG to help me diagnose severe OSA with severe airway obstructions and to help guide CPAP prescription. Despite that, I remain as an obese male with a BMI over 30. I will be starting CPAP therapy on Friday, January 20 (next Friday). Please advise me regarding my chances of a successful CPAP trial.

Question: Which are the most common problems in very obese patients (e.g., neck circumference) when they are undergoing CPAP treatment? (e.g., nasal congestion; dry mouth; morning headache; weight gain; etc.)

Question: Is CPAP successful in treating snoring, but does not adequately treat high blood pressure (hypertension) or OSA? (If the answer to that is ""yes"", please list out the clinical parameters, etc.)

Question: Is there a ""threshold"" for normal-to-severe (as in the apnea plus hypopnea index) AHI in obese people? e.g., should AHI = 0 for obese people and should it be < 1/hr for the normal-to-obese?

Question: Is Lateral Pharyngeal Collapse (LPC) an appropriate target for the surgical therapy of OSA patients?

Question: Obese patients who have a good response to CPAP or BIPAP therapy are likely to continue this treatment.

"Question: Is the Distance Worth It? Answer:  Is the Distance Worth It?
As a graduate student I should know that a good abstract answers the question to whom and what the research is addressed to. I usually try to get a few sentences, which are not too long, to answer that question. I know that scientific publication doesn't always have to have a long description or even a full abstract. What is too long?

An obvious answer is just like ""We study..."". But what other answers are OK? How much space is too much for one sentence with only one important point?

For instance, a common response is ""We study..."" followed by ""an alternative approach..."". The first sentence is fine. But I don't understand (with a certain degree of sarcasm) how the second sentence can be so long. Also, what is the second sentence about? Is just a description of the alternative approach? I'm asking from the point of view of scientific writing, not from the point of view of science (it is not my aim yet).

Another possible answer I have seen is ""We study...""  followed by a list of methods, which is a description of the approach. But I'm not sure if it makes sense to use a list of method names as a summary of the results.

I guess I'm not the only one who is confused here. Any ideas?

Answer:

There's no ideal space limit for an abstract. How it's written, structured, and structured by the author affects the readability. If the abstract is too long it does nothing for you.

If an author is describing or criticizing his own work and gives a list of methods, he's basically telling people how to reproduce the work. You're telling people the methods instead of showing them. So you're creating a barrier between yourself and future users and the information conveyed by this abstract could be used to avoid people from getting to your work.

If you want to give a summary of your results it could be something along the lines of, ""A previous researcher (or previous researcher x, y, or z) proposed that a zig-zag pattern in the shape of a line would be a more efficient way of measuring the size of a plant species than the square root of leaf area, so we measured a line in shape to evaluate if this is the case.""

If an author is describing a new approach, he could write something along the lines of, ""This work proposes the use of a new approach to evaluating leaf size as a part of determining the species name for the plant."", along with how to use the method.

It's usually acceptable to say that the new method was a modified version of another and say things like, ""Approach A was modified version of this."" The reason you do this is to inform people of the reason that the approach exists. With a list of methods, one of the purposes is to list them; the other is to inform the reader where they can go to learn more, should they be interested.

You should keep in mind that in general if there is a method description, it should end with the words ""and here is how to use the method."" If you don't, the reader may not understand what exactly it is you're describing. If you give the methods as a listing (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), it's as if you've told them how each method can be implemented.

So, in a nutshell, you shouldn't write any more than one sentence for the title and one or two sentences for the abstract. That should be enough to communicate the information, and if you have to write more, you're overstating what should be communicated.

""Approach A was modified version of this"" gives the reader more information, whereas ""Approach A"" is more ""empty"" as it doesn't convey any extra information apart from pointing them in the right direction. People are not that interested in describing the method per se anyway, what they want is the result. One of the purposes of writing a paper is to get the results out to an audience in the shortest time possible. If you take the time to describe the method too, that takes away from time spent presenting the results. If they don't need to take that much time for a description, do not write too much.

An example of what I mean by this would be the description of a new approach you might use to measure the size of a large leaf to measure its species. Your description might say something like, ""We used a method using a square array instead of a square root to measure the size of the leaves. A large leaf was measured to demonstrate that this does not affect the measurement of the plant."" Then you need to be a little creative, and say something like, ""We got a very large leaf to get an adequate sample size."" You could explain why you",1
"Question: Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling? Answer:  Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling. Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic and sedative-hypnotic used to control the symptoms of schizophrenia. The study found that compared to placebo, aripiprazole significantly increased the risk of pathological gambling (PG) in adults with schizophrenia. There are multiple risk factors for PG including early age of onset, positive family history, substance use and mood disorders. Although age and mood disorders were ruled out in this study, the authors could identify only antipsychotic use and PG as risk factors (with low rate of substance use). Despite there being an extremely low rate of PG (only one patient with a 12 hour-daily gambling episode), previous prospective PG studies on psychiatric populations yielded significantly higher rates of PG than this study (one study found that 5% of patients with mood disorders were pathological gamblers, another study found that 4% of patients prescribed antipsychotics were pathological gamblers). An increased PG rate was not found in psychiatric or medical patients without schizophrenia. This is an important point of the study as most PG articles focus solely on the rate of PG in patients experiencing symptoms. Why then did the study yield a significant increase in PG in patients prescribed aripiprazole, a drug with no known link to gambling behaviour or gambling-related symptoms? This may suggest that there are unknown risk factors for pathological gambling in schizophrenia. It must be stressed that although this study found Aripiprazole significantly increased the risk of PG in patients with schizophrenia, it did not exclude patients who already had a predisposition for PG. Therefore, a diagnosis of PG may be made much sooner in the population prescribed antipsychotics. The findings also suggest that prescribing physicians should be aware of the possible increased risk of PG in patients prescribed antipsychotic medication. Additional research is needed to understand the pathophysiology of this phenomenon.

Question: Is this type of question appropriate for the section of the paper, ""Methods""? If this question is appropriate, state exactly where in this section to place it. A literature search for both aripiprazole and pathological gambling yielded no similar studies. In fact, the only studies using antipsychotics and pathological gambling were controlled clinical trials evaluating the effects of antipsychotics in the treatment of gambling. These studies showed antipsychotics to be safe when used in the treatment of pathologic gambling, and were consistent with those studies assessing the safety of antipsychotics in patients with other psychiatric illnesses. If this question is appropriate, also explain how the questions are specific to the study. The population is that of patients with schizophrenia on Aripiprazole, a drug used for the treatment of this illness, and with a specific set of symptoms or behaviors, namely ""psychotic symptoms."" There is evidence that an additional risk factor for pathological gambling is the presence of a co-occurring mood disorder; no such other co-occurring psychiatric condition was found in this population. However, it must be stressed that this is a descriptive study. This study was not designed or set up to assess risk factors for PG. PG itself, while linked to many risk factors, is a very rare disorder. No other controlled studies were conducted to test the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying PG. In the study, the authors did test for risk factors as well as for the association between the risk factors and gambling. The purpose of the study was to identify if antipsychotic medication affects PG in an at-risk population. The questions asked in the study are specifically designed to test whether antipsychotic medication increases the incidence of pathological gambling (PG) in this population. The questions were appropriate for the study.

Question: What is your hypothesis for the study? Do you have a hypothesis for the study of whether antipsychotic treatment reduces the incidence of pathological gambling? A hypothesis in science is a theoretical explanation for how the world works. In science, hypotheses must be testable and be consistent with the results. Before the studies can be conducted, a hypothesis is needed based on previous studies or the current knowledge or experience of the investigator(s). It is not necessary that all the findings of the proposed experiment will confirm the hypothesis. This is an essential tenet of experimental hypothesis testing. The hypothesis in this case is: Antipsychotics increase the incidence of PG. This study did not have a hypothesis, since it was a descriptive and retrospective study of a relatively uncommon condition. This study is purely observational, and therefore not hypothesis-driven. The researchers merely wanted to know: Is this happening to any other patients with schizophrenia on this same drug? Since the study was of this population, there was no basis to formulate a theory or hypothesis relating to the purpose of the study. The primary purpose of this study was to identify any association between the usage of antipsychotics and the development of pathological gambling; therefore, in order to do this, questions similar",1

"Question: Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma? Answer:  Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma?

Answer:

By:

Cancer Sci 108, 1655-1658 (2017)

Commentary:

It should be stressed that the authors stated that even though the study was not positive, the addition of induction chemotherapy still has an important role in the treatment of stage IVA and stage IVB cancer. Although both of these patient groups have received very effective chemotherapies and better radiation regimes as well as newer drugs like targeted therapy agents, there still remains a need to give induction chemotherapy or at the very least, palliative chemotherapy to get a better overall outcome. Although this was thought to be a study which showed that induction therapy was not useful, there was no mention on the potential complications, side effects, or other significant risks that might be associated with this regimens. The authors of this study also claimed that there was no mention that induction chemotherapy might enhance the treatment response and improve the overall survival. This needs to be considered because the authors of this study did not assess the potential beneficial effects and advantages of giving induction chemotherapy in their study design so it is a moot point whether this study was able to answer the question: “Do induction chemotherapy have a role in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma?”.

Question: After a series of studies, the consensus seems to have finally been obtained: radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy are the standard of care for the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Does the same apply to the treatment of Stage I non-keratinizing carcinoma of the nasopharynx?

Answer:

By:

Cancer Sci 108, 1659-1663 (2017)

Commentary:

This study was a multicenter randomized trial that showed that there was no significant difference seen in clinical outcomes or survival benefit with adjuvant radiotherapy in stage I or II non-keratinizing type nasopharyngeal cancer. However, the overall complication rates were significantly higher in the adjuvant treatment arm, which resulted in a poorer quality of life. Therefore, it can be argued that, because the toxicity from chemotherapy was found in the adjuvant settings, it might interfere with the overall quality of life and thus, this study does not support the use of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with Stage I and II non-keratinizing type carcinoma. The benefit with radiotherapy needs to be established further.

Commentary:

Although the study clearly showed that there was no significant difference seen in outcomes for patients with stage I non-keratinizing carcinoma and stage I keratinizing carcinoma, this study does provide some additional information such as the potential benefit seen in patients with non-keratinizing tumors when adding concurrent chemotherapy to surgery and radiotherapy. This is in addition to what was known already from studies showing that, in locally advanced disease, the addition of concurrent chemotherapy and/or additional treatment with radiosensitizer might help improve outcomes.

Commentary:

We should first acknowledge that this is a study that showed that induction chemotherapy, which was given after the completion of the main treatment, did not improve survival in patients with non-keratinizing carcinomas of the nasopharynx. However, this was not a randomized controlled trial and there are significant limitations to the study because of the retrospective nature, which makes the study vulnerable to several biases and confounders, including different chemotherapy regimens and a different radiation technique. Thus, the study does not support nor refute the use of induction chemotherapy before or after the completion of radiation and concurrent chemotherapy because of these deficiencies and thus, the evidence level of the study does not allow that we can make any conclusion about the use of induction chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal cancer.

"Question: Is Chaalia/Pan Masala harmful for health? Answer:  Is Chaalia/ Pan Masala harmful for health?

Introduction

We have been discussing the ingredients that could be harmful or beneficial for the body. We have also given examples of ingredients that can be used in ayurveda, but are not useful in other systems of medicine, such as Western and Traditional Chinese medicine.

It is now necessary to discuss about ingredients useful for a particular system of medicine or health.

1. Ingredients Useful in ayurveda

Q.1: Are pan masala, chaalia, and soya bad?

Pan masala is the cheapest but dangerous kind of chewing tobacco that is not a good habit for the body. The best pan masalas are without tobacco and should contain the right mixture of spices.

Chaalia is a natural and safe way of consuming tobacco, as it does not contain any chemical substances, carcinogens or any other harmful effects. If you are really addicted to it, we can even suggest you to have no tobacco pan masala, but if you are just using it to chew, you can continue with this safer form. But the best pan masalas without tobacco contain only herbs and not any poisonous ingredient. They are suitable for adults and children and can be added in different recipes.

Soya should be used with caution. It can be consumed with a maximum 1 oz if we have to discuss its health benefits. It contains toxic elements which can seriously disturb the body, especially if someone has a weak digestive system. Soya should be consumed with great care.

Q.2: Are pan masala, chaalia and soya good?

It requires more research to determine the exact health benefits of pan masala, chaalia, and soya. This is a major area of research, and much of the information that is available is contradictory or based on unreliable research. We have to be cautious about the health effects of smoking, as research is not consistent with regard to the health benefits or risks associated with it.

Q.3: What is the quality of pan masala, and how to identify the quality?

Q.4: Are pan masala and chaalia different?

Although pan masala and chaalia have some common ingredients, they differ in ingredients, which are mostly fruits, nuts, herbs, seeds, and spices. For example, pan masala has tobacco, and chaalia has tobacco, but both use herbs and spices. Thus, if you can find pan masala without tobacco, that would be the safe and healthy choice. It contains only the right mixture of herbs and spices.

Q.5: Is chana dal available in pan masala?

Q.6: Should I take 1 tbsp of honey after chewing tobacco?

"Question: Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus? Answer: Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus? The journal requires that authors include a full abstract, but they could just put an overview, and include a one to two sentence abstract on their CV.

I am not a specialist in this field and do have an interest in it. I am a researcher, who, working within my area of expertise, can put a hypothesis forward.

As it is in many fields, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence in the absence of robust scientific evidence, with many theories explaining this as originating from the use of cervical nerve root blocks in these patients (which then have been transferred to other techniques or modalities and so on).

These could be cervical facet arthrodesis, cervical epidural steroid injections or cervical joint decompression by way of laser or radiofrequency. As most practitioners are not aware of the scientific evidence for these techniques, then the evidence is not well known to those performing this work. It is my opinion that the workup of chronic tinnitus patients should begin with a search in the literature, to see if there is any information on the techniques they are using. We are only too happy to perform them on patients that respond, but only if this work is supported.

I don't think we need to jump on to the whole 'this technique was popular with blah blah' bandwagon. At the moment it is just a hypothesis with an absence of rigorous scientific evidence. Perhaps, but if not, can we not just wait until some good research comes out?

Answer: The journal requires that authors include a full abstract, but they could just put an overview, and include a one to two sentence abstract on their CV.

The abstract should briefly state the problem with no details about the participants.

Question: What are the most important factors of the tinnitus and its management? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the questions What are the most important factors of the tinnitus and its management?The journal requires that authors include a full abstract, but they could just put an overview, and include a one to two sentence abstract on their CV.

Are you alluding to the fact that there is just a lack of research in this area, or it being a contentious area of research?

The lack of research is a difficult question to answer objectively given the multitude of contributing factors so the best we can do is look at the evidence that is out there.

We have tried to go through some of the papers from the last couple of years that may have an influence in the management of patients with either cervicogenic tinnitus or somatic tinnitus based on the patient’s presenting condition.

In terms of managing patients with cervicogenic tinnitus the following key factors should be considered:

1. Patient should have severe, chronic and disabling tinnitus2. If this has begun following the onset of a neck injury, with no other precipitating factors3. This must be in the posterior neck muscles, not the neck joint4. The muscles that are involved should be tested either through electrical stimulation or physical examination and palpation 5. If in doubt over the location and type of tinnitus the patient is then having an MRI of the cervical spine with or without Gadolinium contrast.

In terms of managing patients having somatic tinnitus, the following key factors should be considered:

As with patients having cervicogenic tinnitus, it is very important if there is a change on the frequency and / or amplitude of the tinnitus, that the area which the tinnitus is emanating from is identified precisely.

Question: What is the relationship between chronic tinnitus and the ear and the neck?

The neck is a relatively small structure. The area of the auditory cortex in the brain which is responsible for hearing is only 5 cm of the brain cortex to the vertex. The auditory cortex is not separated by skull at all, but actually in contact. The ear is in contact with the outside (a hole) and is completely encased by the skull bone itself so as there is a continuous path. Therefore there cannot be any mechanical or chemical damage to the ear or the auditory cortex during all the time that tinnitus is being heard.

The neck on the other hand can only be divided into several parts by vertebrae. The most important of these is the skull base with the C1 and C2 vertebrae just below. There is no continuity from the skull to the ear so all damage that occurs may be a mechanical or chemical in nature.

As tinnitus has been found to occur in most patients that have a neck injury, but does not occur as commonly in",1
"Question: Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory? Answer:  Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question. The main research question: Are patients with asthma according to the Allergic Sensitization and Phenotype (the ASAP phenotype, including the AIR approach) phenotypically non-asthmatic or are they phenotypically very asthmatic, with very high inflammatory activity? The rationale behind your research: The AIR approach may be useful for the phenotypical evaluation of patients with asthma and also for the study of the inflammatory pathomechanism of allergic airway disease. This approach, when applied to asthma patients, may allow more effective treatment, including avoidance strategies of known factors that are associated with asthma exacerbation, such as exposure to indoor allergens or air pollutants in sensitized patients.

The ASAP approach allows for more homogeneous studies and the use of different treatments according to asthma phenotypes. There is, however, no consensus on the definition and assessment of asthma phenotypes. A detailed description of sputum neutrophilia is currently missing for most asthma phenotypes. The sputum and systemic inflammatory markers were not measured for all patients. The sputum samples were collected and measurements of several inflammatory markers (serum and sputum IL-6, TNF-α, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and eosinophils) were performed as described [6, 7].

Methods The full study protocol is summarized in the article ""Assessment of sputum and systemic parameters of inflammation in the AIR approach"" published in BMC Pulmonary Medicine 2016;16:42--50 [7]. The full research protocol and statistical analysis plans are available on request from the corresponding author.

Results The patients (n = 60) included in the study were classified according to the AIR approach [6] into the following four phenotypes: no allergy (n = 20) asymptomatic patients with a negative skin prick test (SPT) who had no exacerbations and had normal indices of inflammation in the airways. An association between asthma and sensitization to foods was found in 35% of these patients. Symptoms of asthma and markers of eosinophilic inflammation (e.g. IgE levels, peripheral blood eosinophil counts) were not found in these subjects. Asymptomatic patients with a positive SPT (with or without symptoms) (n = 16) consisted of patients with allergy to cow's milk proteins and latex. Allergy to food was present in 50% of these subjects and symptoms of asthma were observed in 25%. ECP in the sputum was not elevated in all 16 asymptomatic sensitization patients, in whom asthma was not observed despite allergy to cow's milk/latex. Markers of neutrophilic inflammation were raised in these 16 patients. These patients had a low level of serum IgG4. Symptomatic sensitization (n = 16) consisted of allergy to cow's milk, peanut or hen egg protein with or without nasal allergy. An association between asthma and sensitization to foods was found in 75% of patients in this group. Symptoms of asthma were observed in 75% of these patients and sputum eosinophilia was present in 87.5% of them. Markers of eosinophilic inflammation (e.g. serum and sputum ECP, serum and sputum IgE, peripheral blood eosinophil counts) were elevated in these patients. ECP in the sputum was elevated in only 20% of these sensitized patients. An unclassifiable phenotype (n = 4) included patients with allergy to food or pollens/irritants who had no atopy, but asthma, rhinitis and sputum eosinophilia were observed. Allergic rhinitis was associated with low serum IgE and elevated blood eosinophil counts.

Conclusions Patients with the no-allergy phenotype are not asthmatic, while patients with allergy to food are asthmatic, as evidenced by their disease history and their increased inflammatory markers in the airways and their circulation. The sputum from paucigranulocytic patients with allergen-induced disease is associated with increased levels of neutrophilic markers. These patients are asthmatic, suggesting that allergen-induced inflammation may be the dominant feature in the development of asthma. The AIR approach may be useful for the phenotypical evaluation of patients with asthma and also for the study of the inflammatory pathomechanism of allergic airway disease. For example, avoidance strategies should",1

"Question: Is Panton-Valentine leucocidin associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK? Answer:  What is your hypothesis answer?
======================================================================================================================================================================================

Background
==========

Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is a large bicomponent pore-forming toxin and a major virulence determinant of community-acquired methicillin resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) \[[@r1],[@r2]\]. Clinical presentation of severe infection usually includes systemic signs (fever, hypotension or shock) and clinical manifestations caused by toxic shock induced by release of inflammatory mediators (*e.g*. cytokines, chemokines and complement components) \[[@r3]\].

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is defined as MRSA infection acquired in community or out-of-hospital settings and that affects mainly healthy individuals, whereas healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) is associated with recent hospitalisation or stays in medical institutions, although cases of HA-MRSA among non-hospitalised individuals have been described \[[@r4]\]. In the last year, two highly virulent strains of CA-MRSA have been reported in the United Kingdom, ST36/USA300 in a UK healthcare worker \[[@r5]\] and ST8, clone Panton-Valentine leucocidin-positive New Oxford strain (ST8-PVL+) in a community-acquired infection \[[@r6]\]. PVL-positive ST8-MRSA has now been reported with increasing frequency in UK hospitals. In 2012, PVL-positive methicillin-susceptible *S. aureus* (MSSA) was detected in 7 patients, including four cases of hospital-acquired infections (HA-MRSA) and three cases of community-acquired infections (CA-MRSA) among patients infected with USA300, all of whom had a history of recent hospitalisation \[[@r7],[@r8]\].

In 2014, we reported the isolation of CA-MRSA ST36-PVL+ from an immunocompetent elderly male patient. This was a single case, and the patient may be a reservoir or transmitter of ST36-PVL+ MRSA. Another case of *S. aureus* bacteraemia (SAB) associated with PVL, in a healthcare worker, is reported \[[@r5]\]. We report in this letter a further three patients infected with ST8-PVL+ (two healthcare-associated and one community-associated) who carried PVL+ *S. aureus*. Two of them experienced life-threatening systemic signs of MRSA infection (one of the community-associated and one the healthcare-associated case), despite being treated with appropriate antimicrobial agents after *in vitro* susceptibility testing and before molecular confirmation of ST8-MRSA.

Methods
=======

Six episodes of SAB between 2012 and 2014 in patients with community-acquired infection were reviewed, comprising three PVL-positive ST8 and three PVL-positive ST36 isolates ([Figure 1](#f1){ref-type=""fig""}) with MRSA (methicillin-resistance, *pulsed field gel electrophoresis* (PFGE) type USA300) as the sole causative pathogen and with the following details on each case.

![Epidemic analysis showing (a) the first ST8-PVL+ isolates, (b) the first ST36-PVL+ isolates and (c) the two PVL-positive isolates ST8-PVL+ reported in this publication and (d) one case of ST36-MRSA documented in 2013 in an elderly patient \[[@r7]\].](1500620-f1){#f1}

Four of the six case reports were conducted on a clinical research ethics board (reference 10/H0605/19) and two were conducted on a research ethics committee (reference UHB 14/20). A clinical review was conducted for each case, and a public health notification was completed for all six patients. The notification described the epidemiological context of MRSA and the patient's clinical condition. The clinical management and treatment of patients with PVL-positive *S. aureus* infections and the clinical responses to therapy were reviewed for each case.

One of the patients had a staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, a complication of necrotising folliculitis and a previously unreported cutaneous manifestation of staphylococcal disease.

Answer:  Are even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery? Identify the author and the year of publication, and provide a detailed summary of the methods and main results of the paper.

Background: Cardiac surgery is increasingly being performed on patients with diabetes. The preoperative fasting guidelines state that patients with diabetes are not to fast before cardiac surgery. These guidelines are based on the assumption that surgical stress increases glucose concentrations and that fasting and the consequent glucose drop in the blood may cause severe hyperglycemia and trigger complications. However, there is no current evidence about the impact of a long-term elevated preoperative blood glucose concentration on long-term mortality in patients without diabetes.

Materials and Methods: In order to answer the Question, a systematic review of the literature between 2009 and 2016 was undertaken.

Results: We identified 7 studies and included 5 on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and 2 noncardiac surgery on a cardiopulmonary bypass-mimicking cardiopulmonary bypass (conduit). We found no studies that examined effects of fasting in diabetes.

Conclusions: Fasting seems safe in patients without diabetes. Preoperative fasting guidelines for patients without diabetes are justified. There is no evidence of an impact of preoperative fasting on long-term mortality in patients without diabetes mellitus 1 or 2. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to establish optimal preoperative fasting time frames for patients without diabetes.

The increasing age of the patient population has increased the number of patients subjected to major cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB; on-pump CABG (OP-CABG), cardiac transplantation, and circulatory arrest). This has also led to more often the development of complications, such as myocardial stunning (perioperative myocardial dysfunction for \>30 min postoperatively), perioperative myocardial infarction (transient or permanent), and perioperative neurological deficits (stroke), including postoperative delirium.1,2

Fasting of patients prior to surgery is required under current regulations based on good clinical practice guidelines to eliminate the stress response and to protect the patient from hypoglycemia, which occurs during surgery.3,4 However, there is growing evidence that fasting for such prolonged periods of time may not be as beneficial as previously thought. Previous studies of patients undergoing prolonged fasting have found that increased circulating levels of inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-) 6)5 and high levels of catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine) may negatively influence surgical stress responses,6–8 resulting in increased plasma glucose10 and insulin,9,11 and may be related to perioperative myocardial ischemia.12–15 High plasma glucose levels have been associated with increased morbidity; however, it is unknown whether high levels have any impact on survival.

There are no current guidelines suggesting how long a patient should not eat or drink before surgery. Current practice recommendations suggest that patients should be fasting from midnight on the day preceding surgery up to the evening before operation, regardless of their medical condition.3 A recent review,17 which was commissioned by the American Diabetes Association, concluded that perioperative blood glucose levels of patients should be monitored and optimized during the preoperative period, especially in the presence of risk factors such as diabetes. It concluded that while “the current recommendations for the patients’ fasting status prior to surgery are clearly reasonable, they are based predominantly on expert opinion, and data are insufficient to indicate to what extent such recommendations are necessary or can be safely implemented.”17

The aim of this systematic review was therefore to examine the associations between pre-existing impaired fasting blood glucose levels and outcome after cardiac surgery, both with or without CPB. In patients without diabetes it was also examined whether preoperative blood glucose levels have a harmful or beneficial association with postoperative mortality.

METHODS

For inclusion, studies were required to evaluate an association between preoperative fasting blood glucose levels and postoperative mortality, or between preoperative fasting blood glucose levels and postoperative outcomes, among patients without diabetes who had undergone major cardiac surgery (defined as one or more noncardiac coronary surgery) that required CPB, or cardiopulmonary bypass-mimicking CPB (on-pump-mimicking CPB; that is, circuit and pump that could be used with CPB). The primary objective of the present systematic review was to answer the main research question.

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations, to determine studies that investigated an association between preoperative fasting",1
"Question: Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer? Answer:  Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer?

Introduction {#j_raon-2018-0023_s_001}
============

Rectal cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in the world, with nearly half a million new cases occurring each year. The incidence of rectal cancer increases with age, the most common being adenocarcinoma, which develops from the mucosa lining of the rectum, accounting for approximately 30--40% of all malignant neoplasms.^[@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_001]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_002]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_003]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_004]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_005]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_006]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_007]^

In the case of adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum (LARR), transanal total mesorectal excision (TME) is considered the standard of care for patients with a tumour stage ≤1 and no evidence of local metastases as defined by the TNM classification (American Joint Committee on Cancer \[AJCC\]/Union Internationale Contre Le Cancer \[UICC\]).^[@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_001]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_002]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_003]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_004]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_005]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_006]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_007]^ The standard treatment for patients with higher stage tumours consists of either abdominoperineal excision (APE) or radical resection of the pelvis with formation of a permanent end colostomy.^[@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_001]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_002]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_003]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_004]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_005]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_006]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_007]^ The choice of a particular surgical procedure depends mainly on the position of the tumour and the depth of its penetration into the surrounding tissues.^[@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_002]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_003]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_008]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_009]^

In the case of LARR, the mesorectum is completely removed during surgery, and the mesorectum is routinely examined to estimate the completeness of the resection and to remove regional lymph nodes.^[@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_008]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_010]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_011]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_012]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_013]\,\ [@j_raon-2018-0023_ref_014]^ Patients with positive mesorectal margins and incomplete lymphadenectomy are excluded from the R 0 resection category.

"Question: Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator? Answer:  Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator?

Answer: Tidal volume delivery and positive pressure ventilation (PPV) are very important aspects of patient care in resuscitation [ 1, 2 ]. Theoretically, a manual PPV device should deliver accurate tidal volume delivery (V (t)) because the manual resuscitator provides the patient with a better seal to maintain a constant end-expiratory positive (PEEP) as a result of changing the volume being delivered, leading to better lung recruitment during PPV [ 3 ]. However, a recent review showed that only 50% of prehospital emergency department (ED) providers can ventilate a patient well with manual ventilation [ 4 ]. Further, only 33% of providers can ventilate patients adequately for a long period of time without fatigue [ 4, 5 ]. Therefore, we should be certain that we can accurately ventilate patients using manual resuscitators, especially in the ED. Furthermore, ventilating manually must not compromise the manual resuscitator operator and patient's airway patency [ 6 ]. However, there are scant data on the accuracy of manual PPV for resuscitation.

If a manual resuscitator uses a pressure increase or decrease (and thus volume increase or decrease) to create a greater pressure inside a patient's cuff that then creates a greater volume flow to the patient's lungs, then the patient should not lose a negative intra-thoracic pressure (volume) during manual PPV that is required to maintain the patency of the airway and prevent aspiration. If a manual resuscitator has a volume mode where the patient's exhalation volume is determined by a flow meter and a pressure generator produces the specified negative pressure to the patient's airway, then the patient must have a known volume exhaled during manual ventilation. For most manual resuscitators, a volume mode is not possible because a flow monitor is missing, a pressure generator is absent, or the manufacturer may have deemed it not necessary to be able to measure the patient's volume [ 6 ]. Furthermore, there are no data on the accuracy of manual PPV for the delivery of accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitators.

With the goal of better patient management in the prehospital setting, numerous advances in prehospital emergency care equipment have been developed. Recent research has demonstrated that using a manually operated resuscitator to deliver PPV improved patient outcomes, including mortality [ 7 ], and reduced rates of failure-to-resuscitate [ 8 ] in patients who were in cardiopulmonary arrest. However, there exists no published data on the accuracy of manually operated resuscitators. Most studies that report manual resuscitators' performance are of non-technical skills and technical skills [ 8, 9 ] and do not report the measurement of actual tidal volume delivery (V (t)). Our study is the first to report the accuracy of manual resuscitators. However, our investigation was performed in a controlled, monitored, artificial setting, rather than in an uncontrolled field setting. Further, we used volume mode rather than pressure mode.

In resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), manual ventilation is a common practice for prehospital ventilatory support. A recent analysis of a large international data set demonstrated that the best outcomes occurred when manual resuscitators were used to provide positive pressure ventilation [ 1 ]. A study conducted by Pouw et al. showed that for patients with shock, manual ventilation may provide as good a ventilation profile as a bag valve mask or a mechanical ventilator [ 2 ]. Therefore, accurate V (t) during manual PPV in OHCA patient is very important. However, a manual resuscitator should not compromise the operator's airway patency and deliver an accurate V (t) as determined during PPV, especially in an ED. There are no data published on manual PPV during CPR in an ED.

The goal of manual resuscitation is to provide effective ventilation of the patient, which will improve the patient's cardiovascular status and prevent barotrauma and aspiration. This is accomplished by delivering an appropriate pressure, with a known duration, inside the airways of a patient.

The primary aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of delivering a known tidal volume (V (t)) by using manual resuscitator during positive pressure ventilation in simulated cardiac arrest. Additionally, we aimed to determine the accuracy of delivering V (t) at five pressure levels for an approximate duration of four minutes, from a known volume mode of a manual resuscitator.

A manual resuscitator is defined as a tool that is designed to ventilate patients who have no access to anesthesia or mechanical ventilation [ 25 ]. Manual resuscitator is used in place of anesthesia or mechanical ventilation for many reasons: (a) anesthesia may not be readily available to a patient, (b)",1
"Question: Can increases in the cigarette tax rate be linked to cigarette retail prices? Answer:  Can increases in the cigarette tax rate be linked to cigarette retail prices?

In the fall of 1993, state excise tax rates were raised to 50 % and cigarette taxes remained at a record low of $1.77/pack; the price of domestic tobacco products rose almost immediately.

In the fall of 1993, state excise tax rates were raised to 50 % and cigarette taxes remained at a record low of $1.77/pack; the price of domestic tobacco products rose almost immediately to $2.80/pack. One year later the state tax rates were raised again, this time to $2.24/pack (in 1994); cigarette prices rose again, to $3.05.

In the fall of 1993, state excise tax rates were raised to 50 % and cigarette taxes remained at a record low of $1.77/pack; the price of domestic tobacco products rose almost immediately to $2.80/pack.

It is the responsibility of each citizen to be responsible for their own health

The price is a function of supply and demand, and demand is a function of consumer prices and income; there is no direct link, because the price of cigarettes is already at the highest possible level of demand/supply for the tobacco industry.

There is always pressure to raise tobacco taxes, particularly because of cigarette taxes in Canada, and that pressure can be seen in the American market, as well. However, it is the responsibility of each citizen to be responsible for their own health and money.

The cigarette tax rate has a direct effect on consumer prices of cigarettes, and this has an effect on the overall demand/supply, and the result should be an increase in price.

There is a direct, causal relationship between the cigarette tax and consumer prices - not only is the cigarette tax higher in the U.S. than Canada, the price at the store in Canada is higher compared to the states, and is a function of taxes in addition to other economic factors.

All taxes are to be paid equally at all stages of commerce: manufacture, production, storage, transportation, distribution, and retail.

Because of higher costs for tobacco in the U.S., prices of cigarettes (at both the wholesale and retail level) are higher in the United States compared to Canada, but that has little effect on the demand/supply, because cigarettes are a 'luxury good,' the price that the consumer is willing to pay for, is extremely high.

There will be no increase in taxes without an increase in consumer price, because there is no link between cigarette price and tax.

There can be more demand for cigarettes if there is higher income and less taxes.

Income is a factor, but an increased taxes is much more important because it takes into account the income of a smoker rather than the smoker.

An increase in the rates of tax may generate additional income for the Federal government.

But because consumers are not as influenced by taxation, the Federal government may have to raise more income through other means, that may have to be funded by future taxes or through new sources of revenue. This is part of the problem.

Because of this, the government of Canada can increase the tax on ""taxable goods"" much more than the current US Government.

The government has other options, however, such as raising taxes on other ""luxury items,"" which would have a higher impact on consumer spending

The impact is a greater increase in the cost of a pack of cigarettes, by as much as 10% or more.

There is no direct link between the price of cigarettes and the tax levied;

The price of cigarettes increases because of the increased taxes;

The increased taxes, for a pack of cigarettes, has little effect on the price of cigarettes as a whole, and does not influence how much consumers are willing to pay for a pack.

The Canadian government has chosen to levy extra tax, not because they have reduced the supply, but because they are able to extract more from consumers;

Because an additional excise tax can directly affect the price of cigarettes (if consumers become price sensitive), we must be careful to prevent the loss of tax base that could create more pressure against smokers.

This policy is much more likely to harm the overall economy of the country.

This may reduce people's incomes by taking more of the income people make from cigarettes.

The U.S. Federal Tax Court, in the case of United States vs. Hennegan, determined that the cigarette manufacturer can increase the cost of a pack by including additional ""stickers"" on the packaging, but cannot include additional taxes in the same package, because it would violate the rules of supply and demand.

There are different prices by region, state, and city.

"Question: Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children? Answer:  ""What are the causes of true esophagitis (VLEM) in children?""

Answer: In 1996, Al-Ebrahim and Bajic first described this lesion as a cause of true esophagitis (in children), and this was the initial presentation in all patients.[@pah071-B1] Their study was followed by the work of Stowasser et al. that characterized this entity as a subspecific mucosal disease or a form of gastroesophageal hypomotility without evidence for acid reflux or eosinophilia.[@pah071-B2] In 1997, Tarnasky et al. presented 5 cases of VLEM in their study, and hypothesized that it is idiopathic.[@pah071-B3] Later, Kugelman and Weitzman presented 7 further cases, and described the occurrence of VLEM in association with asthma.[@pah071-B4] More recently, Gokaslan et al. stated in their study that VLEM is a very rare inflammatory process of the distal esophagus that has no inflammatory signs and requires special treatment.[@pah071-B5]

Question: What is ""the correct definition of a 'truly' functional esophageal flap in children?""

Answer: In 1996, Al-Ebrahim and Bajic first described this lesion as a cause of true esophagitis in children, and their study was followed by the work of Stowasser et al. that characterized this entity as a subspecific mucosal disease or a form of gastroesophageal hypomotility without evidence for acid reflux or eosinophilia.[@pah071-B2] In 2005, Kugelman et al. characterized their lesion as a condition of gastroesophageal sphincter dysfunction, but they did not clarify whether it is associated with significant reflux.[@pah071-B6] In 2011, Kugelman and Weitzman presented 5 cases, and hypothesized that this is an inflammatory process.[@pah071-B11] Later, Gokaslan et al. presented 10 cases of their disease in the study.[@pah071-B12] However, it was a descriptive study and their definition of a ""true"" functional esophageal flap was not precise. We have no further information on how many subjects showed signs of reflux. Therefore, we believe that VLEM is an entity characterized by a lack of objective reflux symptoms that are typical for reflux disease and that it is not associated with erosive esophagitis.[@pah071-B5]

Question: Do VLEM patients need a more precise diagnosis?

Answer: Patients with ""true"" esophagitis should be treated as such, and we have no idea how many of these children also have typical gastroesophageal reflux. So, we do not believe that pediatric gastroenterologists should go for a more advanced evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux. The presence of an objective symptom of gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn) does not exclude the presence of true esophagitis.

Question: What are the differential diagnoses of VLEM compared to gastroesophageal (GE) reflux disease (GERD)-like symptoms?

Answer: Gastroesophageal reflux is a typical finding in an otherwise healthy child with heartburn, and only in rare cases will other disorders need to be assessed.[@pah071-B13] The spectrum of GERD-like symptoms in children is quite similar to that in adults. Most children with heartburn will respond to conservative treatment such as H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. antisecretory proton pump inhibitors or esomeprin).[@pah071-B14] Patients with non-peptic (acid-related) symptoms will respond to antisecretory medications. In contrast, patients with predominant symptoms of dysmotility or dyskinesia (heartburn, regurgitation) may receive prokinetic agents like erythromycin. However, there is not much evidence for these recommendations.

It should be noted that reflux is not always present in patients with dysmotility or dyskinesia, in children or in adults.[@pah071-B15] Therefore, reflux is not the only cause of these symptoms.[@pah071-B16] Other causes are e.g. GERD, hypertensive esophag",1
"Question: Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events? Answer:  Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events?

The answer is very straightforward:
YES

Hypoglycaemia can be defined as the decrease in blood sugar levels as a result of decreased insulin secretion. In the short term, it may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms such as neuroglycopenia, tingling, numbness, anxiety, muscle weakness, loss of consciousness, headaches or loss of consciousness. If untreated, the consequences of hypoglycaemia can be devastating, causing convulsions and coma. In the long run, it increases the risk of neurodegenerative complications (neuropathy).

Patients suffering from type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes have an increased rate of hypoglycaemia. This increase in hypoglycaemic episodes can be explained by the following:

-   In patients suffering from type 2 diabetes an impaired glucose clearance which results to a decrease in insulin secretion, a compensatory hyperinsulinemia and a progressive insulin deficiency

-   In gestational diabetes an impaired glucose tolerance secondary to pregnancy. Despite an increase in glucagon secretion, an impairment in glucose clearance results in hypoglycaemia.

Consequently, in patients with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, with a history of frequent hypoglycaemic episodes and increased rate of microvascular complications, there is an increased occurrence of cardiovascular complications and the risk of progression to cardiovascular disorders, compared with insulin-treated patients without hypoglycaemia.

In a scientific article entitled: 'Hypoglycaemia and the risk of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: the role of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and severe hypoglycaemia'published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, by Dr. John A. Jakicic et al., researchers report that the frequency of'self-reported episodes of severe hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes or a HbA1c level of 8.8% or greater was 12.2 per 100 patient-years. These results suggest that severe hypoglycaemia is an independent and strong marker of increased risk of future cardiovascular adverse events'. This article should not be a surprise to me. I had written in my blogs in 2016: [https://drnicollands.com/2014/09/31/the-case-for-self-management-of-type-1-diabetes-and-the-consequences-of-hypoglycaemia](https://drnicollands.com/2014/09/31/the-case-for-self-management-of-type-1-diabetes-and-the-consequences-of-hypoglycaemia).

I have been a member of the diabetes and endocrinology community, both online and offline, for a longtime and I know many practitioners, including myself, who have used hypoglycaemia as a tool to manage their diabetic patients. This article gives us no doubt in regards to the role of hypoglycaemia as a tool in the management of diabetic patients.

Another article, this time not published in a scientific journal, entitled:'Hypoglycaemia, the risk of coronary heart disease incidence and all-cause mortality - Results from The Danish National Register and the Danish Cancer Registry' published in the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism journal, reports that: 'In patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance, hypoglycaemia that leads to hospitalisation or admission to the intensive care unit is associated with increased risk of death or, in the case of hypoglycaemia leading to admission, increased CHD incidence'.

Furthermore, another article, also not published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, entitled: 'Hypoglycaemic episodes and mortality among people with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis' published in the International Diabetes Research and Treatment (IDF) journal, provides a very comprehensive and concise overview as for the increased risk of mortality with hypoglycaemia.

It is now time for the diabetes community to accept and to face more often the reality of hypoglycaemia. I have been a diabetic for nearly a quarter of a century. It is still a hard pill to swallow and to accept but I hope that we will do so before another year passes and another patient dies as a result of a hypoglycaemia.

This article does not intend to criticise any of the authors who reported about cardiovascular complications associated with hypoglycaemia but who should be commended for writing about it. This is a hot topic and we should all know that patients suffering from type 2 diabetes or from gestational diabetes are at the highest risk of frequent and persistent hypoglycaemia.

As many of you know, I am retired and that allows me to spend my time focusing on my health.",1
"Question: Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease? Answer:  Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease?

In your opinion, based on the available evidence, which of these surgical interventions is the method of choice? A. Duhamel B. Soave C. Interval colostomy D. Abdominoplasty E. Colostomy closure.

Answer: E

Key Concept: The transition zone is the location of transition from an aganglionic bowel to the colon in patients with Hirschsprung's disease.

Definition: The transition zone marks the junction where an aganglionic segment of the gut begins to transition into a more normal colonic environment. In patients with Hirschsprung's disease, the transition zone is present just proximal to the aganglionic segment and is demarcated on the rectal view by lack of perirectal gas and an abrupt change in bowel caliber when the anus is dilated.

In the upper (right) abdomen, the transition zone begins with a narrowing of the lumen, just proximal to the anorectal ring.

Pseudo-J-shaped transition zone is most notable in patients with a total colonic aganglionosis, in which the aganglionic segment ends abruptly.

Transition zone is usually noted in a short segment of colon during rectal examination; however, due to the lack of bowel movement and fecal stasis in an aganglionic bowel, the transition zone may not always be readily evident.

When an enterocolitis is present with fecal stasis, gas or fluid may be seen within the bowel distally in the transition zone, which may make the transition zone difficult to identify.

In patients with total colonic aganglionosis (TCA), the transition zone may not be present because the aganglionic colon is the only segment of the GI tract.

In patients with long segment aganglionosis (LS), the transition zone may not be present because the aganglionic segment ends abruptly and a continuous normal colon segment begins proximal to the aganglionosis.

Important: The transition zone is located proximal to the anorectal ring and is therefore a sign of intestinal obstruction. In Hirschsprung's disease, the transition zone is caused by lack of innervation of the proximal aganglionic colon and should not be confused with the distal obstruction due to the presence of dilated proximal colonic ganglia in the rectum, which is caused by the dilated aganglionic segment.

The transition zone on the rectal view is also important for determining the proximal extent of the aganglionic segment. The proximal extent of an aganglionic segment is usually described based on a colonoscopically verified length of colon from the anorectal ring down to the transition zone.

Question:

In which patient should the transition zone not be used as a diagnostic parameter?

A) A patient may have total gut aganglionosis due to a ganglioneuromatosis, in which case the transition zone may not be present

B) A child with chronic constipation, who has been treated with long-term laxatives in the absence of fecal incontinence, may have ""pseudo-transition zeros""

C) A patient with constipation in the presence of anal obstruction

D) In a patient with constipation in the presence of rectal obstruction from fecal impaction

Answer: D

Key Concept: Pseudo-transition zone is a phenomenon of chronic laxative therapy.

Definition: Pseudo-transition zone indicates that the transition zone is present, but is of minimal if any clinical significance or that the transition zone is absent. Therefore, in a patient in the absence of fecal incontinence, treatment with laxatives, and, possibly, chronic bowel obstruction, a true transition zone could mask the presence of aganglionosis. This can be misleading when making the decision to pursue surgical intervention in the setting of pseudo-transition zone.

Question: In a patient with constipation, diarrhea or both

A) Which of the following surgical procedures should be performed first?

(a) Duhamel procedure (b) Soave procedure (c) Interval colostomy

"Question: Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations? Answer:  Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations?

This is a scientific paper on how to answer yes or no in the above question about alternative, or adjunctive therapies for the treatment of asthma. First, I highly recommend you access and read my detailed paper about the scientific evidence (link). If you read that paper first, you will be better prepared to write an abstract for this question.

This is an abstract- writing session, and it is my opinion that you must demonstrate your understanding of the scientific and clinical literature on the topic to meet the criteria for this section on the General Surgery Board. That is not to say that anyone will judge how you use and explain the evidence. A peer-review panel, consisting of at least 2 board-certified pediatric surgeons, will determine whether you have the skills and knowledge necessary to compete in this section.

We need good abstracts. You should not attempt to rewrite or copy someone else’s abstract. This section is not about writing an abstract for someone else’s article; it is about writing an article about the scientific and clinical evidence. You should focus on the question: Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations?

This section focuses on how to answer yes or no about the answer to the question above. To answer the question, you must provide supporting evidence, not just opinion about the issue. Your abstract should also address the question.

Some of the guidelines will be helpful to you in thinking about this section. First, let’s think about why we ask, what is the evidence, and what are the results of the evidence. The following guidelines and instructions from the ACGME are helpful to remember.

The goal of an abstract section is to summarize the information needed to answer the question and the question for the application. The abstract can provide a glimpse of the content of the full paper.

You must briefly summarize the question and evidence. You must make a recommendation on the answer to the question.

Answer the Question: Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations?

Answers:

There is one scientific paper on how to answer yes or no in the question above; this study used a group of children with asthma. The paper has been published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. You can read the abstract and the entire paper for this study at link:

[1]

This study showed that the group treated with oral dexamethasone (0.8 mg/kg) for 2 days and the group treated with inhaled dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) for 2 days showed similar results in clinical improvement and peak expiratory flow measurement. Furthermore, the group treated with 0.8 mg/kg oral dexamethasone for 4 days was superior to the other two groups in terms of side effects.

There are no controlled studies on treating pediatric asthma exacerbations with oral dexamethasone. These studies were in adults.

Based on the following evidence, an abstract that recommends using either 0.8 mg/kg or 0.15 mg/kg oral dexamethasone cannot confidently answer “yes” or “no” to the question. If you wanted, you could summarize that the current evidence is insufficient to answer the question about oral dexamethasone. However, you should mention in your abstract that there were no differences about the length of hospitalization, the need for intravenous therapy, and adverse events between groups when using oral dexamethasone. The following evidence provides the rationale for that conclusion.

Lebwohl et al (2004), in an open label single-arm study, evaluated the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone in children with wheezing. The authors enrolled 41 children 3-15 years of age. The study included children with a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. In all children, the symptoms were treated with the following regimens:

Group 1: oral dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg for 4 days.

Group 2: inhaled budenoside and oral loratadine for 5 days.

The clinical improvement scores and the safety (adverse events) between groups were not evaluated. The change in peak expiratory flow measurements were significantly lower for children in group 2. This study showed that oral 0.6-0.9 mg/kg of oral dexamethasone for 4 days are effective in treating pediatric asthma exacerbations.

A woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and is treated with a lumpectomy. This is a routine procedure and the woman wants to know if she will have the same amount of pain in the days following the surgery. How large of a difference is there between the pain before and after surgery? Explain both the short term and long term risks and benefits of the treatment. Include references.

Answer: First, as stated previously, there is some evidence that suggests that ethnicity does have an effect on cancer outcomes in US populations. For example, a meta-analysis shows racial/ethnic differences in cancer-related mortality rates for several types of cancer in the US.

But, with regard to anesthetics, that evidence is mixed. Some studies have shown differences and others have not. For example, in an evaluation of cancer outcomes in a breast cancer surgical population, no racial/ethnic differences in outcomes were found when comparing Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic and Asian breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy with that same population of patients undergoing lumpectomy. But, in a study evaluating differences in anesthetic care for breast cancer surgery between US-born and foreign-born Hispanic breast cancer patients, poor quality anesthetic care was associated with increased cancer recurrence and decreased overall survival. (See also: How Can I Make Sure That Surgeon Is Not Wrong For My Condition?)

However, one group of researchers has conducted work that has shown differences in outcomes when comparing non-Hispanic and Hispanic breast cancer patients. The study had to be excluded from some meta-analysis studies, so the quality of the evidence is not as strong in some cases. (See also: How Can I Be Sure That Surgeon Is Not Wrong For My Condition?)

That being said, there does seem to be some evidence that there are differences. So for most purposes we should look at the evidence. And even where the evidence is mixed on outcome differences by race/ethnicity, the evidence should still be considered. (See also: How Do I Know My Surgeon Is Correct For My Condition?)

If the evidence was clear, then there would be no reason for a provider or patient to consider race/ethnicity in an informed consent process. But, the science is mixed or conflicting, so in some cases the evidence should be considered.

As for the question about pain, the most important piece of information that one could provide the patient is what type of anesthetics can be used after breast cancer surgery.

If you are familiar with the general anesthesia, then using some of the anesthetic protocols, one can use regional anesthesia as well. Some have also shown that the use of nerve block anesthesia can decrease the amount of pain that can occur following breast cancer surgery. And, if the patient needs it, the use of narcotic pain medications can also help.

So, I would recommend that the patient be told what type of anesthesia can be used and be asked about possible side effects. To determine the long term risk of anesthesia, I would suggest that the patient be told that the risks and benefits of anesthetics should be weighed after breast cancer surgery.

However, the answer to the question is that there would be no immediate long term side effects of anesthesia as a result of the surgery. It is the surgery that will have short and long term side effects.

The question is: What is the difference in pain following breast surgery between patients receiving epidural and general anesthesia?

Answer: There has been some mixed evidence that pain perception differs between epidural and general anesthesia. That is, there is evidence that patients who receive general anesthesia compared to those who receive epidural anesthesia are less likely to need a pain med during recovery, and that a certain amount of the pain experienced during recovery is unrelated to the type of anesthesia that is received. The difference seems to be at least a little less than would be expected for a double blind study. (See also: How Can I Have My Surgery Scheduled To Be Done As Soon As Possible?)

In terms of short-term pain, however, as little as 10 years ago there was some evidence that patients that received epidural anesthesia could experience more pain than those who did not have this type of anesthetic (i.e., in breast cancer surgery patients). But, the current meta-analyses that have compared the pain scores that have shown that patients given regional anesthesia had less pain in the short term. (See also: How To Choose Breast Cancer Surgery Option?)

As for any differences in patients’ perception of long-term pain, I could only find a meta-analysis from 2010 reporting that patients",1
"Question: Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects? Answer:  Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects? The TrialNet autoantibody-positive subjects are at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes, and are being followed in an extensive longitudinal study designed to identify as-yet-unknown diabetes susceptibility genes. One objective is to determine whether there is any predictive value in the performance of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for diagnosis of diabetes. The current study reports a set of results that were developed concurrently with a large ongoing epidemiological study (Project VaraTas) in Finland (Project VaraTas). A total of 2,061 ECL and 2,943 serum samples from 495 autoantibody-positive family members in Finland were analyzed for a previously published panel of islet-cell antibodies (ICA), GAD67 and insulin antibodies (IAA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and an extensive set of cytokines and chemokines. Of the 496 autoantibody-positive subjects analyzed with the ECL method, the median time from sampling to diabetes onset was 4.3 years. In ICA-positive, GAD67-negative, and IAA-positive subjects on insulin treatment at sampling, the median age at diagnosis was 2.6 years. In ICA-positive and GAD67-positives on no insulin treatment at sampling, the median age at diabetes onset was 4.3 years. In subjects on therapy with a mixture of insulin, the median age at diabetes onset in ICA-positive subjects was 4.5 years. The median time to diagnosis in ICA-negative and GAD67-positive subjects on no insulin treatment at sampling was 4.3 years. These results indicate a high prevalence of type 1 diabetes even among subjects from a relatively young age with autoantibodies. Although the ECL method seems capable of diagnosing type 1 diabetes accurately enough in some groups of patients, the method alone lacks the predictive value to identify autoantibody-positive subjects who are destined to develop diabetes early.

Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Follow up Question: Which Epigenetic Variants Are Associated with Type 1 Diabetes? What is the best evidence available that supports or rejects the existence and causes of epigenetic changes in islet cells? Is islet beta-cell DNA more easily methylated due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes? For the latter question, what is the best evidence that supports or rejects the existence and causes of epigenetic changes in islet cells? Which experimental evidence demonstrates that islet cells are subject to epigenetic changes? Which epigenetic changes have been described in association with type 1 diabetes? How does this evidence support or refute the existence, causes, and functions of epigenetic changes in islet cells implicated in type 1 diabetes? Which epigenetic markers are available for studying human islet cells? Which epigenetic markers are available for studying human islet cells? How can the epigenetic findings in type 1 diabetes be attributed to the islet cell and other cell types in the islet? How are epigenetic changes implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes related to those implicated in other autoimmune diseases and the response to immune-modulating therapy? Does this disease appear more similar to other immune-mediated diseases and the response to immune-modulating therapy compared to other diabetes complications on the basis of epigenetic changes related to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes? What is the best evidence for type 1 diabetes not being associated with epigenetic changes due to intrinsic causes? If epigenetic changes do cause type 1 diabetes, why do most adults with type 1 diabetes never manifest any of the known epigenetic changes in islet cells, pancreatic islet cells and immune effector cells, such as monocytes and lymphocytes? Do islet cells undergo epigenetic changes in all adult-onset type 1 diabetic patients, regardless of genetic or autoimmune background? What are the possible intrinsic causes for the absence of epigenetic changes in islet cells? Which factors are associated with a lower or higher percentage/fractions of islets or other human cells that can be epigenetically altered? How has epigenetic research contributed to a better understanding of type 1 diabetes? Is there any other potential role for epigenetic research in type 1 diabetes? Does the genome of patients with type 1 diabetes exhibit different types and proportions of DNA methylation compared to other types and proportions of DNA methylation?

"Question: Assessment of appropriate antimicrobial prescribing: do experts agree? Answer:  When should you choose a narrow-spectrum antibiotic?

The first step in writing a scientific paper is to answer a question. The question your paper should answer is this: How should a clinician prescribe an antimicrobial drug?

The paper you write will then need to go on to answer that question by answering the following five points:

Why should we care and why this review is justified (what exactly do we care about)?

What antibiotics are commonly being prescribed?

Where should the antibiotic be prescribed, i.e. what sites are common targets of these drugs?

How should the antibiotic be prescribed, i.e. what dosages and durations of treatment are common?

Are there any known risk factors that predict response and whether those factors are well-captured?

This is a fairly tough question to answer! We don't have the data, so for the purposes of this question, let's be a bit loose. For practical reasons, let's talk about penicillin for this one. We'll look at this question as it applies to all penicillins. It's actually easier to compare and contrast different antibiotics, and this way we'll make sure we aren't just writing a review of the topic and not actually addressing this question.

We should talk about these five things in this order and be briefer in the sections describing them so that the reader walks away with clarity of that information, not a full-length list. Remember, it's okay to break it up if it's too long. Here are the five things we should know about when selecting an appropriate therapy:

What antibiotics are commonly being prescribed?

What is commonly done is to prescribe an antibiotic and then look up what is commonly prescribed. This is called the reference antibiotic.
For example, many textbooks describe the reference antibiotic as amoxicillin. This is a very narrow-spectrum penicillin and should not be used in lieu of a broad-spectrum antibiotic if other sites of infection are likely to appear. Amoxicillin is commonly first-line therapy for common infections, such as pharyngitis, cellulitis, cutaneous abscesses and otitis media.

For penicillins class drugs, the reference antibiotic is typically clindamycin. It is rarely used instead of amoxicillin for cellulitis.

How should the antibiotic be prescribed, i.e. what dosages and durations of treatment are common?

To answer this we'll look at the antibiotic label, either an antibiotic package insert, a prescribing information (PI) or the package itself. Ideally you'll have the PI rather than looking at a package label unless it's a very large package of a very common antibiotic. You can usually get PI's for most medications from manufacturers or your national formulary. A national formulary is, in essence, an up to date and complete list of medications that is updated to reflect new information on medications' appropriate use and safety. The FDA (US) and PMPA (Canada) maintain and make available a free national formulary. The WHO and other international organisations have their own. A PI has the form of a table listing a medication and side effects, indications and contra indications, dosing and appropriate duration of therapy. What is listed in the table is not an indication of the drug's superiority over another antibiotic. These drug lists typically define an appropriate indication or indication duration for a particular drug based on its pharmacological properties, i.e. bioavailability, metabolism, efficacy, side-effects and toxicities. These lists are updated periodically with new information and are the basis for the WHO Essential Medicines List and the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.

For penicillins class drugs, the label typically states 500 mg q 6 hrs to 10 days, a wide interval, for community-acquired pneumonia. Because the indication is listed at 500 mg, not 800 mg, it does not make sense to increase the dose unless the patient fails to improve.

Are there any known risk factors that predict response and whether those factors are well-captured?

Well, this is tough because we don't have any data on factors that predict response to therapy. If antibiotics work at all, then they do not make the patient worse and will not result in the resolution of infection, however, if they fail to eradicate an infection, patients will be dissatisfied. If, on the other hand, a given antibiotic is not effective, a patient will continue being sicker because of the side-effects of being on an antibiotic and they may not be able to complete the full dosage regimen. Therefore, if you look at a risk factor in hopes that it will predict if patients will get sicker or better, you are trying to define the worst case so that they will get sicker. If your",1
"Question: Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases? Answer:  Is there a subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases?

Clinicians have a responsibility as primary care physicians to keep their patients well if we want them to be able to keep working (and stay economically useful). A lot of effort has been put into building and studying models of health care. Unfortunately, most models treat patients like assembly line widgets-each with their own distinct but similar problems, and for no other reason than to reduce costs. (See my comment above under ""Can we reduce costs without ruining health care? "" for the model that most closely matches this ideal of making everyone feel like a patient. What we are talking about today goes one step further--we want to optimize patient outcomes.)

To optimize patient outcomes, we have to get a better understanding of how each type of patient is different. The next time you feel bad, look at a patient in front of you and ask yourself this question: Is this a one-dimensional patient or does it tell a different story? How do you define your patient population? What are the things that you learn from your patients? One day a patient I cared for felt like a one-dimensional patient. He would come every 4 to 8 weeks, complain of pain, get his prostate biopsy and have a repeat prostate biopsy within 6 weeks because his PSA went up from 3.1 to 3.6 ng/ml. His PSA went back up and he had his prostate removed. He came back in about 3 weeks of his post-prostatectomy diagnosis and had a PSA of 0.8. The pain, urethral stricture and urethrogram from the second operation had resolved and there was good urine flow and voiding symptoms. His story had a very different outcome than the one to three month stay every 4 to 8 weeks I had seen before. So, I asked, what has your patient experienced? He told me he had been doing great and the second biopsy seemed to be working. The reason for the increased pain was that he had a bladder stone that was found at the time the second biopsy was done. This was treated with a cystoscopy and removal of the bladder stone. The pain he had been feeling was, in part, related to the biopsy needle irritation caused by the bladder irritation. A single course of antibiotics and oral pain medicine for the pain seemed sufficient. The follow up care would be provided with a PSA every 6 to 12 months. So, we have defined the patient population very well. What are some things we can learn about them? Do we really know what we are doing? What have we learned about our patient group? We can learn to be better clinicians if we take the time to understand the patients with whom we care.

I feel like my patients with prostate cancer are the best patients for teaching this concept. With a cancer patient comes the knowledge that nothing about treatment works 100% of the time. It is important for the patient to understand this--the same is true about the patient with high LDL cholesterol or high sugar--you have to keep telling them that nothing about treatment works 100% of the time.

A paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by the Society of Hospital Medicine (JAMA, June 26, 2010, DOI: 10.1001/jama.2009.4737) describes a series of studies that give us a chance to learn about each of our patients in a way that will help us to optimize patient outcomes. In each study, the authors were looking at outcomes associated with specific interventions. For example, the study looked at how different doses of aspirin might impact clotting times in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation. The JAMA paper is here. These are the typical data sets we collect from our clinic and we could apply this set of data to the patients in front of us. Now, when the question is, ""How does this patient compare to these two studies?"" how does it compare to other patients who have experienced a similar intervention?

In looking at the paper, I realized that patients with cancer and patients with other diseases are almost the same--in both cases, there is a variable that gets altered. So, as clinicians, we are in the perfect spot to be able to learn about our patients in a way that can improve our outcomes. To look at this paper as a collection of individual patient outcomes is to learn our patients like I was told about that patient. It is important to identify the variable that you have a little bit of control over that will lead to a change that produces a benefit for that patient. If you are a clinician who can demonstrate to that patient that his PSA is the variable, then you have a chance of improving the patient's outcome. It is important to focus on the subset of patients that are at highest risk, but most importantly",1
"Question: Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory? Answer:  Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory?

This is intended as a starter for my students and, more importantly, my colleagues.

If you use refractive error for clinical purposes, as most practicing eye care providers do, it is mandatory to measure autorefraction. If we don’t, you need to be very sure which one you are using, as different devices will give different values. It is important to know your refractive values, as they are likely to change throughout your life. It is also vital to know the average values for your fellow eye exam team members, since values may often vary among different device.

Autorefraction is the automated, computerized, objective measurement of refractive error. It is the most commonly used diagnostic tool to monitor the refractive status of an eye, and it has proven to be especially valuable in predicting potential myopia (nearsightedness) and other causes of poor vision such as hypermetropia (far sightedness).

With respect to refractive outcome, for example, in a small but very long-term, prospective study, the myopia prevention intervention program (MPI) in school-aged children showed a statistically significant reduction in the progression rate of childhood myopia in the treated eye compared with the fellow, control eye.^[@ref3]^

Many studies compare one or more parameters of refractive or IOL power results between different refractive techniques. Unfortunately, a great deal of confusion exists in the literature about which measurements are truly interchangeable. I have tried my best to clarify this, in order to make the choice more clear for my students and colleagues.

If you compare autorefraction readings obtained with different devices, there are differences in diopter readings as well as differences in refractive astigmatism/spheroequivalent values. It is also sometimes reported that autorefraction has significantly greater inaccuracy than subjective refraction, especially in young children.

If the device you use gives different refractive values compared with the other eye care provider, you need to be sure that they are indeed different. To do this, you need to check the manufacturer\'s guidelines. But, the good news here is that it can be relatively straightforward: we just need to look at one or two parameters.

In my opinion, it is the best to use a technique that is commonly used in the clinic. To achieve this, you should consider the following conditions:

\(i\) The technique measures the refractive error of both eyes together. (ii) The refractions are performed on the same day or at the same time of the day, on relatively few patients, or with patients who are not using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or soft contact lenses, or both. When you measure both eyes together, there is a chance that one or more of them may have an aberration that is not seen by other devices. (iii) Most of the autorefractor methods do not give you the IOL values of the measured eye.

For these reasons and so on, all the devices I am going to discuss are considered acceptable autorefraction methods: some can be more accurate than others and, thus, some refractive values may be better and some values may be worse. When you measure the refractive error of the same eye, you can always check the values of the fellow eye and compare them.

What are the accepted guidelines for using an autorefractor in a clinical setting? The American Academy of Ophthalmology has recommended that the IOL power calculated by any of the following methods should be used as the expected base power for IOL calculation:

\(1\) An A-scan biometry refraction, if possible;

\(2\) An autorefraction using any of the following techniques:

-	\(a\) Scheimpflug analysis

-	\(b\) Optical low-coherence reflectometry

-	\(c\) Optical heterometry

-	\(d\) Laser-based autorefraction

-	\(e\) Wavefront analysis

\- For optical biometry, the IOL power calculated based on Haigis formula is considered the ideal baseline;

-For Wavefront analysis, the IOL power should not be calculated using the standard formulas. The results of refraction with a wavefront aberrometer can also help in the process.

What should you do if the IOL or refractive outcome using one of these techniques is different from that of your colleague\'s? It is always suggested to have a discussion about this issue with your colleague to determine which refractive outcome is most reliable and relevant.

"Question: Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients? Answer:  Is screening or surveillance for CHC with US beneficial? In other words, does it make a favorable outcome for patients?

Answer: As suggested, we will consider it as an ""investigation"" rather than a ""practice"" since the main aim is not to screen or treat but to evaluate the prognosis of CHC and, for this goal, other non-invasive modalities or methods are recommended, such as US, CT, and CTP. For example, we can perform a prospective study by evaluating the survival of all CHC patients without any screening for all types of cancer. If the survival is better among a screened group than a non-screened group, the screening improves the prognosis, and the screening will become a new standard treatment for CHC, and also provides an evidence for the diagnosis of CHC. Although, in the other way, if the survival does not show any difference between the screened and non-screened groups, it will provide no supportive evidence. However, the overall survival of CHC patients has improved markedly during the past decade, especially due to modern therapy. Therefore, we should not perform any unnecessary screening or surveillance.

Question: Should we perform surveillance with imaging for cirrhosis with a history of CHC?

Answer: For patients who continue to have CHC but receive therapy, the cirrhosis could be improved. This is because we can evaluate the status of liver function and the progress of cirrhosis with repeated tests including US, CT, or pro-GPT. But, if it is a new diagnosis of cirrhosis with a history of CHC and the cirrhosis is severe, the patient would experience acute exacerbation (decrease of GELD, ALT, and bilirubin) during a short time, followed by progressive improvement. So, we might predict that liver dysfunction would improve with the therapy, while the patient would still suffer from a high risk of developing liver failure after the therapy is discontinued. In spite of these limitations, our answer is still ""No"" unless there is a new history of CHC and the risk of developing liver failure is clear.

Question: Is there any benefit in screening for primary liver malignancy?

Answer: Although the screening of the early detection of liver malignancy is more convenient and may help to prevent the death of patients, the screening may also present some complications, such as cost and the risk to patients. Thus, it is not an easy thing to perform regularly in the health checkup, nor to screen a very large number of patients. For example, there is no significant benefit in screening small hepatocellular carcinomas \<3cm and there would be many false positives. Therefore, there is no benefit in screening for liver malignancy using imaging modalities.

Question: Does surveillance of HCV cirrhosis with an ultrasonography improve survival? For the patients with HCC, the surveillance of early detection of HCC will not make a favorable outcome for the patient

Answer: The screening or surveillance of cirrhosis of HCV in the patients who have known that they have CHC is performed on the basis of the guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma, so we will think that it is not an ""investigation"" in this case. Since the main aim is to evaluate the prognosis of the patients with CHC rather than their outcome for HCC, it will not be a proper case for our suggestion. That is why we have decided not to respond this question.

Question: Is it valuable to screen liver cancers?

Answer: The screening or surveillance of the early detection of liver malignancy is not performed regularly at most of the health checkup centers in most countries, considering the risk and the cost of the screening process and the accuracy, especially for the detection of HCC, since it has a very low sensitivity of 4 - 10% [@B30]. Since there is no definitive evidence about performing a screening or surveillance, no definite answer is reached. If it is needed for the treatment of a liver malignancy or a precancerous lesion, it will be determined by medical oncologists or hepatobiliary surgeons.

Question: Do you think there is any benefit in screening for HCV cirrhosis with an ultrasonography for HCC?

Answer: In the other way, the screening is an important part of the evaluation and treatment for the patients with suspected CHC. However, it should be noted that the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasonography for CHC is suboptimal, even when performed by radiologists who are specially well trained. The test may miss up to 50% of CHC in the cirrhotic patients. Therefore, it is more important to rule out CHC than to",1
"Question: ""Would a man smell a rose then throw it away? Answer:  ""Would a man write a scientific paper then smell a rose?""

Answer: ""One person who is good at writing a scientific paper smells the rose and then writes it down. The other simply writes it.""

Answer: ""A man would first smell a rose, then throw it away.""

Answer: ""Neither a man nor a woman will ever smell a rose without throwing it away.""

Answer: A man would smell the rose then throw it away. A woman who is good at smelling roses throws and eats the rose. A man or woman will never smell a rose without throwing it away.

Answer: A man will smell a rose then throw it away. A woman, if she is good at smelling roses will eat it. A man or woman will never smell a rose without throwing it away.

Question: Write a scientific paper that answers the question: “Do all humans throw things away?”

Answer: ""All humans throw things away because a human being should be able to answer a question. If a human being cannot answer a question, then the question is not answered.""

Answer: All humans throw things away because all humans have a human mind, and people’s minds ask questions. If human beings do not ask questions, the mind does not learn. If the mind does not learn then it cannot answer questions. Therefore, the mind can ask questions, and the mind should be able to answer them.

Answer: “People do throw things away for two reasons. One reason is that all people have a mind, and a mind can ask questions. The other reason is that people throw things away to help themselves. They need things that people throw away. The only thing people throw away is trash. Therefore, people throw away certain things.

Answer: All people throw things away because all people have a mind. If there is a question, then people must be able to ask the questions. By asking questions, people are learning. So, people throw certain things away.

Question: “A man writes a scientific paper and asks the question ‘Why people do not throw things away?” Write a scientific paper that answers the question.”

Answer: “A man will first write a scientific paper then throw it away. But an abstract is written and published on a scientific paper by someone who is good at throwing things away.”

Answer: “People do not throw away things because a person can throw things away if he likes, and people can throw things away if they love to throw things away. A child throws things. A person does not throw things away by herself. She only throws things away because someone taught her how to do it.

Answer: When a person can do something by themselves, the person is teaching that person to do other things. But when the person cannot do something by themself, the person is teaching a child how to do it and to help a teacher.

Question: “Write a scientific paper that answers the question ‘How do people save things?”

Answer: “A man saves something if a man saves something by himself, and he saves it because he wants to store it away for himself. A man can lose valuable things if it is not stored in his home.

Answer: A man loses some of the things in a place because a man does not save some of the things. A man loses some of the things as a result of an experience. A man does not lose everything but only valuable things.

Answer: People’s minds should not be changed by the words that people say. People should not make other people’s minds different unless a person is being changed by people. People should not be changed by being a person’s teacher or a person’s father. But people can be changed. Therefore, people should be changed by themselves. People should change the mind of another person when a person can change the mind of another person.

Answer: People’s minds can not be changed by words like “man”, “child”, and “teacher.” People do not feel happiness or sadness with people. Only something changes the people, and the thing that changes the person is called “human being.” People can learn through different learning types such as reading, learning, and listening. People do not learn with a “man” or a “teacher.” People learn with a thing that changes the person’s mind.

Answer: If people are happy, then a man who is good at changing the minds of children will change the children. Or a woman will change the children if she is good at it. Therefore, the children will behave like",1
"Question: Department of Transportation vs self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree? Answer:  Do stroke survivors report increased risk for fatal or nonfatal motor vehicle collisions?

Why this question: While we have had success in promoting and improving stroke survivor driver safety since the 1950s, this question arose when an article published in 2014 stated that stroke survivors drive ""more unsafely than a group matched on age and sex"".1 As one of our community's active advocates for stroke survivor driver safety, The Stroke Foundation's Chief Program Officer, Fiona Wood, recognized that this statement could have major implications for stroke survivor driving rates and stroke survivor safety in general. Therefore, the goal of this research is to investigate the question whether or not stroke patients are over-represented in accident-related data reported in Australia: it may be that the data are an under estimation of stroke patients' driving safety and that the numbers on stroke survivors and their driving may both be ""more unsafe"" than the data suggest.

Objectives: A) To evaluate the reported proportion of fatalities and injuries due to motor vehicle crashes, in Australia for both stroke survivors and a ""matched"" control group, using statistics published to date. B) To compare accident-related driving data reported by stroke survivors in Australia with driving statistics of similar aged people.

Methods: This study will rely on a simple comparison of reported hospital statistics from the National Coronial Information System's Victorian State Registry to driving statistics published by Australian Department of Transport. Driving fatalities and injuries due to motor vehicle crashes reported in the National Coronial Information System Registry, are available for comparison. 2

Preliminary results: Results will be reported back to The Stroke Foundation once analysis is complete. Stroke survivor group participants will receive notification of their participation in the studies.

Summary: The Stroke Foundation is using these results to make recommendations to the Australian government and the Australian community as to how to appropriately address the health needs of stroke survivors and improve their road safety.

1. Introduction

In 2014, a study was published in the international journal Stroke that used a cross-sectional study design to compare the behavior of a ""stroke survivor group"" to the behavior of a ""matched"" group in an Australian state. Their data was self-reported data from their survey. Their data indicated that stroke survivors were driving ""more unsafely than a group matched on age and sex"".1 The question arose that in Australia, have studies used ""real world"" statistics to compare driving statistics in stroke survivors to ""an age-and sex-matched group"", or have they simply relied on self-reported data to estimate the proportion of stroke patients driving ""more unsafely""? Unfortunately, this study by the authors themselves is the only study known to The Stroke Foundation to estimate the rate of stroke patients driving ""more unsafely"", or even driving ""at all"".

As a large portion of our advocacy efforts at stroke advocacy groups, The Stroke Foundation has been responsible for making the public aware of the ""stigma"" associated with stroke patient driving for over 25 years. Therefore, it was with great concern that we read the 2014 Stroke study by the authors themselves. This study was published in a peer-reviewed, international journal and was intended to be the final word on whether stroke survivors drive ""more unsafely"" when compared to their age- and sex-matched control group. Unfortunately, this study may have very significant implications for the future of public health, stroke advocacy, stroke survivor community safety, and even stroke patient road safety and road safety in general.

Therefore, The Stroke Foundation is utilizing the preliminary data from this research to propose further investigation into whether or not stroke survivors actually drive ""more unsafely"" compared to a group of age and sex matched people generally. Further investigation will also be performed to determine if there are differences in safety between men and women in Australian motor vehicle accident statistics.

This research study has been in review by various agencies for over 2 years and has been conducted since October of 2015. While we are not aware of any adverse outcomes associated with this research study, we wanted to ensure that our advocacy is based upon accurate data for safety programs for stroke survivors.

"Question: Neoadjuvant Imatinib in Locally Advanced Gastrointestinal stromal Tumours, Will Kit Mutation Analysis Be a Pathfinder? Answer:  Neoadjuvant Imatinib in Locally Advanced Gastrointestinal stromal Tumours, Will Kit Mutation Analysis Be a Pathfinder?

It has been reported that Imatinib treatment may have better anti-tumour effects in patients with Kit mutation [1]–[3]. In the current study, a meta-analysis combining 16 eligible studies including 2,854 patients was performed to compare preoperative and postoperative Imatinib therapy in gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Our analysis showed that postoperative Imatinib significantly improves the outcomes of patients. However, it does not reduce the risk of local recurrence, although the overall survival (OS) with Imatinib appears to be clearly improved.

There is substantial evidence proving that the KIT gene mutation can be used, as a predictive factor, in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) [4]–[8]. Kit is a proto-oncogene encoding an integral transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor. Its proto-oncogenic function can be enhanced by mutant Kit, and it can stimulate the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GISTs [9]. Recent studies have also demonstrated that Kit is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis. The absence of Kit protein has been reported to be linked to resistance to apoptosis induced by growth factors or chemotherapy in GISTs [10].

Imatinib, a TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), can competitively inhibit the interaction between wild type and mutation Kit after it is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract [11]. Therefore, it was anticipated that Imatinib plus surgery could improve the outcome of localised GIST patients, especially those with Kit mutation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that Imatinib can effectively inhibit the growth, migration or invasion, and promote the apoptosis of GIST cells [12]–[15]. There are currently multiple clinical trials to validate the effect of preoperative Imatinib on locally advanced GIST patients. The goal of this study is to determine the influence of Imatinib therapy at the time of preoperative treatment for locally advanced GISTs. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis combining 16 eligible studies including 2,854 patients to compare pre- and postoperative Imatinib therapy. The purpose of the meta analysis is to evaluate the results of these studies to determine if adding preoperative Imatinib will improve OS after definitive surgical resection.

Materials and methods

Literature search strategy and selection criteria

A systematic review of the Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (search date: August 10, 2017) was carried out to identify eligible literature. The specific retrieval keywords and free words included the following: ‘kit mutation’, ‘imatinib’, or ‘GISTs’. No filter or restriction was applied except English or Chinese language. The reference lists of included articles were also reviewed for potentially relevant articles. Studies were excluded if there was insufficient information about the patients and/or methods. After exclusion, 16 studies were eligible for the review. A flowchart is presented in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)-formatted flow diagram (Fig. 1). Four reviewers individually assessed the eligibility of the included studies and reached a consensus regarding study inclusion. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Two reviewers (Li Wang and Yongmei Guan) independently extracted data from the included studies with the use of a pre-designed data collection table. The variables were obtained from the text and tables of the studies as follows: patient characteristics; number of patients; tumour characteristics; treatment and follow-up for OS; and surgical technique and recurrence; the study results and conclusions. Disagreements were also resolved after discussion.

"Question: Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease? Answer:  Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary atherosclerosis? (Hint: you will need to cite two references.) For the purposes of this paper, “Coronary artery disease (CAD)” is defined as a hardening of the innermost wall of the coronary arteries.

Answer: This is an excellent Question, and the results of a meta-analysis evaluating bezafibrate for prevention of colon cancer can be found at our article “Bezafibrate Reduces the Incidence of Colorectal Carcinoma in patients with Cardiovascular Disease,” Journal of Gastroenterol Hepatol (2010) 25:1914-1924.

The study was a meta-analysis on 7 trials that included a total of 3,843 participants. Bezafibrate was associated with a statistically significant reduction of colorectal carcinoma incidence (28% relative risk reduction; p = 0.02) and decreased CRC risk in participants with a relative risk reduction of 57% (p = 0.004). An absolute risk reduction was also statistically significant (3.1/1000 individuals).

Colonoscopy was offered to participants in the trials at the time of diagnosis of CAD, but a substantial proportion (~90%) of participants did not complete the recommended follow up colonoscopy, with a median time of 13.5 years after enrollment. Since we did not know when the cancers would emerge, we could not know that the cancers would evolve to a later stage than what was detected by colonoscopy.

Bezafibrate is a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist that has been shown to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors mediate the effects of fatty acids and, among other effects, are critical in regulating genes encoding proteins that regulate energy metabolism and inflammation. The study in this meta-analysis was conducted in patients who also had CAD, therefore, an additional reduction in CRC by bezafibrate was clinically plausible for this group. The clinical question of this topic deals with the preventive effect of lowering lipids to prevent colon cancer in those with CAD.

While we have examined the potential for secondary prevention of CRC using statins in this topic in those with CAD, this meta-analysis highlights another prevention method that has not been previously evaluated.

Question: Has the use of celecoxib reduce recurrences of pancreatic endocrine-exocrine neoplasia type 1 (PEEN1) with endoscopic and radiographic improvements?

Answer: We examined the use of celecoxib to reduce recurrence of PEEN1. A meta-analysis and review of the published literature were used to answer the question.

We conducted a systematic review of all case reports and series published between 2000 and 2011; this also included a search of PubMed. We found 25 reports of 19 children treated with celecoxib who were diagnosed with PEEN1 and a total of 23 patients in whom PEEN developed after initial regression following successful surgical resection of benign lesions.

The search also included a systematic review of the published literature. A total of 36 reports of 33 children and adults were identified during the search. Based on the literature and our review, we were able to conclude that celecoxib use in pediatric patients with PEEN1 was common; it was used within 2 months of diagnosis and typically as an independent variable, with no other medications or procedures used. There was no specific response to celecoxib noted on endoscopic or radiographic findings, but reductions after treatment were demonstrated in size, number, and duration of lesions in the majority of patients.

Celecoxib can be used safely and effectively in pediatric patients with PEEN1 and may be helpful in treating this disorder.

Question: How do you use the concept of risk to help you make treatment decisions for children with chronic kidney disease?

Answer: When a new medical treatment for children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is first shown to improve a risk factor, how should one interpret the available data? We can think of this question like this: we know that a risk factor is a measurement of the impact of that risk factor on your health. So, if a risk factor improves but does not improve the overall risk in children, you can conclude that it does not directly decrease the risk.

A hypothetical example might be that of an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor. You can use ACE inhibitors (enalapril, captopril, ramipril) to control blood pressure in children with CKD.",1

The importance of human factor to medical care improvement and the contribution of each human factors including cognitive, behavioural, and psychosocial factors were well recognized by both patients and healthcare professionals \[[@CIT0001],[@CIT0004],[@CIT0005]\]. The quality of care, including safety and effectiveness, can be improved by understanding psychological and emotional factors about medical professionals. Health care professional's motivation, emotions and stress can cause medical mistakes. In addition to psychological factors, medical mistakes can also be caused by lack of competence, and poor work attitudes: all these include human factors \[[@CIT0006]\].

Medical professional's competence is an important factor to increase patient safety \[[@CIT0007],[@CIT0008]\]. However, the medical mistakes and errors of physicians are frequently occurred \[[@CIT0009]\]. In contrast to physicians, nurses, and other staff in healthcare, the prevalence of medical mistakes among nursing students is high \[[@CIT0010]\]. In addition, some studies showed that nurses can make serious errors of patient care \[[@CIT0011; @CIT0012; @CIT0013]\]. Several studies demonstrated that nurses' errors of critical care, including central nervous system (CNS) infusions and oxygen monitoring, during labour and delivery, are frequently occurred \[[@CIT0014]\].

Sleep is generally believed to be the most important factor for good human physical performance \[[@CIT0015]\]. Sleep problems and inadequate sleep are increasingly encountered in medical professionals \[[@CIT0016; @CIT0017; @CIT0018]\]. Sleep problems are more frequent among nurses than physicians, nursing students, or other staff in medical institutions: a study showed that almost half of registered nurses (49%) in Canadian hospitals reported at least one sleep related problem \[[@CIT0019]\]. A study showed that approximately one third of US nurses reported having at least 10% sleep debt at work, which was associated with decreased job performance \[[@CIT0015]\]. According to a previous study, poor quality of sleep can contribute to medical mistakes \[[@CIT0016]\]. Sleep quality is related to clinical outcomes: a study showed that low sleep quality and fatigue were associated with the development of type 2 diabetes \[[@CIT0020]\].

Cognitive performance and psychomotor skills can be improved by learning \[[@CIT0021]\]. In contrast to physicians and nurses, nursing students or other staff can learn a lot during their internship \[[@CIT0010],[@CIT0022]\]. During internship, newly graduated nurses, or nursing students are commonly called ""pupils"" during medical education and clinical training. In this situation, students are frequently required to work with senior nurses, and be ""treated"" for several weeks. This is also a time when they are learning, and therefore, they may have high degree of motivation to work. It is important for the clinical instructor to know if the high degree of motivation can be maintained later in their practice: can a ""high-motivation"" nursing student learn better in the actual clinical setting, compared to the other ""low-motivation"" patients? If ""high-motivate"" students can be retained/retrained as good practitioners in the future, it will help improve patient safety. For the patient, retaining ""high-motivation"" students may be as important as quality and safety. The quality and safety of medical profession will greatly improve if these students are retained as ""high-motivation practitioners.""

To have successful clinical clerkships, the clinical instructor may use transformational leadership behaviours to promote student motivation and improve student learning in clerkships \[[@CIT0023; @CIT0024; @CIT0025; @CIT0026; @CIT0027]\]. Transformational leadership behaviours will promote students' learning, and in turn, the learning by junior students may improve in the future. On the other hand, students' learning may be less effective if transformational behaviours induce stress or anxiety in them; and as long as students feel stressed or anxious, their learning will be lower: it is likely that ""low-",1

Question: What exactly defines normal neutrophil recovery? How does a patient who fails to recover a normal neutrophil count over a defined time period become a candidate for alternative strategies to achieve neutrophil recovery? Answer: Neutrophil recovery is a variable and usually occurs between 10 and 20 days after HSCT. In general, only half of recipients recover an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) by day 10. In general, patients with a lower day-14 ANC have a higher risk of developing severe or life-threatening infections (Figure 1). In those with a ANC < 500/uL on day 15 to 20, infections are associated with a greater risk of death. Based on this information, the EBMT defines delayed neutrophil recovery as ANC <500/uL from day 10 to 20. Patients who fail to improve to this degree have multiple strategies to try, including a second unrelated donor allogeneic transplant or high-dose growth factors (Figure 2).

Question: What are the risks and benefits of autologous HSCT in patients with lymphoma? Answer: Patients with lymphoma who are not chemo-responsive or have chemoresistant disease have survival rates of 10% to 30%, which is much worse than for most other subtypes of acute leukemia and lymphoma. Autologous HSCT is an option for patients who fail to achieve a complete remission or are not treated with consolidation therapy as part of their initial management. Although there are no randomized trials for any lymphoma subtype, several retrospective analyses have shown that autologous HSCT appears to be the single most important factor determining long-term survival after therapy for advanced lymphoma. Patients who undergo an autologous HSCT for aggressive B-cell lymphoma in first remission can achieve long-term disease-free survival without additional treatment. For those with follicular lymphoma, the disease is most often considered chemosensitive, even without initial autologous transplantation if the patient's disease relapsed after an initially intensive chemotherapy. However, long-term disease-free survival may not be possible given the possibility of disease recurrence. A number of regimens, including R-CHOP and autotransplantation, have been reported to achieve a high complete remission rate with a low treatment-related mortality. The optimal length of maintenance therapy for follicular lymphoma is unclear. There is some evidence that the disease-free survival and overall survival is longer for those who undergo consolidation chemotherapy after an initial autotransplantation compared to those treated primarily with chemotherapy. In addition, the majority of patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma appear to respond well to chemotherapy regimens with modest or no toxicity and have an overall survival rate similar to that of patients with follicular lymphoma. The efficacy of autologous HSCT for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia is variable. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have similar outcomes whether they undergo maintenance chemotherapy, immunosuppression, or autologous HSCT. As the disease progresses, the risk of relapse is significantly lower for autologous HSCT than for chemotherapy, but the survival is not appreciably longer. For each disease subtype, patient selection is important for the ultimate success of an autologous HSCT. In general, patients who have an earlier relapse or who fail to maintain remission will have a lower long-term survival rate. A more aggressive approach may be warranted early in the disease course, and even with poor responses, chemotherapy intensification may be appropriate, but these studies are mostly historical or small scale. Treatment-related mortality has been the main concern with autologous HSCT, as it is much higher than the risk of disease relapse. However, over the last two decades, considerable experience has been gained with autologous HSCT for these diseases, and with more patients being transplanted, treatment-related toxicity has fallen considerably. With the use of better pretreatment and conditioning regimens for stem cell collection, a greater utilization of peripheral blood, and the more frequent use of second donor transplants, there has been a decline in the use of unrelated donors, and the donor-related toxicity was thought to be somewhat less. However, this experience does not appear to match the expected outcomes. For lymphoma and leukemia, autologous HSCT in recent series often results in more disease recurrences than do related allogeneic transplants. This trend has been evident in a number of recent reports including the Lymphoid Cancer Consortium's randomized trial of allogeneic versus autologous transplantation for poor-risk B-cell lymphoma. In this study, autologous transplants resulted in early disease recurrence. In all disease subtypes, autologous transplants resulted in a significantly higher relapse risk compared to related allogene",1
"Question: Very high serum CA 19-9 levels: a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy? Answer:  Very high serum CA 19-9 levels: a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy?

Introduction {#Sec1}
============

Pancreatic carcinoma is a malignant tumor, which arises from the epithelial cells of the pancreas \[[@CR1]\]. Many cases of pancreatic carcinoma present with various symptoms caused by invasion of the main pancreatic duct, the duodenum, or the common bile duct. Surgical resection of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes is the only treatment option for pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is performed for many cases of pancreatic carcinoma and is considered a standard surgical treatment \[[@CR2]\]. Pancreatectomy requires careful consideration of surgical contraindications; therefore, preoperative knowledge of tumor markers is important. In addition, pancreaticoduodenectomy is a rather complex pancreatic surgery and a prolonged surgical procedure. For these reasons, it is important to select patients with good prognoses to avoid overtreatment.

Pancreatic carcinoma cells release mucin glycoprotein MUC1 into the blood \[[@CR3]\]. MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein and contains a large molecular weight *O*-glycosylated region that is highly homologous with the human embryonic stem cell protein, embryonic cadherin (E-cadh) \[[@CR4]\]. As for normal tissues, MUC1 is overexpressed in several kinds of cancers, including pancreatic carcinoma. Serum levels of cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 \[[@CR5]\] and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) \[[@CR6]\] are markers of pancreatic carcinoma \[[@CR7]\]. CEA is not released into the bloodstream when pancreatic carcinoma occurs; however, CA19-9 is actively released from the malignant cells \[[@CR8]\].

The incidence of pancreatic cancer is lower than other cancers \[[@CR9]\]. However, because pancreatic carcinoma is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, the prognosis is particularly poor \[[@CR10]\].

CA19-9 and CEA have often been used to diagnose pancreatic carcinoma in patients with high serum tumor marker levels. Moreover, a few studies have evaluated the impact of high CA19-9 or CEA levels on postoperative morbidity and mortality of patients with pancreatic carcinoma. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated differences in the CA19-9 and CEA concentrations of patients in the postoperative course and compared them with the disease-free interval, treatment, and other clinicopathological factors.

This retrospective study included 103 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma from September 2001 to October 2008 in the Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery at the Okayama University Hospital. All patients underwent curative pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer, such as pT3NOMO/MO or pN1, and had no extraperitoneal metastasis. There were 68 men and 35 women, and the median age was 65 years (range 32--83 years). Histological classifications for pancreatic cancer were as follows: pT3N0M0: 23, pT3N1M0: 39, pT4: 12, pT1: 10, pT2: 24, pTis: 7, pT3N0M1: 3, and pT3N3M1: 2. Histological diagnoses were confirmed by operation before operation for all patients. The median tumor size was 4 cm (range 1--12 cm) and the median tumor was 4.0 ± 3.1 cm in the largest dimension (Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type=""table""}). Forty-four patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and S-1 after surgery. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in all cases by an experienced surgeon as a standard procedure. Postoperative complications occurred in 46 patients, including 12 cases of wound infection, 8 cases of pancreatic fistula, 15 cases of biliary fistula, 13 cases of delayed gastric emptying, and 4 cases of intra-abdominal bleeding. All patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Adjuvant therapy was performed",1

==========================================================

1. Introduction {#s1}
===============

Surgery is a medical practice in which invasive procedures are performed to correct a pathology or to improve the quality or length of life. Anesthetics, analgesics, vasodilators, and sedatives are applied during surgical procedures to provide adequate conditions for surgical interventions.^[@R1]^

The use of anesthesia is associated with changes in several biological processes and metabolic pathways. It has been shown that the administration of drugs during anesthesia affects the metabolism of endogenous molecules, such as lipids and bile acids released following food ingestion. This occurs mainly due to alterations in the levels of insulin and glucagon.^[@R2],[@R3]^ Additionally, changes in protein catabolism also occur due to fasting.^[@R4]^ The administration of anesthesia is also related to the stimulation of inflammatory processes due to the release of several inflammatory mediators.^[@R5]^

Animal models constitute a tool for scientific research, allowing the investigation of the effects of new treatment protocols on certain health problems or diseases. However, it is important to consider the differences between the human organism and animals to ensure the ethical quality of the study. Currently, it is recommended that anesthetics, analgesics, and sedatives be eliminated from animal feed before surgical intervention, because these are associated with stress and pain in animals and they cause suffering.^[@R1],[@R3],[@R6],[@R7]^ Nevertheless, there are indications that food must be withheld for some period before anesthesia, analgesics, and sedatives are applied in animal models of laparoscopic or open surgery.^[@R8],[@R9]^

As part of the preoperative fasting and as recommended in various guidelines,^[@R1],[@R3],[@R6],[@R7]^ the use of anesthetics, analgesics, and sedatives must be discontinued 6 hours before surgery. The aim of this review is to discuss the need to fasting the animals, as well as the different alternatives available with the aim of reducing the distress and improving the quality of the preoperative period for the animals undergoing surgical intervention.

I have a patient that comes to my office and reports to me her blood pressure. It is 160-170 systolic and 90 diastolic and she says she tries to lower it by increasing her medication and by eating healthier but it is still high. What do I need to know about your patient? How could I suggest ways to decrease her blood pressure? What medications if any is she taking?

ANSWERHi: I don't know how old you are, but if you are under 50 it would be better to see a dietician as she could help with diet. I do recommend a low sodium diet and limit sodium to 100 mg or less on a daily basis with food. You may also want to follow a high protein low-carb, grain-free diet that is also low salt. To lower blood pressure I recommend taking Diltiazem, Hydrochloroisopropyl-Beta-Cyclodextrin (HCTZ) or Lisinopril. For diuretics I would be careful of Potassium supplements. The best time for blood pressure is on the same time of day. Take your blood pressure at the same time of day every day. I believe the lowest best time of day for hypertension is about 6 am. Also, exercise could help with your blood pressure.

"Question: Residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: is fundectomy safe and effective as revision surgery? Answer:  Residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: is fundectomy safe and effective as revision surgery? The abstract was published in the Journal of American and European societies of abdominal surgery (2014 February).

In laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), creation of the fundoplication was initially recommended to prevent reflux in the gastric remnant ([@CR1]--[@CR5]). The fundoplication was later abandoned because of the risk of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux with impaired dietary tolerance and weight regain ([@CR6]--[@CR9]). At present, surgical closure of the fundus is not routinely performed, and no standardized method has been defined for closing the fundus ([@CR1]--[@CR9]). The fundus is conventionally sutured to the greater curvature, although it has been suggested that this may place a high risk for anastomotic leaks ([@CR10]). Alternative techniques for fundoplication closure that require shorter operating times are a modification of Toupet fundoplication (a 360° posterior wrap-around technique) ([@CR11],[@CR12]), and another technique, which does not require additional operative time is that of Nissen fundoplication ([@CR13]). As a result, the incidence of leaks associated with LSG is approximately 1.6%, and leaks are classified as minor (\<1 cm or 1--3 leakages), moderate (\>1 cm and 10--24 perforations) or major (\>1 cm and ≥25 perforations) ([@CR6]--[@CR9]).

According to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), fundoplication is necessary to seal the gastroesophageal junction ([@CR1]--[@CR3]). In contrast, according to the Japanese Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (JSMS), creation of the fundoplication is not recommended ([@CR14]). The JSMS proposed that the fundus should not be sutured to the greater curvature of the stomach. After LSG, a neofundus was formed over the gastric remnant and a hiatal hernia was expected to form ([@CR1]--[@CR3]). There is no consensus on whether this neofundus should be completely excised or if a portion of the neofundus should be preserved ([@CR2],[@CR14],[@CR15]). If the neofundus is completely excised, the residual fundus may cause gastroesophageal reflux and a persistent hiatal hernia, which may lead to a recurrence of a weight regain ([@CR6],[@CR8]). Thus, it is presumed that the risk of a leak would increase. If the neofundus remains undisturbed, it could be expected that it may prevent the reflux from causing weight regain. Although several small scale studies have been conducted to evaluate the formation of the residual fundus and the neofundus in the gastric remnant after LSG, there has been a lack of evidence regarding either its occurrence or its size ([@CR2],[@CR3],[@CR16]--[@CR19]). Recently, Ohta et al. reported the formation of a neofundus between the gastric remnant and esophagus in the stomach ([@CR20]).

The purpose of this study included (i) the determination of an appropriate operative time for LSG, and (ii) an analysis for the formation and size of the residual fundus or neofundus.

This study was conducted at Osaka National Hospital (ONH) in Osaka, Japan. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Ethics Committee at ONH (No. 1517), and written informed consent was obtained from each of the patients who were enrolled in this study. In accordance with ethical regulations, all human studies were conducted with the approval of the ONH Ethics Committee and with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as found in the current revision of it.

This study was a retrospective single-center analysis that included 461 patients (age, 42.4 ± 9.9 years; male, 44.7%) who underwent LSG at the Division of Bariatrics at ONH from April 2012 to July 2015. Prior to LSG, all patients showed a body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m^2^ or ≥30 kg/m^2^ with overweight for a Japanese criterion ([@CR2],[@CR22]) and had a life expectancy",1
"Question: Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients? Answer:  Why do black and white patient respond differently to physician severity estimates of asthma?

Asthma is more common in African American and Hispanic than in white children. However, only limited data exist about how physician estimates of asthma severity differ among blacks and whites. Our aim was to determine whether physician severity assessment differed between black and white children with asthma.

Design and Setting

In a multicity prospective cohort study, we enrolled black and white children with asthma. Children were enrolled at 3 pediatric outpatient medical centers in Birmingham, Chicago, and Seattle and followed up for 2 years of clinical practice.

Conclusion

Physicians may underestimate asthma severity in black children less often than in white children, which could affect the management of asthma.

For children with asthma, clinical practice guidelines advise physicians to obtain a history of severe asthma during an annual visit to provide treatment with a step up in therapy for those with asthma severity.1 Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the mainstay for these patients.2,3 Several studies have shown that a history of severe childhood asthma influences future management of asthma4,5 and that the risk may be greater in African-American than in white patients6,7 although data about the proportion of black children with severe asthma is sparse.

As an effort to determine how race affects physician management of asthma in children, in this manuscript, we used a prospective multisite asthma cohort study8 to investigate whether physicians differ in their assessment of asthma severity in black compared with white children with asthma.

Methods

Study Design

In a prospective study, the pediatric patients were recruited consecutively and enrolled at 3 medical group practices within 3 cities: Seattle Children’s Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, and Children’s Hospital in Birmingham. Patients were enrolled from October 2004 through 2007. Patients were enrolled regardless of race at the time of enrollment and were followed for 5 years. The protocol was approved by the human subjects committees of the participating institutions. The study was completed during 2009.

Patient Recruitment, Data Recording, and Definitions

At enrollment, informed consent was obtained from both parents/guardians. Data included demographic information (age, sex, and ethnicity), asthma symptoms, asthma triggers, family history, and history of allergy. Trained research personnel abstracted data from medical records or collected data from the patient and family interviews. The primary outcome for this analysis was the concordance between the physicians’ estimates of asthma severity as measured at enrollment and asthma therapy prescribed after 1 year of enrollment. We defined asthma severity as less (step 1), moderately severe (step 2), or severe (step 3).9

In the medical record, information on current symptoms, asthma severity, asthma triggers, and current controller therapy was abstracted for each time point, including data from patient/family interviews. We also abstracted asthma triggers and allergic conditions. We collected data from the medical records for the following: atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.10 In patients with atopic dermatitis, family members assisted when abstracting information from the medical record.

Interobserver Reliability

Two independent investigators abstracted the following data from medical records: information on asthma severity and controller therapy. These data were compared for 100 medical records that were reviewed twice by 2 investigators and assigned as a random sample to determine interobserver reliability. The kappa statistics for these abstractions were.94 and 1 (ie, total agreement),.92 and 1, and.91 and 1, with 95% confidence intervals of 0.89 to 0.98, 0.88 to 0.97, and 0.84 to 0.91, respectively. These data demonstrate substantial (>90%) interobserver agreement.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics. Concordance was defined as the physician’s assessment in the medical record and the prescription of controller therapy at the time of the study visit within 1 year. Concordance was determined as concordance between the physician severity assignment (step 1, step 2, or step 3) and controller therapy prescribed at the time of this visit.

As a first step, unadjusted concordance across the 3 study centers was measured. Concordance was further measured at each center to control for clustering by center. Subsequently, we performed multivariate analysis using generalized linear regression with random effect models to determine concordance between physician severity estimates, the children’s demographic information, asthma severity at enrollment, and physician specialty (pediatric or family medicine). The primary outcome of interest was a physician’s estimate of the child’s history of asthma and a pediatrician prescribing ICSs at the time of the visit, a finding that would indicate a high likelihood of concordance between physician severity estimation and the prescription",1
"Question: Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery? Answer:  Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation after surgery of the esophagus, stomach, or small bowel? For the abstract, discuss at least two randomized controlled trials, ideally in English. One of the articles should be published in October 2014 or earlier.

Background {#S0001}
==========

The prevalence of esophagectomy is low, as is the number of complications. Siewert and colleagues \[[@CIT0001]\] found an overall complication rate of 45% (32% in the thoracic esophagus, 12% of thoracic esophago-gastric and 1% of total esophaco-gastric resections). Complications following surgery range from 12% (thoracic esophagus) to 50% (total esophagus), even though there is only a slight difference in the two groups (44% and 35%). In addition, no difference was found \[[@CIT0002]\] in the rate of pneumonia (18% and 23%) or tracheostomy \[[@CIT0002]\] (9% and 5%) in thoracic versus total esophagus. Nevertheless, the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after surgery is increased from 1% up to 4%, and the risk for AF is higher in the thoracic esophagus (7%) versus total esophagus (2%) \[[@CIT0002], [@CIT0003]\]. In addition, the risk for stroke is doubled after esophagectomy (2.5%) \[[@CIT0004]\]. The risk of AF postoperatively depends on the preoperative state of AF \[[@CIT0005]\]. Esophagectomy can be performed laparoscopically or open. Laparoscopy was proven to reduce the inflammatory reaction by decreasing postoperative pain, the need of postoperative analgesics, the length of hospitalization as well as the incidence of pulmonary complications \[[@CIT0006]\]. Nevertheless, the impact of the type of surgery and the patient\'s preoperative rhythm on postoperative AF is unclear. The incidence rate of the rhythm control method in AF is about 50%.

The aim of this study was to systematically analyze the data concerning the impact of laparoscopic surgery in patients with preoperative AF (preoperative A) on the risk of new-onset AF (postoperative A) with regard to the patient\'s preoperative rhythm.

Material and methods {#S0002}
====================

We conducted a systematic review of the PubMed database (from October 2000 to December 2013) with an appropriate search engine algorithm. An appropriate data mining with the use of a relevant algorithm (MESH/keywords, language, and publication time) was used to evaluate randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and studies on animal experiments. The terms ""laparoscopy"" ""atrial fibrillation"" (search of ""mixed terms"" with the MESH terms ""MESH (term1 and term2, \..., \..., termn); limit MESH (term1 and term2, \..., \..., termn)"" was used), and ""randomized and controlled trial"" were chosen. The inclusion criteria were randomized, controlled trials in the field of AF following laparoscopic esophagectomy; the postoperative development of AF should be verified, and the patients should be pre- and postoperatively in sinus rhythm. The exclusion criteria were a control group (analog of observation or non-randomization), postoperative AF in the esophageal-gastric region in relation to patients without a laparoscopic esophagectomy, and AF \> 24 hours postoperatively. The review was conducted according to the systematic review guidelines. After identification of the pertinent abstract in PubMed, the abstract was read and checked for the inclusion and exclusion criteria; if applicable, the full-text version was downloaded. For the included studies, a detailed review of the respective data sheets was conducted regarding the main variables (number of cases, type of surgery \[laparoscopy as a criterion or as an additional treatment method\], gender, age, number of preoperative drugs for rate control, number of patients who underwent surgical therapy of the heart and coronary artery diseases, number of patients with coronary artery disease receiving β-blockers, type of surgery of heart procedures etc. with reference to the AF as reported by the authors).

"Question: The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim ""surge"" management? Answer:  What is your proposed research paper on subject? This paper has to be written by you, and you may include your name as one of the authors if you so wish. The first author must be a student. The topic must be limited to the concept of ""The Main Gate syndrome"" and the need for its implementation. You must use a single author; we cannot put students on the front lines of any sort of work in progress.
- This is a scientific paper, so it is expected that you know all the elements of a scientific paper. The only exception is the introduction. The other elements have been taught in the last 3 years; if not, come right back to this page and learn them right now! The rest of this page is for your convenience to learn these elements.
- The concept of ""The Main Gate syndrome"" is the primary focus of your paper. For that reason, there is no one paper we have written on the subject. You will need to research other references and papers, and even Wikipedia for some help. You'll have to read about the syndrome, how it's been described, and how to find out. There are a number of elements that you'll have to get right; they won't be taught, they'll come from your reading and research effort. You may not use any existing reference at all, but you will have to create some kind of rationale as to why you used that one particular one. All this is part of your own original research. Use the comments to explain your reference rationale, but for now, try to keep it simple.
- You are not required to have a background in medicine or first aid. Simply state whether you have studied these areas in the past, whether you currently are studying them, and how well you have studied them.
- The ""scientific abstract"" is the first paragraph of your paper. The second paragraph starts after line two. The first part of this paragraph describes the syndrome, and it should state why this is not already in first aid textbooks, why it's a topic not discussed at first aid and CPR courses. Next, the paragraph should state what the purpose of your paper will be, and it should state whether you'll discuss solutions or only the problems.
- For the purpose of your research efforts, I would suggest only using the Internet, and doing as much of your own reading and research as possible. However, do not overlook the value of books written by authors who have experienced and understand the syndrome.

SECTION 3. METHODS

- The purpose of the paper is to discuss the Main Gate Syndrome and provide you with some suggestions on a new, or revised, format for conducting an initial assessment of a mass-casualty incident.
- You might not be required to provide your own examples of this format. In fact, you wouldn't be blamed if you didn't have them. Most mass-casualty incidents we have dealt with have had some existing written guidelines already in place; this doesn't mean that these guidelines could not be improved upon, but the best you can do is to find the current best practices that have been used and document them, so that you may then present a new solution to an even better standard of care.

SECTION 4. CONCLUSIONS and TAKE-AWAYS

- The following take-aways are based on the first portion, or introductory paragraph, of your paper. You will be expected to state what you have done and what you have learned.

"Question: Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term? Answer:  Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term? The population consists of patients receiving folic acid supplements with and without methotrexate and methotrexate alone. Folic acid does not change the effect of methotrexate. However, the use of folic acid will reduce the dose of methotrexate. Thus, in a clinical trial, folic acid is needed.

Answer: The patient population for a randomized clinical trial of combination folic acid and methotrexate, compared with methotrexate alone, in treating rheumatoid arthritis, will include patients with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. In a preliminary analysis of the data, the addition of folic acid to methotrexate does not alter the benefit seen with methotrexate alone. The number of patients in each group to be evaluated is 500.

Lymphoproliferative disease associated
with the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with adalimumab
(Humira)

Question: In the development of lymphoproliferative diseases
(LPD), it has been postulated that adalimumab (Humira)
interferes with the function of regulatory T cells. The role of
humoral and cellular immunity is well recognized in the pathogenesis
of adalimumab-associated LPD. We hypothesize that the pathogenesis of
the 2 patients reported here (Pt 1 and Pt 2) involved both humoral and
cellular immunity, as evidenced by the following: adalimumab may be
associated with humoral anti-adalimumab immune complexes with complement
activation that cause the release of cytokines, such as TNF-alpha
(Tumor Necrosis Factor) that may disrupt or activate T cell-mediated
cytotoxicity and/or regulatory T cell function; adalimumab may induce
production of anticitrulline antibodies in response to its treatment
by activating antigen presenting cells that activate a T cell
antigen-driven immune response; T cells may play a dual role in the
pathogenesis of adalimumab-associated LPD, either by an adaptive
(immune regulatory response) mechanism (perhaps as a form of immune
desensitization) or by being causally related to the development of
LPD; humoral anti-adalimumab antibodies have been shown to correlate
with clinical response in rheumatoid arthritis to adalimumab therapy.
These immune mechanisms are consistent with the LPD, with the
association of antibodies that may act on cells directly, or
specifically via complement fixation, as well as the direct
toxicological effect of monoclonal antibodies on lymphocytes and
monocytes. In conclusion, we propose a model to explain the 2 cases
(Pt 1 and Pt 2) reported by the French Health Ministry concerning the use
of Humira (adalimumab).

Joint inflammation (arthritis)
associated with the treatment with rituximab
(Rituxan)

Question: What are the risks associated with the use of this
antibiotic for treating rheumatoid arthritis? Write a paper that
demonstrates that the benefits outweigh any risk. If you plan to do the
study, specify the type of antibiotic and the specific reason(s) it was
prescribed.

Answer: Risk

Answer: A review of the clinical trial data shows that
the use of rituximab is effective for achieving improvement in both
joint inflammation and patient-reported outcomes within 3 years of
treatment. The efficacy of rituximab is independent of rheumatoid
arthritis disease duration. Clinical and radiographic progression, and
serious adverse effects are uncommon in patients treated with rituximab.
Thus, the benefits of rituximab treatment outweigh the risk associated
with its use.

"Question: Can infundibular height predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stone after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy? Answer:  Can infundibular height predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stone after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy? This question can be answered by a prospective study of 100 patients at Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, with calyceal stones below 1 cm which are treated by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy.

INTRODUCTION {#sec1-1}
============

Shock wave lithotripsy is an ideal treatment modality for most non-communicating kidney stones as it is associated with acceptable morbidity, high stone-free rates, and minimal complications.\[[@ref1]\] The procedure is considered safe, and the main complications include mild flank pain and hematuria which are self-limiting.\[[@ref2]\] The incidence of complications is directly related to stone size and location.\[[@ref3]\]

Ductal or infundibular calculi are rare, and we know of only two previous studies\[[@ref4][@ref5]\] which discuss the management of this type of renal stones using extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). One of the major difficulties in managing these types of renal stones is failure to visualize the upper pole calyx due to its small size and the close proximity of the stone to the hilum which may hamper adequate energy flux. However, due to the retrograde and antegrade flow of urine in these calyces, calculi may sometimes move out of the infundibular region while in the proximal ureter and be propelled further during SWL.\[[@ref6]\] However, it has been shown that even in the presence of a large upper pole calyceal calculi SWL may be successful if it is positioned in close proximity to calculi on the lower pole.\[[@ref7]\] We believe that the infundibular component of this stone may assist in localizing it and therefore can predict its clearance more accurately.

This study was performed to evaluate the stone clearance rate of infundibular stones and to see whether infundibular calculus size can predict the clearance of lower pole (LP) stones after SWL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS {#sec1-2}
=====================

Eighty one patients with LP stone treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) at our center were included in the study. We evaluated the demographic data and stone characteristic (size, site). Patients with multiple stones, cyst, stricture, previous intervention, biliary tract stone, hydronephrosis, renal anomaly, or other serious renal or ureteral pathology were excluded from the study. All patients underwent SWL using the third generation Dornier Compact SWL lithotripter at the rate of 1 sine wave per second. All patients received standard analgesia. Patients with a solitary stone underwent immediate treatment after initial shock wave was transmitted to it. Those with multiple stones underwent treatment over a period of 6 months. All patients (from February 2007 to September 2007) underwent followup plain abdominal radiographs at two weeks, one month, three months, and six months after SWL. Treatment success was assessed with plain abdominal radiograph at six months, as it is a routine followup modality after ESWL. The patients without stone free status underwent another session of SWL one month later. Those patients who failed SWL continued to have regular followup visits every three months until complete clearance was achieved. The patients who failed SWL were evaluated by ureterorenoscopy (URS) and required to undergo another session of SWL at 6 months.

All analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Mean and standard deviation were calculated for all variables. Student's *t*-test was utilized for comparison of means and Fischer's exact test was used for comparison of proportions. A *P*-value of \<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS {#sec1-3}
=======

A total of eighty one patients with LP stones presented with urinary tract obstruction and subsequently referred for treatment were included in the study. The average age was 42 ± 14.6 years (range 18--85 years) and a male predominance was evident (M:F = 5.5:1). All patients were in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Category I and the mean stone size was 0.59 ± 0.27 cm. Forty one patients (51.2%) had stone in",1
"Question: Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow? Answer:  Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow?

Answer:

Coronary flow has been investigated in several different ways, and the results presented in different studies are difficult to interpret because of methodological differences. Although the lung ischemia and reperfusion model can provide a good model of the ischemia and reperfusion events that can occur during a heart attack, no one has yet shown how coronary flow is affected by prolonged pulmonary ischemia or by reperfusion alone. However, because several factors may be involved, we performed a study to evaluate the coronary flow pattern in isolated hearts perfused with the Langendorff technique under normal conditions and under conditions of prolonged lung ischemia.

The data we obtained suggest that the heart was subjected to an ischemic event and that reperfusion was more frequently associated with a decrease in coronary flow. However, after a minimum reperfusion time, the hearts demonstrated a reversion in their flow to normal values: this could be a compensatory mechanism in order to limit further damage. The coronary flow pattern in the different conditions tested suggests that an acute ischemic event causes more severe alterations in the coronary flow in the reperfused compared with the nonreperfused heart. These differences are probably dependent on different mechanisms, such as the involvement of different mechanisms during the ischemia and reperfusion events.

Questions with the same title, but different questions are listed below. Only the original question in the form in which it was submitted by students will be posted here (click on the ""view questions"" link for each individual question to view them):

QUESTION:

What have the results of the studies to date, including research you have done on this, told you about the impact of lung ischemia and reperfusion has an impact on coronary flow?

Answer:

Because coronary flow has been demonstrated in several different ways, the results presented in different studies cannot yet be interpreted. Although the lung ischemia/reperfusion (LIR) model can provide a good model of the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) events that can occur during a heart attack, it has not yet been shown how coronary flow is affected by prolonged pulmonary ischemia alone, nor has reperfusion alone been shown to affect coronary flow. However, several factors may be involved. Data are presented that suggest that prolonged lung ischemia is associated with a decrease in the coronary flow, whereas reperfusion tends to promote an increase in the coronary flow. In addition to flow data, we observed that the LIR model results in a decreased diastolic force in ventricular contractility, an increase in coronary perfusion pressure, and an alteration in electrocardiographic ST changes. However, the heart responds with a compensatory mechanism following ischemia that seems to protect against further damage and restores normal heart function. It is believed that the heart is subjected to an ischemic event and that reperfusion produces a marked reduction in coronary flow because the ischemic conditions are not completely reversed. The coronary flow pattern in the different conditions appears to indicate that the reperfused coronary flow is greater than the flow of the nonreperfused heart, suggesting that an ischemia/reperfusion event leads to more alterations during the reperfusion phase. These alterations are probably depend on different mechanisms at play during the ischemia and reperfusion events.

Because of the differences between the various experiments, the data collected cannot yet be interpreted. However, the results suggest that the heart is subjected to an ischemia event and reperfusion is associated with an increase in coronary flow. This compensatory mechanism is probably a protective mechanism that can limit further damage.

The coronary flow pattern in the different conditions tested suggests that the heart is subjected to an ischemic event and that reperfusion is associated with a decreased coronary flow. After reperfusion, there is a compensatory reversion of flow to values similar to the ones prior to ischemia. It seems to be the only mechanism that the heart has to recover from the damage caused to its walls. This reversion may be due to different mechanisms, such as differences in the reperfusion time, the involvement of factors during the reperfusion process, the extent of the coronary arteries territory involved or the heart itself damaged. This model may be useful in establishing hypotheses about clinical situations to be tested during coronary occlusion periods.

There are two main types of studies of coronary flow: those that take place with the model lung ischemia/reperfusion, and those that involve the heart without the lungs. In the following pages are discussed two studies that we have published on the impact of prolonged lung ischemia and reperf",1

"Question: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes? Answer:  TTN: a role for polymorphisms in the ADRB3 and ADRB2?

Introduction

Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is the most common condition of respiratory distress requiring immediate intervention among preterm infants. It occurs primarily during the first three days of life and presents as a clinical syndrome characterized by a failure to thrive. Respiratory assistance, including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), surfactant replacement, and even the use of mechanical ventilation, are used to treat TTN. The etiology of TTN has not been established but appears to be multi-factorial based on the clinical course of the condition. The two most frequently implicated genes are adenylyl cyclase (AC) 3 and type 2 (ADRB2) adenylyl cyclase (AC) 2 genes. Both of these two genes are involved in the modulation of the AC that synthesizes cyclic AMP (cAMP) in response to beta adrenergic and G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at positions 49 and/or 709 of the ADRB3 gene is common among TTN cases, whereas an intronic polymorphism in the ADRB2 gene has been found to be associated with TTN. A role for polymorphisms in the ADRB3 and ADRB2 genes is now supported by multiple lines of evidence.

Objectives

In order to examine the role of polymorphisms in the ADRB2 and ADRB3 genes in TTN, four studies were conducted using a case-control design:

The first study (1) tested the hypothesis that the ADRB3 polymorphism is associated with TTN risk. The ADRB3 polymorphism was not correlated with risk for TTN. However, the second study (2) confirmed that the polymorphism at position 49 of the ADRB3 gene was associated with TTN risk in a large Asian population. The final study (3) in a European population also showed a significant association between the ADRB3 polymorphism and TTN risk. A study performed by the fourth group (4) showed an association between the ADRB2 gene polymorphism and TTN risk in a North American population.

Materials and Methods

First Study (1): To examine the association between the ADRB3 gene polymorphism and TTN risk, an analysis of the rs1042714 variant was conducted using an Iranian population from the Tehran (northern part of Iran) population (n = 645) using the following hypothesis: TTN cases (n = 192, gestational age<32 weeks) versus controls (n = 153, gestational age of 32 to 36 weeks). A minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.37 was identified in our controls. The frequencies of the variants differed between cases and controls (ORa = 2.38 with an unadjusted P value = 0.0026 and ORa = 2.24 with a P value = 0.018 after adjusting for gestational age, age, and gender). Based on our results, the ADRB3 polymorphism appears to be associated with an elevated risk of TTN and could be correlated with TTN risk in the Iranian population.

Second Study (2): The ADRB3 rs1042714 gene polymorphism was examined using an Indonesian (Jawa) population. This study included a total of 643 subjects of whom 192 and 151 participated in the TTN case-control and twin study, respectively. The MAF in the control group is 0.41. The frequencies of the rs1042714 variants differed between TTN case subjects (AA, n = 60, GA, n = 105 and GG, n = 27) and controls (AA, n = 46, [GA], n = 103 and [GG], n = 36). This pattern of variants differs significantly according to a multiple logistic regression model after adjusting for multiple factors (ORa = 1.99 with a P = 0.018, [ORa 2.04 with P = 0.030], and ORa = 2.33 with a P = 0.005 and a P value of 0.011, [ORa with P value = 3.36 with a P value of 0.0004].

Third Study (3): The ADRB3 rs1042714 gene polymorphism was examined using two European populations: a North European population (Swedish) and a South European population (Greek). This report included a total of 1385 subjects of whom 292 were TTN patients in Sweden, and 281 TTN in Greece. A MAF of 0.21 was identified in our control group in the Greek population.

"Question: Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment? Answer:  Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment? This assignment consists of a 1-hour written summary of a scientific question, a literature survey, and a paper in which you summarize findings from evidence-based research. The APA style is suggested for research papers.

1.  The aim of this study was to analyze duration of treatment and whether or not duration of treatment is associated with return into treatment. A total of 761 individuals with a ICD-10-coded diagnosis of depression, who had been treated in a specialist clinic, were treated for an average of 1.3 years. Using the duration of the treatment, they were categorized into one of three groups of treatment duration—short (≤ 6 months, n = 240), medium (6-12 months, n = 303), and long (≥ 12 months, n = 248)—and were evaluated for 6-month clinical remission. The 6-month remission rate was 37, 32, and 34% in the short, medium, and long treatment groups, respectively. The remission rate was significantly higher in the medium (p =.036) and long (p =.065) treatment groups compared to the short treatment group.

2. Background: Depressive disorders are highly prevalent, associated with an impact on the patient, and with major socioeconomic costs. The evidence-based treatment of depression is complex and includes at least 6-12 months of duration. It has been shown that long-term treatment results in lower remission rates as well as higher relapse rates (1,2). Several studies indicate that depressive disorders can be improved with less (3,4,5,6) and/or with more (7,8,9,10) treatment and that the duration of hospitalization may be reduced (11,12). The question has been raised whether the duration of initial hospitalization in the treatment of depressive disorders is to continue with the same or with the same intensity until the patient reaches an optimal outcome.

3. Purpose: This study was to answer the question whether or not the duration of initial hospitalization in the treatment of depressive disorders is to continue with as much intensity as initially or to change the intensity and decrease it over the course of the treatment process, with the aim of achieving optimal outcomes.

4. Methods: A total of 761 patients with depressive disorders (9.3%) were treated in a specialized clinic at the University of Magdeburg/Deutscher Spitzenverband from 1994 to 2009. This study included all patients treated after 1996 with a depressive disorder, as defined by the criteria of ICD-10. The initial discharge criteria for inpatient care were a score of ≥ 16 on the ICD-10 Depression scale. Sociodemographic, clinical, and outcome variables were assessed at baseline for 6-month clinical remission.

5. Results: Of the 761 patients treated, 239 (30.9%) were initially in treatment for less than 6 months, 303 (39.5%) were treated with treatment durations of 6 to 12 months, and 239 (30.8%) were treated for ≥ 12 months. The 6-month remission rates were 37.38, 32.58, and 34.05% in the short, medium, and long treatment groups, respectively, with a significant difference in the 6-month remission rates between the long and short treatment groups (p =.065). This difference, however, disappeared after adjusting for factors that differed between the treatment groups. Additional analyses showed a significantly higher probability (44.11% vs. 7.23%) for achieving 6-month remission with long treatment.

6. Conclusion: Long duration of initial hospitalization in the treatment of depressive disorders improves the 6-month remission rates and has a positive effect on the probability for patients to achieve 6-month remission.

Psychological treatment of unipolar depression has the most pronounced effect when it is started within 1 year after symptom onset (13). However, only a few of these patients go into remission after this treatment, leading to the question if the treatment period should be increased for these patients. This study analyzes whether the duration of initial psychological treatment is associated with the return into treatment as well as in the maintenance of treatment effects.

Results

In comparison with patients who were treated for ≤ 6 months, persons with a treatment duration of ≥ 12 months had an average age of 53.1, whereas persons with shorter treatment durations had an average age of 45.8 (Table 1). Men and women treated for ≥ 12 months were also more often married compared to the other treatment groups.

The group of women (N = 36) with a longer duration of initial treatment had the smallest proportion of patients with high work impairment among all groups (Table 2). With regard to psychiatric comorbidities, the longer the duration",1
"Question: Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery? Answer:  Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery?

It seems to me that the idea of the incision site being covered with a piece of skin is not as relevant as it used to be. The first operation I had was a lumbar laminectomy in which a very clean incision site was made. It was not covered. I had two epidural injections right after the surgery. One in the L4-L5 right above the scar and one in the L5-S1 area of the scar. In both locations the incision was deep enough that there was still muscle attached to the incision site. I was not able to stand without significant pain for over a month following these injections in the L4-L5 and L5-S1 incision sites. This seems to correlate strongly with what I hear of with the lumbar spine in general. Many people have excellent results after an early return to work after lumbar surgical procedures.

Another patient of mine had two spine fusions in the lumbar region. Both were anterior in nature and she has already had a lot of pain in her legs from the incision site. She now has a lot of pain in her back that she attributes to the scar tissue. She said that she also has a hard time lifting up her back. It seems like both of these patients were not given any kind of skin cover for the incision site. I feel that they should have been protected with the skin cover that I have used in all of my operations.

Question: Do spinal infections cause a lot of long term pain? You can add to or comment on my hypothesis. I suspect that spinal infections cause a lot of long-term pain, and I don’t understand why. I have one patient in particular who is in chronic pain. The patient in question has a bad infection in the L5-S1 facet joint and the infection has spread into the canal. In the right patient, a spinal infection can give way to spinal canal damage and permanent nerve damage. These patients are in a lot of pain for a long time and I think their pain may just never go away.

Many spinal infections happen not from injury but from bacteremia. This can happen in healthy people like dental procedures and from IV administration of drugs or from improper blood-collection. But when blood makes it up to the spinal fluid, it’s not a problem for most blood tests. When it gets through the arachnoid membrane or epidural space however, it can create a mass of dead cells and bacteria and even pus. It can create a hole, a cyst of some sort in the spinal canal. The spinal cord may be pressed against the dura, the outer layer of the spinal cord, pressing on the axons of the nerve fibers. There may not be a hole and no obvious symptoms but the spinal cord and the nerve fibers themselves become destroyed. The damaged brain stem becomes the “driver” of what the patient experiences. These symptoms from the spinal cord, the brain stem, and nerves are a lot less dramatic than the ones caused from having spinal bone and nerve damage. The nerve damage makes it difficult for the brain to interpret the sensory feedback from the pain receptors in the skin. So you might have no pain, but the brain says it’s still there. This can lead to what I like to call phantom pain, or the perception of pain in the absence of a true injury.

People with spinal infections are in a lot of pain. The pain often is worse with certain movements like standing or sitting down. I have seen no literature on this yet and I haven’t personally ever worked on one who was in chronic pain as a result of a spinal infection.

I want to talk about a patient who was in chronic pain for several years and had the benefit of working with a pain specialist at UC San Diego. The patient has since moved out of the state and his experience is not a good one at the present time.

The patient was an athlete initially and had been working out a lot. His activity began to decline and he started to develop a new injury in the lower sacroiliac joint. There are a lot of symptoms that point to the SI joint being bad, but the patient was also experiencing some low back, as well as groin pain, and a numb left leg.

The patient had a disc herniation at L4-L5-S1. At this point, the disc was pretty far out in the spine. The nerves that travel through and innervate the pelvis from the L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs are the sciatic and the posterior femoral cutaneous nerves. The sciatic nerve has two different components: a ventral and a dorsal component,",1
"Question: The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important? Answer:  The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture?

Answer: Atmospheric pressure is an important factor in the rupture of an aortic aneurysm. When a person passes a gas into a balloon under the action of pressure, the area of the balloon increases with increasing pressure up to a maximum area determined by the diameter and the density of the gas. For a fixed area, the number and size of gas molecules increase as the pressure rises. When this critical number or critical pressure of molecules per unit area is exceeded, the balloon ruptures. The critical pressure is the same whether the balloon is filled with water or an air or a gas mixture (see Appendix 1).

The elastic properties of blood vessels determine the amount of stretching necessary to rupture the walls of any part of the artery. The elastic properties of the various blood vessels are related to the amount of stretching associated with a given pressure load, which varies from one part to another. An important factor in rupture of the aorta is the strain rate and the time rate of change of this rate when this is very high, as at the time of aortic systole, the vessel stretches to a very great extent. Another important factor is the amount and distribution of strain. This can be expressed in terms of a stretch index (SI) calculated from strain divided by the diameter of the vessel. The amount of strain needed to rupture the aorta depends on the elastic properties of the aortic wall and the elastic properties of the surrounding tissues. The elastic properties of blood vessels vary considerably from person to person, but the elastic properties of tissues such as the aorta and surrounding tissues are basically the same.

The elastic properties of aortic tissue vary considerably in different regions and in different groups of people. The elastic properties of the aorta are also dependent mainly on the age of the person. These factors modify the maximum stretching or overstretching to which the aorta is exposed and the amount of strain, leading to rupture.

Aortic aneurysms are areas in the wall of the aorta where the wall of the vessel has become weakened and enlarged. This weakening results from inflammation, infection, loss of connective tissue, and genetic factors leading to abnormal repair of the weakening wall with connective tissue forming inside the wall. When the strength of the wall decreases to a certain level, stress (force/unit area) develops causing the weak part of the wall to bulge. In the case of aortic aneurysms, the rupture may result from a rise in blood pressure or from a fall of pressure in the aorta. A rise in blood pressure distends the aorta and, together with mechanical stretching, is an important factor in producing rupture. (For more detail, see ""Mechanics of Aortic Aneurysm Rupture"", from the American Heart Association, Circulation 1999 May 22;99(11):2114-45;

The elastic properties of the aorta and tissues vary considerably from person to person and from region to region within the same person. For example, the elastic properties of the aorta are greater in younger people in the ascending and descending aorta than in the abdominal aorta. (For example, see table 1, from the paper mentioned above, Circulation 1999 May 22;99(11):2114-45.)

The elasticity or strength of an elastic vessel is dependent on its thickness and its surrounding tissues. In the aortic wall there is a transition zone from thinner to thicker part in the anterior and posterior portions and a zone of greater thickening adjacent to the diaphragm (see figure below, left). Such thickening may be a result of a congenital or acquired defect of the fibrous membrane of the aorta. Normally, the elasticity of aortic tissue is greatest in the portion of the wall where the outermost layers, the adventitia, are thinnest. The tensile strengths of the wall of the ascending, descending, and abdominal aorta and the elasticity of the adventitia for a 60 year old person are shown in the right side of the table below (from the paper mentioned above, Circulation 1999 May 22;99(11):2114-45)

"Question: Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease? Answer:  Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease?

INTRODUCTION

This is a questionnaire-based, survey research that was carried out in order to determine the opinion of the general public in France about breaching patients' confidentiality for sexual disease prevention purposes and about the importance that the French public attaches to its acceptance. This study is particularly interesting and timely due to the current debate that is going on in our country about the acceptability of the screening of sexual diseases in public health settings, especially in gynecological clinics.

There is a risk of the public and their patients being exposed to stigmatization, even if disclosure is well-intentioned and medically-sound. According to the recent debate about the possibility of sexual disease screening in gynecological clinics, in some European countries (including France), it is currently possible to ask women to answer a series of questions about their sexual life, including the condom use. The intention of these questions is that their answers could later inform the prevention against the sexual transmission of human papillomavirus (with the objective of facilitating early diagnosis and management) and HIV, by recommending certain medical procedures or vaccinations and encouraging condom use. These questions, which are not part of an official medical visit, are anonymous and are not meant for medical purposes, at least that is what they are explained on the leaflets and the websites about these types of sexual health and prevention initiatives, but there is no obligation for the patient to accept. At the very least, this is not clear.

The risk of disclosing information without a medical indication is one of the main reasons why we should be cautious, if not sceptical, about the risk of such a screening program, especially if carried out in public health care settings \[1\].

The aim was to carry out an investigation about the attitudes of the French public towards the use of the medical excuse to reveal information that a sexual partner or a female patient has been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection without the patient's explicit consent. The same study is being carried out on health care professionals and we hope to publish the results at the end of 2012.

RESEARCH GOALS

The research focuses on (1) a review of the literature about the attitudes of French lay people and health professional towards sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and (2) investigating if the same attitudes were shared by the general public as well as health professionals, in France.

The medical excuse is defined here as ""the use of a medical, administrative or police document as legal justification to reveal information about the sexual history, such as a partner's diagnosis of a sexual disease or patient's diagnosis of a STD acquired by sexual intercourse, without revealing the patient's knowledge and consent"".

A second objective was to get to know how the French general public thinks about a breach of patient's confidentiality and whether the general public thinks that it is acceptable to reveal their sexual life history without their consent in the event of a serious disease such as HIV or STDs. It also focuses on the medical excuse to reveal the patient sexual history, without the patient's explicit consent for the prevention of infectious diseases.

Another objective was to explore if health professionals (nurses, doctors, obstetricians, midwife, etc.) agree with the general public opinion, and to find out what motivates them to agree or to disagree. It is important to note that the information and the sexual history of the partners of the patients could reveal a large number of STDs including HIV.

METHODS

To answer the questions posed to the general public about the medical excuse to reveal a partner's sexual history, a questionnaire was designed in France and in English, as this study required the collaboration of three different research institutions. This questionnaire was created in order to collect data in a standardized format and it was sent by email to 2,500 subscribers of the website www.recherche-opinion.fr (a survey website) in September 2011. Data were collected by two distinct groups of people.

The first group consisted of the researchers and members of the team at the Department of Sociology of Reims University (n = 50) were responsible for analyzing all the data and writing and submitting the scientific paper.

The second group of researchers and members of the French Association of Sexual Rights (Aspref) (n = 50) were responsible for collecting the data, reading the questionnaires before they were sent to the individuals, and sending the questionnaires back once the data had been received. All the questionnaires were checked for consistency using Epi Info software. A total of 1,200 questionnaires were read and checked. Only questionnaires that mentioned only one infection (with no mention of multiple STDs), and did not make",1
"Question: Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression? Answer:  Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?

Introduction {#S9}
============

Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide ([@R1]). Although the cause for major depression in a large portion of cases is unknown, family ([@R2]) and twin ([@R3]) studies have suggested that genetic variation plays a key role. It has been estimated that genetic factors contribute up to 50% of the variation in the risk of depression ([@R4]). Twin and adoption studies have found that familial transmission plays a key role in the onset of depression in early adulthood ([@R5]).

However, previous research into the genetic etiology of depression has used a psychiatric disorder diagnosis to index affective disorders. This requires the presence of a cluster of symptoms, which are sometimes overlapping and which may be seen as epiphenomena of the central disorder itself.

Recently, several studies have reported associations between somatic complaints and the depression spectrum. The somatic symptoms are not merely an expression of the psychological state but are independent of depression and anxiety.

To date, the main emphasis in investigating the relationship between depression and physical illness remains on the influence of physical disease on the course of depression. It is now suggested that physical illness should be viewed as a clinical dimension in its own right and that future research should focus on the biological mechanisms that produce depression from the perspective of physical illness ([@R6]). There is increasing interest among clinicians to consider physical complaints in diagnosing anxiety and depression, and the use of somatic symptoms has been recommended in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition) for the diagnosis of major depression in the absence of depression symptoms ([@R7]--[@R11]).

The aim of the current study was to assess somatic complaints as predictors of depression and anxiety symptoms in college students. By the use of a community sample, we are able to assess the impact on depression and anxiety of the severity of somatic complaints without the contribution of physical disease.

Methods and Procedures {#S10}
======================

Participants and Procedure {#S11}
--------------------------

The sample of participants consisted of 1,077 undergraduate college students from the University of Sydney from 2003 to 2005. The participants were approached to participate in the study during lectures. They were informed about the study and were given the option to either sign a consent form, provide written assent, or decline participation. The research protocol was approved by the University of Sydney\'s Human Ethics Committee.

Measures {#S12}
--------

Somatic complaints were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale for somatic complaints (CES-DC) ([@R12]), which is a self-report measure that assesses somatic pain, nausea, and fatigue in the past week. The measure comprises 20 items that are scaled from 0 to 3 in accordance with the participants\' reports to assess somatic complaints. Higher total scores represent more somatic complaints. Cronbach\'s alpha for the scale in this sample was 0.88.

The 21-item Patient Health Questionnaire-Depression scale was used to assess symptoms of depression ([@R13]). Each item is rated on a 0--3 scale to assess the extent to which the mood has been impaired over the past 2 weeks. The frequency of symptoms ranges from not at all (0) to nearly every day (3). The total score ranges from 0 to 63, with high scores indicating more severe depression. Cronbach\'s alpha for the scale in this sample was 0.74.

State anxiety was measured with the state part of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ([@R14]), a 20-item questionnaire that assesses current state anxiety levels. The scale has a reliability of 0.82 for state anxiety.

Demographic data, including age, gender, nationality, living arrangement, and academic year, were obtained.

Analysis {#S13}
--------

Pearson\'s correlation was used to analyze relations between CES-DC scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-Depression scale, and Spearman\'s correlation was used to analyze relations between CES-DC scale and state anxiety.

Results {#S14}
=======

Sample {#S15}
------

The majority of the sample was female (53.2%) and from an English-speaking background (76.9%), and 41% had had at least one episode of depression.

Age did not differ significantly between the groups (Friedman\'s χ^2^(8) = 20.66, *p* = 0.14).

There were no significant correlations between CES-DC scores and Patient Health Questionnaire-",1
"Question: Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data? Answer:  Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data? Do you know where to find this information? How would you answer this question using population health data?

Introduction

Research Questions

Introduction

Pregnancy is a major public health issue for women and their babies. Depression during pregnancy often results in women becoming disabled and having their baby prematurely. To know whether depression affects the baby’s health, many studies have been performed that collect data on depressed women from clinical population samples. Yet studies examining depressive symptoms in the general women’s population are scarce.

The aim of the Research Question

The purpose of my paper is to research and discuss whether women with major depression in pregnancy can be identified in population health data. For this analysis, I will use data from the nationally representative National Health Service Births and Stillbirths Statistics (NHSBSTS), from July 2011– June 2010. The NHSBSTS is a yearly, representative health survey and is based on the NHS Family Resources Survey or NHS FRES, an annual survey on the wellbeing of the UK's population. It also records information on children’s births and stillbirths.

Methods

I will identify all live births and stillbirths for women who were registered with their general practitioner between July 2011– June 2012, aged 16–49 and recorded as having no mental health issues. This group of women will be compared with all women who have given birth in the same age and time periods but did not have any mental health issues. I will also look at the data in four different time periods: July 2011– June 2012 and March 2011, April 2011, May 2011, and June 2011. I will then analyse each group separately to assess whether the mental health status of women is reflected in the population health data. This will be done through comparison of rates for key indicators.

Outcome

There were a total of 28,096 births in the survey year (July 2011– June 2012) and this equates to an estimated 5.04 births per 100 women aged 20–49, with a birth rate of 1.27 per 100 women, and 3.23 births per 100 women aged 16–19. Also recorded by the NHSBSTS were 14 stillbirths and 718 births to women who had a previous stillbirth, giving a stillbirth rate of 3.35 per 1000 births, and a stillbirth-to-birth rate of 0.24. Finally, there were 974,856 live births from women with no mental health issues, making a live birth rate of 5.22 per 100 women, and a stillbirth-to-live birth ratio of 0.25. The stillbirth and live birth rates were then calculated per day for the dates listed above, with March–June 2011 used as the comparison period for analysis.

Results

The stillbirth-to-live birth ratio on selected dates is calculated and analysed. There are more stillbirths registered per day for the first three selected months (April–June 2011) compared with other months. This could be potentially explained by the fact that the NHSBSTRSTS sample is mostly made up of women in the reproductive age group. To assess whether there is a shift in pregnancy outcomes associated with the mental health of women, rates for key indicators (stillbirth, live birth, neonatal death, and infant death) were calculated by comparing per day rates for live births in selected months (July–June 2012) from women without mental health issues to rates for the corresponding months for all women. The rate for stillbirths per day is significantly different for selected months, with average rates being significantly higher for women with depression from the selected months compared with months where women had no mental health issues. For live births, the rate for infants was also significantly different, with a lower average rate for women with depression from the selected months than months where women had a mental health issue (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Rate difference for live births and stillbirths by month of gestation for selected months in comparison to the corresponding months for women with depression. Analysis of all available months was not possible due to missing data.

Discussion

It could be a matter of poor sampling in those months, but this is not the case. When months are combined the results are consistent. The results of this research show that women with depression still have poor pregnancy outcomes, even when it is a well-recorded, longitudinal survey from general practices. It is important to note that the difference in the rates for both stillbirths as well as live births in women with depression does not appear to be related to the pregnancy (pregnancy rate is higher for those months compared with July 2011–June 2012).

Conclusions

Overall, women with depression during pregnancy have a poorer pregnancy outcome than women without mental health issues",1

Answer:  The inverse equity hypothesis: does it apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries? Write an abstract for a scientific paper in any area of science or health policy that answers the Question: Why do some countries have better health outcomes than others? Write a short summary to summarize the findings in your abstract.

Background
==========

Health inequities are a major challenge in the Americas -- a problem that appears more apparent in many Latin American countries than others in the region. Equity in health is usually understood as social justice, a concept that requires both distributional and opportunity principles that are often in contrast to each other. Equity or inequity in health is most often related to differences in socio-economic status, such as education, income, sex, race/ethnicity, occupation, access to treatment, geography, and/or other social variables. However, the concept may also be analyzed in terms of access, quality, use, or use appropriateness of needed health resources, including health services, treatment, diagnostic services and medications ([@R1],[@R2]).

Although most Latin American countries do not have comprehensive coverage of basic health systems that include all of these equity dimensions, a few, notably Chile, Cuba and Mexico, have done relatively well when compared to other countries in the region. Other countries are closer to middle-income countries elsewhere in the world, and many countries in the region now have policies and laws focused on health human resources. Brazil, which is both upper-middle and middle-income, now has universal access to basic health services ([@R3],[@R4]).

Yet, in many countries, there remain fundamental socioeconomic, socio-economic and gender inequities as well as limited access to health services, medicines and technologies ([@R3],[@R5]). This persistent inequality is most apparent in poorer countries where both poor and rich have unequal access to health, but the gap has widened and, in many cases, it is poor who have limited access ([@R6]).

While the concept of health inequity has long been recognized as a problem in Latin America, there has been relatively little research into the potential causes of inequities. A recent series of studies in Brazil ([@R7]--[@R11]) analyzed a number of health systems issues, including the lack of coverage, access, quality of care, and appropriateness of drugs and tests and technology. The studies examined these issues for the primary care, hospital, pharmaceutical and health monitoring systems and for private health insurance ([@R3],[@R7]--[@R11]).

They concluded that in addition to the fact that not all people benefit equally from the resources that are available, another important explanation was the fact that the use of health services does not happen at the right place or time to benefit most people, especially the poor, and a lack of quality in the care delivered. Among the studies ([@R8]--[@R11]), the authors identified the lack of attention to primary health care to be one primary cause of increased inequity, especially in poorer population and of higher disease burden and severity ([@R8]). In addition, there is a lack of attention in providing primary care, which leads to secondary care ([@R8]--[@R10]). This in turn leads to an increase in adverse outcomes and a need to use expensive health services such as pharmaceuticals, surgeries, or specialty diagnostic tests that are not covered by insurance ([@R8]--[@R10],[@R12]).

In Latin American, as in most health reform efforts in the world, coverage and access to care has been emphasized, and there have been major initiatives to ensure universal access to services as required by the Millennium Development Goals. Although most of the region has achieved such goal through social protection programs and, more recently, social spending to support health, and many countries in the region have also achieved relatively good progress in the last decade in terms of reduction of maternal and child mortality ([@R13]), the picture is not as good for countries in other dimensions such as the quality of care, inequity of access to care, the availability of medications, diagnostic tests, and health technologies, among other criteria.

In Brazil, coverage of primary care and hospital care has increased substantially in the last decade, so that universal access to those services has been achieved for nearly all the population ([@R14]). Coverage of health services in Brazil also includes a small group of the population that has comprehensive coverage through the private health system. However, this system is much smaller than the public system (approximately 8%), and this coverage is focused only on specific groups of the population such as the better-off, those who work with private employers or those who work for private organizations ([@R14]). Also, the private insurance is not comprehensive, and",1

"Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer:  Can aromatase inhibition prevent osteoporosis-related musculoskeletal symptoms in postmenopausal women?

Introduction {#S1}
============

Aromatase inhibitors (AI), a family of drugs that act by limiting estrogen synthesis, improve survival in breast cancer, especially in patients with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or *HER2/neu*-positive tumors ([@B1], [@B2]). After the introduction of AIs in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, concerns emerged regarding musculoskeletal side effects associated with aromatase inhibition, including joint pain, back pain, and bone fractures ([@B3], [@B4]). The exact mechanism and prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms associated with AI are unknown ([@B4]), and no studies to date have systematically examined these musculoskeletal symptoms in AI-treated patients.

Question: Aromatase-related musculoskeletal side effects: a common symptom?

Aromatase inhibitors {#S1-1}
--------------------

Aromatase, an enzyme found predominantly in the gonads but also in the brain, converts androgens to estrogens ([@B5]). Aromatase has been found in bone tissue, and inhibition of aromatase has been postulated to limit estrogen levels in bone tissue, resulting in decreased bone mineral density (BMD) ([@B6]). The two AIs currently indicated in the US for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, *HER2*-negative metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women are exemestane ([@B7]) and letrozole ([@B8]). Exemestane, introduced in 2001, has been associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease ([@B9]) and may also be associated with increased risks for fractures of the face, spine, hip, and wrist ([@B9]--[@B11]). In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning, but allowed the prescription of letrozole, for women with receptor-positive, ER-positive tumors and no known contraindications ([@B8]). Postmenopausal women have been prescribed AI for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and to reduce or prevent breast cancer recurrence in the adjuvant setting.

Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal side effects {#S1-2}
--------------------------------------------------------

Musculoskeletal side effects, both bone-related and non-bone related, have been associated with AI treatment; however, data are conflicting, and no systematic or prospective studies examining musculoskeletal symptoms and breast cancer patients have been published. One small retrospective study found that, regardless of the type of AI, postmenopausal women being treated with AI tended to have a higher incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms, including increased risk of bone fractures, as compared with postmenopausal women on non-hormonal treatment ([@B12]). Another retrospective study, also small, compared premenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with AI, and found increased musculoskeletal symptoms, bone fractures, and lumbar spinal compression fractures compared with women receiving non-hormonal therapy ([@B13]).

Question: Does musculoskeletal symptom frequency or severity change after initiation of AI in breast cancer patients?

Methods {#S2}
=======

A search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Google, and the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) databases was conducted using the medical subject heading terms aromatase inhibitor, exemestane, and letrozole to identify English-language publications from November 2008 through May 2013. Relevant articles were evaluated by the authors for the presence of two key words, ""aromatase inhibitor"" and ""post-menopause,"" to identify studies pertaining to symptomatic side effects of AIs in breast cancer patients. Reference citations from relevant articles and review articles were also examined for articles pertaining to the topic of post-menopausal women receiving AIs. We included articles focused on musculoskeletal side effects in postmenopausal hormone-sensitive breast cancer patients receiving AI at doses effective for breast cancer treatment. We excluded articles on endocrine therapy without the addition of AI (e.g., tamoxifen or ovarian ablation) or studies solely on endocrine therapy without the use of AIs. We also excluded articles in non-English language, reviews, meta-analyses, case reports, and commentaries.

Results {#S3}

We identified seven articles focusing on musculoskeletal side effects in",1
"Question: Could different follow-up modalities play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses? Answer:  How would you conduct a research on this topic?

Answer: In our study, we retrospectively analysed data on women with follow-up. Our cohort of patients is highly heterogeneous, with many types of cancer in different stages. The follow-up protocols vary in terms of duration as well as the test results (imaging or endometrial sampling).

The literature shows that in women with normal preoperative and postoperative test results, the mean period between the operation and the endometrial sampling or/and imaging and the test results are similar.

There is little experience with the follow-up of women who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but on the basis of the data available, we have come to the conclusion that they have the same indications as other women. In this respect, we do not recommend systematic follow-up with a view to detecting an endometrial recurrence at an early stage. In our opinion, this type of investigation is not justified, and we think that it would be a waste of resources, the risk of complications is relatively high and there is no proven benefit. In most women, the risk-benefit balance is negative and would not be worth putting in place an appropriate follow-up protocol. We think that the cost-benefit ratio is negative and that it is not worth implementing a procedure that has not been proven to have therapeutic value.

Question: What type of research would you recommend to find the right answers to the Question?

Answer: The research should focus on assessing the true incidence of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses and should involve large numbers of patients.

Question: Have you completed your research project? Have you published the results?

Answer: Yes

"Question: Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia: does it matter? Answer: 

Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia: does it matter?

Introduction

Esophageal atresia (EA) is a complex malformation with a reported incidence of one in 4,200 to 21,100 live births, in which the esophagus is deficient (open) and the trachea is normally developed. The condition can cause severe respiratory tract compromise or failure, thus requiring reconstructive surgery for survival. Preoperative bronchoscopy is used as an essential component of the surgical strategy in EA and other neonates with severe respiratory distress syndrome, including high-risk nonimmune surgical patients1,2,3,4,5,6,7. It can also be performed in preopertive stabilization as an additional procedure for assessment of the structural and functional aspects of upper airway anatomy and physiology. It is still debated, though, whether it is also necessary in newborns with EA to accurately direct the surgical repair8,9.

Aims

To conduct a literature review to describe the indications and usefulness of preoperative bronchoscopy in newborns with EA.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science search on studies published in English since 1968 and found using the terms \[""esophageal atresia"" or ""esophageal atresia and trachea""\] and \[""bronchoscopy"" or ""tracheobronchoscopy""\]. We also reviewed the references from the relevant articles and published guidelines, all in the English language. We excluded case series where all newborns had esophageal atresia, as well as abstracts without data on indications for bronchoscopies, newborns, and infants. We extracted data on the following variables: the age of the patients, the reasons and findings of bronchoscopies, the surgical techniques performed, morbidity and mortality data, the length of hospital stay, and long-term follow-up.

Results

We located a total of 1,024 articles, of which 44 were considered potentially relevant to the Question. The indications for pre-operative bronchoscopy in newborns with EA included evaluating the esophageal and pharyngeal obstruction, assessing the lower anatomy and lung function, detecting the presence of associated anomalies and identifying the correct diagnosis of EA, as well as assessing the viability of surgical repair and detecting the presence of associated anomalies, such as tracheomalacia and congenital lobar emphysema8,9.

Bronchoscopic findings may be: 1) congenital tracheal stenosis, 2) congenital pharyngeal stenosis, 3) esophageal stricture or stenosis, 4) pulmonary airway abnormalities, and 5) esophageal or pharyngeal malformations, such as double aortic arch, tracheal web, and other vascular malformations8.

Bronchoscopy can show esophageal and lower airway anatomy and provide additional information on lung function using forced expiratory volume, forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of vital capacity, flow expiratory time/flow time; it can also rule out the presence of congenital tracheomalacia of the thoracic trachea, and even of tracheal sleeve syndrome when the patient is awake. The examination can also identify pulmonary airway abnormalities, such as congenital lobar emphysema or interstitial emphysema, and bronchial agenesis9.

The indications and usefulness of preoperative bronchoscopy, therefore, vary with the surgical approach, the presence of tracheomalacia, and the presence of associated anomalies, such as congenital lobar emphysema.

Bronchoscopy in babies with EA can be performed after stabilization of the newborn. It is usually performed in conjunction with cardiopulmonary tests, and is performed under general anesthesia, unless a stable newborn can sustain spontaneous nasal expirations8. There is an adequate amount of time to perform the procedure because the risks of tracheobronchoscopy are small. The most frequent complications are hypoxemia with a temporary decrease in lung compliance and transient desaturation due to positive pressure ventilation (PPV), although the risk of hypoxemia is extremely low, occurring in less than 1% of newborns. Other complications include airway edema and mucosal inflammation, subglottic stenosis, lacerations of the epiglottis or arytenoid cartilage, subglottic hemorrhage and foreign body aspiration8,10.

"Question: Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs input? Answer:  Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organ input? If you are writing an essay rather than an entire scientific paper, then do not place word restrictions or format limitations in the Abstract. You may wish to place a word count restriction on the Abstract and see if that influences the Abstract. In your abstract for this question you need to take into account the following, which should not hinder your abstract:

The information in the abstract is provided in a manner that explains the topic and presents your results within a context of prior research.

As in any abstract, your abstract needs to be clear and concise.

Your abstract will be edited and modified based on feedback from the grader.

There is usually more information in an abstract than is required of the full paper, so you must write an interesting, informative, and concise summary of the paper's main findings or conclusion in your Abstract. Focus your paper's message rather than your message, and do not repeat information from the introduction.

In your introduction, you have the opportunity to make a lasting impression on the person reading your abstract. The introduction does not need to be long, but must introduce enough substance for the grader to understand your contribution to the field.

As you work on your full paper, you will begin to develop a thesis statement that will express the main idea of your paper. At this writing stage, you need to write a brief summary of your paper. You will explain the significance of your work by presenting it in relation to the current literature and also by explaining how your work has helped make meaningful progress toward answering the question of interest. A solid thesis is the first thing that the grader will read, and if you do not have a well-developed thesis, your paper will need to be revised. The thesis is also the main message that will be discussed in the introduction and that the first paragraph of the body (Abstract) will draw attention to. You will want to use different types of language in your thesis and first paragraph. Write your thesis statement as a statement of fact rather than a statement of opinion. The thesis statement needs to express something meaningful that will advance our understanding of the topic. The thesis statement should be supported with clear and specific evidence or by a discussion of past work related to the topic. For further information as to what the thesis statement is and how it differs from the thesis statement read further here.

As a general guideline, focus on what distinguishes your paper as special and not on what makes your paper similar to other papers in the field. This will help you in building the case for why your contribution is valuable and why it should be published.

"Question: Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy? Answer:  Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy? You will need to take into account that the topic of your work should be a clinical investigation and not a systematic review. The background should have one or more of the following types of questions:What is the prevalence or incidence of perforation of the appendix in infertility patients?In patients with tubal infertility, is perforation of the appendix more common in patients with tubal infertility as compared to a control group?What is the pathogenetic significance of perforation of the appendix in infertility patients?

Answer: Perforation of the appendix is not a risk factor for ectopic pregnancy, neither during the infertility assessment nor at the time of the procedure. Perforation of the appendix occurs when the appendix has become inflamed or inflamed in the mucosa. Perforation of the appendix is also termed ruptured appendicitis. Rarer are infections or infections of the appendix such as appendicitis with *C. difficile* infection. [Figure 1](#f0001){ref-type=""fig""} shows a specimen of appendix in the operation theatre, which is being prepared to remove it laparoscopically. FIGURE 1Specimen of appendix in the operation theatre being prepared to remove it laparoscopically.

Perforation is one of the signs of appendicitis, but it may or may not be symptomatic, depending on various factors. In many cases, perforation passes out through the bowel and it may be seen during a procedure or later. A small perforation with an abscess will not usually cause any problems. Infection at the base of the appendix is a true risk factor for ectopic pregnancy since it causes ectopic implantation of the embryo in the ampulla or in the isthmus. This may be due to the direct effect of the inflammation on the ampulla or implantation in this location.

Perforation of the appendix has a well-defined preoperative diagnosis. This was performed by ultrasound-guided paracentesis of the appendicitis, which confirms the diagnosis in 85% of cases, in the first hours after surgery in \>95% of cases and in most cases can be done directly on the operation table or on the operation table. The incidence of perforation and its associated complications is approximately one per 200,000 population per year, but these vary according to the population and the time of year. In the USA, the incidence is around five per 100,000 population. [Table 1](#t0001){ref-type=""table""} shows an overview of data from different sources.

"Question: Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist? Answer:  Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist?

Contents

Introduction

Neisseria gonorrhoeae or gonorrhoea, a Gram-negative, non-motile, aerobic coccobacilli, is a major cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide. More than 90 percent of gonorrhoeic infections are attributed to only three serological groups: I-III, which are the most common. Group I is the major cause of oropharyngeal gonorrhoea whereas Group II accounts for about 11 percent of pharyngeal infections and Group III for about 1 percent of oropharyngeal infections. Despite the serological grouping of N. gonorrhoae isolates, there is a considerable diversity within the different genetic branches or serovars of N. gonorrhoeae and this diversity accounts for the differences in virulence, epidemiology, antimicrobial sensitivity and drug resistance (2).

To study and compare the antigenic nature of the different groups of N. gonorrhoeae, a serological procedure that uses standard agglutination and indirect haemagglutination techniques has been developed. The aim of this test is to identify specific antibody reactions of N. gonorrhoeae against the different antigenic forms which might explain the apparent inappearance of gonorrhoea caused by a certain serovar as a result of natural immunity.

Methodology

In the present study, we tested human sera for gonococcal group-specific antibody (1). Gonococci from each serological group (I.I.-II.II.III.) were cultured from a patient affected with gonorrhoea. The bacterial suspensions containing 100 colony forming units (CFU) were transferred into 10 μL of sterile water and suspended at 37°C for an hour followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was discarded and 1 μL of the bacterial pellet was suspended in sterile distilled water. The bacterial suspension was used for the test by adding 50 μL of the suspension into 2-3 drops of the respective dilutions of antisera; all antisera were aseptically obtained in triplicate. Each of these reaction mixtures were observed for agglutination within 15-30 minutes. The sera were tested by serial twofold dilutions (starting with a reciprocal titer of 1 in to 1 in 16). Titer (1 in) was used to indicate a highly agglutinated reaction by the test, whereas a titer of 1 in 16 or 1:16 meant that no agglutination took place in the sample.

Results

Group specific antibody to N. gonorrhoeae was seen in various sera (Table 1). We also found that one isolated gonococcal strain from each serological group gave titers similar to those of the group of origin, indicating that they were antigenically identical. Serovar I.I. and serovar II.II. produced strong agglutination with group specific antisera. The serovar I.V. produced agglutination with group specific antisera; while serovar III.III. gave weak agglutination. All group specific antisera gave a positive reaction with all three isolates. Thus, no group specific immunity to N. gonorrhoeae could be observed.

Discussion

Gonococci have been classified into various serological groups based on differences in sensitivity to phage typing, plasmid content and various other characteristics. Serotypes differ in their antigenic properties and the number of antigenic types is constantly increasing (3,4). This wide diversity can explain the inappearance of gonorrhoea-causing isolates due to a natural immunity. N. gonorrhoeae may also change serologically because of genetic transformation.

The aim of this study was to test specific antibody in sera of patients against serogroup I.I., serogroup II.II and serogroup III.III isolates representing the serologically defined groups I, II and III N. gonorrhoeae respectively, and to test the isolates for antibody in the same way. Our results showed no specific immunity against gonorrhoea for serogroup I, nor did we find any specific immunity against gonorrhoea isolated for serogroup II and serogroup III for all groups, I.I.-II.II.III., respectively. In a similar study, it has shown that serum did not contain anti-N. gonorrhoeae specific antibodies in human and animal sera (5). However, we also found that 1",1
"Question: May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies? Answer:  May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies?

Introduction {#cesec10}
============

In medicine it is expected that both student and faculty examiners be able to examine students during the clinical years of their training in the same fashion and to the same standard as they would in their own clinical years. To this end, examinations are conducted using students as student examiners, and they are asked to assess the skills of other students under examination. These examinations have the potential to provide students with authentic workplace experience, in which they can interact with, and learn from, their faculty supervisor in a clinical setting.[@bib1] For patients, these examinations are an important way of assessing the performance of the student and their ability to cope with the situation as a trainee.

Traditionally, examinations of this nature have been conducted in a variety of ways. Most students use their own teachers in examining students, and this seems to be the method of choice in medical schools around the world.[@bib2], [@bib3] However, some students do not feel comfortable using their own teachers as examiners due to the potential for bias on part of the teacher[@bib4], [@bib5] and a fear of unfair criticism of themselves.[@bib3] The latter point has been highlighted in an Australian study wherein students complained that teachers frequently over-criticised their work for fear of being blamed for the student\'s mistake.[@bib6]

For many institutions, a barrier to performing clinical examinations within their own discipline is the financial cost. However, students and teachers would both benefit from the ability to examine students in a clinical simulated environment where their clinical performance could be observed by supervisors with the same level of oversight, if possible.[@bib7], [@bib8] There is little consensus as to whether, or how, supervisors other than a principal examiner should perform these competency evaluations.[@bib9]

We present the first OSCE as conducted in our institution, which was developed by incorporating the principles of constructive alignment, problem based learning, and simulation-based medical education.[@bib10] The objective of the OSCE was to simulate an emergency scenario in the presence of an examiner. These principles were incorporated mainly to increase the validity of the examination. The study also intended to ascertain if the examiners would be able to undertake this form of examination in the same context as their own clinical years of training.[@bib11], [@bib12], [@bib13], [@bib14], [@bib15], [@bib16], [@bib17], [@bib18], [@bib19], [@bib20]

Methods {#cesec20}
=======

The examination took place in June and July 2016 in the Department of Internal Medicine, Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand. The examination consisted of two stations. The first station was a patient emergency room (ER) with no doctors present. The purpose of the examination was to determine whether students can manage an immediate emergency. Students were assessed as to their ability to perform various critical tasks with a view to examining the skills of students under examination. Two examiners were used, one as a faculty member in the ward and one as a student. A simulated patient was employed to observe the student as they performed the tasks. After the students had completed their assessment of the patient, the student and the faculty were interviewed by the examiner as to the clinical context in which the clinical decisions needed to be made (see appendix). The patient was interviewed and scored by an external member of the staff.

In the second station, six students were assessed one student-to-one faculty examiner. Students assessed each other as they were assessed to ensure they were able to respond to both positive and negative feedback and to maintain an equitable response to the task. Students examined their peers on the first few stations. After a short break, each student-to-one faculty examiner was assessed.

Setting and context {#cesec30}
-------------------

The OSCE was administered in the Department of Internal Medicine at Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand. Auckland City Hospital is a 550-bed tertiary referral hospital with a range of inpatient services including a large mixed medical ward in the department of emergency medicine and critical care. This department is a teaching department to four of the five medical schools in New Zealand. Students who have successfully completed basic clinical attachment to the department of emergency medicine and intensive care during their clinical years are considered for participation in the OSCE.

"Question: Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade? Answer:  Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade?

Introduction

Most of us remember the famous case in which the astrocytic tumor (astrocytoma) of the pons was described as a diffuse astrocytoma (grade II) in contrast with the nodular astrocytoma (grade III) on the opposite side. This case and its interpretation was first reported by Verocai in 1967, following which all reported cases of astrocytomas in the pons have been classified as grade II astrocytomas. In contrast, most cases of astrocytoma in the hemisphere or along the frontal lobe (frontal lobe type) have been classified as grade III astrocytomas, and when the same cells extend peripherally to the pial surface and are present at lower levels (lateral type) they often have only one part designated grade II, because it is very difficult to establish whether this is a part of the tumor that has been infiltrated, or whether it represents a single small component of the tumor.

In the case just described there is good evidence that grade II and III cases are distinguished histologically, but this does not apply in practice. For instance, we could say that the tumor has grade II characteristics because it shows a low degree of nuclear pleomorphism and proliferation rate, but we might also say that it has grade III characteristics because it is a highly vascularized neoplasm with large endothelial cell complexes and perivascular zones. There are two problems here. Firstly, the criteria for grade II have never been clearly defined. This may have been an attempt to use a simple measure that could be applied consistently to brain tumors of an even histological appearance, but this is clearly an unsatisfactory practice because a tumor, even of the same type, may be more or less differentiated for some other reason. Therefore the term grade II, which has been so widely used in the literature, should probably at the very least be confined to cases like that reported above. Secondly, the term grade II, or even grade III, does not in itself differentiate a tumor from that of another type, because it does not specify whether these other characteristics are due to infiltration, or whether they represent an intrinsic difference in tumor cells, which of course would be possible.

The distinction between astrocytoma and glioblastoma is often made on a pathological basis, and the most common astrocytoma is found to be a low-grade glioma or astrocytoma. This type of astrocytoma rarely progresses to a grade IV brain tumor. Most cases of astrocytoma and anaplastic astrocytoma in the brain have a short clinical course, with the tumor being only one of the incidental findings on neurosurgical investigation. However, if they have a prolonged clinical course it can be associated with a shorter survival rate than if the tumor is grade IV.

Anaplastic astrocytoma.

Anaplastic astrocytoma is often characterized, in the older literature, by the presence of mitoses and microvascular proliferation within the tumor, but now a more important feature is the presence of large multinucleated cells. Multinucleated tumor cells have been recognized by various pathologists and the term giant cell or bizarre cell has been applied because large numbers of such cells can be found in tumors like astrocytomas. These cells may also be called anaplastic or pleomorphic astrocytoma by some authors.

It is likely that astrocytomas are in fact a collection of tumors with common morphologic features that are distinguished from this group of tumors by variations in their degree of differentiation or malignancy. The most common variants are listed in [Fig. 1], along with the most frequent cell types found in astrocytomas, although this is not the same as classifying astrocytomas histopathologically from grade I to IV. There have been a remarkable number of variants in astrocytomas described in the literature, but some of them may be cases of a single tumor. In particular the so-called chiosarcomas are found in astrocytes (Figure 2) as well as in cells of other types (Figure 5), and are probably better categorized under the term astrocytoma chrondrosarcoma rather than as a distinct entity.

Astrocytoma

Astrocytomas are the most common astrocytic tumor type, affecting the young and therefore often referred to as ‘juvenile’ astrocytomas. Anaplastic astrocytomas are the second most common astrocytic tumors with the exception of gl",1
"Question: Do healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources? Answer:  Do healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources? Using the literature review technique, you will provide in a single paper a clear and concise explanation of the health, behavioral, and social reasons why fewer people choose to use health services. A literature review often follows a question and provides answers to that question in a coherent manner, either by discussing the literature using examples and arguments or by listing relevant references using a bibliography. While the format does not have to be as elaborate and formal as a traditional scientific paper, a high standard is expected. We suggest referring to the literature review section for more detailed instructions on paper creation. Due to the extensive amount of content, this assignment should take approximately 45 to 60 minutes to complete. Please note, however, that this time frame should only be used as a guideline, and the review should not exceed the stated time length. The goal of the review is to explain the reasons why fewer people choose to use health services. This task will involve following and understanding these concepts: * What is a literature review? * What does the “literature” or “science” in a literature review refer to? * What are some of the most common reasons why fewer people choose to use healthcare services? * What are some of the reasons why individuals choose to use services? * How can you prove causation? * How do you use the literature review assignment guidelines?

An answer is required in two parts. Part 1 is due at the time of class submission. Part 2 due 2 days after the class date.

Submission guidelines for the Literature Review assignment

The assignment guideline is a general guideline on the required format of the literature review. Any deviation from this general guideline should be justified and clearly discussed in your review.

Introduction

The literature review should provide an intellectual summary of what is understood about this topic. While a good literature review should provide an overview of the information it discusses, we expect the literature review in this assignment to have a stronger emphasis on describing and summarizing the results of scientific inquiry, for example, by discussing the evidence or conclusions.

The literature review assignment must follow the following guidelines:

1) Your review should begin with a question. It should also end with a question. It should never be the case that the final question or thesis stated in the review is implied by the question. Please make sure to state both the question and the thesis (or the research hypotheses) in the last sentence of the review. If you don’t have a question or thesis statement, we strongly recommend referring to the assigned literature review assignment guidelines for suggestions. For tips on writing the literature review, refer to our Literature Review assignment guidelines. 2) The review does not need to contain every citation or reference found, but rather a select list of important references should be included. When reporting references, please use APA citation style. Please do not include any citation or reference information in your attachment; the class website is provided to post all references in the review. 3) The literature review format should follow APA, MLA, or Chicago citation conventions. Please click here for APA citation instructions. Please click here for MLA citation instructions. Please click here for Chicago citation instructions. 4) Please provide the name of the author with whom you were cited, the page number on which you have found the reference, and the journal in which the article was published. Please reference the document(s) to the APA format. 5) Do not forget to check to make sure your spelling is correct! We expect a scholarly writing and proofreading process within which you cannot go wrong, but there is no excuse for careless mistakes. A proofreading can quickly be done by sending the last part of the review to a native. If you do not feel you are able to proofread your own work a professional is available for a reasonable fee through the University. 6) It is very important that the review be a single paper that is not longer than eight double-spaced page. If your review uses quotations from multiple articles or books of varying length, remember that the total number of pages must not exceed the total number of pages used in the entire piece. 7) Please include at least one page that clearly states your thesis statement. 8) For an assignment that is assigned for a higher level course (above the APA level), please provide information that demonstrates your competency and command of APA guidelines. You should include in your assignment at least",1
"Question: Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH? Answer: 

“Can antral follicle count (AFC) as an ovarian reserve test be used as a prognostic tool to predict IVF embryo outcome in women undergoing IVF?”

Response:

Antral follicles (small preantral follicles) are of variable size but they are closely associated with the ovarian reserve.[@b1-asm-1-40] The AFC evaluates the number of follicles 2--8 mm in diameter and it is assumed to reflect the true number of recruited primordial follicles in the ovary. The AFC is therefore used both as a parameter of ovarian reserve and as a predictor of cycle outcome in assisted reproduction. AFC has recently also been used in menopausal women undergoing hormone replacement therapy.[@b2-asm-1-40] AFC measurement can therefore give additional information regarding both the reproductive process and the management of women with abnormal conditions, including those with premature menopause.

AFC is routinely assessed on the day of oocyte retrieval in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.[@b3-asm-1-40] The procedure for AFC measurement is straightforward and the equipment is readily available. Measurement is quick (10--15 minutes) and there are no additional laboratory tests required. However, some patients experience discomfort and pain during ovarian puncturing. Furthermore, there is a possibility of a false low AFC measurement although the specificity of the test is reported between 78% and 98%.[@b4-asm-1-40],[@b5-asm-1-40] Other ovarian reserve tests are less easy to perform and require additional laboratory tests, which may raise the cost of the procedure. Despite these limitations, AFC measurement can be useful as a marker of the quality or quantity of the oocyte pool, and therefore as a powerful tool useful to predict the chances of subsequent IVF treatment success.[@b6-asm-1-40] Previous studies showed that AFC is a superior predictor of IVF treatment with respect to the number of oocytes collected.[@b7-asm-1-40]--[@b9-asm-1-40] However, there are limited data to show that AFC is superior to age and FSH in predicting IVF cycle outcome, even though the best cutoff value and predictive ability remain to be determined.[@b10-asm-1-40]--[@b12-asm-1-40] In particular, studies about cycle outcome have shown that there is a wide range for both AFC and age in women undergoing IVF, particularly in terms of pregnancy chances.[@b13-asm-1-40],[@b14-asm-1-40] Therefore, large-scale, well-controlled patient series with well-matched controls need to be further studied in order to improve the evidence base for the clinical use of AFC or age as markers of biological markers and predictors of IVF outcome.

The present study assessed the clinical usefulness of AFC as an ovarian reserve test and a predictor for IVF cycle outcome as stated in the question. Therefore, we measured the AFC both pre- and post-COH in women undergoing IVF treatment (n=70), and then compared them in terms of ovarian response and pregnancy outcome. We also compared the clinical outcomes of this study with different age and AFC cut-off levels.

Methods
=======

The present study was performed using the records of the in vitro fertilization program at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center between September 2005 and December 2011. FSH and AFC measures were obtained from patients undergoing COH for IVF treatment. The records were assessed for each patient's demographic information, ovarian response and pregnancy rates, as well as age and AFC on the day of oocyte retrieval. The study was carried out in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki (1975).

We included all IVF cycles which utilized a COH regime consisting of pituitary down-regulation that was performed using the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist triptorelin (Decapeptyl, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Germany, 0.1 mg/1 ml). FSH was started on cycle day 3 with 75 IU/day of recombinant FSH (Gonal F, Serono S.A., Switzerland) and was administered per the long down protocol.[@b15-asm-1-40] Patients who had a basal body temperature (BBT) \>37°C were treated with a bolus dose of 35 IU of hCG (Ovidrel, Merck & Co., NJ, USA). AFC and blood sampling for measuring FSH were performed on the 3rd day of pituitary down-",1
"Question: Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients? Answer:  Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients?

Answer: A multi-country literature review shows that mortality trends in New Zealand do not differ between ethnic groups, despite lower socio-economic position being related to substantially poorer health.

Question: New Zealand Census has found that the proportion of indigenous people is increasing. Therefor, an ethnically diverse population is rapidly becoming a reality in New Zealand. Do you think it is a good/bad idea to have an ethnically diverse population? Why?

Answer: The increasing proportion of indigenous in New Zealand is a sign of success for the New Zealand government to improve living standards of indigenous New Zealanders, to integrate them into the New Zealand society, and to promote the country as a destination of choice for international migration.

Question: What are the barriers to international mobility in New Zealand? Which barriers will need to be addressed to attract more international students.

Answer: New Zealand has more than 1.4 million students and the total number of international students in New Zealand in 2015 was around 50,000. However, the numbers of international students are relatively small compared to the total number of population. The top three universities which ranked most attractive to incoming international students in 2015 in New Zealand are the universities of Auckland, Massey and Otago. Auckland is ranked first, followed by Massey and Otago. There are around 50,000 international students currently studying in New Zealand. However, in the next several years, the number of incoming international students in New Zealand is expected to rise from 50,000 at present to around 120,000 by 2025. This number of incoming students will continue to rise in the next decade. Many New Zealand universities welcome foreign students more than 10 times in comparison to the number of international students actually in New Zealand.

Question: We were wondering whether the average wages of New Zealanders with indigenous backgrounds and New Zealand born-citizens are the same to non-indigenous New Zealanders or if they are better?
You can find some statistics here

Answer: The median male earnings of Māori in New Zealand grew by 10.7 percent in the last decade, while other ethnic groups experienced a 3.3 percent fall. For women median earnings rose by 6 percent for everyone except for Pacific Islanders, who experienced a 6 percent fall. Median earnings of Māori women have doubled in the last 10 years.

Question: Why do some people think it's a good idea to have foreigners buy up New Zealand houses and pay them for land when we already have a shortage of housing in the country?

Answer: New Zealand has a shortage of housing because it takes decades for the country to grow to the point that there are housing for the masses. The shortage of housing is likely to persist until the country experiences economic growth, job growth, a population boom, etc. The cost of living is expected to rise in the coming decades.

Question: Do you think New Zealand is becoming more ethnically diverse?

Answer: In the past, it was possible to have ethnic homogeneity in countries. The ethnic profile of New Zealand is changing as it used to be possible to have a clear majority of one ethnic group from New Zealand. The ethnic profile of New Zealand is changing today because New Zealands is gradually becoming more multi-ethnic.

The New Zealand census in 2013 and subsequent census in 2017 has found that the proportion of indigenous in New Zealand is rising as shown in the following chart.

Question: Do you think New Zealand is becoming more ethnic-diverse? Does this make the country more or less ethnically homogeneous?

Answer: The ethnic diversity in the new decade is still at low levels compared to countries which were ethnically homogeneous in the past. In other words, New Zealand is only slightly more ethnically diverse than the ethnic profile of New Zealand in the earlier decades of the 20th century

Question: Do you think the proportion of Pacific Islanders is growing in New Zealand?

Answer: Pacific Islanders make up around 11 percent of the population currently and are a high-income group. Pacific Islanders are also one of the few ethnic groups that have a positive economic trend. This is why some New Zealand politicians encourage to make Pacific Islanders the majority ethnic group in New Zealand.

Question: Why do you think there has been such a large influx of refugees and asylum seekers in New Zealand in recent years?

Answer: New Zealand currently hosts 7,470 refugees, 6,690 asylum seekers and another 5,670 protected persons. According to the UN Refugee Agency, these numbers might be much higher than the total number. Refugees and asylum seekers are usually hosted at the two refugee settlement camps. However, one of the reasons that the number of refugees and asylum seekers is",1
"Question: Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement? Answer:  “Can normal knee kinematics be restored?”

Abstract

Normal knee kinematic function in the lower limb can only be restored successfully using a unicompartmental knee implant. A unicompartmental implant has no effect on load distribution between compartments and allows the patellofemoral and adjacent compartments to function dynamically as the intact knee. A unicompartmental implant restores the functional alignment of the components in a range of motion and cruciate ligament conditions. It has the greatest potential to restore the range of normal quadriceps femoris muscle activation. For this reason, the knee implant used, with unicompartmental design, is now being incorporated into new artificial knee development programs. It is, however, not suitable for severe osteoarthrosis.

Knee implant with unicompartmental design for restoring normal range of motion

Question: Does a normal knee ROM affect range of motion of the new implant? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: “Does a normal knee ROM affect range of motion of the new implant?”

Answer:

The joint range of motion is determined by the ligament balance, the geometry of the articular surfaces and the condition of the soft tissues that cover and stabilize the joint. A normal knee joint has a good ligament balance and normal articulation. When the ligaments are stable and the joint has a normal articulation, the joint range of motion is typically within the limits of 100–125° flexion to 0 or 5–25° extension. The patient will use this ROM while using the prosthesis

Question: Are there any negative effects on the muscle or soft tissue associated with surgical implantation, like an artificial knee joint? Write an abstract for a scientific paper about what happens if you have a knee replacement surgery.

Answer:

Following a total knee replacement, the quadriceps angle is almost invariably reduced below its initial value or even less when compared to the contralateral unaffected knee. The average reduction in quadriceps angle is 20‒22°. This should not be interpreted as a ‘quadriceps deficiency’; it should rather be regarded as a functional adaptation of the quadriceps mechanism (Fig. 3). An increase in quadriceps force of the same magnitude (or larger) than that of the non-operated knee would bring back the quadriceps angle to its original position. This is not achieved when the load imposed between the femoral condyles of the joint with the prosthesis is equal or less than that of",1

In your paper, ""Clinical Trials, Pro Bono Service"" [The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Journal
(2008, Vol. 14, no.6), pages 491,494], you state in an interview with Dr. Jonathan Koffler, that the ""Lymphoma Foundation of America has just begun a new trial with Dr. Jonathan Koffler."" Unfortunately, we haven't figured out which trial he is referring to, but there are
quite a few active trials with Koffler conducting patient-oriented research on lymphoma. Some trials include:

Leukemia & Blood Disorders, Koffler, Jonathan et al. - Koffler continues to conduct investigator-initiated clinical trials exploring new therapies such as the use of rituximab in the treatment of lymphoma, CLL of both mature B-cell and T-cell
lineage, and in NHL specifically those of CLL or NHL with overexpression of CD56. He is also an active clinical trial coordinator or principal investigator on a number of studies exploring the role of rituximab as a single agent in the treatment of NHL which explore, among other issues,
whether it is possible to predict and overcome lymphoma cell resistance to rituximab using sequential exposure of increasing dose levels of this drug. Rituximab may prove to be particularly efficacious in combination with the
CD20-targeted agents for treatment of both B- and T- cell NHL.

Blood and the Immune System, Koffler, Jonathan et al. - Clinical and laboratory studies of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the treatment of lymphoma are explored by Dr. Koffler and his colleagues. They propose that there may be a role for more

"Question: Is fetal gender associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy? Answer:  Is fetal gender associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy? The abstract you write should include the question, main results and implications. You might also need to provide a literature review if you haven’t studied this topic. Be specific and evidence-based—think bibliometrics, such as references and authors’ names.
You can’t get pregnant if an egg cell is not fertilized. If your fertility is challenged, your doctor may suggest using donor sperm, which can often be donated from a close relative. But since you don’t know the genes of the donor, your baby could have unexpected traits from both parents. If you choose to do this, make sure you ask the clinic if genetic problems can be detected in the babies of their donor or donor egg program.
To use donor sperm, most IVF clinics would use it from a donor sperm bank. If you're going to use your egg and sperm together, the egg and sperm need to be fertilized together to create a fetus. The sperm donor can be tested, so you won't have to worry about whether or not the donor can conceive or pass on a disease. Be aware that some fertility clinics charge for these services, while others include it.
This condition was first described in 1846 when the German doctor Rudolf Virchow reported the first case of ""molar gestation,"" a condition in which the fetus grows in an incompletely developed pattern of all three fetal parts, including the head, trunk, and limbs.[6] It is the most common cause of spontaneous abortion.[7] It occurs in 2% of pregnancies, though the incidence increases to a 6% rate in first-trimester spontaneous abortions.[7][8]
Although most sperm banks do provide the same basic services that are used for in-vitro fertilization, few if any provide donor insemination. Donor insemination is a much more popular and affordable method of family planning than using donor sperm to conceive, and is less expensive than traditional IVF techniques where eggs are fertilized in a lab.
To conceive naturally, your body produces the same hormones that normally develop a fetus in your uterus. Most IVF clinics will begin administering these hormones before ovulation occurs in order to create an optimal environment for fertilization to occur. This technique is called follicular maturation. There are a couple different types of maturation or egg maturation. Your doctor will discuss which of these are used for you.
Don’t bother ordering an Egg Crate® online. It’s a completely unrealistic and silly thing to order to help you get pregnant, considering you can’t order one until you’ve been on birth control for a minimum of 5 to 6 months. And there have been times with birth control pills I haven’t been on for 7 or 8 months. Trust me, there are much better ways to lose weight!
The majority of cases (68%) of ectopic pregnancies are discovered in the first trimester (10% in the second trimester and 50% in the third trimester (9, 16). Often they are identified by an ultrasound scan during the routine examination of the woman’s abdomen and pelvis at her first prenatal visit. Ectopic pregnancies are most commonly found in the fallopian tubes (52%), less frequently in the ovaries (31%), in the cervix (7%), and a few in the endometrium (6%), although there have been documented cases also in retroperitoneal lymph nodes, bowel, and appendix.
This should be done at your first prenatal visit. Blood work will be performed at your first prenatal visit. If levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 are normal, there’s no need for further testing. If levels are low, then the results of a pregnancy test should be checked. If you are pregnant, you or your doctor will determine if your gestational diabetes is controlled, and further testing will be needed.

To conceive spontaneously, your body produces the same hormones that normally develop a fetus in your uterus. Most IVF clinics will begin administering these hormones before ovulation occurs in order to create an optimal environment for fertilization to occur. This technique is called follicular maturation. There are a couple different types of maturation or egg maturation. Your doctor will discuss which of these are used for you.

You can get pregnant if you don’t ovulate every month. Your ovaries are usually working pretty hard during the month when you’re ovulating. If you don’t have much ovulation during your cycle, then you may not be able to get pregnant, even if you keep having periodic sex with your partner and you both use the proper methods of birth control.

"Question: Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation? Answer: 

Stretch-sensitive Kir4.1 potassium channel plays an important role in atrial cardiomyocyte electromechanics and arrhythmogenesis under diastolic loading. It is not clear if Kir4.1 expression can be modified by the environment and contribute to the observed changes in atrial arrhythmogenicity and arrhythmia burden in people with AF.
Question: How is it possible to change the expression level of Kir4.1 potassium channel?

A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation?

To understand the pathogenesis of atrial arrhythmias in humans with atrial fibrillation, we looked for stretch sensitive K(+) channels in an extensive literature survey. We found that stretch activates K(+) current in cell-model and heart of both animal and human studies. The role of stretch sensitive K(+) channels, namely Kir4.1, contributes significantly to atrial mechano-electric coupling in normal and diseased state. Kir4.1 channel expression may be modulated in humans under the influence of the environment and influence development and maintenance of AF.

Question: What are the strengths and limitations of this study; how much the patient data agrees with the hypothesis; what is the difference between clinical studies and laboratory studies; how do I choose research design?

Human genetic studies to identify genetic factors involved in development and progression of a disease. They are highly important in understanding pathophysiology of a disease. For example in diabetes, genetic factors can be detected which are contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease. These factors can be treated by giving medication or gene therapy. Human genetic studies are essential to understand risk factors of developing a disease.

Question: Why should I conduct a gene expression study rather than a gene polymorphism study?

To understand molecular mechanism of a disease, the gene expression study is essential. For example, in the study of hypertension, we can measure gene expression of the RAS system, natriuretic peptides, growth factors, nitric oxide synthase etc. We should try to make our own study to validate other studies.

If the study is designed and conducted properly, it becomes a source of new knowledge which might lead to development of drugs. The study conducted can be considered as an art, which can be improved by having knowledge about it.

Question: What are the most popular methodologies for a gene expression study?

Experimental evidence show that many diseases are a heterogeneous in their biology. A few of them are known to be associated with a number of genes. Many diseases may be associated with a very small set of genes and they may explain only a small fraction of disease. Therefore, the disease may be explained by the interaction of various genes.

For example, in a patient, certain gene may predispose to a disease, but in fact, it requires a number of genes to develop a disease. For example, in the development of pulmonary hypertension, genes, such as ANP and BNP, may not cause the disease on its own, but they can modify the risk of developing. The presence as well as increase of these genes further increase risk of developing.

Question: Could you expand on the first part of the answer? For example, I noticed in your first paragraph, that you say “The majority of gene products are under genetic control in humans.” Which would mean the vast majority of cellular properties and processes are genetic in scope. Which means this area of study would be one of the most active areas as far as research goes. Could you explain why?

Question: Do you have data about the impact of gender of a particular disease?

Yes. At the National University Hospital, we examined the impact of gender on the rate of AF recurrence among patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing rhythm control therapy. There are reports, suggesting that AF may have a different outcome based on the sex. Therefore we examined the recurrence rate after AF ablation by dividing subjects into 3 sex/gender subgroups: Female, Male-Gender and Male-Gender-Hormone. We found that recurrence rate after AF ablation was significantly higher in Male-Gender-Hormone than Male-Gender.

Question: Could you give some evidence that gender-biased drug response is the reason behind poorer outcome in Men-Gender-Hormone. How much the drug response is mediated by sex-hormones and how much it is mediated by other mechanisms? It will also be good if you could mention the mechanism of this difference in drug response between the males and the females.

Question: The next part of your answer addresses the difference between male and female population and how this can affect drug responsiveness. Do",1
"Question: Are adult body circumferences associated with height? Answer:  Are adult body circumferences associated with height?

This study examined the relationship between female adult male adult body circumferences and height. The subjects were African-American females ages 21-69 years old as well as the same number of adult males ages 21-69 years old. Body circumferences and heights of all subjects were measured. As expected, body circumferences of all subjects showed a strong positive correlation to each other. The r-value was 0.918 which is very significant when taking 95 % (0.000) confidence level. Height also showed a positive correlation; however the r-value was not of as high as 0.918 for the female subjects while it was high at 0.954 for the male subjects. The r-value is very significant when taking 95 % confidence level. These findings demonstrate the significance of body circumference and height in the prediction of body mass and body height for men and women respectively.

This study provides strong evidence in support of the following statements:
1. adult female body circumferences are related to height, r value =0.987, 95 % (0.000) confidence level.
2. adult male circumferences are related to height; however the result is stronger than for female circumferences, r-value=0.954.
These findings are indicative of the fact that the female population is taller in general compared to the male population. This is probably due to the fact that the female body is larger than the male body and more female bodies may lead to greater heights.

This research study will analyze the relationship between children birth length and the amount of time they spent breast feeding. It is an important relationship because the baby will get all the nutrients he or she needs, during the first year of life to develop a healthy body, which is an important ingredient in their brain development. In order to determine how long a baby is breast-fed, mother’s will use their arm length, and circumference of their forearm, along with their baby’s birth length and the number of years they spent breast feeding them.

This study will be a literature review and will review birth length and time spent breast feeding, the relationship between the two. This study will then go more in depth.

This research will use literature to support the following:
1. Length at birth and breast-feeding is a significant relationship
2. The length of time a baby is breast fed is not related to the mother’s arm length.

This study is going to analyze the current relationship between adult height and weight to infant and child birth length. The purpose of this study is to provide information to the public on how baby’s growth is related to adult height. Because infant and child height have close relationships with adult height, the public needs to know this relationship in order to avoid eating too much food or gaining too much weight and also not exercising too much so that they don’t develop a tall figure as they grow up. Therefore, the study will focus on two studies.

This study will analyze the relationship between adult weight and height to child and infant birth length. The study’s purpose is to provide information to the public on how the baby’s growth is related to adult height growth in the hopes of raising awareness in regards to eating in a healthy way, exercising and gaining strength and staying active throughout their life. There are two types of information that the study will address. The first is the relationship between infant, childhood, and adult height to adult weight. The second is the relationship between child and infant birth length and the amount of time a mother breast-feeds.

This research consists of several chapters. The first chapter includes the introduction and background information. The second includes two chapters relating to the topic of this research. Chapters 3 and 4 include chapters 4 and 5, respectively, regarding data analysis. In the first chapter, the relationship between infant birth length and adult height is related. The first chapter in this research is therefore composed of the following paragraphs: Chapter one: introduction;
Chapter 2: the first chapter; and Chapter 3: summary analysis. In chapter two, the relationship between child birth length and adult height is discussed in detail. Chapters 3 and 4 will discuss the summary analysis and data analysis, respectively. In Chapter 4, the relationship between baby’s height and body composition in children ages 2 and 6 is explained in a summary way. Chapter 4 continues in Chapter 5: data analysis where it focuses on the relationship between child and infant birth length and the amount of time a mother breast-feeds.

This study has two purposes: one is to increase the life span and increase mental well being of senior citizens; the second is to develop strong communities amongst seniors.

In order to support the first goal, we need to develop new ways for seniors to social",1
"Question: Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients? Answer:  Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients?

Answer:

The hypothesis is that the corrected QT interval or QT dispersion, measured at rest and during a head-up tilt test, will be associated with the presence and degree of left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. The study may lead to the development of new methods of recognizing the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with essential hypertension.

13. Discuss the generalizability of study outcomes.

14. Give the major findings of the study and the significance of differences or similarity between group mean values for baseline characteristics.

Answer:

This is a cross-sectional analysis of 993 consecutive asymptomatic participants referred for an invasive stress test for chest pain who had no heart disease as determined from coronary computed tomography angiography (QCT CAG) at baseline, and underwent QCT CAG at least 1 year after the baseline stress test. Our inclusion criteria excluded patients with heart disease as determined by QCT CAG, and included patients on stable medical therapy (as defined per the investigators). Our exclusion criteria included the following: patients were excluded if they did not meet the inclusion criteria of at least 1 year prior study enrolment; were unable to provide written informed consent; had a history of prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery or interventional coronary procedure. In addition to the above criteria, patients on new anti-hypertensive drug therapy were excluded, as well as patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, patients with unstable angina, and patients with arrhythmia. Baseline characteristics included the following: medical history; family history of CAD, hypertension, or diabetes; blood tests (including liver function tests, renal function tests, lipid panels, C-reactive protein, and cardiac markers (troponin I and T, BNP, and NT-proBNP)). Patient characteristics were reported by the treating doctor. At baseline, the age of the participants ranged from 20 to 87 years (mean, 51 years [standard deviation, 11 years], 63% women. One hundred and nine (10.8%) participants were diagnosed with hypertension. Patients with higher blood pressure readings on outpatient medication were more likely to have an abnormal stress test (P < 0.009). A total of 993 consecutive asymptomatic patients were referred for an invasive stress test for chest pain. Our inclusion criteria excluded patients with heart disease as determined from coronary computed tomography angiography (QCT CAG), and included patients on stable medical therapy (as defined per the investigators)-those unable to provide adequate informed consent or who did not meet",1
"Question: Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity? Answer:  Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity? The aim of this study was to determine if the anatomy of the aortic arch is a contributing factor in determining the severity of the trauma. A total of 50 patients with traumatic rupture of the ascending or descending aorta were retrospectively studied (22M/28F, average age: 38 ± 6 years old). The aorta was transected at its base into multiple segments according to the aortic arch anatomy. Aortic transection was determined and completed by measuring the distance between the end of the transection and the aortic adventitia from the transected end in millimeters. Traumatic aortic transection was associated with severe blunt abdominal trauma (average AIS: 35.6 ± 9.3/12). There was a predominance of blunt trauma to the neck or face. There was no significant difference in aortic transection among the tracheal, supra-aortic, and abdominal arch anatomy groups (1.0 ± 0.5, 0.9 ± 0.6, 1.2 ± 0.5, respectively, p = 0.53). However, there was a clear association between aortic transection and the number of rib fractures. There was no significant difference in the time interval between injury and surgery according to the location of the tracheal, supra-aortic, and abdominal arch anatomy (0.5 ± 0.7, 1.3 ± 1.2, 1.4 ± 1.4 days, respectively, p = 0.09). Despite the similar anatomy of the ascending aortic arch, there was a clear association between aortic transection and the number of rib fractures. Traumatic rupture of the aorta is more common in patients with multiple rib fractures.

Introduction {#s1}
============

Blunt aortic injuries (BAI) represent about 5% of all blunt abdominal injuries. These traumatic injuries are associated with high morbidity and mortality. They can be broadly classified into aortic and non aortic lesions.[@R1],[@R2] Traumatic lesions of the aorta are usually divided into four categories: (1) hematoma; (2) pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula; (3) transection (defined as transection of the whole thickness of the aorta); and (4) aortic wall disruption (defined as disruption of the integrity of the aortic wall and penetration of the vascular lumen by a foreign object). While in the past, most of traumatic BAI were secondary to penetrating injuries, nowadays traumatic BAI result from blunt trauma from traffic accidents or falls.[@R2]--[@R5] Injury to the aorta tends to be confined to the suprarenal segment of the aorta (type A) or the infrarenal (type B) or both segments, with or without an intra-thoracic component.[@R6],[@R7] Abdominal trauma that involves the descending thoracic aorta generally does not lead to visceral ischemia or require aortic repair.[@R3]--[@R5],[@R8]--[@R9] The majority of dissections begin and are confined to the ascending aorta.[@R7],[@R8] Injury to the descending aorta is more common, has a higher mortality rate,[@R10] and is characterized by involvement of more vessels.[@R5] The anatomy of the aortic arch presents an inherent risk of aortic transection.[@R11]--[@R14] Aortic injury is significantly associated with multiple injuries, associated organ injuries, and mortality rate[@R3]--[@R4],[@R14]--[@R15]. The majority of aortic injuries require surgery; in recent times, in addition, endovascular aortic repair has emerged as a less invasive treatment option.[@R4],[@R16]--[@R17] The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to evaluate the aortic transection, (2) to compare the anatomical anatomy of the aortic arch with the transected length, and (3) to examine whether the transection occurs at the thoracic arch, supra-aortic, or abdominal level and compare transection length according to these anatomical regions.

"Question: Inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients: is risk stratification useful? Answer:  Inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients: is risk stratification useful?

The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a systematic review of the current literature that compares inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic patients with fever. This article focuses on two Questions: Are there any benefits to be gained by inpatient management of neutropenic patients with fever? Is risk stratification for neutropenic fever of any use?

Neutropenia in the setting of cancer treatment is associated with increasing risk of infection by bacteria, fungi and viruses. The incidence of bacteremia associated with cancer chemotherapy is reported to be 0.2% to 3% ([@A14]). One study reports the overall infection rate in patients with solid tumors to be 12.9%, whereas in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies the median rate was 31.3% ([@A12]).

Prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of neutropenic fever in these patients. This treatment is often provided with inpatient and outpatient intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Although there is a strong evidence base supporting the use of outpatient IV antibiotics for selected febrile neutropenic patients, there is a growing evidence base supporting the use of inpatient IV antibiotics ([@A11]).

The risk for developing bacteremia is higher when febrile neutropenic patients are allowed to remain ambulatory for the remainder of chemotherapy than when they are managed conservatively ([@A1]). Furthermore, in a meta-analysis ([@A8]) comparing inpatient with outpatient therapy for febrile neutropenic cancer patients, in-hospital mortality was 0.5% and in-hospital mortality/neutropenic cancer-related deaths was 2.2%. In addition, patient outcome measures, such as length of hospitalization and subsequent infection-related morbidity and mortality, were better in the inpatient therapy group ([@A8]).

An inpatient approach may also reduce overall health care costs by reducing length of hospitalization (a direct cost). More importantly, by increasing the probability of an ongoing cure, inpatient therapy may reduce the potential to develop multiple hospital care costs, both within and outside the hospital-setting. Although an inpatient approach to neutropenic fever for the outpatient management of febrile neutropenic cancer patients is recommended in certain clinical situations ([@A5]), in many cancer treatment centers there are challenges associated with the transition from inpatient to outpatient therapy and vice versa. This transition can be problematic as patient care teams are not adequately prepared for this transition. This is particularly relevant where patients are cared for in multiple health care institutions. In addition, the transition from outpatient to inpatient management is particularly challenging where patients are medically complex, have multiple comorbidities and/or have recently undergone surgical procedures.

Therefore, in an effort to prevent inpatient-to-outpatient transitions in neutropenic cancer treatments from becoming routine, the transition process should be considered from the time of neutropenic fever recognition in the outpatient setting through the transition from inpatient to outpatient management and vice versa. The care transition process is challenging, and not all clinical issues are adequately addressed. Thus, there is a need to continue to review the process to be certain that it is not improving.

Question: What is the transition process between inpatient and outpatient management for neutropenic cancer patients? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the transition process between inpatient and outpatient management for neutropenic cancer patients?

Transition Processes
--------------------

A comprehensive transition process for neutropenic and febrile adult cancer patients transitioning between health care settings is critical for the inpatient-to-outpatient and inpatient-to-inpatient transitions to occur smoothly and without complications for patients, and for both health care institutions to receive an appropriate reimbursement from their respective insurance carriers.

The transition process usually includes identification of the need for hospital-to-home care, a process by which the patient is identified for transition ([@A5]), admission to an inpatient medical/surgical unit, recognition of the need for an inpatient admission, recognition of the need for outpatient follow-up after discharge, assessment of patient needs for transition to home care, and transition to home care ([@A10]; [@A11]).

In the management of febrile neutropenic cancer patients, there are several challenges that must be surmounted for appropriate transition from inpatient to outpatient management to occur. These challenges are associated with patient care teams and their readiness to transition and include patient adherence to prescribed therapy and/or the inability to transfer medical records. There are also concerns regarding patient,",1
"Question: Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer? Answer:  Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer?

The role of chest wall irradiation after breast cancer surgery remains controversial, and few randomized data are available. The debate is being fueled by three factors: the emergence of the sentinel nodule concept, which has led to wide adoption of breast-conserving therapy (BCT); the use and/or development of adjuvant endocrine therapy, which may limit locoregional and distant tumor spread; and the adoption of aggressive systemic therapy that improves both local and systemic cancer control. Studies have shown that some patients with negative axillary nodes (ie, ""negative"" nodes) after surgery are at high risk for locoregional recurrence, particularly if they have residual microscopic cancer. Thus, these patients may benefit from chest wall irradiation. In addition, some patients with locally advanced and/or node-positive cancer may need chest wall irradiation to help to control residual microscopic disease at the resected margins. Furthermore, several retrospective studies suggest that there may be a role for prophylactic chest wall irradiation after BCT and that this postoperative treatment may have a role in reducing the incidence of chest wall recurrence (CWR). Two randomized controlled trials of patients treated with BCT are in progress to answer the relevant questions.

A series of questions about the role of prophylactic chest wall irradiation in BCT and its role in the treatment arm of these trials can help determine who is a candidate for prophylactic chest wall irradiation.

QUESTIONS

What are the indications for prophylactic chest wall irradiation after breast-conserving therapy?(A) Who is at particular risk?

Who would best benefit from the reduction of CWR as the result of this treatment?

What are the treatment benefits of local control?

QUESTIONS

What are the indications for postmastectomy chest wall radiotherapy?

Who is at increased risk for locoregional recurrence regardless of nodal status?

QUESTIONS

(A) What are the risks associated with adjuvant chest wall irradiation?

(B) What are the risks associated with adjuvant irradiation to the supraclavicular area?

(C) Are contralateral breast tissues at risk for locoregional recurrence after adjuvant chest wall irradiation?

(D) Are breast tissues at risk for toxicity after adjuvant chest wall irradiation?

QUESTIONS

What is the effect of prophylactic regional treatment on systemic disease control?

Are there treatment-induced changes in the size or number of palpable nodes that may alter clinical decision making?

QUESTIONS

(A) Who is at risk for systemic disease recurrence whether or not chest wall irradiation is used?

(B) Whether treated with or without chest wall irradiation, will systemic disease relapse only affect the supraclavicular area?

(C) Is the reduction of the recurrence risk in the chest wall an indication for postmastectomy chest wall irradiation?

(D) Which radiotherapy fields are ideal in the setting of chest wall irradiation?

QUESTIONS

What is the effect of radiotherapy on the prevention of lymphedema?

QUESTIONS

What is the ideal treatment target for radiation delivery? Should it be the operative tumor bed or the entire surgical bed? Should any electively involved tissues in the chest wall receive a boost?

QUESTIONS

When treating postmastectomy patients with chest wall irradiation, what dose, technique of therapy, and fields are optimal?

QUESTIONS

Who is the best candidate?

The answers to these questions vary according to clinical practice and the available data, and they help determine the role of postoperative chest wall irradiation and provide an indication for treatment with this modality.

A series of questions help determine which patients may be candidates for prophylactic chest wall irradiation after BCT and its role in the treatment arm of these trials.

Should chest wall irradiation be included after BCT?

In its most conservative form, BCT is a procedure designed to remove breast cancer with the goal of reducing regional disease and improving cosmesis. It has been adopted by many physicians for a variety of reasons (Table 1):

In cases of very high-risk patients, the goal of breast conservation therapy is to achieve a cure with a minimum of surgical trauma and minimal toxicity. The advent of BCT technology allows local recurrence in as low as 2% at 5 yr in patients of all Stages and Histological types, particularly when breast-conserving surgery only is performed and no axillary treatment is necessary.",1

Question 2, part 1:

""Can a short course of high‐dose bisphosphonate treatment in children with high bone pain be done if they are at high risk for developing osteonecrosis of the jaw? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: ""What can be done when a child is exposed to high‐dose bisphosphonate treatment for a short time and the skeleton becomes extremely fragile?""

Question 2, part 2:

A 16‐mo‐old girl in a multisystemic failure receives bisphosphonate treatment and an infusion of a stem cell (bone marrow--derived) product. After 2 y of treatment, the bisphosphonate has been discontinued. She is now having a fracture at the distal end of the right ulna (R.J.L, 16 mo). The radiologist observes a fracture that, as far as he can tell, has no clinical significance.

Question: What is the probability that the fracture is a complication of the bisphosphonate treatment, an unrelated spontaneous fracture, or a complication of the stem cell treatment?

Question: Is there a clinical consequence from the fracture?

Question 1:

A 6‐y‐old girl presents at the clinic with persistent bone pain, bone tenderness, and intermittent abdominal pain and nausea for 2 wk. She is pale with anemia at the time of presentation. Abdominal imaging reveals that the child has diffuse mesenteric disease with thickening of the small bowel, most severely affecting the distal portion. She has a positive family history of a similar illness. A colonoscopy confirms the diagnosis of Crohn disease with multiple shallow ulcers involving 20% of the small intestine. Treatment with antibiotics and a trial of steroids for the abdominal pain has not been completely helpful. Stool studies are negative for pathogenic organisms. She has multiple dental caries. There is no history of trauma or trauma to the skeleton.

Question: What is the most likely diagnosis?

Question 2:

Are there clinical symptoms that should suggest that she is at risk for a spontaneous fracture or for developing osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)? If so, what precautions should be taken?

Question 3:

What tests should initially be considered, and in case of abnormalities, what further tests should be done? Which tests would you consider to diagnose ONJ?

Question 4:

At what age is an adequate response to corticosteroid therapy anticipated?

Question 5:

What therapy will be most helpful in treating this child? Should therapy involve a bisphosphonate? Intravenous bisphosphonates?

Question 6:

What tests can be done to estimate fracture risk at her age or in future?

Question 7:

Should she receive treatment for her osteoporosis?

Question 8:

What risks should be expected from the stem‐cell protocol to the child? Is the risk less than that of a spontaneous fracture?

Question 9:

What role, if any, will prophylaxis with bisphosphonate play? Should she receive a bisphosphonate once she is off steroids or not? For how long? If treated, should it be intramuscular or oral?

Question 10:

Should the patient receive prophylaxis for the period when she is receiving stem cells?

Question 11:

What will be the effect of the stem cells on the child's immune system? Will the stem cells increase her chances of developing opportunistic infections or other complications?

Osteoporotic fractures are a significant risk in children and are mainly of postmenopausal type, especially in adolescents. Recent data indicate a rapidly increasing incidence of ONJ in children, as well as other rare complications.[1](#jbmr2742-bib-0001){ref-type=""ref""} Spontaneous fracture seems to be more common than spontaneous onset of ONJ.

Question: General anesthesia as compared to a combination of epidural and local anesthesia for hip fracture surgery in geriatric patients: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs?

Abstract

Question: Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs?

Hip fractures in patients ≥ 75 years increase the risk of death and are associated with institutionalization. Anesthesiologists in the care of the elderly may be concerned that these patients are at increased risk for complications associated with general anesthesia alone. In the past, studies have demonstrated regional anesthesia to be preferred in these patients, however, regional methods have not been directly compared with general anesthesia alone in a randomized trial. The purpose of this study was to compare morbidity, mortality, and costs of general anesthesia versus a combination of epidural and local anesthesia in geriatric patients ≥ 75 years undergoing hip fractures. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial at a Level I Trauma center. Of the 464 prospective patients, 234 patients (117 male, 117 female) were consented for study and randomly assigned to either general anesthesia alone or the combined regional anesthesia method. Primary outcomes studied were inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay, length of intubation, pneumonia and non-cardiac pulmonary complications. These were evaluated at 24 hours, 30 days and six months for mortality. Secondary outcomes were time from admission to surgery and length of stay in the operating room. Total hospital length of stay, length of intubation, pneumonia and non-cardiac pulmonary complications were significantly associated with the use of general anesthesia in the study population (p < 0.05). Total hospital length of stay and intubation time showed a statistically significant difference favoring the epidural blockage group in the study overall. In addition, there were no differences in 30-day and six-month mortalities (p = NS). These results were not affected by the site of the fracture; the results did not differ in the subgroup of patients with intertrochanteric fractures. However, compared with patients randomized to general anesthesia alone, patients receiving the combined regional anesthesia method spent less time in the operating room and spent less time in the hospital and it may be concluded that in the high risk elderly population, combining regional anesthesia methods with general anesthesia may decrease inpatient morbidity and mortality.

Objective:

To determine the effects of a single dose of prophylactic intravenous lidocaine on outcomes of geriatric patients that undergo general anesthesia.

To perform a prospective, double-blind study to evaluate the effects of an intravenous lidocaine infusion in patients that received general anesthesia.

Patients:

Patients over the age of 65 that underwent general anesthesia for hip fractures. The study group received a single IV injection of 2 mcg/kg of Lidocaine whereas the control group received a normal saline solution.

Intervention:

A single IV infusion of 2 mcg/kg of lidocaine 30 minutes prior to the induction of spinal anesthesia.

Outcomes:

We evaluated the effects of lidocaine on outcomes at 24, 72, and 120 hours, including: (1) Postoperative pain, (2) Duration of anesthesia, (3) Duration of surgery, (4) Cardiac complications, (5) Intraoperative blood loss, (6) Opioid consumption, (7) Length of hospital stay and (8) The cost of admission.

Results:

The mean (sd) of Age was 81 (11), there were 62 female patients, and 30 patients had intraoperative intubation on admission to the hospital. Ninety-one patients were assigned to the treatment group and eighty patients were assigned to the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the two group in age, American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status, gender or preoperative intubation on admission to hospital. The results showed that there were no differences in pain on admission, time until spinal anesthesia, duration of surgery, opioid consumption, and length of hospital stay both in 24 and 72 hours. However the patients in treatment group had less mean blood loss (0.74 mL) compared to patients in control group (1.54 mL) (p = 0.01). Patients receiving",1
"Question: Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse? Answer:  ""Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse?""

An accompanying editorial suggested that blood pressure readings taken by nursing assistants may be inaccurate and should be discarded. This claim was presented as a scientific argument, so please provide a critical assessment of the claim and discuss the limitations to these ideas.

**Response from a scientist:**

The author of the letter responded to this comment with a long explanation of what constitutes a good scientific argument (a debate, not a discussion), and the scientific errors made in the initial editorial. The author argued that the editor was just trying to make a controversy out of nothing. We have provided a link to the editorial on our site.

However, it would be unethical for the editor to present such an argument, unless he could provide proof that blood pressure taken by a nurse is actually falsely low. We don't think he has the ability to do so (without actually testing a large number of patients), hence this kind of argument should be removed.

Question:

Does this paper really prove that blood pressure is actually lowered when checked by a nurse?

As the author has correctly identified, this experiment was conducted on a single group of patients in intensive care. Does it really prove that a nurse can't detect a blood pressure which is actually lower than that of a physician?

**Response from a scientist:**

According to the study it cannot be concluded that a nurse is unable to detect a lower blood pressure. It can in fact conclude that a nurse is able to detect a lower blood pressure.

We have provided a link to the study on our site.

### **Comments from a consumer:**

Question:

This paper contradicts basic medical science. No one knows how blood pressure is measured in any way that is accurate. There is NO proof that the blood pressure of a nurse or any other non-doctor is accurate. If you do any research about accurate blood pressure, you will find that it cannot be measured accurately by anyone, and is not ""standardized"".

**Response from a scientist:**

We have provided a link to the study on our site.

### General feedback:

Question:

We would like to express our appreciation for the editors and the many participants in the debate. All were civil and respectful. We encourage other scientists, doctors, and lay members of the public to join and participate in debates on our journal's website: www.neurology.org.

Introduction

Fetuses of an advanced gestation develop spinal cord lesions between the 14th cental and the 16th week of gestation. Those who are born may suffer from a combination of skeletal problems such as skeletal deformities of the chest and pelvis, and sensory and motor deficits. The prevalence of spina bifida varies in different places, ranging from under 1/1000 live births in some regions to over 1/800 live births in other places (Table 1). It is usually divided into three types:

Meningomyelocele : a congenital cerebrospinal neuromuscular disorder of the spinal cord and its arachnoid membranes, where a defect occurs in the spinal cord and a cyst protrudes through the covering of the spinal cord(1).

In developed countries the most commonly seen anomaly in congenital spinal lesions, which is usually due to postnatal trauma, is spina bifida, where a sac, or meningocele, forms because of incomplete closure of the neural tube. However, in low technology areas the most frequent cause of spinal cord lesion is birth trauma in the form of hypoxia and ischemia, such as in an unwell (‘s",1
"Question: Is the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy different for fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived following assisted reproductive techniques? Answer: 

Is the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy different for fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived following assisted reproductive techniques vs.

•

conception in the natural way?

Answer

Yes or no.

Explanation

Assisted reproductive techniques and natural conception do differ in some respects, but the overall risks of undergoing assisted reproductive techniques or a natural conception, even if the conception is achieved by fertilisation and implantation, is extremely low. Prenatal diagnosis of fetal anomalies following a natural pregnancy is similar to the likelihood in fetuses conceived following assisted reproductive techniques. Termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies is more common following natural pregnancies, but the numbers are low. Fetal anomalies in children conceived following assisted reproductive techniques are more common and have received less scrutiny than those occurring in children conceived naturally (Duffy and O'Leary, 2017). Termination of pregnancy is not available in the UK.

In all assisted reproductive techniques, the fetus is in the wombs of women and is not in the control of the woman. The women undergoing assisted reproductive techniques have multiple fetal anomalies. The risk of the woman being affected by any of the fetal anomalies, which might affect her future development and her fertility, is very low for the most part. If a woman conceived naturally does develop these conditions, it is unknown what impact they will have on her future development and fertility. In some women, complications can be serious and affect their future health and fertility.

What is assisted reproduction?

'Assisted reproduction' is a term used to refer to methods whereby a pregnancy is conceived, usually by using a combination of assisted fertilisation techniques and implantation. There are many options and assisted reproductive techniques. They all involve the manipulation of the natural functioning of the ovaries, the uterine lining, and the woman's fallopian tubes in order to create an environment that mimics the natural setting on the point of fertilisation. These methods have advanced and continue to be introduced but have never been shown to be unsafe or to change the nature of the developing fetus.

What is in vitro fertilisation?

In vitro fertilisation involves the fertilisation of eggs, collected from the woman and allowed to mature, in a petri dish containing a medium that mimics the normal body environment. This usually occurs within hours of the eggs being collected.

With in vitro fertilization, the woman's fallopian tubes are surgically removed. This stops eggs ovulating normally, so no eggs can collect in the fallopian tubes. The woman's body does not recognise that the eggs are still there, so the woman has no release of a monthly period, and no ovulating of the eggs that remain in the system.

Some women would like to have children within certain age brackets, meaning they won't produce eggs any more. They then undergo surgery to have their ovaries and some of the follicles inside surgically removed.

When this surgery has occurred, eggs that have not yet matured are fertilised in a petri dish containing a mixture of sperm, donated from a man, and a liquid growth medium that supports the sperm and eggs to mature, allowing them to combine and produce embryos. These immature embryos are allowed to develop inside the woman over several weeks until they are ready to be frozen. If all goes well, the woman should be able to give birth to a healthy child.

Why would I want to have a child by in vitro fertilization or donor egg?

There are several reasons for using in vitro fertilisation and donor eggs. The first reason why women would want a child by this method is that, in order to have a child using in vitro fertilisation, the woman will have to travel to a clinic to take part in the procedure. This is generally not a problem for some women, but others might find this difficult to do. It also depends on the size of organisation or clinic that the woman will be able to travel to. It will also depend of the location of the clinic, as some areas might be more or less remote or expensive to travel to. Many of these clinics that offer this method of conception are located in major cities in the United Kingdom.

If the woman is unable to conceive naturally, for whatever reason, a cycle of in vitro fertilisation with donor eggs is a reasonable option to have the benefit of a donor egg for use in a natural cycle.

When are donor eggs used?

Normally used in cases where there is a low chance of the woman being able to contribute to a pregnancy. There are several tests that can be performed to see if the woman can contribute to the pregnancy even prior to the donation process. These can be done by a doctor trained to conduct them.

If the results of the tests indicate that the woman might be a low contribut",1
"Question: Is there a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation? Answer:  Is there a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation?

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice. AF frequently develops after cardiac surgery (congenital and acquired heart disease, valvular disease) and is associated with worse outcome and higher mortality.[1, 2] Recent studies have shown that AF is a common and potentially lethal complication after cardiac surgery and that early postoperative AF is related to increased mortality.[3, 4]

AF recurs often after successful ablation of AF.[5, 6]

Because of the relatively high recurrence rate for AF, ablation has been introduced into clinical practice. However, in the long term, there is no convincing evidence that AF is cured by AF ablation.[6] Since AF can recur after initial successful AF ablation, and the underlying substrate of AF may be fibrotic and/or anatomically distorted. AF remains a poorly understood disease.[1, 2, 4]

During AF, myocardial electrical activation is variable and irregular due to abnormal and heterogeneous conduction. As a result, the atrial activation sequence is discontinuous, and a complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) is characteristic (Fig 1) (Fig. 1).[7, 8]

The goal of this study was to investigate whether fractionating atrial electrograms in AF reflect fibrotic and anatomically changed areas with inhomogeneous conduction and whether areas with high fractionation reflect regions with the greatest electrophysiological abnormalities. If so, we expect that the areas with high fractionation are related with the fibrosis and anatomic changes in the substrate of AF.

Methods:

A) Subjects and definitions and b) Study design and data analysis

Seventy-five consecutive patients (pts) underwent left pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and linear ablation for symptomatic AF (pts without ischemic heart disease) were included in the analysis. Age, gender and procedural risk were similar between pts with and without complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE).

Arrays of 3 to 4 electrodes (intra-atrial electrodes) and a 20-pole Lasso catheter (intracardiac bipolar electrodes) were placed in the left and right atrial chambers during atrial fibrillation (AF) to form an atrial activation map (Figs.1-6).

B) The atrial map was visualized and activated to map AF (Fig. 1-6).

Definition of complex fractionated atrial electrogram

The definition of CFAE was as follows: (1) an atrial electrogram with fragmented, fractionated components, and (2) the fractionation rate should be more than 10ms.[9] The fractionation rate is the difference between the peak and the valley, the frequency between the peak and valley, or the slope, as shown in Fig. 5.[9, 10] The area of CFAE occupied at least 60% of the entire atrial activation area. A single fractionating electrogram was defined as a single location whose fractionation rate was the highest of the entire atrial activation area.

Sinus rhythm fractionation

The definition of sinus rhythm fractionation was an electrogram with two consecutive peaks (more than 10ms) in an isolated atrial cycle time.[9]

Arterial hypertension

Arterial hypertension was defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90mmHg.[11]

C) Recording and analysis of CFAE

We selected patients in whom AF could be terminated within one week with atrial tachycardia on antiarrhythmic drug therapy. We recorded and analyzed atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with a minimum duration of three months.

We divided all patients in five groups according to the proportion of the atrial activation area occupied by the CFAE and patients without CFAE (CFAE0): “0” less than 7% (Fig. 3).

“5” greater than 96% (Fig. 4a)

In patients with CFAE0 less than 50%, AF and sinus rhythm (SR) were recorded simultaneously (Fig. 6).

For analyzing the conduction gap between the right and left PVs, we measured the width of the conduction gap. The conduction gap was defined as the distance between the beginning of the atrial electrogram in the right PV(RV) and end of the atrial electrogram in the",1
"Question: Does rural or urban residence make a difference to neonatal outcome in premature birth? Answer:  Does rural or urban residence make a difference to neonatal outcome of premature babies in Tanzania.

Answer:

This study aimed to assess the relationship between area of residence (urban or rural) and neonatal mortality. The study population consisted of all live born singleton babies delivered between 37 and 56 weeks of gestational age which were recorded in nine public hospitals in Tanzania. A total of 684 babies were studied. Infant outcomes were recorded at birth as well as in hospital and included newborn and early neonatal deaths. The prevalence of early newborn mortality was 20.9 and neonatal mortality was 42.1 at 10 days of life. The risk of death for rural babies in hospitals was 30.1 times higher than for urban babies.

Q.13) Briefly explain what you think this study would mean for our understanding of what factors affect neonatal outcome in Tanzania. Give examples of these factors.

1. I believe that this study will add an information about the situation in Tanzania with regard to neonatal health care. It will be an additional information, as data is very rare. This study will provide information on the status of neonatal health care in Kilimanjaro region, as this place has only one hospital that provide services by neonatal care. (Question: Do you feel that the way the study was conducted limits the ability to draw conclusions? Write a response, including justifications and examples. Please use specific language, even if using abbreviations is allowed.)

Response 2: I think that this study will be very helpful for the study the next one, as the situation in Tanzania has changed a lot. This study will help to fill the blank space and help to understand the status of neonatal health care system in Tanzania (at least Kilimanjaro) with all the information obtained during one year of a study, which will be very useful to conduct studies.

"Question: Is the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis a good and reliable alternative? Answer:  Is the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis a good and reliable alternative? To respond to this question, the experimental animal models should be investigated that is the best way to solve this issue. Answer: The method of intestinal anastomosis is one of the most difficult and time-consuming procedures in a surgical field. This technique is one of the major cause of high mortality in operations performed in gastrointestinal tract since it requires a delicate balance between perfect coaptation and tension on the suture line, as well as a complete intestinal integrity. Therefore, it is logical to use different methods and materials to perform the intestinal anastomosis. The recent studies have demonstrated that intestinal anastomosis technique using cyanoacrylate adhesive has been introduced as an alternative surgical technique with less complications and better outcome compared with conventional anastomosis. Therefore, this technique can be considered as a new method of intestinal anastomosis. However, this new technique is not completely safe without well-designed experimental studies to obtain a better understanding. So, we suggest that in future studies, it is recommended to make a comparison between these new methods and routine intestinal anastomosis in experimental animal models.

Introduction {#sec1-1}
============

Anastomosis is the process through which two ends of different tissues are surgically joined to the form a conduit with integrity.\[[@ref1]\] This process of surgical joining is vital to ensure the adequate blood flow and nutrition among the tissues that were joined to each other. Anastomosis is one of the most significant operations for treatment of various human diseases that are caused by the failure of tissue separation, such as aortic, vascular, and gastrointestinal anastomosis. It is a critical step during the surgical intervention that is applied in cases of different diseases such as esophageal surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, vascular surgery, and plastic surgery.\[[@ref2]\] Due to its importance, many studies have been carried out to improve the outcomes of surgical repair of these types of disease. However, many problems have emerged that result in a higher death rate in operations related to anastomosis as compared with other steps. In anastomosis, coaptation and the tension applied to the tissue are of primary importance. This process is required to have an appropriate tension and close attachment of two tissues as well as no leakage from the joined area that causes infection.\[[@ref2]\]

In recent years, intestinal anastomosis has been performed using different methods with appropriate materials and surgical techniques, to improve success of the operation, decrease the anastomotic complication rate, and shorten the duration of surgical procedures.\[[@ref2][@ref3][@ref4]\] Some studies have reported that the routine intestinal anastomosis is a critical step related to the occurrence of many operative complications such as fistula, strictures, and reoperations, as well as increased mortality.\[[@ref3][@ref5]\] Despite the advantages of routine intestinal anastomosis, recent studies have revealed that performing this technique using a mechanical suture with the increased use of different staplers have led to improvement in the mortality and complication rate.\[[@ref3][@ref5][@ref6]\] However, it is worth mentioning that the high cost of staplers, especially in some developing and developed counties, is still a problem which reduces their use in patients.\[[@ref3][@ref6]\] As a consequence, the number of patients who undergo intestinal anastomosis by the conventional surgery has decreased.\[[@ref6][@ref7]\]

In comparison with other methods, the technique of using cyanoacrylate for intestinal anastomosis has recently begun to gain the attention of researchers and surgeons.\[[@ref8]\] Although the literature reviews indicate that this new surgical technique is a good option, it is necessary for more clinical studies to validate this method for its application in clinical practice.\[[@ref8]\] This surgical technique is a common and well-known one which has been used for many years in surgical interventions since it is one of the few methods for joining tissues that produce a perfect seal, regardless of any tissue and blood flow to the area that has been sealed. However, there is still a dispute among researchers with regard to the application of this method for suturing in clinical trials and reports about its efficacy and complications in anastomosis of the gastrointestinal are very limited.\[[@ref9][@ref10][@ref11]\] Although the findings of the few studies have shown that this technique has limited effects",1
"Question: Is trabecular bone related to primary stability of miniscrews? Answer:  Is trabecular bone related to primary stability of miniscrews?

Answer: We have evaluated the effect of age and gender on changes in bone morphology and density (BMD) using bone mineral density (BMD) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Twenty-eight pre-pubertal and 19 post-menopausal participants were assessed. BMD and bone morphometric measurements were also undertaken. The mean BMD in both the pre-pubertal and post-menopausal groups were not significantly different. The mean bone morphometric indices were not significantly different between the pre-pubertal and post-menopausal groups. We suggest that the morphology and mineral density of trabecular and inter-trabecular bone in the inferior alveolar nerve canal of maxillofacial region is similar irrespective of age or gender. It was further suggested that the use of miniscrews in this location is safe in both the pre-pubertal and post-menopausal patients.

Question: Is there evidence to show that, for miniscrews, primary stability is more important than the amount of load-bearing?

Answer: Miniscrews are widely used in orthodontics. There are over 10 different lengths of these devices, with the majority of clinicians using miniscrews at the mid-diastemal level in the alveolar bone. This is commonly found in the labial or buccal aspect of the teeth adjacent to the mid-diastemal areas of molars and the incisors in young adults. Miniscrews are fixed using a variety of methods at this level, namely, as a platform for orthodontic appliances, as a space maintainer for orthodontic and orthognathic surgery, and for skeletal anchorage. When inserted using orthodontic methods, these devices are placed at the level of alveolar bone, often providing the anchor for a bracket. These appliances are inserted blindly. It is postulated that the force generated on the bone during the insertion procedure results in compression, causing changes in the trabecular patterns, leading to alterations in the micro-mechanics of the bone. The purpose of this question is to attempt to answer the age-old question of whether primary stability is an important factor for successful anchorage. A literature review was performed, which found that there is no definitive answer. There is evidence that orthodontic miniscrews inserted in the interradicular spaces of the mandibular molars in patients during their early twenties could provide excellent results even without initial activation of the osteons. This finding suggests that the development of the bone is more important than its stability \[11\]. However, this would be a theoretical finding, as no experimental setup is available. A study conducted by Lin et al found that the distance between teeth and alveolar ridge was the main cause of miniscrew malposition that could occur during orthodontic treatment \[22\]. There was no reference to primary stability in their article.

Question: What type of bone quality is there, and is this related to the potential failure of orthodontic miniscrews?

Answer: The density of the human maxillofacial bones, although not identical, can be reasonably compared. A study by Kavanagh et al found that the density of anterior mandible is significantly higher than posterior mandible, anterior ramus is higher than condyle, and condyle density is higher than the posterior ramus. Hence, the potential weakness of a particular bone can be predicted from the density \[30\]. The study found that trabecular density of ramus decreased with age. The bortical density was not significantly different between the pre-pubertal and post-menopausal groups. This, coupled with the fact that the bony walls of the maxillary sinus were not thickened, is suggestive of lack of weakening of these walls to these forces. The maxillary sinus is prone to fractures secondary to trauma due to the thin bone wall and the effects of periosteum and muscles. These are not strong enough to resist trauma when the maxillary sinus is fractured. Therefore, the walls of the maxillary sinus are not as strong as the bony walls of other bones. The failure of an orthodontic miniscrew, as noted in the studies, is usually due to one of three reasons: excessive insertion torque during insertion, poor insertion angle, and excessive screw length \[28\]. These factors alone do not determine the failure. A combination of all factors could cause failure. In patients with advanced resorption, orthodontic miniscrews are more frequently pulled out over an extended period of time. The res",1
"Question: Is there any evidence of a ""July effect"" in patients undergoing major cancer surgery? Answer:  Is there any evidence of a ""July effect"" in patients undergoing major cancer surgery?

Background: For years there has been a popular belief that major surgery in the month of July can have a negative effect on the patient's outcome. During the summer months, it is thought, there are greater numbers of cancer cases than at other times of the year. The number of operations performed for cancer may be large, but the number of postoperative complications following the surgery may increase by about 30%.

Objective: The objective of this review is to critically appraise evidence on whether there is any evidence of a ""July effect"" in major cancer surgery.

Methods: A systematic review was conducted for the objective by use of a predefined protocol, according to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews (version 5.1.0). Medline and CINHAL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Health Literature), published between 1960 and November 2009 were searched. In addition, we made reference to the results of literature searches on PubMed, Cochrane reviews and hand searching of references of Cochrane reviews. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, case-studies, studies in which control groups were not used and studies in which patients were divided equally into three or more intervention groups were included, and, for each publication, for which the research question could be answered, were identified and included in the review. After an introductory phase, data were extracted and assessed for risk of bias (RoB). As this review is based on narrative synthesis and on RoB assessments, this does not form a formal meta-analysis.

Key results: Only five of the articles (all based on data from one study) provided data on cancer surgery-specific outcomes. For acute cardiac surgery the results of a single study were not sufficient to conclude if there was a positive, negative or neutral July effect. The results of an additional study in which all of the patients had undergone cardiac surgery suggested that there may be a positive July effect in cardiac surgery. For lung resection the results of the study in which all of the patients had lung cancer suggest that there may be a negative July effect. The results of the study in which all of the patients had advanced colorectal cancer were not sufficient to draw conclusions.

Authors' conclusions: In acute major surgery a higher incidence of postoperative complications and deaths than in any other time of the year were found.

As the results of different studies are not comparable, due to the lack of evidence of an effect between different populations, and due to the heterogeneity of the outcome studies, the evidence from this review does not provide any basis on which to draw conclusions in cancer surgery.

Background: There have been numerous reports regarding the possible impact of the time of the year on morbidity and mortality from various types of surgery during the last 60 years. One widely held belief is that in July there is an increase in the number of surgery performed and thus there is an increase in the operative mortality, incidence peri-operative complications and readmissions. This may result in a worse outcome in July.

Objective: To evaluate if the time of the surgery performed has any impact on postoperative morbidity, mortality or readmission, and if there is some time of the year when postoperative mortality or morbidity is at a higher or lower rate.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library, and screened the reference lists of relevant articles by using the following key terms. Searches were limited to papers published in any language between 1960 and the present. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, case-studies, studies in which control groups were not used, and studies in which patients were divided equally into 3 or more intervention groups were included and assessed for RoB. This resulted in 25 RCTs, 1 quasi-experimental study, 3 cohort studies, 4 case-studies and 3 studies with only subpopulations in their analysis contributing to the overall results. As this review is based on narrative synthesis and on the RoB assessment, the meta-analysis was not conducted formally.

Key results: In a subgroup analysis of RCTs, there was no significant difference in mortality between patients undergoing a surgery performed at any given time in the year and a surgery performed during any other time of the year. Morbidity was significantly higher in the intervention vs control groups only when the surgery was performed in the summer months. The risk of postoperative pneumonia was significantly increased in the intervention group when surgery was performed during the summer months, whereas the time in the operating room did not seem to have an effect on the risk of cardiac complications or respiratory complications.

"Question: Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis? Answer:  Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis?
==============================================================

Answer: Choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis (CIC) is defined as acute cholangitis following endoscopic treatment of the common bile duct (CBD) by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The management of CIC is determined by the presence of choledocholithiasis, pancreatobiliary inflammation, or intrahepatic bile duct pathology. Endoscopic drainage and removal of calculi are indicated, either directly or via intrahepatic stenting, in patients with CIC with lithiasis; whereas, endoscopic treatment is appropriate in patients without lithiasis alone or with extrahepatic biliary pathology. In particular, patients with CBD stones and/or common hepatic and/or cystic duct stones are best treated by endoscopic sphincterotomies followed by stone extraction by endoscopic retrograde stone removal, rather than by biliary sphincterotomy alone. In contrast, patients without CBD stones or with only intrahepatic bile duct stones or inflammation alone that do not require dilatation are best treated by conservative therapeutic modalities.

In patients with CIC accompanied by intrahepatic bile duct stones or cholangitis, the presence of large, mobile CBD stones usually implies dilatation of the CBD by ERCP. Although biliary sphincterotomy alone is considered safe and effective in the management of these patients, placement of a nasobiliary drainage (NBD) tube at the end of endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy for CBD drainage has been suggested as a standard practice due to the possibility of CBD leaks associated with biliary sphincterotomy alone. The rate of CBD leaks after ERCP varies from 2.4 % to 25 %, with approximately 30 % of these occurring within the first 24 hours after ERCP. Post-ERCP bile leaks are most commonly (80 %) treated successfully without any intervention. However, in the remaining, 10 % -- 20 % of the cases, intervention is required ([@R1]-- [@R5]). In particular, in patients with large, mobile CBD stones and cholangitis, the requirement for drainage following CBD drainage for removal of large stones by endoscopic sphincterotomy, and the use of an NBD tube, varies significantly in the literature.

To identify the rate of CBD leaks and the optimal management associated with NBD drainage, the authors have reviewed studies from the English-language literature in the past 5 years (January 2010 to June 2015) that contained a sufficient data set on all identified CBD leaks in the published reports (Table [1](#T1){ref-type=""table""}).

###### 

Prevalence of CBD leaks after ERCP in reported studies (2010--2015)\*

![](ejgh-33-e232-g001)

The mean number of patients in these studies was 508 (range 100 -- 1290), and the overall CBD-leak rate was 5.1 % (range 1.2 -- 16.1). The overall rate of NBD drainage after endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction showed a variation, and that was associated with the presence or absence of CBD leaks in these studies. In the studies containing a sufficient data set to determine the rate of CBD leak after ERCP, a total of 9 studies (containing 10 157 patients) met the study inclusion criteria ([@R1]-- [@R9]). The pooled rate of NBD drainage after endoscopic sphincterotomy was 17.26 % (5 -- 50 %) in studies with CBD leak (eight studies, *n* = 4748) and 13.33 % (4 -- 32 %) in studies without (two studies, *n* = 4730). Considering that the median drainage time was 12 hours in all 10 157 patients who underwent ERCP, the rate of NBD drainage after endoscopic drainage was 0.3 % (0 -- 1.9 %) in studies with CBD leak and 0.2 % (0 -- 0.9 %) in studies without",1
"Question: Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain? Answer:  Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain?

Answer: Community Based Vaccination

Objective

1: Community health workers, for example health volunteers (HV) and community health agents (CHA) have a great potential for delivering vaccination services. HVs and CHAs have gained much traction in sub-Saharan Africa because they can be trained quickly to deliver vaccines. These vaccines can provide direct service to the communities, and in countries where cold chain storage of vaccines is weak, vaccines administered to HVs and CHAs may be more durable (e.g. long shelf life at room temperature). In addition, CHVs and CHAs are familiar with the community they are targeting, which may allow for more effective communication about vaccination requirements.

The objective of this project was to explore the potential of community workers, such as CHVs and CHAs, as vaccinators, as this is a new concept for both CHWs and vaccination programmes. CHVs and CHAs have the advantage not only in that they know the community and may know local leaders, etc., but they also know community preferences and may have more understanding than regular vaccination staff when it comes to how to provide incentives for vaccination.

Project description

The study involved a total of 6 CHVs and 2 CHAs, all belonging to the same association of social workers of the community, the PEP (Plateforme de Sida Paysan et de Promotion Sociale), and the EPI (Equipement Pediatrique Ingénieur), all from Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire. They were trained together over 4 days by the vaccination team to learn how to administer vaccines. From the training, it was agreed for the CHWs, to become community vaccinators for children (10 weeks) and pregnant women (6 weeks) during the 2014/15 calendar year. Training also included the practical aspects of how to administer the vaccines, such as storage of vaccines, equipment needed, etc.

Findings

During the training period of 4 days, the CHWs and CHAs were given a 1-day refresher course on administering the vaccines. At that point we had four CHVs and one CHA in the field, with approximately 300 persons covered the week after the training, which gradually decreased gradually to cover about 250 persons weekly from week 2 to week 38. The 4 people chosen initially from the association were not always always the same, so we had three trained CHVs, one of them left very early, one CHA and one CHV. Of these 3 CHVs, the CHV trained first had some difficulties with the injections and left the community at the end of the 4 days of training. The second CHV, trained second, was excellent and never left. The last CHA had some difficulties with the injections, but improved rapidly after the second day of training. With the 4 CHVs, it was agreed that we would have at least one CHV and one CHA present at the community from 2 weeks in the field and the rest would leave eventually. Initially, there were a few days when one person left for some reason or another, so we would get as close as possible 2 CHVs and 1 CHA then from week 4 to week 9, there were times when none of the 3 people were at the community for a given week, so that we had to cover by telephone for those people that weren’t present, and so we would see a decrease in coverage from week 4 to week 9. When one person left the community, they were offered the position as CHV or CHA for the following week.

We also discovered that the community had about 5 days in the month that were out of commission for vaccination so it was not always possible to bring vaccines to the community on these days, so for these, we would use a telephone appointment instead and ask them what days they were at home on a different day. This also served as a reminder for the person to come the next day.

Figure 2: Vaccination coverage after initial vaccination

We also needed more health cards (H1 or H2) for each child as they would always find a way to say they wanted a H1 or H2 but had only brought a vaccination card (J). Some parents brought 1 vaccination card and 2 H1 or H2 cards. It was important to verify the 2 H1 or 2 H2 cards with the vaccination card as they would give out the J cards only after these were verified. We also discovered during our visits to the health centre that they asked for the H1 card when vaccination for the month is done every 4 weeks so we had to bring in all the cards at the same time and verify them, sometimes, this meant that we had to send in more information than was needed for these people, but it",1
"Question: Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy? Answer:  Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy? *Answer: No*

Abstract and Conclusion {#s1a}
========================

Patient {#s1b}
-------

A 51-year-old-woman who presented to the Breast Care Centre at Royal North Shore Hospital complaining of an expanding, painless breast lump. The breast had been first diagnosed 21 years earlier and had since been treated with three consecutive lumpectomies. Recently the patient had noticed a rapid increase in the breast\'s size. On physical examination, she had a well-circumscribed, non-tender, mobile mass that was 8 cm in greatest diameter and extending 5 cm beyond the nipple. The rest of the breast examination was unremarkable. Her surgical history included two caesarean sections and a hysterectomy. The patient had no prior medical illness and had a normal family history. She had not smoked and did not consume alcohol. She was taking hormone replacement therapy.

Diagnostic assessment {#s1c}
---------------------

Ultrasound examination was performed to evaluate the patient\'s breast mass. Ultrasonography showed a hyperechoic, well-circumscribed, heterogeneous mass involving the upper third of the breast. US-guided biopsy of the mass revealed a moderately atypical ductal hyperplasia. Mammography of the right breast in 2009 showed no suspicious areas but a persistent radiological abnormality had prompted a referral to our unit for further assessment.

Mammography in 2009 confirmed the non-malignant US findings. The lesion was circumscribed. There was a central dense area of opacity, and there was associated focal peripheral stellate-shaped radiolucencies ([Figure 1](#pgrb-76-1142-g001){ref-type=""fig""}).

![Mammogram 2009; non-mammographic (CC-beam) and mammographic (LM-beam) views showing a circumscribed, circumscribed mass with associated features.](pgrb-76-1142-g001){#pgrb-76-1142-g001}

Surgery {#s1d}
-------

Aspiration cytology of the breast mass was reported as revealing only blood. Biopsies of the breast wall were performed at six locations. Bilateral axillary nodal ultrasound was performed. The right axillary node was clinically positive, with a maximum nodal length of 26 mm, and the left node was clinically negative with a maximum nodal length of 19 mm. In conjunction with the negative axillary sentinel node biopsy (SNB) from the right breast, a bilateral SNB was considered. An ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy was performed as the final axillary procedure. SNOs identified on a blue dye map were located at the second-to-third and third-to-fourth intercostal spaces on both sides. Of the seven SOns removed, seven were determined to be positive for the presence of metastatic tumour ([Figure 2](#pgrb-76-1142-g002){ref-type=""fig""}).

![SNO; images at the second-to-third and third-to-fourth intercostal spaces, showing the presence of metastatic tumour.](pgrb-76-1142-g002){#pgrb-76-1142-g002}

Pathology {#s1e}
---------

Histology confirmed the initial biopsy reporting of an abnormal ductal proliferation. The tumour was moderately atypical with nuclear pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, and high mitotic figures.

Tumour markers {#s1f}
--------------

The following laboratory reports were obtained before the patient proceeded to the procedure that would change the prognosis for her: CA 15-3, CEA, CA-125, CA-19-9, CA-15-4, CA 72-4, CA 50, Cys-c, HER2, sIL-2R, CYFRA 21-1, MIF, hCG, AFP, and CA50. (All except Cys-c were negative). A retrospective review of these reports revealed the following results: for CA 15-3 the most recent value was less than 3.6 ng/ml, sIL-2R was 544 U/ml, CA-50 was 6.4 ng/ml and CA-19-9 was 8.9 ng/ml.

"Question: Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further? Answer:  Could they be symptoms of Moya Moya?

Dr. J.W.Buckmaster, Professor of Neurology, University College London

Moya Moya is an unusual but treatable condition that can lead to very severe convulsions and progressive brain damage. The diagnosis is important and it is necessary to be extremely careful when deciding how to treat patients with this condition. We need more information as, at the moment, we are all rather clueless as to how best to proceed. The condition is caused by an abnormal form of collagen in the blood vessels and can be prevented, to a large extent, by controlling blood pressure, especially when it falls below 80mmHg or if there is evidence of renal artery stenosis. The disease is always present from birth but, fortunately, most people live for many years without any problems arising from it. Patients have a very high risk of developing severe convulsions as soon as puberty arrives although it can take several years for the first attacks to occur. Some cases never really get to grips with the disease and it has been suggested that an aggressive therapy should be instituted as soon as these first symptoms appear. However, in most patients, the condition is mild enough to be medically managed with little long-term damage. It is clear that all affected children should have good neurological care and that the sooner this is available, the better outcome will be for them. Fortunately, there are now excellent neuro-paediatric facilities and it seems to me that every case should have a full neurological assessment as soon as possible. Such an early diagnosis will, of course, have the greatest effect on the treatment given in the future. Retinal haemorrhage can be a late complication of Moya Moya and such haemorrhages can occur as a result of trauma, drugs or infection. They can also be asymptomatic, the patient being unaware that an episode has occurred. Occasionally a haemorrhage may be noticed and this would be important to confirm the diagnosis but, as far as I know, its presence is not, in itself, a definite marker of the Moya Moya condition.

Question: Can a patient with brain abscess be misdiagnosed for a long time?

Dr. Suresh G.K.N.Prasad, M.D.

Answer: A brain abscess can result in neurological sequelae that would make a diagnosis of Moya Moya seem most appropriate. There is an excellent chance, if the patient is treated properly, that this severe disease can be cured in a short time. In a few cases, it might be the best to do nothing and allow the abscess to destroy the brain so that there is no longer any chance of any future clinical symptoms. It cannot be stressed enough that the treatment of a brain abscess can be life saving, depending on very difficult decisions about the choice of antibiotics and the need for surgery. In my opinion, the case should have been reported to a neuro-oncologist and it was fortunate that this case was not lost just because there might have been some delay in getting treatment for this unusual condition.

Question: There has been an allegation by the Ministry of Health that the Ministry of Health and Social Development (MHSD) has not allocated enough funds to Moya Moya. Why is this happening?

Dr. Fafinee Wawai, Professor of Public Health

Answer: This seems to start with a situation in which the MHSD received no response to a request for additional funds and funds were, it developed, allocated by ""a process of negotiation and consent"". This was agreed as part of the budget and any changes to this budget would then, presumably, be made by agreement with the responsible Minister. Under these circumstances, the decision of the MHSD to release more funds was dependent, in effect, on the consent of the Minister. Obviously, if the Minister was unwilling to provide further funds, a proposal would have had to be made to a different Minister or (if necessary) a different government. The Ministry of Health has, over time, managed to have two or three of these funding agreements so I feel sure that, in this instance, an agreement would have been made. In my opinion, it is not unreasonable for the MHSD to suggest that every effort should be made to prevent a disease like Moya Moya from continuing to cause avoidable suffering. Obviously, that would be a very difficult matter to judge and it would, therefore, seem much better to have a clear budget for all funding. As this disease may well need treatment that will ultimately cost a lot of money, it seems very reasonable to spend a little more now for treatment of Moya Moya that might possibly save someone's sight in the future. In the present climate, there is probably less risk of",1
"Question: Are patients willing participants in the new wave of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia? Answer:  Patients are participants in regional or rural community-based medical education?. You are encouraged to use published literature to support the answer given. (see the reference list at the end of the paper).

There is a critical shortage of medical graduates across Australia. While strategies have been implemented to try and attract talented medical students to rural Australia, a new and alternative initiative has been the development of community-based medical education (CBME) programs---medical educational programs that have students actively practicing under supervision, often in rural areas, with a defined number of medical students (1--6 per group). The CBME programs are designed to be situated outside of the university campus, so that the university's academic standards and academic curricula can be maintained or enhanced via distance learning.

This article provides an anecdotal account of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia. It considers the potential roles and value of patients as participants in CBME programs. It outlines the advantages of patients participating in regional or rural CBME programs and why these programs exist. This article then considers the advantages and disadvantages of patients participating in CBME programs. It looks at this in relation to future models of health delivery and education. Finally, it considers ways in which universities might adopt and facilitate these communities-based medical education programs in regional and rural Australia.

Discussion of the Problem {#Sec1}
=========================

The problem of a shortage of doctors across Australia has been well documented \[[@CR1], [@CR2]\]. Increasing medical schools capacity is not an adequate solution to this problem \[[@CR1]\]. Rural and remote areas have very poor medical student--nurse ratios in comparison to metropolitan areas. This situation negatively impacts on the care provided in rural and remote Australia. Rural and remote Australia also has higher than average rates of disease, especially chronic disease. For example, the incidence of diabetes in rural Australia is more than twice the rate in urban Australia \[[@CR3]\]. These statistics contribute to the greater burden of disease and reduced life expectancy experienced by many Australians in regional and remote Australia. The shortage of doctors is exacerbated in regional and rural areas by higher than average unemployment, lack of educational infrastructure, and difficulty recruiting young, skilled professionals to the area \[[@CR4]\]. However, Australia is also home to some of the greatest and richest university campuses in the world, with many of them located in or neighboring regional and rural Australia. The solution to the doctor shortage is thus twofold. It relies firstly on increasing the number of medical schools and secondly on developing new curricula delivered through an increased number of medical schools.

Increasing the number of medical schools could allow the curriculum at any one school to be tailored to an increased student population. This would offer more students with the skill set required to deal more effectively with the disease burden of regional and rural Australia and would also provide more opportunities for regional and rural doctors to practice outside of university campuses. However, the cost of running a medical school program is prohibitively expensive. University campuses have to compete against industry for the limited pool of skilled workers, and the high cost of running a medical school means that medical students from rural and regional areas are disadvantaged in securing a position at a university medical school. The solution to this is to establish an alternative to uni-campus medical programs, such as those offered through the CBME programs.

New programs offer more than just a place to study medicine. They provide students with clinical placement, often in rural areas such as those that are underserved by public health \[[@CR5]\]. CBME programs have the potential to improve outcomes if they provide the student with greater opportunities for clinical practice. The student often forms strong personal and professional relationships in this situation, as evidenced with students participating in CBME programs \[[@CR6]\]. Student participation improves outcomes and reduces the stress experienced by students \[[@CR6]\]. Students are also able to practice in areas where they may struggle to gain medical experience while studying medicine at a university, such as rural Australia.

The CBME programs provide the students with skills and experience to be more resilient in the face of clinical practice, such as coping in difficult situations, dealing with patients suffering from complex diseases, and the skills to work on a team \[[@CR5]\]. In addition to gaining skills that are transferable to any setting outside of the university campus, students are able to use these skills to practice in areas where they would otherwise struggle to gain experience through undergraduate medical education. The ability for CBME programs to make a direct impact on the care of regional and rural Australia is highlighted by the fact that CBME programs operate across the entire country. This allows students and doctors from anywhere in regional Australia to access the program. While there is no evidence to show that the",1
"Question: Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90° of Knee Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction? Answer:  Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90° of Knee Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction? in this science fair project at Chemistry.org

Can the use of flexible fixation instruments create sufficient femoral tunnel lengths in an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at 90° of knee flexion? Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is performed by many surgeons in order to restore the knee function. A femoral tunnel and a graft tend to rotate away from the femur, which reduces the fixation strength in the ACL reconstruction. In this study, femoral tunnel lengths were measured using computer tomography in the flexion position and the rotation of knee joint under weight load. A comparison was also made among the measurements of the conventional tunnel, an ACL flexion instrument, and a cannulated flexible instrument with a curved distal tip. Femoral tunnel lengths were measured by calculating the distances from the center the femoral origin to the edge of the femoral graft. The flexible fixation instrument was made out of polyethylene (PE) and had a 4mm diameter at the tip of a 10mm length. The experimental study was performed on six fresh frozen cadaveric knees. Graft and knee joints were loaded at 1Hz and a 100g weight load, and then the knee was flexed 90° to measure the distances between the flexion and extension positions using CT images. For each measurement, three tunnel length measurement were performed by a single surgeon with a surgical navigation system. The mean difference and standard deviation were calculated and compared using one-sample t-tests. The lengths of four femoral tunnels were measured under the same conditions. The conventional tunnel was 12.2 ±0.5mm short at 0° of knee flexion and 17.7±1.1mm short at 90° of knee flexion. The flexion instrument was 11.4mm at 0° and 13.6mm at 90° of knee flexion. The cannulated instrument was 10.9±0.2mm at both knee flexion angles. All the measurements were statistically significant using each instrument. The rigid instrument was the most accurate measurement, but the cannulated instruments also showed similar accuracy. All three kinds of instruments were sufficient to measure femoral tunnel lengths as the distances between the native ACL, graft, and the joint at 0° of knee flexion, and 90° of knee flexion.

Introduction

In anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, a femoral tunnel and a graft are needed to attach autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts to a prepared bone tunnel. The location of the tunnel or the position and flexion angle at the time of the operation also affect the fixation strength of the reconstructed ACL [1, 2]. The optimal femoral tunnel length to the anterior center of the joint surface (AC joint) is about 1.5 to 2 times the length of the BPTB graft [3,4]. For an ACL reconstruction, there are many surgical methods, and surgeons vary with their preferences. However, most of them have a risk of complications such as tunnel loosening, graft rupture, or patellar fracture. Complications have been reported in the literature and are caused by a femoral tunnel which is too long by 1 mm or is too short by 0.2 mm to the ACL, even if it is measured at the extended position [5-8]. Therefore, the femoral tunnel has to be measured and fixed accurately before the operation to prevent complications when reconstructing the ACL. There are several conventional methods for measuring the femoral tunnel length. A probe, a Kirschner wire, and a guide pin are commonly used. A probe is usually placed in the femoral tunnel at the time of surgery. It is recommended to keep a minimum distance of 20mm from the edge of the bone to the center of the tunnel under a 60° flexed of knee joint. At full extension of knee joint, there should be a minimum distance of 30mm from the edge of the bone to the center of the tunnel and a minimum 10mm from the femoral insertion to the center of the tunnel [9,10]. A Kirschner wire can measure the length of the femoral tunnel during surgery. The minimum distance from the top of the femoral tunnel from the femoral origin is recommended to be 10-15mm [11]. The distance changes to 30-40mm when the knee joint is rotated more than 90°. Some instruments are designed as the guide pin to confirm the position of the Kirschner wire. They are called as guide pin [12,13]. However, the guide pin for measurement is not always used",1
"Question: Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter? Answer:  Do differences in socioeconomic status affect the overall quality of life of lung cancer patients? The abstract must be written in APA format.

Topic: Lung cancer: early detection and follow-up

Instructions: Choose the best answer. Choose ONLY one answer. Answers must be typed in APA format with the following specifications: 1. All responses need to be formatted correctly using APA format rules; and 2. Your paper must be formatted to word size.

I am wondering how to best answer this question:

""Quality of life in lung cancer patients is affected by their socioeconomic status.""

- I think it depends on the types of cancer patients you are talking about. Some people with cancer live longer than normal people and have little pain since they have been through the pain of their cancer. On the other hand, patients have different types of cancer that can effect their quality of life, but some people may have a higher quality of life than others.
- Some people with cancer live longer than normal people and never experience pain because they have undergone chemo or radiation. Still, though, others may feel pain and experience other physical issues because of cancer. Cancer patients live different lives. Some have quality of life lives while others do not.

My friend is going to use a question that is more specific and has to deal more with the different types of lung cancer. I would be glad to help him if you could edit my response for him, if you could contact him at (323) 488-4828. (Andrew).

-I think that the answer depends on the patient and what kind of lung cancer he or she has. For a smoker, quality of life is affected by whether or not the patient gets lung cancer or can prevent it from coming back. It also has to do with the kind and degree of pain, if the patient has pain. For a nonsmoker, it has to do with if and how often chemotherapy and other treatments such as chemo-radiation or surgery will be needed. For someone who may have lung cancer years from now, quality of life could be affected by any surgery done now and/or the effect of the cancer on other parts of the body.

I want to know how to answer this question:
""Quality of life in lung cancer patients: What should be done to improve the quality of life in these patients?""
I think one thing that should be done is to help people get regular checkups. Many people have this disease, and they should get regular checkups to look for ways to make them better.

Hi there, I want to know how to answer this question:
""What should be done to improve the quality of life in lung cancer patients?""

I think that, you have to take care of the patients. Not only these patients but also their family.

I think that you have to pay attention to the quality of life of the people that the disease affects, by being an active or proactive person, I believe that you will be able to manage the disease. I am right?

- I would recommend trying to become active and proactive as much as possible for yourself. It is a positive approach and also a way of not only doing well as a cancer patient but living well as a cancer patient, even during and after treatment.

I am very confused. I have heard that the quality of lives of lung cancer patients is a good.But it seems that people with lower socioeconomic status have even worse quality of life than those of high status.
I need your help. Write my paper in APA.

"Question: Are Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover Representative of Bone Histomorphometry in 370 Postmenopausal Women? Answer:  are biochemical markers representative of bone histomorphometry outcomes as measured by histomorphometry in postmenopausal women? In a cohort of 370 postmenopausal women, is skeletal bone markers, particularly ALP and bone-alkaline phosphatase (bAP) levels, representative of bone histomorphometric outcomes?.

Results
=======

The mean age of women in this study was 50.1±5.3 years old. Bone histomorphometric measurements did not significantly correlate with measurements of ALP. Serum concentrations of bone alkaline phosphatase did not significantly correlate with the BTM concentration nor with histomorphometry outcomes.

Discussion
==========

The results of this study suggest that bone alkaline phosphatase or bone formation variables are poor predictors of bone histomorphometry outcomes when compared to osteocalcin. In essence, the results suggested that biochemical measures of bone turnover should be re-examined as potential parameters for risk stratification of postmenopausal women.

Research Perspectives
=====================

It is important to conduct studies that involve a more rigorous methodology in order to improve the quality of research. The present findings indicated that there was a poor correlation between histomorphometric bone turnover outcomes and bone formation variables. Therefore, the findings indicated that these variables, especially biochemical variables of skeletal bone formation, should be reconsidered. Histomorphometry was chosen as a more rigorous method.

Introduction
============

Estrogens have multiple effects on skeletal tissue that include regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation, and proliferation; they are also important in maintaining normal bone remodeling \[[@b1-ijms-12-02032]\]. Estrogen deficiency has deleterious effects on bone health. The bone loss that results often leads to osteoporosis. Bone loss progresses with age particularly in postmenopausal women. The resulting osteoporosis is termed ""postmenopausal"" and contributes to osteoporotic fractures. Currently, most patients diagnosed with osteoporosis receive bisphosphonate treatment.

Bisphosphonateds inhibit bone resorption and have an impact on bone formation; thus, they are used to treat patients with osteoporosis. Alendronate sodium (ALN), the active ingredient in Fosamax^®^ (Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA), is an amino-bisphosphonate. ALN may inhibit osteoclast apoptosis and therefore preserve bone mass with a prolonged duration \[[@b2-ijms-12-02032]\]. Bone mass is constantly being remodeled via the bone remodeling process \[[@b3-ijms-12-02032],[@b4-ijms-12-02032]\].

Histomorphometric procedures that are used to study the remodeling mechanisms that occur during bone repair include bone biopsy which consists of a small incision. The result is that a tiny bone sample is either taken from the iliac crest or the distal part of the forearm. Bone biopsy allows evaluation of the histology and composition of bone repair sites within the bone \[[@b5-ijms-12-02032],[@b6-ijms-12-02032]\]. Samples obtained by bone biopsy are referred to as histomorphometric samples. There is a close relationship between bone quality and bone remodeling \[[@b7-ijms-12-02032]\].

Many bone-related markers have become available for the diagnosis of diseases and research into bone disease. They are a powerful aid to the assessment of bone metabolism. The markers that are currently used in order to evaluate bone metabolism include alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine (Cr), osteocalcin (OC), and type I collagen cross-links. The most commonly used markers of bone formation are ALP and OC. The major biochemical markers of bone turnover are ALP and bone AP (bap). Other bone-related markers that show promise include OCN, carboxy-terminal collagen peptide (CTX), amino-terminal procollagen I (PINP), *N*-telopeptide (NTX), free deoxypyridinoline (DPD), and urinary N-methylhistidine (NMH). They are also increasingly being investigated for use as potential predictors for fracture risk \[[@b3-ijms-12-02032],[@b4-ijms-12-02032]\].

The objective of our study is to investigate the association between bone turnover and bone histomorphometries in postmenopausal women. This was achieved by comparing the following two variables:

"Question: Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery? Answer:  Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery?\[[@ref1][@ref2]\] The Topic sentence is: Early extubation after congenital cardiac surgery should be the goal. IntroductionThe author\'s Abstract consists of: Methods: In this prospective observational study, children operated on for congenital heart disease with cardiopulmonary bypass who required ventilation for one night or more were included. Early extubation was done from the 2^nd^ postoperative day using the Modified Aldrete Scoring System as an index for the time of removal after the children were conscious except head, eyes, ears, nose, and tongue (HEEANT) scores ≤4 and the modified Ramsay Score for sedation ≤4. The time to early extubation, which was the time interval from the termination of anesthesia and the removal of endotracheal tube, and the reason to be extubated or reintubated were recorded. Results: Fifty children were included in the study. Their age ranged from 2 to 120 days with a mean postoperative hospital stay of 7 days. The early extubation group comprised 38 children whose HEEANT and modified Ramsay scores were ≤4 by day 2--5. Only two children had bronchospasm requiring reintubation. Sixteen children required reintubation because of respiratory difficulties, and ten required reintubation because of vomiting. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that early extubation should be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery with the availability of a suitable intensive care unit setting and trained staff. It is best to avoid reintubation and re-exploration if possible. We suggest the HEEANT and modified Ramsay scores for monitoring of consciousness and sedation to facilitate early extubation.\[[@ref4]\]

Answer:

Early extubation after congenital cardiac surgery should be the goal {#sec1-1}
====================================================================

Introduction {#sec2-1}
------------

Successful extubation in ventilated children after congenital cardiac surgery using CPB is associated with low morbidity and mortality. The ideal index for early extubation is the combination of safe hemodynamic status and recovery of postoperative respiratory functions as assessed by respiratory rate, auscultation of breath sounds, chest radiology, and oxygen saturation.\[[@ref5][@ref6][@ref7]\] The modified Aldrete score and Ramsay sedation score are the two indices for assessing postoperative consciousness and sedation, respectively, which can be used during CPB.\[[@ref7][@ref8][@ref9]\] We designed a score system comprising the modified Aldrete score (combined eye and ear openings and extremity movement), modified Ramsay sedation score (combination of verbal response score and response to verbal commands score), and requirement of supplementary oxygen to facilitate early extubation. The time interval from termination of anesthesia to time of extubation was taken into consideration as the index of the success of extubation.\[[@ref7]\]

Methods {#sec1-2}
-------

This prospective observational study was conducted using 50 children aged less than 1 year posted for elective surgery under CPB for cyanotic and acyanotic lesions at a tertiary care facility in the middle part of India.

Surgery was performed using a modified mini-sternotomy technique. After induction using sevoflurane and fentanyl, the left pleura was opened in a longitudinal plane and the pulmonary valve was opened. Repair of the intracardiac lesions was performed using interrupted, monofilament absorbable, or biodegradable sutures. Weaning from CPB was commenced from the right side in acyanotic children and the left side in cyanotic children until they could tolerate systemic oxygen flow of 2.0 l/kg/min. Preoperative or postoperative ventilation support was also carried out for all children if they required an increase in the FiO~2~ or oxygenation. The children were premedicated with ranitidine 10 mg/kg and midazolam 0.04 mg/kg i.v. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane, fentanyl 1 µg/kg i.v., and atracoronazole 2 mg/kg i.v., and maintained using sevoflurane and fentanyl. The children received a 30--50 ml/kg bolus of Ringer\'s lactate every 30 min if they required blood transfusion or required an increase in FiO~2~ or inspired oxygen concentration and maintained with CPB.

"Question: Does delivery mode affect women's postpartum quality of life in rural China? Answer:  Does delivery mode affect women's postpartum quality of life in rural China?

Question and answer {#Sec1}
===================

Question: Why is this an interesting question? {#Sec2}
---------------------------------------------

The World Health Organization (WHO) in 1990 recommended that caesarean section rates should not be over 15 % and that it should not exceed 5 % in developing countries \[[@CR1]\]. As of yet, developing countries have made little progress towards achieving these targets.

There is insufficient research on whether elective caesarean delivery, especially planned caesarean section for the prevention of obstructed labour, increases the risk of morbidity and mortality in both mothers and infants, or reduces women's quality of life after childbirth. This study will be a randomised controlled trial of women who have had a vaginal delivery or elective caesarean section. It will provide better evidence of whether women undergoing elective caesarean section have increased risks of poor health outcomes after childbirth including longer hospital admission, longer breast pump time, increased pain or infection. We also aim to investigate if elective caesarean section reduces mother's satisfaction with their childbirth experience. The findings will suggest that a vaginal delivery and elective caesarean section are both considered a safe option by participants. Elective caesarean is thought to be associated with reduced satisfaction with the experience of childbirth, which if true, is likely to affect the quality of maternity services in the future.

Question: Who are you asking this question to? {#Sec3}
----------------------------------------------

Maternity services that provide caesarean sections for non-medical reasons are common in China and are thought to be relatively safe. However, there is insufficient evidence to ensure that all hospitals will follow the World Health Organization's guidelines for caesarean sections \[[@CR2], [@CR3]\]. The results of this trial will help to answer whether the caesarean section policy should be considered for adoption in China.

Question: Who are the main researchers? {#Sec4}
---------------------------------------

This is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial involving seven hospitals in rural China. The trial was funded by a joint venture between China Medical Board (CMB) Foundation, UK, and Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, China. The two co-chief investigators, Professors Li and Yang, are based at Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital and are both obstetricians. They are supported by research nurses, research midwives and the trial manager from the Division of Research Management, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital. Professor Yang will be the principal investigator.

Question: Why don't we just ask women who have a planned caesarean section to provide an unplanned caesarean section for free? {#Sec5}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In China, maternity services were initially free, which means it is now expensive to deliver a baby. An increasing number of women choose caesarean section for a variety of reasons, including to give birth in hospitals, to prevent obstructed labour and to have a cleaner birth \[[@CR4]\]. There is no evidence that caesarean section for these reasons is less safe for the mother and the baby; the majority of babies delivered by caesarean do not have to go via a caesarean section. However, it would be unethical to make women choose caesarean section only for financial reasons, when studies from many other countries around the world, including developed countries, have shown that there are risks associated with caesarean section.

Question: Isn't it illegal to have trial and control participants together? {#Sec6}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is illegal in China to combine participants in intervention and control groups. We have a strict separation of groups, so we are only giving information to the intervention group about their maternity option by delivering them a health promotion booklet on vaginal delivery and caesarean section. The control group are not recruited and will receive the health promotion booklet after randomisation. This means women in both groups will be aware of the information they receive and will still choose their own option.

Question: Isn't it better for women to pick a vaginal birth over a caesarean section anyway? {#Sec7}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An increasing number of women in China are now choosing caesarean section for the reasons mentioned above, for example to prevent obstructed labour. It may be better for Chinese women to pick a vaginal birth.

"Question: Percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules: is aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid advantageous? Answer:  is aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid advantageous?

Answer: {#sec1_2}
======

A 52-year-old woman presented with a palpable left neck lump and a family history of thyroid cancer. She had a 25-pack-year history of smoking, and a chest X-ray revealed a normal lung appearance. Thyroid function tests revealed elevated thyrotropin (TSH) (3.5 mU/L) and a hypothyroid state (TSH = 2.01 mU/L). Ultrasonography showed a 26-mm cyst in the left thyroid lobe and an incidental multiloculated cyst in the right lobe. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) revealed malignant findings. After fine-needle aspiration cytology had been performed and the patient had undergone total thyroidectomy, a left lobe nodule measuring 5 mm was detected in the operating field. FNAC suggested possible malignancy, and the mass was removed. A pathological examination revealed it to be a multicystic lesion. A second FNAC was performed on the mass and showed malignancy, thus completing the preoperative diagnosis of primary papillary thyroid carcinoma. After histopathological evaluation of the mass, the patient underwent a percutaneous ethanol cystic nodule injection (PECI). The nodule was removed 5 months later without complications.

Indications for PECI {#sec1_2_1}
====================

The primary indications for PECI are: (i) a high risk of recurrent thyroid carcinoma or metastasis or recurrence; (ii) a malignant mass that shows no response to conventional treatment modalities; (iii) a thyroid nodule that may represent a benign follicular adenoma; (iv) a nodule in a patient who has already undergone surgery or radiotherapy; and (v) a solitary thyroid nodule that increases in size during the follow-up period, even in a patient with hypothyroidism or after thyroidectomy and iodine therapy. In addition, PECI can be performed for cosmetic reasons, but a cosmetic surgery should be discussed with the patient, especially in patients with a multicystic goitre.

Procedure: PECI Technique {#sec1_2_2}
=========================

According to the technical procedures described in the original work by Lai et al. \[[@B1]\], the procedure is usually performed under local anaesthesia. However, general anaesthesia or conscious sedation is an option if required. The PECI technique is performed in the outpatient clinic, and the procedure is monitored using a high-resolution ultrasonography machine to perform the initial puncture and to guide the needle. The patient usually lies in the supine position with the neck slightly extended. The puncture site is in the lateral aspect between the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. In order to puncture, it is essential to locate the cyst fluid with ultrasound. Initially, the needle will be guided into the cyst without aspiration because the cyst fluid may cause pain or bleeding. After aspiration, the needle is advanced to the bottom of the cyst without aspirating it. A solution (usually 2 mL of 95% ethanol) is slowly injected into the cyst under ultrasonographic guidance. The needle remains in place for 20 to 30 s, depending on the cyst size and location, and then removed. The ethanol solution is aspirated and the cavity is filled with the normal thyroid parenchyma. In order to prevent a leakage of ethanol solution, the cyst wall must be thick. Furthermore, the cystic volume should be less than one-fourth of the nodule volume. A histological examination is performed after puncture or after the first two injections if the indication for the procedure is a recurrent carcinoma or a metastatic cancer. The second and subsequent ethanol injections are usually guided by the ultrasonographic findings. If there is no cyst fluid after puncture, ethanol is administered and the aspirated contents are analysed; aspiration cannot be used to detect malignant cells. Histopathological samples of aspirated fluid must be taken and evaluated before a diagnosis of malignancy is made.

Precautions {#sec1_2_3}
-----------

Although the PECI technique has recently been accepted in the treatment of thyroid nodules and some guidelines have been published \[[@B2], [@B3], [@B4]\], this procedure is still being investigated and complications have been reported. In general, PECI is safer than ethanol lavage or aspiration for cystic thyroid nodules, but the data are limited because of the",1

Answer: A gallbladder polyp is a growth on the wall of the gallbladder. It is a relatively common finding, but a true neoplasm does not occur in the gallbladder.

Question: After the initial gallbladder cancer is diagnosed, how long can the cancer be treated or can it progress? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: After the initial gallbladder cancer is diagnosed, how long can the cancer be treated or can it progress?

Answer: The management of gallbladder cancer consists of surgery (i.e., cholecystectomy), chemotherapy, or radiation. There is no evidence that cholecystectomy should be delayed in patients with gallbladder cancer that is treated by surgery.

Question: Why do people not die of pancreatic cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Why do people not die of pancreatic cancer? Do more than 5 people die of pancreatic cancer in a given year in the U.S.?

Answer: The most common cause of pancreatitis is gallbladder disease, especially from a combination of biliary stones and a gallbladder polyp or gallbladder cancer. However, the gallbladder is also a common site for adenocarcinoma, and adenocarcinoma may develop in association with cancer of the pancreas.

Question: How often do people with gallbladder disease die from gallbladder cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How often do people with gallbladder disease die from gallbladder cancer?

Answer: The 5-year survival rate for people with cancer in the bile ducts, gall bladder, ampulla of Vater, and per duodenal diverticulum is about 55%, whereas the 5-year survival rate for people with cancer of the pancreas is only 25%.

Question: What are the most typical symptoms of diseases of the gall bladder? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What are the most typical symptoms of diseases of the gall bladder?

Answer: The most common causes of jaundice are gallstones or a gallbladder polyp. Other causes of jaundice include pancreatic cancer, and bile duct cancer. The patient's symptom pattern determines whether surgery is advisable, usually in the form of cholecystectomy.

Question: Where else can one get biliary colic? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Where else can one get biliary colic?

Answer: Biliary colic is an acute, unilateral pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen that may begin during the night or in the morning and last several hours. Biliary colic usually occurs when stones in the biliary tract (gallbladder, cystic duct, or common bile duct) become impacted and migrate through the intestinal tract causing biliary colic. The stones can become impacted in a small bowel obstruction, pancreatic duct, or cystic duct obstruction. Biliary colic occurs in about 1 in 100 persons after cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) for biliary colic.

Question: What causes jaundice with nausea (and what is the most common cause)? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What causes jaundice with nausea (and what is the most common cause)?

Answer: The most common cause of jaundice in people without gallbladder disease is biliary tract stone obstruction; the second most common cause is acute hepatitis. The most common cause of jaundice in people with gallbladder disease is acute hepatitis or a duodenal ulcer. Jaundice without nausea is much more likely to be due to gallbladder pathology.

Question: What is the most common reason for gallbladder operation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the most common reason for gallbladder operation?

Answer: The most common reason for gallbladder operation is a symptomatic gallbladder polyp or a gallbladder neoplasm.

Answer to your Question :

Explanation :

As discussed above, in the induction of abortion using prostaglandin gel abortion, it is very effective to use trans-cervical method of abortion. However, it is not always possible to perform trans-cervical method. Therefore, the para-cervical block method, which uses a needle into the cervical canal rather than inserting the instruments into the uterus, is recommended in cases of difficulties in performing the method of medical abortion by trans-cervical method.",1

Staple Line Leakage (SSL) is a relatively common complication of laparoscopic gastric surgery\[[@B1],[@B2]\]. The prevalence of SSL has been reported to vary, depending on which definition is used in particular studies of laparoscopic gastric surgery\[[@B1]-[@B3]\]. It is well known that a greater intraoperative spillage volume seems to be associated with higher rates of SSL\[[@B2]\]. As with any other complication following laparoscopic surgery, various strategies have been formulated to prevent abdominal contamination and to decrease the risk of SSL.

Anastomotic leakage is a feared complication after colorectal surgery. Anastomotic leakage results in a prolonged return to a hospital, and is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality\[[@B4]\]. Anastomosis integrity is still not preserved because anastomotic leakage is not a well-defined entity. There are two definitions; one from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (*def*: anastomotic disruption) and another from the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer (*def*: disruption of the anastomosis)\[[@B4]\]. Anastomotic integrity is an issue of ongoing discussion\[[@B4]\].

Anastomotic leakages can potentially be classified into two forms: acute (or intra-abdominal) and late (or bowel-wall) leakage\[[@B4]\]. Both types of leakage can occur during and after surgery; however, early leaks are more hazardous and occur more frequently than late ones, which are more likely to become chronic and to lead to bowel-wall leakage. Leakage is classified as clinically significant versus minor according to the amount of fluid that is detected. In cases where a significant leakeage is present, reoperations are inevitable and the patient needs to undergo a second surgery to replace the diseased bowel segment. On the other hand, a minor leakeage may only require a simple procedure to drain the space, and the patient can receive conservative treatment. Many factors have been reported to increase the risk of anastomotic leakage. These include colonic and rectal anastomosis, poor bowel preparation, the surgeon's experience, the quality of the bowel anastomosis, and the extent of the abdominal procedure\[[@B4]\].

In addition to clinical features, various scoring systems are used in the prediction of the occurrence of anastomosis leakage, such as the Clavien-Dindo classification and the National Institute of Health classification\[[@B5],[@B6]\].

Many previous studies have been conducted to define the risk factors and strategies to prevent complications during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies, and even stapled anastomosis. In a systematic review of 29 randomized controlled trials, Kim et al\[[@B7]\] studied the factors related to anastomosis leakage in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies.",1
"Question: Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome? Answer:  Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome? This research topic comprises three papers that assess the relationship between chronic functional somatic symptoms and various disorders.

The following papers in this field, which was also the topic of the 2009/10 Special Issue of the International Journal of Applied Psychotherapy \[[@B1-ijerph-11-09142]\], have been published during the past year in different countries, and we invited the authors to expand on the topic and provide new results in order for them to be published:

\(a\) ""*The relationship of mental stress and somatic symptoms*"": ""The objective of this study was to analyse and classify factors involved in the genesis of somatization phenomena. Stress has been found to play a key role in the pathogenesis of many cases of somatization. A series of questionnaires have been used in order to assess the emotional and somatic component of the stress, as well as coping strategies. A cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational design was performed, so that it is possible to draw comparisons between a group of cases that present somatisation and a control group without a history of somatisation. The results reveal that, as regards stress, certain personality aspects were found to correlate with somatization disorder.""

\(b\) ""*The role of mental distress and somatization: the impact of job stress in the development of chronic functional somatic disorders*"": ""This study, which was performed using a cross-sectional design, aimed to investigate the role of various occupational and health factors on the development of Chronic Functional Somatic Disorders (CFSD) in male workers aged 25--64. The study included 656 workers enrolled in nine vocational centres in Poland from the second half of 2011 to 2011. Each of the centres is located in one of the largest industrial areas in the country. The following analysis were performed: (1) a comparison of the CFSD group with the group of subjects without a history of chronic somatic disorders; (2) an analysis of the relationship between CFSD and socio-professional factors, medical factors, and lifestyle factors; (3) a regression analysis of the relationship between the dependent variable: CFSD, and the independent variables: somatization, anxiety, and depression disorders; (4) the analysis of the relationship between the main causes of chronic diseases: somatization disorder, mood and psychological disorders, somatic symptoms-related disorders, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, endocrine disorders, musculoskeletal and nervous system disorders.""

\(c\) ""*Symptoms of temporomandibular disorder, anxiety and somatization disorder: is the link between temporomandibular disorder and somatization disorder more apparent than the link between temporomandibular disorder and anxiety?*"": ""This study describes the relationships between the symptoms of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) evaluated with Craniofacial Pain Index (CPI), anxiety symptoms and somatoform symptoms using the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (R-CIS-8) as well as the relationships between TMD and somatoform symptoms. The study was made in three groups: the first, control (n = 25), the second--patients with a diagnosis of rheumatic pains (n = 50), and the third--patients with a diagnosis of pain caused by TMD (n = 50). In this study, the prevalence of TMD was found not to be higher than was reported in the literature; however, the prevalence of somatoform symptoms, both physical and psychological, was found to be comparable with literature data found for somatization disorder and other somatoform disorders.""

"Question: Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010: are Medicare beneficiaries getting sicker? Answer:  Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010.

In 2008, the Medicare Trustees reported that there would likely be a “Medicare crisis” starting in 2015, due to the continued high and rising costs of Medicare as well as the lack of a solution to the impending costs of health care reform. For example, in 2008, there were about 2,000 hospitals nationwide that closed. As of 2009, the number has risen to about 5,500. The rising costs for Medicare were seen in the Medicare program rising from $764 billion in fiscal year 2002 to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2005, the program was spending $819 billion, and $1.2 trillion by the end of the decade.

The current system is a mix of ‘fee for service’ (FFS), ‘supplemental insurance’ (Medigap) and ‘managed care’ (Medicare Advantage: MA). Each part of the Medicare program cost the nation about $746 billion in fiscal year 2008. In total, Medicare comprises more than 18.2 percent of all national health spending in the US. It is the largest part of the US spending system and second largest part of national health spending worldwide (1). Medicare spending is growing faster than the rest of the economy as more seniors are entering Medicare, more of them use the program for hospital services and the average health care cost per beneficiary has increased.

In terms of health care spending, the majority of the increase was attributed to spending on inpatient services, which accounted for the majority of health care spending in nearly all other developed nations. From 1996 to 2010, the percentage of total health care spending spent on inpatient services has doubled in the US and rose to 75 percent by 2010. Even with the increase in the portion of total health care spending spent on inpatient care, the percentage of people spending on FFS increased the most – from about 70 to 75 percent in 1996. Part of this was the introduction of the Medicare program and a new ‘supplemental insurance’ program in the form of the Medi-gap program.

As an indication of the cost of the Medicare program we looked at the total cost of all health care spending by 2008 and 2010. According to the Office of the Actuary in 2010, spending between 2008 and 2010 is projected to grow by an estimated 5.6 percent. This includes Medicare and Medi-gap expenses along with medical care spending in general, Medicaid spending, the Veterans Health Administration and spending by Federal employees, such as Social Security, and other government spending.

Over the past few decades, healthcare spending has risen much faster than other industries. The growth rate in spending on healthcare has been over 10.5 percent since the early 1990’s. The only other industry to have had faster growth in that period was the oil and gas industry which grew by close to 14 percent. In 2011, US healthcare spending rose to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). In 2010, total spending reached $2.7 trillion with GDP reaching over 16 trillion, so the nation was spending nearly 26 percent of GDP on health care. Since we are paying most of the costs for health care out of household income which typically only reaches 60 to 65 percent, we are spending between 37 percent and 40 percent of household income on health care in the US. (2)

The rising cost of health care is a major problem for the US in terms of affordability, but also for the economy. In 2008, a survey found that one of every three dollars of the total US spending is spent on health care. In 2010, the spending was a record $2.7 trillion and projected to rise in the future. This will affect spending on home mortgages, on consumer spending and on the entire US economy. The US will face a possible crisis in terms of budget surpluses, unemployment, recession and the deficit, as was found in the fiscal year of 2009, which ended September 30, the second trillion-dollar budget deficit. In fact, federal deficits in the 1980s and first half of the 1990’s were over $1 trillion, but fell to under $1 trillion for seven years from 1997 to 2003. However, spending on Medicare has grown from less than $100 billion in 1979, to about $500 billion in 1990 and almost $1.1 trillion in 2008. (3) We have to ask ourselves the question, are we all getting sicker and sicker, or is the population getting older?

If the population is getting sicker, then the government is not making enough investments in health. It is more likely that the prevalence of chronic illnesses is rising, but the Medicare Trustees report is a result of population aging and a larger",1
"Question: Does successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice? Answer:  does successful completion of the Pregnancy Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice? This paper should not be submitted until you have secured an ethics committee approval to undertake research.

**Thesis: the successful completion of the pregnancy education program does not result in improved obstetric practice**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The thesis of this study is, that there is very limited evidence to support the notion that completion of a pregnancy awareness and preparation training course, like the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP)^®^ ([Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type=""fig""}), leads to improvements in obstetric practice.

Literature review {#sec1}
=================

The review of the literature begins with the initial literature search which found the first scientific paper in 1987 that supported a relationship between education regarding the effects of the obstetric risk factors on the outcome of pregnancy and birth.[@bib1] This was followed with a number of studies from 1996 onwards which supported an association between education and improved outcomes.[@bib2], [@bib3], [@bib4], [@bib5], [@bib6], [@bib7], [@bib8] This study, however, is not in total support of the benefits of pregnancy education as seen in literature. A study conducted by the [@bib9], at the University of Oxford, demonstrated a relationship between increased knowledge of pregnancy risks and birth outcome, without a significant relationship identified between knowledge and practice (measured by the Caesarean section rate) after controlling for the effect of age of pregnancy, parity and maternal age. This same theme emerged in a study by [@bib10], where knowledge of pregnancy was not significantly correlated with the prevalence of caesarean section.

The results of this study, however, does not provide conclusive results. A study conducted by [@bib11], in 2008, suggested that knowledge of obstetrical risk is significantly correlated with the knowledge of the obstetrical risk factors, however, knowledge was not a significant contributor to the knowledge regarding the management of pregnancy complications. Other studies have identified that educational interventions in antenatal care increases knowledge and improve the communication with the women but there is very limited evidence to suggest a relationship between the educational interventions and improved antenatal care practice.[@bib12], [@bib13] This study will review available evidence in this area, including the results of this study completed and the published literature from 2012 onwards.

A narrative review of studies will be used to assess the evidence in this area. This will be followed by a review of the articles for quality and validity of each individual study.[@bib14] This will be followed by a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the evidence in this area.

A narrative review of available evidence {#sec2}
========================================

[Figure 2](#fig2){ref-type=""fig""} shows that there was only one study conducted examining the impact of education of the Perinatal Education Programme,[@bib1], [@bib3] by which the participants were followed to assess the impact on obstetric practice. This found no evidence of the benefits of pregnancy education. Four years later, [@bib5] and [@bib8] showed that education of participants of the [@bib15] (later known as the [@bib16]) programme (the Perinatal Education Programme) results in decreased neonatal mortality and morbidity. This result shows that there is a relationship between the education programme and better outcomes. Two years later, [@bib2] (the World Health Organization) showed that education of the mother resulted in a significant decrease in pre-term birth. This evidence is seen to be quite significant, however, it does not support a relationship between education and improved obstetric practice per se. This study included a study by [@bib17], where it was identified that women with a lower educational level and low household income were more likely to have caesarian section, suggesting that education level had a role in obstetric decision making. This is a result which is not in keeping to the outcomes of this study (pregnancy education and improved obstetric care). In 2005, a study by [@bib14] identified that the education during pregnancy increased their knowledge and communication skills, however, their practice of antenatal visits and fetal monitoring did not improve. In 2009, a study by [@bib18] showed that a higher educational level was a significant predictor for antenatal care visits and fetal monitoring. They found that increasing education was associated with improved utilisation of antenatal care. This is a very strong theme for education in all areas of public health. In 2010, a study by [@bib",1
"Question: Do patients with localized prostate cancer treatment really want more aggressive treatment? Answer:  Do patients with localized prostate cancer treatment really want to be treated like a man?

Abstract

The main objectives of this study were first to examine if patients with localized prostate cancer really want more aggressive treatment and second to test the predictive value of one’s belief that one will die from cancer as a reason for or against treatment.

Methods

Using a quantitative research methodology, a total of 928 patients with localized prostate cancer were interviewed by two research assistants who were not involved in managing or treating the patients. Each patient filled out two separate questionnaires: the first to ask patients about their opinions concerning treatment and the second to indicate what they thought would happen to them at the end of 10 years should no treatment be undertaken.

Results

One-third of the patients were unwilling or very unwilling to be treated. Of those who were going to be treated, 45% considered treatment futile and 35% did not feel that their lives will be negatively affected by treatment. Age was a significant predictor for patients’ opinions regarding treatment. Patients willing to be treated were younger than those unwilling.

Conclusion

Patients with localized prostate cancer may differ in their reasons for or against treatment. The decision to treat cancer with curative intent should be in line with the patient’s wishes and medical guidelines.

Using a quantitative research methodology, a Total of 928 patients with localized prostate cancer were interviewed by two research assistants who were not involved in managing or treating the patients. Each patient filled out two separate questionnaire: the first to ask patients about their opinions concerning treatment and the second to indicate what they thought would happen to them at the end of 10 years should no treatment be undertaken.

Results

One-third of the patients were unwilling or very unwilling to be treated. Of those who were going to be treated, 45% consider treatment futile and another 35% did not feel that their lives will be negatively affected by treatment. Age was a significant predictor for patients’ opinions regarding treatment. Patients willing to be treated were younger than those unwilling.

Conclusion

Patients with localized prostate cancer may differ in their reasons for or against treatment. The decision to treat cancer with curative intent should be made in line with the patient’s wishes and medical guidelines.

Thesis/Dissertation

Prostate cancer is a common form of cancer in men, for which no curative therapy exists. Treatment options for patients are currently limited to radical prostatectomy (RP) with endocrine therapy. Radiation therapy (RT) remains a therapeutic option in locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa), and recent studies show a lack of negative effect of RT-based treatment on erectile function (EF), the ability to have intercourse. The use of this modality is, however, controversial in the literature, as no prospective data exists and most publications are retrospective or based on historical data. Furthermore, little insight is available into the mechanisms of such treatment effect or which patient characteristics determine the outcome.

In this study, we aim to determine the influence of treatment type (RP vs. RT) and patient characteristics in determining the change in EF following treatment by RP or RT. The main objective of the study was to assess the influence of treatment type on the change in EF at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months following RP or RT. A secondary objective was to determine the association of patient characteristics, including pre-treatment EF, performance status and age, with change in EF. We hypothesized that change in EF is similar for RP and RT, as it is not associated with treatment type but is instead due to the presence or the absence of androgen deprivation therapy combined with surgery. Furthermore, we hypothesized that baseline performance status and age influence change in EF.

"Question: Does music influence stress in mechanically ventilated patients? Answer:  Does music influence stress in mechanically ventilated patients? Use information from the research report to support your response.

AIM: To examine the effects of musical interludes in a mechanical ventilator and on nurse workload in general and more specifically on psychological interventions administered to mechanically ventilated patients.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study design was quasi-experimental with two time groups: ""with music"" and ""without music."" Participants were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to one of the two groups, according to an alternating randomized Latin square in each group, with 3 cycles (21 subjects). Subjects were monitored continuously and during periods of intermission a music song was played. A music song with rhythmic cadence based on a four part harmony was played for 7 minutes in each group. The music song was chosen to be well known and easy to hear by the patient. The control group was monitored continuously with a silent mechanical ventilator setting. The nurses perceived a decrease in stress for the intervention group compared to the control group as it was reported during the study.

CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the presence of a music song in mechanical ventilation during periods of interruption may be useful as a complementary procedure to improve the quality of life of patients and to improve the perceived stress of nurses.

Introduction. A music therapy (MT) intervention for mechanically ventilated patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) was designed to reduce the length of intensive care monitoring time and nurses' workloads. However, the feasibility of the MT intervention for patients in mechanical ventilation and its effect on nurses working in that setting was unknown, as was the ability to provide effective psychological treatment to them. This study assessed the feasibility of, and patients' interest in, the MT intervention in comparison to a standard group that included mechanical ventilation without background music. In addition, nurses' perceptions of patients' stress were collected.

The need for improvement in intensive care monitoring and for stress reduction in patients in mechanical ventilation is recognized.1-2 Patients receiving mechanical ventilation can develop depression and fatigue, and such distress may worsen the clinical condition,3 the quality of life,4 and even shorten their survival.2,5-7 Additionally, it was reported that nurses working in a high stress environment, such as that of an ICU, are at risk of burnout.8 Other reports suggest that burnout among ICU nurses decreases staff commitment, decreases satisfaction with patient outcomes, and increases the risk of depression, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse.1-3 Because of these consequences, stress reduction during periods of intensive monitoring and other intensive interventions is important to the successful treatment of mechanically ventilated patients.

In ICUs, there are many demands on nurses, including, for example, giving pain medication, administering intravenous fluids, taking blood gas samples, conducting blood tests, performing ventilator settings, changing electrodes, and giving psychological therapies.6-8 Thus, the time available to provide intensive monitoring has decreased in recent years.6 While providing such monitoring requires a high level of attention for some patients,9 a review of the literature found that it also increases the stress levels and psychological demand for nurses.10 While various approaches have been used to reduce stress, such as relaxation techniques,11 light therapy,12 exercise programs,13 and mindfulness (eg, guided imagery and breathing exercises),14 there are few published reports on the benefits of music use, such as the presence of music in mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care. Thus, the feasibility of a music therapy intervention and the efficacy of music as a stress-reducing strategy remain unsettled issues.

It was suggested that the benefits observed for pain perception and distress reduction during mechanical ventilation in intensive care may be associated with the benefits of music therapy.15 However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no study has evaluated the efficacy of music therapy for decreasing stressful events in mechanically ventilated patients.16 The aims of this study were to examine the feasibility of, and the patient interest in, the intervention in comparison to a standard group of mechanically ventilated patients that included a standard treatment with background music, and to measure nurses' perceptions of their patients' psychological stress.

"Question: Does reducing spasticity translate into functional benefit? Answer:  Given the clinical practice of treating spasticity, to what extent does the treatment of spasticity predict functional improvements in a patient group?

A recent issue of *The Spasticity Newsletter* featured a guest editorial highlighting a major scientific challenge in the field of spasticity---""The challenge of spasticity measurement"".[@b1] As the editors state, ""Spasticity is one of the most frequent symptoms in neurological disorders; however, there are no agreed outcome measures or standardized assessment protocols for measuring spasticity."" As many others have stated, it is now the consensus that the greatest gap in our knowledge of spasticity is its measurement.[@b2]--[@b4] We now also feel that there is no consensus on whether there is any benefit to treating spasticity---is it really necessary to treat, or can we use our knowledge and experiences to guide rehabilitation that is more appropriate and functional (and possibly less toxic)? This editorial states that this confusion ""prevents reliable decisions about treatment and has created a major obstacle to developing meaningful therapeutic trials.""

The Editorial Board at *The Spasticity Newsletter* is made up of individuals who work in the field of rehabilitation and all have their hands (or more in some cases!) full with their current or prospective clinical and research activities. One thing that we do have is the experience of working with clients and their families who have had spasticity, in the best sense, throughout their lives. One of the most challenging areas of clinical practice we have seen is the experience of clients who have spasticity in the early years after spinal cord injury (SCI), particularly those affected by the devastating ""pontine"" injury. Many of these clients have been using Botox or other medications for some time (some say for up to 10 years in some people). In the course of working with these people for some time, it becomes evident that many of their symptoms, such as pain and spasms, were not as disabling as their spasticity. As time has passed and they have begun to use alternative medications and procedures, the spasticity has remained static, or even more disabling than before. And yet, the majority of these people still report having had a good quality of life, with a positive outlook for life and having tried to achieve the highest standard possible in their own life.

There have been several challenges in finding this group of clients, but we realized relatively quickly that they are very hard to find. The majority of people in this group need at least some form of rehabilitation, and that involves a variety of professionals (for example, physical and occupational therapists, psychologists, and social workers) and many more professions who are working together in the rehabilitation setting. We have often felt a sense of exasperation at what was needed to enable a few of our patients to receive an evidence-based diagnosis and receive interventions that are evidence-based. This Editorial Board felt that there needs to be a way of identifying clients who might have received Botox and the like, but who may well need other more aggressive and targeted interventions that have the potential to improve their spasticity and function. We started on a systematic search to try to identify some specific types of interventions that might have an outcome benefit for chronic spasticity. Our approach was to describe our search strategy in sufficient detail to identify other researchers who could undertake their own evaluation for the purpose of generating some new research trials. We published a report to describe our systematic search strategy[@b5] and then started to look for other systematic reviews. However, even though the Cochrane Spinal Cord Injury group had produced a systematic review on Botox[@b6] in 2002 \[which concluded that there is certainly not enough research to warrant making any recommendations about its usage; this was done because there is the potential for it to be beneficial, but not yet adequately substantiated that it might be so\], there had been a major change in the way these therapies were being delivered. That is, many clients were being treated in an ""outpatient onabotulinum toxin type A (onabotA) group,"" with no formal assessment of their baseline spasticity. In our systematic review there were only 6 studies on the treatment of spasticity in people after SCI for the period from 1994 to May 2000. Two of these were related to botulinum toxin and so may not have been useful in our review. This group of people are being treated in more than 20 centers around the U.S. alone. Since this group is very hard to quantify, it would be very hard to quantify or evaluate their true condition. There are some that would like to see this group of patients in a ""spasticity clinic"" that uses the ""spasticity-spasm as a target for assessment, monitoring, and treating.""

"Question: Is the holmium:YAG laser the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter? Answer:  Is the holmium:YAG laser the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter?
The purpose of this study was to compare, based on a rigorous analysis of the peer-reviewed literature, the Holmium:YAG laser--lithotripsy versus ESWL in a single randomized trial. Although ESWL has already replaced invasive lithotripsy for most patients with ureteral stones, some patients still need invasive lithotripsy, primarily because the stones are large, or a different intracorporeal lithotripter is preferred. ESWL is also not an effective option for patients with stones in the lower ureter. Thus, an effective intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter needs to be selected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to examine systematically available, relevant, and rigorously performed clinical trials using ESWL and Holmium:YAG laser to compare the efficacy and the safety of each device. A comprehensive systematic search of 4 electronic databases was performed from their inception to 30 March 2010. The inclusion criteria for the systematic review were random controlled trials (RCTs) of intracorporeal lithotripsy. The primary meta-analyses were the pooled proportion of successful stone clearance. Secondary analyses included the pooled rate of complications attributable to each modality. Risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence were also assessed formally. Nineteen RCTs involving 771 patients compared ESWL to Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy (Holmium:KTP). The median aggregate diameter of stones for patients receiving intracorporeal lithotripsy (ICL) was >10 mm. The pooled estimate of successful ureteral stone clearance, for the Holmium:YAG laser, was 92.5%, a significant increase over the 86.6% pooled estimate for ESWL (P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04, 2.08). The Holmium:YAG laser was also associated with a significantly reduced rate of complications as compared with ESWL (rate ratio, 0.33; 95% CI 0.24, 0.47). Based on rigorously designed RCTs, the Holmium:YAG laser is associated with improved outcomes compared with ESWL when considering stone-free rates, complication rates, and cost savings. This review provides Class 2B evidence that Holmium:YAG laser is associated with improved stone-free rates, decreased complication rates, and lower rates of hospitalization as compared with ESWL regarding ICL for large ureteral stones >10 mm.",1

Objectives. To evaluate the effect of bracket-ligature combination on Orthodontic Space Closure.Materials and Methods. 20 patients requiring fixed orthodontic treatment on premolars are chosen to record their pre-treatment and post-treatment measurements. Bracket-ligature combination were used to reduce chairside time and also to increase reliability. Orthodontic treatment was carried out with Ni-Ti closed coil springs, 0.016′′’ edgewise bracket.RESULTS. The bracket and ligature combination resulted in significantly more space closures over 3 months than single ligature application, but space closure was not clinically significant. Conclusion. There is no difference in the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months with the bracket and ligature combination.

Question:

Answer:

Question: Can any orthodontic or endodontic problem lead to peri-apical lesions?

Answer:

It depends and it is a combination of these factors 1. There is a direct relationship between the severity of the orthodontic problem, the forces applied, and the rate of progression of the lesion.

The risk of root resorption is greater if the problem is associated with the presence of micro-fractures 2.

Question: What are the benefits of fixed orthodontic treatment for an adolescent patient when compared to the use of removable and fixed appliances?

Answer:

Removable appliances are more efficient in that they allow a closer periodontal monitoring 2. A more comfortable patient can avoid the daily problems of plaque and calculus around the bracket base, the occlusal surface of the brackets, and teeth. Fixed appliances have proven to have significantly more torque than removable appliances as well as an improved patient tolerance, and comfort 3. No removable appliance will eliminate the need for a periodic recall and professional cleaning of the occlusal surface of the appliance

Question:

Answer:

Question: What is the advantage of the new technique, using open coil spring in orthodontics?

Answer:

The open spring offers several advantages over the other orthodontic springs in the fixed appliance bracket systems. The open coil spring offers flexibility from ligature to bracket base. Open coils allow a very fine spacing of the base of the appliance, hence allowing a very efficient arch wire for more powerful forces. A high tensile force from the spring is applied on top of the tooth, and this results in force directed away from the periodontal ligament. This means that force is not wasted on a more compliant area that is not supporting the tooth, or on a tooth with periodontal attachment that is being extracted. This provides protection and safety to the periodontal ligament

Question:

Answer:

Question: In a child with deep bite (retroclined occlusion), does the presence of an extraction of first incisor significantly alter the skeletal pattern?

Answer:

In adults, loss of lateral incisors may be accompanied by significant loss of overjet and gingival retraction. In very young patients, these are not likely to be problematic 4. The first permanent molars are more critical than the lateral incisors.

Question: Question: How can orthodontic therapy be designed to meet the needs of a young child with severe upper and lower canine-overjet relationship?

Answer:

It is difficult to treat this type of problem without placing a removable appliance. The child should be encouraged to have her permanent first molars brought to the ideal overjet and overbite relationship. By this time (pre-retention), the child may have enough space, and the molars appear to have a sufficient amount of eruption. However, the first premolars seem to play no role, as opposed to the first molars. It is necessary to have the first molars brought over to correct the overjet relationship, followed by the second molars 5

Question:

Answer:

Question: Does the type of metal for orthodontic arch wires influence the rate of tooth movement?

Answer:

For the same force per area, NiTi and beta gold wire are identical in terms of mobility. The NiTi wire is more resistant to corrosion, and less brittle than beta gold 6. The wire also has a high tensile strength and can withstand loads during arch movement. However, NiTi wire is a ferromagnetic material, and a magnetic",1
"Question: Health habits and vaccination status of Lebanese residents: are future doctors applying the rules of prevention? Answer:  Health habits and vaccination status of Lebanese residents: are future doctors applying the rules of prevention?

1. Introduction {#sec1-ijerph-16-01333}
===============

The Lebanese people have shown their willingness to contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the global community since the Middle Age \[[@B1-ijerph-16-01333],[@B2-ijerph-16-01333],[@B3-ijerph-16-01333]\]. This is the result of an ancient cultural and civilizational heritage, which continues to thrive to the present day \[[@B4-ijerph-16-01333]\]. This heritage has been further strengthened through an active and dynamic national identity that has gradually emerged over the past 70 years \[[@B5-ijerph-16-01333],[@B6-ijerph-16-01333]\]. The Lebanese identity today is marked by an ancient heritage of a national culture that is rich in history and spirituality, an Arabic identity based on the Arabic language, a modern identity based on a democratic system of governance, an Eastern identity based on Arabism and a Mediterranean identity based on the shared prosperity that characterizes the Mediterranean. This image of the Lebanese people is an important cornerstone of the nation as it represents a fundamental foundation that is both social and spiritual, since there can be no Lebanon without the nation and without Lebanon's population \[[@B7-ijerph-16-01333]\].

However, when the Lebanese people take the health challenges of our society into consideration, we do not find any substantial progress in the last several decades, even though the Lebanese people have shown considerable advances in medicine and scientific research, and in public health knowledge. This situation is not unique to the Lebanese people \[[@B8-ijerph-16-01333],[@B9-ijerph-16-01333],[@B10-ijerph-16-01333],[@B11-ijerph-16-01333],[@B12-ijerph-16-01333]\]. This situation is particularly evident when the health risks of our society are examined. Even though the Lebanese people possess considerable abilities in science \[[@B13-ijerph-16-01333]\], they show a relative weakness in knowledge regarding personal health and the public health system, as well as attitudes about these issues \[[@B14-ijerph-16-01333],[@B15-ijerph-16-01333],[@B16-ijerph-16-01333],[@B17-ijerph-16-01333]\]. Similarly, as we all know, we are not completely immune to the health risks that are prevalent in this society. We know very well that the Lebanese people are subject to the health challenges of our society.

In this context, there is a need to look for potential obstacles that could hinder the progress of science and education within the medical and scientific community. We can see that the knowledge of the medical fraternity of the Lebanese people has remained limited and that they do not apply many of the rules of prevention \[[@B18-ijerph-16-01333],[@B19-ijerph-16-01333],[@B20-ijerph-16-01333]\]. One of the limitations to medical work within the scientific community, which could hinder the development of the medical field, is the low level of participation of young people in the scientific community \[[@B21-ijerph-16-01333]\]. This situation is most visible in the fields of medicine, the health system, and public health. Even though there is not enough information to make generalizations from such limited data, we can assume that low participation is not limited to only the medical scientific community. Although higher participation within the medical scientific community is a goal that would be beneficial for the development of the medical field, it would be a waste of resources and a failure to utilize the potential and scientific capabilities of the Lebanese people; such as the ability of many to find solutions to the most challenging problems of society and humanity.

An important factor is the education system's emphasis on the production of doctors of different specialties. The main educational and training systems are not sufficient to meet the future needs of medicine \[[@B22-ijerph-16-01333]\]. Although a lack of awareness of the current health issues among doctors remains a potential barrier to successful practice, this phenomenon is not exclusive to the medical scientific community \[[@B23-ijerph-16-01333],[@B24-ijerph-16-01333],[",1
"Question: Does vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia have the same evolution as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia? Answer:  Does vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia have the same evolution as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia? What would you discuss? Write your abstract in 750 words and use one or more of these items as a basis for your answer:

Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is more serious than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The two diseases are in the same disease-specific group along the cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia continuum. Women with HPV-related neoplasias that are not classified as carcinoma in situ may have a worse prognosis than women who have squamous-cell carcinomas.

Abstract

Intranuclear, or intratubular, HPV infection is found in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cervical neoplasia). The incidence of cervical neoplasia increases with increasing age. A similar association has not been confirmed with precancerous lesions, which may be due to the fact that women rarely recall receiving a pelvic examination as part of their medical care by age 30. Histologically, the changes in precancerous cervical lesions can include atypical hyperplasia and atypical dysplasia. These lesions are not clinically distinguishable from low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and are known as borderline or atypical condylomas. There is conflicting evidence on whether women who have HPV-related condylomas may have a higher risk of developing cervical neoplasia and whether there is a relationship between HPV-related condylomas and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. This statement is endorsed by the following organizations: the National Cancer Institute (NCI); the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology; the American Society for Clinical Pathology; American Society for Preventive Oncology; American College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists; the Canadian Society for Clinical Laboratory Science; and the National Women's Health Network.

Introduction

One of the best-known genital infections is human papillomatosis virus (HPV), also known as oncogenic, cancer-causing virus1,2. HPV is a double-stranded DNA virus with the molecular weight of 40,000 and is transmitted sexually, not by person-to-person contact. The virus is present in 90% of women with genital HPV and 7% of the general population when a cervical sample or cervical smear is analyzed. The disease is categorized into 3 clinically-differentiated stages: 1) normal; 2) metaplasia; and 3) cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV), is an intracellular, single-stranded DNA virus containing 8,000–10,000 nucleotides. HPVs are capable of infecting both mucosal and cutaneous epithelia and have been characterized mainly into low or high-risk types. High-risk HPV types are associated with cervical, vaginal, penile, and anal intraepithelial neoplasia and have been linked to an increased risk of anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and vaginal cancers. High-risk HPV seroprevalence starts at an early age. HPV DNA is present in 70% to 80% of women by age 14 and in all women by age 29.3 HPV infection has a prolonged asymptomatic period and does not always lead to cervical neoplasia.4 HPV infection is thought to progress along the continuum from normal cervix to cancer of the cervix.5 The progression of low-risk HPV infection from lesion to high-grade intraepithelial lesion (dysplasia), is unknown. Women with HPV may have a worse prognosis as compared to women who have cervical carcinoma. Recent studies reveal that treatment of women who have HPV-associated dysplasia using various surgical procedures was associated with longer progression-free survival than those who received no therapy3 and similar improvements in survival for women with high-grade dysplasia. This clinical observation suggests that women with HPV associated neoplasias may be more sensitive to cancer therapy than those who have high-grade cervical dysplasia but no HPV.

Clinical description

Intraepithelial neoplasia occurs in areas of the genital tract where epithelial cells divide rapidly and are not protected from exposure to exogenous and endogenous stimuli. The genital tract has 2 mucosal surfaces separated by a thin layer of highly vascular connective tissue. The mucosal surfaces are characterized by epithelial cells and glands. The epithelial cells are composed of cells that are rapidly dividing, in contrast to the cells found in the epidermis, which generally are not dividing. The epithelial cells of the uppermost layer of the genital tract are in the secretory phase of the menstrual",1
"Question: Should general practitioners call patients by their first names? Answer:  Should general practitioners call patients by their first names? A. Discuss the risks of calling a patient by their first name. B. Define ‘name caller.’ C. Describe the effects of calling patients by their first name. D. Discuss the effects of calling patients by their first name. Use data gathered on the number of calls that patients make to the general practitioner at a busy family practice. What is the overall average increase in the workload for the general practitioner that is attributable to these frequent phone calls? E. Discuss any consequences to the health and well-being of the patient who is calling the doctor.

Answer: An abstract for a scientific journal is a summary of a research article.

Answer: Most of the time, people who call a doctor’s office by telephone mean well. However, sometimes the people who call the doctor’s office do things that actually harm, or even endanger, the patient. The doctor has an ethical obligation to protect the patient. Therefore, if the doctor hears from a patient after hours that the patient is worried about the possibility of having a serious heart problem, the doctor is ethically and morally obliged to get an expert opinion about the situation.

What do people who call, for example, “Mr. Smith” do? They will often give the family practice manager their name only. Sometimes they will say there is a problem with a tooth or some kind of surgery that is being planned. To verify such information, the doctor might make a call to the person who they believe to be the patient, and ask, “How are you doing?” Or they might take down the patient’s address and write the message, “I am getting ready for my surgery,” on a piece of paper and leave it with the receptionist.

Sometimes people who call the office by telephone want to discuss a serious medical issue with the doctor, but in such cases, they will always want the caller’s name and some kind of identification: a driver’s license or some other form of photo identification. The doctor may feel uncomfortable doing this, but it is a matter that must be addressed.

Answer: We have discussed the ethics and legalities concerning the use of force by police officers and other law enforcement officers. Similar rules cover the use of such force by family practice managers acting on behalf of doctors. The force, however, must be employed in the interests of a patient’s welfare. This involves some pretty basic questions of ethics on the part of the manager:

Is there a genuine risk of harm to the patient?

Has the patient, in fact, threatened the safety of other persons, or endangered others with a gun, or other weapon?

Is force required?

Is the time for delay in using force too long?

These last two questions are very important, since in a medical emergency, a delay of seconds or minutes can be the difference between life and death. If a person is in need of medical assistance or has a medical emergency, but the person is not a criminal, and no gun is involved, the general practice manager is allowed to use his or her judgment to decide whether there is time for delay. However, in a medical emergency, he or she must give appropriate instructions to the person calling.

Example: Suppose a patient is at the emergency clinic with a severe toothache, and is bleeding profusely. The nurse, at the doctor’s request, will then call an ambulance to take the patient to the hospital. What happens if the general practice manager, thinking that the patient has no emergency medical condition, allows the family practice receptionist to take the phone, and he or she asks the patient how his tooth is doing? If a person is in acute, life-threatening pain, the person is allowed to say “Ouch, Ouch, it’s killing me, Please, help me,” and the doctor would be required to provide emergency aid. However, if the person is not at risk, there is no need for any emergency assistance. And, a general practice manager who fails to intervene in a medical emergency, when asked to do so, actually violates the standard of care, in that he or she is in effect allowing a criminal to escape arrest.

On other occasions, the caller is probably in great pain and has some questions about the doctor’s treatment: what procedures were done, how the treatment progressed or changed over time, and what the chances are of recovery, for example. The general practice manager should be willing to answer such questions. However, if the caller becomes angry and upset, the general practice manager is ethically and legally obligated to put the caller on hold, and he or she will probably not even consider any further questions.

"Question: Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients: are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for transplantation? Answer:  Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients: Are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for transplantation? The abstract should include: A succinct background that explains your rationale.The method(s) and results (numerical data collected and the findings for these patients)

**ANSWER: Transesophageal assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients**

As we read above, Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients is a well-established technique in many centres and it provides good quality data.

The key point is that Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients shows a high correlation with left ventricular function before cardiac transplantation, without showing any significant differences in the clinical outcome as compared to heart transplantation from other potential donors, i.e., a non-marginally acceptable heart.

The euvolemic status of the marginal donor heart has a similar prognostic outcome as in donors with a slightly reduced left ventricular function.

We can safely conclude that Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients is a reliable method to exclude these marginal donor hearts, because they cannot be transplanted. All the results can be summarized in this one statement:

*""Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment in brain-dead patient is effective in excluding marginally acceptable hearts for transplantation""*

**Question: What was the most interesting discovery, question or result?**

**ANSWER:** *What was the most interesting discovery, question or result?*

The most interesting finding is that Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients showed similar outcome as from marginal donor hearts when transplanted.

Because we could exclude marginal donor hearts because of severe systolic dysfunction with Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function.

The question was: Are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for transplantation.

The answer is No, Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients is effective in excluding marginally acceptable hearts for transplantation.

**Question: Please describe your work in 5-8 sentences.**

**ANSWER:** *Please describe your work in 5-8 sentences.*

**The most interesting finding is that Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients showed similar outcome as from marginal donor hearts when transplanted.**The left ventricle and atria in brain-dead patients showed an increased wall thickness without significant systolic dysfunction and without pulmonary hypertension.Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients excluded marginal hearts with severe systolic dysfunction, without showing significant differences in long-term survival when compared to heart transplantation from other potential donors, i.e., non-marginally acceptable hearts, as compared to the group of heart transplant recipients.**Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patient is valuable in evaluating the quality of the marginal donor heart.**

"Question: Attenuation of ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats: does edaravone offer protection? Answer:  At least 3 authors; present work in the context of other published investigations regarding the same topic to date.

Methods/experimental details
=============================

Animals
-------

Twenty-four sexually mature female Wistar-albino rats weighing 210-220 grams were obtained from the Central Animal House Facilities, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt. Rats were maintained in a standard environment under controlled conditions (12 hour light/dark cycle; temperature: 22±1°C; relative humidity: 55±5%; lights on 0600, off 1800) with food and water ad libitum. All animals received human care according to institutional guidelines and the Animal Experimental Ethical Committee of the National Research Centre, Egypt approved all experiments. Experimental protocols were followed based on the guideline for the welfare of experimental animals.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a multi-functional cytokine with essential roles in immune responses to infections and inflammation \[[@B1]\]. Overproduction of TNF-α may lead to local and systemic inflammatory responses and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many chronic and acute inflammatory disorders.

Determination of basal TNF-α protein expression
------------------------------------------------

Serum TNF-α was determined as described by Fathalla et al. \[[@B5]\]. The serum was collected for 24 hours, centrifuged and stored at -30°C before it was measured using commercially prepared rat TNF-α ELISA kit (RayBiotech, Inc. NorcrossGA, USA).

Surgical operation and study groups
-----------------------------------

Animals were anaesthetized by an intra-peritoneal administration of ketamine (0.08 ml/100 g body weight 100 mg/ml) and xylazine (0.08 ml/100 g body weight 100 mg/ml) in a dose of 10 mg/body weight/ml \[[@B6]\]. The ovarian veins were cannulated just after the operation for TNF-α determination. Ischemia was produced using a microclip (MS-2, 6 mm diameter x 3 mm long) applied to the left ovarian pedicle for 5 hours in the first 3 days and for 8 hours on day 7. The clip was removed on day 8 and reperfusion lasted 48 hours. Sham operated animals underwent the same procedure except that the ovarian pedicle was not ligated.

The rats were divided into four sub-groups (6 animals in each) as follow:

**Group I**The sham operated control animals.

**Group II**The TNF-α control animals undergoing ischaemia by a 5-hour left ovarian pedicle clip and 5-hour reperfusion without pharmacological treatment.

**Group III**The edaravone-treated animals undergoing ischaemia by a 5-hour left ovarian pedicle clip and 5-hour reperfusion. Edaravone was administered 30 minutes before reperfusion for 7 consecutive days in doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight \[[@B7]\] and the corresponding saline solution as the vehicle. The groups were as follow:

**Group III-I**The 50 mg/kg edaravone-treated animals undergoing ischaemia by a 5-hour left ovarian pedicle clip and 5-hour reperfusion.

**Group III-II**The 100 mg/kg edaravone-treated animals undergoing ischaemia by a 5-hour left ovarian pedicle clip and 5-hour reperfusion.

**Group IV**The sham operated edaravone-treated animals undergoing ischaemia by a 5-hour left ovarian pedicle clip and 5-hour reperfusion.

The animals were sacrificed by decapitation under ether anesthesia followed by blood collection. The ovaries were then immediately dissected and divided into cortical and medullar segments for TNF-α immunohistochemical and enzymatic determination as well as for biochemical analysis.

TNF-α assessment
----------------

For immunohistochemical study, ovaries specimens were fixed in freshly prepared phosphate buffered formaldehyde solution, washed, dehydrated through serial ethyl alcohol changes and finally cleared in 2:1 benzene:paraformaldehyde, frozen in super-cooled liquid propane and sectioned at 10 mm \[[@B8]\]. Sections were cut at 10 μm and incubated with 10% normal goat serum for 1 hour before incubation with a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against rat TNF-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California, USA). Staining was carried out using the appropriate secondary anti-rabbit",1

"Question: Can a Novel Surgical Approach to the Temporomandibular Joint Improve Access and Reduce Complications? Answer:  Can a Novel Surgical Approach to the Temporomandibular Joint Improve Access and Reduce Complications?

ANSWER:

1-2 years in writing and editing in preparation for peer review.

3-5 months in editing and proofreading after peer review.

2 months in peer review, 1 month for editorial commentary on first round review and subsequent revision, and approximately 3-6 more months in editing and proofreading if accepted/rejected as final paper by peer reviewers as a result of revision.

4-6 months for review of other journals.

2-4 months in peer review, and another about the same in editor/proofreader editing if accepted/rejected.

1 week on a plane trip (traveling to a meeting).

There are no guarantees, and the timeline can vary, but most peer review times are about 1 month.

As you can see, it’s a big commitment on your part, and there is plenty of opportunity for setbacks, delays, and missed deadlines.

And a rejection can be a major set-back, not just in time, but also emotional and monetary (we lost several potential publications in our previous papers that were rejected without even a rejection letter, which was the ONLY time we accepted to publish without an acceptable peer review.)

When you are asked by editors or reviewers about peer review, what the experience is like, the answer is varied and depends on the journal.

Some journals are so demanding of their peer reviewing that you see little in the way of feedback, and your manuscript is just sent to a queue that may or may not be reviewed by the author within the time you specified.

If you read your submission in the journal where the peer review went the distance, you may read some good things, in particular about one thing that the journal editor did to improve the quality of the journal (there are quite a few that have made this happen).

But, the reality is, there is no way to know if peer review has happened and what the manuscript has been reviewed by, and if you’ve requested peer review for more than 2 years, there is really no way to gauge whether you’ve submitted to the right journal to even start with as far as peer review goes, and even after peer review is completed it may not be what you hoped it was and it may be sent to another journal without even a chance to resubmit to your journal.

But that journal may just be a great journal for writing, not peer review, and that’s why some peers say, “if I only ever peer review in the great journals, I would never submit a manuscript.”

And I’m not trying to dissuade you from submitting to journal, but it takes a lot of time to ensure that the best journal in that field will accept that manuscript! If it takes 2 years, then you are going to submit to a few great journals and just about any journal you can find in that field.

So it is really a question of finding the right journal and the right reviewer.

If you find a journal that can satisfy both criteria for you and you have a good relationship with the editor then you will probably be very happy. There is a chance that the journal will give you constructive criticism, but it all depends on the editor you are working with and what they think you wrote, or didn’t write.

If you are in the middle at the point of your career, trying to establish new authorship (you are submitting after a few years of publishing, where you were a co-author), then your chances of an editor giving you some feedback, constructive criticism, or even sending your paper to a reviewer are probably pretty low.

If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to receive constructive criticism from the editor about the manuscript, you may be disappointed by how it comes across.

I think that there are some editors that are very helpful and some that are not.

It takes a while to establish a working relationship that is helpful, and some editors don’t even like to have a working relationship with anyone.

So many people are looking for peer review/writing/publishing positions that if you ask who do you like, who’s your favorite editor, most people cannot name one, so there really isn’t a way to know who the editors are that like to offer help and how helpful they are.

That’s why you have to be patient and understand the system.

What is your timeline? What is the level of the journal? Are you willing to change the journal if editors do not meet your timelines?

"Question: Young-Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures: does it predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries? Answer:  Does the Young-Burgess classification predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries in pelvic ring fractures? Your answers should focus on the answers to the Question. If your answer refers entirely to the Question, explain your rationale.

Answer:Pelvic fractures can be classified as anterior, posterior, posterior superior, and lateral, and can also be classified by their severity as unstable or stable. The most important step is to reduce the fracture and keep the patient stable while performing internal fixation. A good reduction allows early mobilization as in the unstable cases with higher complication rates. We use the Young-Burgess classification based on the sacral ala to assess the injuries to better explain associated orthopaedic injuries and plan further management. Our aim in this study was to know the prognostic value of Young-Burgess classification in predicting the need for blood transfusion and non-orthopaedic injuries in unstable pelvic fracture patients.

Key words: Young-Burgess classification, unstable pelvic fractures, blood transfusion, non-orthopaedics injury, prognosis.

***Answer:*** *Mortality in pelvic fractures is approximately between 30-50%. The risk factors are high-energy injury from traffic accidents or from a fall on the ground. The highest morbidity is seen in those patients who sustain either a combination of fractures involving the sacrum, pubic symphysis and acetabulum or who show posterior shearing and unstable sacro-posterior joint fractures (type B fracture)*.

The incidence of traumatic pelvic ring fractures rises with age, with the highest incidence rate observed in geriatric patients in whom the mechanism may be a fall from the same level. The mechanism of injury in pelvic ring fractures can be the result of a high-energy trauma, which can be directly or indirectly inflicted such as motor vehicle crash (MVC). Direct impact on the pelvic ring leads to fracture patterns that are characterized as an oblique or transverse fracture through the sacrum (Type A and B), the pubic symphysis, the superior ramus of the pubis, or the anterior acetabular cortex (Type C, D, E, and G). A fall from a higher level is likely to result in a posteriorly unstable injury, as well as sacrally unstable fracture patterns (type B).

The fracture patterns in pelvic fractures are characterized from anterior to posterior and medial to lateral. In unstable injuries, fractures involving the pubic symphysis and the sacroiliac joints also result in an increase in mortality. Fractures of the sacrum are often neglected leading to the development of instability \[Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}\].

![X ray pelvis showing pelvic fracture](JETS-4-314-g001){#F1}

***Question (Reddy):*** Describe the treatment of posterior stable pelvic ring fractures. Also describe management of sacral injury/sacral fracture.

***Answer:*** Posterior pelvic ring fractures can be classified as either posterior shear/stress fractures (type C) or posterior compression/transverse compression fractures (type D or E). These types of fractures are managed conservatively. Posterior ring dislocations often have concomitant posteriorly displaced segment fractures/dislocations which may be reduced in the emergency setting. The anterior component injuries should be assessed as this also aids with prognosis. Posterior ring reductions usually do not require additional internal fixation as the sacral fracture has not displaced posteriorly.

Posterior shear fractures are often associated with fractures of the posterior superior acetabular margin and sacrum. Posterior compression fractures often have a greater extent of sacral fractures which are more significant in posterior compression fractures. Both anterior and posterior injuries from the ring disruptions may have associated limb injuries. The treatment of the limb injuries should first be carried out, after this the pelvic ring injuries are treated. The sacral injury needs to be assessed for reduction and stabilization. The type of sacral injury needs to be taken into consideration and is an important prognostic sign. This would include sacroplasty or sacroiliac stabilising technique when deemed necessary. A stable sacral fracture or fracture-dislocation requires an emphasis on the treatment of limb injuries.

***Question (Reddy):*** Explain the steps of management for patients with unstable pelvic ring.

***Answer:*** Unstable pelvic ring fractures can lead to instability with or without neurological injury. Management should address all aspects of injury with particular emphasis on the reduction and stabilisation of the pelvic ring. Fracture patterns in these injuries are often significant with fracture lines and displacements often extending over multiple segments (Table [1](#",1

Abstract

Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been recognized as a public health concern and a clinical challenge in many parts of the world. The objective of this review was to assess the prevalence and causes of vitamin D insufficiency in children with celiac disease in different countries/regions.



Methods: The primary database, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched through April 2019 for studies on Vitamin D deficiency among children with celiac disease. The exclusion criteria were non-English-language articles and duplicate articles. The data included country, study type, study population, age, season of the year (if applicable), screening method used for vitamin D status, the cut-off values used to diagnose vitamin D deficiency, diagnostic criteria for celiac disease, and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.



Results: A total of 20 studies from 9 different countries were included. The prevalence of celiac disease in children ranged from 0.33% in Denmark (1,863 celiacs per 100,000) to 16.5% in New Caledonia (30 celiacs per 100,000). The vitamin D cut-off value in children with celiac disease ranged from 11 ng/ml (25 nM/L) to 40 ng/ml (100 nM/L). Vitamin D insufficiency was reported in 50 - 90% of children with active celiac disease. A seasonal clustering of celiac disease cases was reported in New Caledonia (December - March) compared to Denmark (July - September). A significant association between vitamin D insufficiency and celiac disease was reported in New Zealand children, North Americans, and Italian children. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was significant (P < 0.001) when vitamin D insufficiency was defined as a 25(OH)D serum level lower than 20 ng/ml (50 nM/L) or 30 ng/ml (75 nM/L).



Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is a feature of celiac disease and can be identified in about 50% of children with celiac disease in the developed world.

A vitamin D deficiency is commonly recognized as the main cause of rickets. Studies conducted in recent years have shown that vitamin D deficiency is also a common feature of celiac disease.1-5 This is a condition characterized by intolerance to gluten. It is the most common autoimmune disease of the small intestine, although up to 1% of the population are asymptomatic for celiac disease.6 The presence of celiac disease-related antibodies in the blood of more than 90%7 of children with celiac disease and up to 50% of adults8 indicates that their small intestinal immune cells are already involved in the celiac disease process. Although there are no symptoms associated with ongoing celiac disease in up to 75% of children,9 a study has shown that these children still had abnormal growth and development.10 However, it has been questioned whether any growth differences are caused by non-specific effects of celiac disease on the small intestine and/or bone growth or may also be associated with a more severe course of celiac disease. The most extensive study on celiac disease-associated malnutrition in children has been carried out by Moriz and colleagues,11 who defined celiac disease-associated malnutrition according to height-for-age, weight-for-height and weight gain below the third percentile and below P90 of the reference population.11 It was noted that there was a trend towards a positive association of weight-for-height, but not height-for-age, with the presence of celiac disease. It was concluded that celiac disease affects bone growth in children and they may be underweight.12 Celiac disease was most frequently found in Caucasian children with vitamin D deficiency.13,14 However, vitamin D deficiency has not been identified as the major factor for celiac disease-associated malnutrition. This has led to the conclusion that celiac disease may affect growth by its nutritional consequences, not only by its celiac disease-specific effects.



A recent study with a large population of 2,076 schoolchildren demonstrated that all the children had a mean 25(OH)D level of 18.4 ng/mL which indicates that 40% of them were vitamin D sufficient and 40% were vitamin D insufficient, even with a low calcium diet. The serum 25(OH)D was less than 20 ng/mL in",1

Abstract for Question: Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?

The HIV epidemic continues to fuel risky sexual behaviours, and studies examining behaviour change in this group are needed.[1,2]

To examine behaviour change over time in people living with HIV (PLWH), we investigated trends in three key sexual risk taking behaviours among PLWH. The main exposure was self-reported condom use at last sexual intercourse with primary and casual partners during the past year. Data are for a representative sample of PLWH in the UK (estimated size 1.34 million, 90% of all diagnosed adults and 10% of all undiagnosed people), and trends over time are studied by comparison with survey estimates for the general population.

This cross-sectional study compares condom use over time with a similar general population sample, using population weights and standard errors to adjust for the differential demographic composition of the two samples.[3] We used regression models to assess trends for each risk category using all data obtained and by including data from an annual survey of the general population, the British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, 1991–2002.[3–5]

From a representative sample of PLWH aged 18 years or more, 50% of primary partners and 60% of casual partners were reported to have involved no other sexual partners in the past year: 33.6% of these individuals reported condom intercourse in the past year. From the BNSS general population sample, 28.2% of individuals were from the same age group, 30.3% of partners were primary partners and 51.2% were casual partners; 30.5% of these individuals were reported to have not used a condom in the last sexual encounter. Prevalence of no condom use in primary and casual partners was 16.1% in both populations.

Condom use in most (71.7% in the last sexual encounter and 86.8% in the last year) was similar to that in the general population and remained relatively stable over time (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR), 1.05; table 1). However, condom use reported in casual encounters declined significantly over time (adjOR, 0.87 per annum; P=0.03). Condom use reported in primary partners did not change significantly (adjOR, 0.92; P=0.41). Prevalence of condom use at last sexual intercourse, although lower than in the general population, remained relatively stable over time.

Conclusions

In contrast with the general population, condom use reported at last sexual intercourse was stable, and condom use at last sexual intercourse with casual partners declined although not significantly. Condom use reported for primary partners also remained stable. The fact that condom use remained relatively stable at a high prevalence, despite the epidemic, indicates that sexual behaviour is not changing for the worse. The use of more accurate denominator data may be one factor explaining this.

"Question: Cholestasis associated with small bowel atresia: do we always need to investigate? Answer:  Is Cholestasis Associated with Small Bowel Atresia always needed to investigate?

ANSWER: Hello there, in the case of an infant, I would be looking for liver pathology, since small bowel atresia is an exclusion criterion. Anecdotal cases of this complication, in the absence of other diseases, have also been reported in the literature, with a good response to octreotide or to antibiotic therapy for the intestinal obstruction[@B1]. The treatment of choice is the resection of the obstruction and the creation of a side-to-side anastomosis between the distal jejunum and the ileum, as it provides an excellent functional outlet and allows for an early nutrition, along with parenteral nutrition therapy during the weaning period (6-12 weeks)[@B2],[@B3]. If the weaning is not successful, patients may require a long-term nutritional support.

QUESTION: Which factors must be taken into consideration before ordering an autopsy of a child? Who will make this decision? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What factors must be taken into consideration before ordering an autopsy of a child?

ANSWER: As the body of children is not usually completely formed, the main factors to be considered in order to identify developmental conditions are those that occur later on in life: malformations of the heart, lungs and limbs, which usually are the result of intrauterine or postnatal growth disorders. In addition, other internal organs, such as kidneys may also be affected in these situations and should also be evaluated and documented before an autopsy is performed.

QUESTION: Which are the main signs of severe gastroesophageal reflux? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Which are the main signs of severe gastroesophageal reflux?

ANSWER: According to the literature, severe gastroesophageal reflux is one of the most common diagnoses in child practice, and it is characterized by non-resolution of gastroesophageal reflux episodes in spite of a long-term therapy (\> 6 months). Furthermore, these disorders are more frequent in infants with high body weight, and they have more episodes and more long reflux durations during the day[@B4]. Reflux esophagitis has an important contribution in determining long-term complications in infants and young children with severe gastroesophageal reflux[@B5]. The main sign of this type of reflux process is the so-called Barret´s esophagus, characterized by the inability of the esophagogastric junction to retroflex during swallowing. Another common finding is the presence of vomiting episodes in children with severe reflux refraction. These episodes can reach up 100 at a time with a very intense abdominal pain[@B6]. In infants with severe gastroesophageal reflux, the clinical symptoms are rarely associated with an important organic disease, and these patients mostly present with non-resolving diarrhea[@B7]. The only exception is the presence of gastroesophageal reflux-associated failure to thrive, where the high frequency of gastroesophageal reflux episodes is responsible for feeding problems[@B8]. These are the cases of esophageal and or gastric dilation, vomiting and diarrhea, with abdominal retraction and loss of subcutaneous fat, which are more frequent in infants than in adults. The main diagnostic test for severe gastroesophageal reflux is the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which identifies both esophageal and gastric dilation, and the endoscopic biopsy that reveals the most common pathology: the presence of inflammation and gastric dilation. In contrast, infants and children with severe gastroesophageal reflux presenting with respiratory symptoms present a more difficult disease management; this is because it depends on the symptoms of reflux that appear first in upper airway obstruction and then in wheezing. This type of symptoms appear initially in young children and then, even with effective therapy, can progress to asthma or to early childhood wheezing[@B9],[@B10]. If the above symptoms are not relieved by a successful management, a gastroesophageal endoscopy can identify the presence of eosinophils in the esophageal or gastric mucosa, which identifies this type of reflux to be responsible for bronchospasm.

"Question: Are financial incentives cost-effective to support smoking cessation during pregnancy? Answer:  and states in the abstract the evidence from the systematic review you conducted.



In high-income countries, approximately 10–20% of pregnant women smoke during pregnancy. Many pregnant women smoke in order to have a cigarette before or after childbirth, and many pregnant women also want to quit. Smoking cessation during pregnancy offers both the mother and the fetus health benefits, but it is a stressful and hard task. Pregnant women are often encouraged to quit by their partner, family or healthcare professionals, and some also receive financial incentives as motivation to stop smoking. Several studies suggest that financial incentives could be a strategy for increasing smoking cessation during pregnancy. However, in many cases of financial incentives, cost-effectiveness analyses were only used as a part of the study, and the studies were mainly of non-peer reviewed nature, where the primary objective stated was to assess effectiveness of the incentive. In this systematic review, we assessed whether financial incentives help pregnant women to decrease the harm of smoking, and if we could recommend financial incentives as effective. Evidence suggests that financial incentives increased the quit rate in pregnant women, and if offered by healthcare professionals, these incentives may be cost-effective. Given the current lack of evidence, however, further research is needed. This review will summarize the literature on the effects of financial incentives during pregnancy and describe the strengths and limitations of the studies.

Introduction:

During pregnancy, approximately 10–20% of the women smoke, causing substantial morbidity and mortality to both the mother and the child.[1-7] Smoking during pregnancy, besides causing a direct harm to the fetus, has several other detrimental effects on maternal health, including the risk of complications at the time of delivery and increased risk of future diseases in the mother. The newborn child has a number of adverse effects, including preterm labor, low birth weight, increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome and increased risk of respiratory problems, such as childhood asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[8-11] Furthermore, there is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and infertility in the neonate and its children.[12-14] Some studies also showed that fetal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke has an effect on cognitive functioning in the child.[15, 16] As far as we know, in low- and middle-income countries, the consequences for the fetus of being exposed to the nicotine in the tobacco smoke is not yet studied quantitatively, and more studies are needed.[17]

The smoking status during the pregnancy varies with several factors, including the women’s age, age at starting smoking, marital status and educational background.[6, 18] Smoking during pregnancy is a result of an addictive behavior, which can be changed through intensive antismoking counseling, self-help support, combined with pharmacotherapy.[19] The harm caused to fetuses of smoking during pregnancy can be reduced through the use of effective interventions, with nicotine replacement therapy as one of the most-common effective treatments.[20] Furthermore, antismoking counseling in pregnancy is also very effective,[21] although counseling is probably not available to all the women who want to quit smoking during pregnancy.[22]

It is easy and cost-effective to identify women who smoke and offer them a brief intervention. Nevertheless, it usually fails to lead pregnant women to stop smoking successfully.[22, 23]

There are many approaches to increase the effectiveness of smoking cessation in pregnancy. This review focuses on the role of financial incentives on smoking cessation during pregnancy. Financial incentives to quit smoking has been proven to be more effective when offered by healthcare professionals,[19, 24, 25] or by someone whom a pregnant woman trusts, such as her partner, family or healthcare professional,[10, 26-28] as well as when they are offered within the healthcare facility itself.[11, 29] As some studies indicate, these incentives might provide a cost-effective way to increase the quit rate in pregnant women. Studies from the 1970s suggested that smoking cessation during pregnancy provided an economic savings to society as a result of the decreased number of babies born with lung disorders.[13, 30] In several high-income countries, financial incentives are used for helping pregnant women to reduce the harm caused by tobacco smoke.[8, 10, 11, 31-44] Although there are different ways of offering incentives, and some studies included cost-effectiveness analyses as a part of the study,[13, 34, 35, 45] the primary objective of most of the studies was to assess only the effectiveness of the incentive. However, in most cases the aim of the study was to assess effectiveness of the incentive, while cost-effectiveness analyses were only used as a part of the study.[8, 10, 11, 31-33, 34, 35, 45] Another challenge is that incentives were offered for a period of time (",1

The questions may have been asked, or discussed on the forum, prior to the submission deadline

The questions may have been discussed in a workshop. You won’t get extra points for attending a workshop

The questions may have been discussed in an online discussion group or mailing list

The questions may have been discussed at university-wide congresses

If a question has been discussed within the curriculum on the forum before the deadline and you have posted the first question that answers this question, you can get an extra bonus point (50% off!) for each of the last two categories (3 bonus points)

You cannot use the same question twice in a row

Please use each question once and no more than twice in order to get credit for the assessment

The points are accumulated with a minimum of 20 (for 20 questions) and a maximum of 100 (for 1000 questions).

You can participate in this assessment up to 20 times a year

Each semester there are specific assignments in the topic of the Quality Assurance programme which you have to work on. You could also work independently on this topic.
This means that you will work within a group on specific issues/questions and report on that part of the issue/question/topic through specific assessments at the end of semester.
It could be your individual assignment or, alternatively, a group assignment.

If you want to get started in the group assignment please have a look at the specific assignments you can find on our website. Please keep in mind that you can only do part of an assignment, or choose to do the one you feel like the most interesting.
Our courses are different in size and we try to keep this so we can better support you and you are not stressed.
You should therefore take your time during the process and try to fit it in the best way possible.

At the end of each semester, we have short evaluations or feedback. As a rule we are very happy when you can do the full assignment to the best of your talents. We are even more happy when you do the evaluation afterwards. I think that it’s very important that you give us your feedback and if you like something we did, we learn from it and try to implement it next time it comes up again!

If you are not satisfied with the quality of the feedback at the moment, it’s certainly better to wait for it because we change the feedback form slightly every semester and make it more detailed. So keep in mind to do the evaluation at the end of the semester and don’t complain about any feedback you get this moment. Just get a different one next time because you have to wait two months to take your feedback from us this time.

You are also welcome to give feedback to your tutor. Your tutor will get notified of the questions being sent to the forum. The number of questions you get will be counted in that feedback.

The questions in the topics you get assessed are marked out of 20 and therefore only 8 marks are awarded. This marks are a combination of 1 mark each, out of those 8 marks per topic.
The maximum points you can award is 120 and 100 points is the maximum amount you can get for the points you get in this assessment. Please have a look at each topic

The maximum amount each student gets is 25 marks. This is calculated by adding up the points you got in the assessment. The maximum amount is therefore 10 x 25 = 250. The rest of the marks, i.e. those that didn’t get assessed, gets calculated by the average points you have taken across the whole curriculum. These questions are not marked out in any order to avoid randomness in the marks you get and therefore the scores, i.e. how many marks you get for each of the four parts of the assessment, are still quite random as well.

Please note that you should only assess the questions that you have been given an assignment for in the corresponding topic. If you have more questions than that, please get in contact with us on this subject.

The answers you get will be marked out of 20, therefore only 8 marks will be given.

The scoring system of the questions is:

"Question: Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort? Answer:  Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort?

Ans. Head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) can be the cause for severe and persistent pain and dysphagia when associated with compressive neurological symptoms and vascular hypertension. Therefore the aim of this study was to analyse if vascularisation correlates with the clinical characteristics of HNPGLs and if volumetric analysis on MRI (1.5T) is worth the effort. Data were retrospectively reviewed for a cohort of consecutive patients with clinically confirmed or histologically proven glomus jugulare tumours (GJTs) that received a 1.5 T whole body MRI with fat-suppressed 3D FLASH sequences with axial and coronal T1w, T2w and contrast enhanced T1w MR sequence (GRE).

A total of 10 (median = 64 years; range= 29 to 85 years) HNPGLs were included in the analysis. Mean tumour volume was 15.95 cm3 (SD= 8.26). In 11 out of the 10 patients that underwent surgery mean tumour volume was significantly higher (25.06 cm3, SD= 18.18) than in 9/10 patients with biopsy, suggesting that preoperative imaging parameters could be useful for the assessment of the biological behaviour of the lesion. Interestingly, the 3 largest tumours were seen in the 2 patients with an impaired neurological function (p = 0.037); they were significantly larger than the other tumours (p = 0.0027) and showed increased T2 signal intensity and diffusion restriction. Concerning vascularisation, we hypothesise that vessel density correlates with blood flow and vascular remodelling as reported in other malignant tumours [2, 3]. In this study vascularisation data were analysed only retrospectively, without direct, real time image-based evidence. Nonetheless we were able to show that high vascularisation correlates with some clinical parameters. Interestingly, the 3 tumours that are usually clinically aggressive and symptomatic and tend to overgrow during their disease course had the highest vascularisation index with an average of 14 for JUV-001, 13 for JUV-002 and 13 for JV-003 respectively.",1
"Question: Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions? Answer: 

3-D ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions?

Abstract

Background

3-D ultrasound-guided large-core needle biopsy (L-CNB) has been recommended recently as a reliable method for the preoperative diagnosis of breast lesions. However, most studies have involved only lesions seen on mammography, and the effectiveness of L-CNB for lesions detected on ultrasound, its sensitivity, and the false-negative rate during the entire clinical work-up of those lesions, which must be considered the current standard-of-care technique, are not well known. Therefore, in this study, we sought to investigate the reliability and utility of L-CNB in lesions identified on ultrasound.

Methods

From January 2006 through June 2009, 962 patients with a breast mass identified on ultrasound were referred for further diagnosis. All lesions underwent L-CNB. We defined a large tumor as a lesion with a minimum diameter of ≥4 cm. For 937 large lesions, the final histology was obtained either by palpation-guided or ultrasound-guided surgical excision.

Results

Of 962 patients, 628 were female (64.94%) and 334 men (35.06%), with a median age of 47 years (range 22 to 76 years). A total of 962 masses were biopsied and 1065 cores were produced. The largest dimension of the lesion was ≥7.5 cm for 54.3% of the masses, and a median lesion size of 5 cm (range 1 to 12 cm). Regarding localization patterns, masses were located in the upper quadrant of the breast for 61.96% of the masses, the lower quadrant for 26.5%, the central region for 6.4% and the supraclavicular region for 0.75% of the masses. We found a total of 948 negative biopsies with a benign or malignant diagnosis. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of L-CNB for ultrasound guided biopsy were 97.4 ± 0.9%, 100.0 ± 0.0%, 98.5 ± 0.5%, 100%, and 96.3 ± 0.9%, respectively, and for patients with large masses >5 cm were 100.0 ± 0.0%, 92.4 ± 2.3%, 95.7 ± 2.2%, 84.2%, and 100.0 ± 0.0%, respectively. The largest core obtained and a false-negative biopsy yielded a false-negative rate of 0.8% for patients with large masses >5 cm.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that 3-D ultrasound-guided L-CNB is a reliable tool for the preoperative histological diagnosis of breast masses >5 cm; furthermore, it has the potential of reducing the false-negative diagnostic rate in ultrasound-guided biopsy of small or medium-sized lesions. Therefore, L-CNB is an important diagnostic tool in ultrasound-guided breast biopsy because it improves the diagnostic accuracy of benign lesions and obviates a more extensive and/or repeated search for suspicious lesions in the ultrasound-guided biopsy.

INTRODUCTION

In the past 2 decades, significant advances have been made in the field of breast medicine, with breast lesion characterization now considered the first line of defense in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with suspicious lesions, as well as in the identification of breast cancer before it becomes clinically palpable. The detection of a suspicious lesion by any current method for the diagnosis of breast cancer still depends entirely on the subjective appearance of the lesion on physical examination or in the mammogram. However, recent improvements in the identification, diagnosis, and evaluation of patients with breast lesions have allowed accurate and objective evaluation and confirmation of these lesions. These improvements have allowed appropriate treatment and follow-up for a breast cancer patient without an increased rate of false-positive or false-negative findings [1, 2].

The Breast Imaging and Mammography Reporting Assessment (BI-RADS) system is a practical and efficient system with high efficiency and validity, which is accepted by international radiologist and clinicians. It facilitates the management and follow-up of patients with a suspicious finding. Based on the BI-RADS system, breast lesions are classified into groups using a numeric scale according to the likelihood that they are malignant [3]. This system involves the use of ultrasound methods to measure, locate, characterize, and observe lesions as they occur and for the evaluation of the entire lesion after the examination. Using this system as a",1
"Question: Can bone thickness and inter-radicular space affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites? Answer:  The research purpose is to evaluate (a) the effect of the thickness of bone on miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites and (b) the effect of inter-radicular space on miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites.

Response: To reduce the effects of bone thickness, use two miniscrews at two different sites. Use a longer miniscrew. Use a bone biodegradable material for the miniscrew.

Question: What causes inter-radicular space? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: The Research purpose is to determine what type of alveolar bone resorption causes the inter-radicular space and what is its mechanism? The mechanism can be related to hormones, genetics or trauma.

Response: There are three sources of inter-radicular space: 1) Bone resorption caused by the contact between implants and teeth.2) Space between the teeth caused by the contact between implant abutments and teeth.3) Bones resorption caused by trauma (crush) of teeth and sinus.

Question: Give an account of the history, literature review, and your explanation for the research you propose here. In particular, explain the scientific rationale behind such experiments.

Response: The following is the result of my research. In the case of posterior mandible, miniscrews show a superior survival rate in patients, which is about 5 years after surgery. If the space is created, the survival rate of miniscrews decreases in the late period

Question: What are you proposing to do that will contribute to the advancement of the science and art of dentistry?

Response: To reduce bone resorption and to increase the placement rate, the following should be considered: The surgical area should minimize trauma. The placement sites should be carefully selected. If an operator is well-trained and careful, the surgical site can be healed faster. Minimizing the pain of the patients during the operation should be considered. To create a space, there could be many ways such as bone spreading at sinus, creating small gap under the crown and inserting the implant on top of the crown. After surgery, the space should be filled with the biomaterial which can increase the osseointegration rate and improve the survival rate of implants.

Question: Provide an account of the historical background, research rationale and method, and conclusion drawn from the studies. In particular, explain what the significance of each study is and how it differs from the others.

Response: Following are the methods which are mainly applied to create space in posterior mandibular region bone:

Compare the functions of your own organs to those of your best friend’s and to those of your worst enemy’s. Give details.

Response: The following tables compare the function of a few organs of animal and human body. (1) The number of animal cells in the brain corresponds to the brain weight of one human being. The number of human cells in the brain corresponds to the brain weight of one chimpanzee. (2) The number of human cells in the lungs corresponds to the lung weight of one chimp. The number of human cells in the kidney is much higher than that of the human cells in the brain.5) A human is more intelligent than a chimp.

Question: Which of the following has the strongest correlation with the strength of the immune system? The number of times a parent is vaccinated has a 0.86 correlation with longevity. The percentage of men and women who exercise has a 0.74 correlation with longevity. Age at which the human body starts producing its estrogen has a correlation of 0.67 with longevity.

Response: The correlation of human life expectancy to the immune system is 0.84 (0.78 on average). The average human body makes about 7-8 billion new cells per day (0.7 x 1026 in volume). The number of human cells in the brain is on average more than 7 billion cells (3 x 1026), but less than 10 billion cells.

Reviewer \#1: The study reports whether there is a correlation between clinical selection scores and those achieved in the Medical Research Council GP assessment. The authors report that at a 5% level of significance, there is no correlation at any specific time of assessment between Clinical Selection and assessment scores. It is accepted that some GP practices have a tendency towards under-representing the white British ethnic minority group, but this is not discussed. The study is well presented with a clear hypothesis and a set of clear and cogent statistical analyses. An interesting study that clearly confirms existing data, and which provides evidence to refute the previously reported correlation.

Reviewer \#2: Dear Editor,

It is interesting to see that the authors are making the following statement: 'At a 5% level of significance', this would of course imply that at less than 5% significance level, there will be a significant association. However, I do not agree that there is evidence supporting this.

The methods should allow the reviewer to conclude with certainty that the study is soundly conducted and the outcome measured appropriately. In particular:

"Question: Does age moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients? Answer:  Does age moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients? (Please answer on a separate sheet of paper).

I believe that age and personality disorder are both moderators
in the relationship of coping style and psychiatric inpatients. In
order to establish the effect of age on personality and coping, I
performed separate ANOVA's for each measure. I determined that the
effect of personality had a greater effect than the effect of age.

For each variable, I used the following procedure for analyses.

I determined if either age or personality played a role, either
negative or positive, by performing a one way ANOVA. When a
significant effect was found, I compared the variance due to
personality versus age to find the effect of age or personality.

I then used an ANCOVA with post hoc comparisons. When a
significant effect was found, I compared the variance due to
personality versus age to find the effect of age or personality.

One way ANOVA: To determine if age has a significant effect on coping style of psychiatric inpatients, I performed separate ANOVA's for each of the three coping styles and for each personality. I decided to use separate ANOVA's for each coping subscale because it's a well known fact that there are different coping styles. (Locus of control, external, and hopelessness.) (Locus of control is my main interest, so I chose it to determine the effect of age on personality.) To simplify the results, I combined the three scores from each coping dimension into a total coping score. Then I wanted to determine if an age interaction occurred. Therefore, I wanted to know if the effect of age on coping style differs for each coping style.

One way ANOVA: When performing the One-way ANOVA, I decided to determine if age and personality had an effect on coping. I performed separate tests for each of the personality and age variable since it's known that both personality disorder and age have an effect on coping. Therefore, I wanted to determine the effect of each on the dependent variable. Because I used a One-way ANOVA, I did not find it necessary to include post hoc comparisons. However, I still chose to determine a significant effect, if any, using ANCOVA, when I found significant effect using the ANOVA.

ANCOVA: After performing the One-way ANOVA, I performed an ANCOVA to determine if any age x personality effects occurred on the coping variables. Because of the number of ANOVA analyses completed for this paper, I used the conservative Bonferonni procedure for the post hoc analysis of ANCOVATests. When using the Bonferonni procedure, you are testing significance for every one of the post hoc comparisons you made. It is considered to be a conservative procedure. This means that you get more power by only using a specific test on selected groups. The problem this method has is that because the Bonferronni test is conservative, it becomes less powerful which can create inaccurate results.

Because I had a large number of tests for the post hoc analyses, I looked for each personality and age effect using a conservative test. To accomplish this task, I used the Post Hoc Tests at the 5% level rather than the 1%. Even though I did not use the Bonferronni procedure in the post hoc analysis, I will still report all the analyses I performed.

Once both analyses were complete, I determined the effects of age and personality on coping style using a 2-step process, as follows......

After finding significance for both age and personality in a post hoc comparison in ANOVA, I determined the moderating effect of each variable using the two-step process as follows:

First, age was tested to determine if it was a moderator for the relationship between the personality and coping scores. This was done by testing whether the effect of personality on coping scores varied between subgroups of different age. In order to determine significant differences, I followed the procedures listed above. When a significant effect was found, a regression analysis (age is known, personality is unknown) was done to determine that age is the moderating effect for the relationship between personality and coping scores.

The same procedure was then performed for personality. When a significant age x personality interaction was found, a similar regression analysis (age and personality are both moderators; personality is known, age is not) was performed to determine that age is a moderator in the relationship between personality and coping.

I then used correlation for linear regression analyses for all of the age x personality moderator results. (correlation is a conservative analysis method)

All hypothesis about the relationship of age and personality and coping were:

Use at least one reference for each part of the abstract and each chapter and section of the paper---the Abstract, Background, Methods, Results, and Discussion.

Introduction
============

Uremia is closely associated with increased oxidative stress, which is caused by both an inflammatory state and the accumulation in the blood of oxidized products of the metabolism of various free radicals. These increases in oxidative stress increase the rate of deterioration by atherosclerosis and of cardiovascular disease as a complication of uremia \[[@B14]\].

The aim of this review is to discuss different aspects of the theory that autoxidation products are increased in uremic plasma, a theory with major implications for the physiopathology of the disease. Our specific purpose is to explore the theory that uremics show higher levels of oxidants, antioxidants, and oxidant-producing enzymes than controls to the point that the balance between oxidants and antioxidants is altered, triggering oxidative stress.

Lipoperoxides are found in increasing concentrations in uremia
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 1). Autoxidation of triolein in serum

During the 1970s and 1980s, it was thought, following the studies of Kontis and colleagues \[[@B34]\], that autoxidation was the main cause of lipoperoxidation. The theory of this process was based on the findings that autoxidation, catalyzed by Fe(II)-containing enzymes, generates lipid peroxides and causes the accumulation of fatty acid peroxides \[[@B19]\]. The use of triolein in vitro was the main tool to demonstrate that lipid oxidation is enhanced in uremia.

In 1989, Buechl and colleagues \[[@B5]\] established the presence of oxidative products of triolein in serum. The presence of trihydroxyhexadecatrienoic acid, trihydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid, and t-c-9,t-c-12 linoleic acid in serum was demonstrated after the addition of an oxidizing agent.

The findings were interpreted to be due to the accumulation of these compounds in uremic serum as a consequence of the increased concentration of iron in uremic serum. This interpretation was based on the use of samples from uremic patients with moderate and severe kidney disease and in a population without hematologic or hemostatic alterations, with the only difference being in the level of serum iron.

Buechl and coworkers \[[@B5]\] also reported that peroxidation of triolein under mild conditions increases in uremia. These findings led to the conclusion that uremia constitutes a state of oxidative stress and an abnormal metabolism of lipid peroxidation. A few years later, Kontis and colleagues \[[@B35]\], in an experimental study, made a similar observation: the generation of lipoperoxidation products by a process that does not require enzymatic activity and an iron-dependent auto-oxidation of triolein occurred in the first week after a rapid increase in serum creatinine levels in guinea pig. These findings raised questions about the role of iron and an iron-dependent mechanism.

Later, in vitro studies of the auto-oxidation of serum or the oxidation of unsaturated lipid fatty acids were performed. The oxidation of lipid fatty acids is mainly carried out by the enzyme lipoxygenase that is present in the cytoplasm. The presence of lipoxygenase in the cytoplasm and in the cell membrane has contributed to making the lipid auto-oxidation theory the main theory of oxidation in uremia.

HPV causes cervical and other intraepithelial neoplasms. It is often transmitted by sexual contact and is prevalent among adolescent and young adult women. Human breast milk transfers HPV to the breasts, and breast infections can be a precursor of breast and other epithelial cancers. Since breast feeding is widely advocated, it seems prudent, especially with an active infection, to screen breast milk for HPV, which is not detected in maternal blood.

Briefly: We examined a total of 38 women and found that 21 (55%) expressed HPV16 and/or HPV18, 3 women (8%) expressed HPV39 and 1 (3%) expressed HPV42 in their breast milk. We believe that with additional data analysis, it is likely that a significant proportion of women produce milk with active HPV infection and so women with active HPV infections should be counseled about breast feeding options.

In this study of breast milk, we found no HPV DNA in the breast milk of 38 women using PCR.

We detected the presence of HPV sequences in milk from 3 of 38 women as follows: HPV39 was detected in 1 milk sample from a primipara, and HPV42 was found in 1 milk sample from a multipara. We also found 2 samples with a HPV DNA load ranging from 6,564 to 6,900. One of these samples was contaminated during the testing process. Thus, 3 of 38 (8%) women were positive for HPV in their breast milk and 2 (5%) were detected at high loads. There is little published data regarding the presence of HPV in breast milk and other studies have found even less HPV sequences in human breast milk.

There is scanty data regarding the presence of HPV in human breast milk worldwide, and in Brazil, there is no such research.

What are the implications of this research for human health? These data are important for public health and for the woman and her physician to decide on a safe pregnancy plan.

Introduction

Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are double-stranded DNA viruses that can be sexually transmitted and have a relationship with epithelial neoplasms. The different types of HPV are divided into low risk and high risk. The genital types belong to high risk and cause cervical, vaginal, anal, penile, and oral penile and anal warts, which usually resolve spontaneously. In contrast, cervical intraepithelial neoplasms are generally associated with infection by specific HPV types. In addition to anogenital lesions, these viruses have been detected in other human tissues, including breast and skin cancers and they may play a role in the development of other types of cancer (1). However, it is not known how frequently these viruses are transmitted in different types of human fluid as studies are mainly focused on vaginal fluids. In this study we investigated the presence of genital and anal types of HPV in breast milk of women.

Methods

The procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Ethics Research Committee of the School of Nursing at the Federal University of Ceará, and were approved on April 29, 2009, under the protocol no. 4/2009. An informed consent was obtained from all subjects. We performed a prospective study from April to May 2009, with 38 participants of all ages, divided into 2 groups using simple randomization. All participants were volunteers and each had a normal examination at the Breast Care and Feeding Center. Group 1 consisted of pregnant women (n = 28), and group 2 composed of multiparas, postpartum, and lactating women (n = 10).

All participants underwent a breast examination, breast ultrasound, Pap smear test, and colposcopy. The breast examination was performed in a semi-reclined position, with the help of the examiner. This was a dynamic examination, with the woman in a comfortable position, where the breasts were free from clothing. Breast ultrasound was used for diagnosis of lactational and benign breast pathology. Each mother with papillomatous lesions was submitted to colposcopy to rule out the presence of an HPV lesion located in the transformation zone or any HPV lesions in the adjacent areas. Colposcopy was performed by a gynaecologist according to the recommendation of the American Center for Disease Control (see Appendix). It consisted of two phases of visualization of the lesions and the adjacent areas, and the interpretation thereof performed by a radiographer with a gynaecologist in the room (2). Patients were not vaccinated and were not using any contraceptives. This was a descriptive study conducted in the Human Milk Service, Federal University of Ceará.

The PCR technique (3) was employed to detect HPV in samples using a primer for HPV16",1

Answer: Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still matter? Surgical effort is associated with an increased rate of complications and a decrease in postoperative survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), but the survival benefits seen with maximal debulking are small, and this does not account for the impact of surgical effort. Furthermore, the benefits of cytoreductive surgery in patients with advanced ovarian cancer can in some cases be seen with less extensive surgery. The evidence that cytoreductive surgery in EOC leads to a survival benefit is from high-quality systematic reviews and is based on data from large randomized controlled trials. A single institution case-control study was performed to test the hypotheses that in patients with stage III or IV EOC and initially low-volume metastatic disease who had optimal surgical cytoreduction; (1) disease recurrence is associated with increasing volume of disease at the time of cytoreductive surgery, (2) the hazard ratio for disease recurrence associated with increasing tumor burden at time of surgery increases in a dose-response manner, and (3) survival is reduced when patients undergo high-volume cytoreductive surgery compared to low-volume surgery. This retrospective case-control study included patients identified from the Mayo Clinic in-house EOC database from January 1995 through December 2000, and was performed at two separate institutions. Patients who underwent optimal surgical cytoreduction were matched to patients who did not undergo surgery on a one-to-one basis by stage, histologic grade, age, and performance status. Matching factors were chosen to maximize the similarity of the two groups. Patients who underwent high-volume cytoreductive surgery had more advanced disease at presentation than the low-volume group (stage III, 55 vs 31% and stage IV, 36 vs 34%, respectively). The postoperative complication rate (P<0.0001), postoperative mortality rate (P=0.01), and postoperative survival (P=0.03) were all significantly worse among patients treated with high-volume cytoreductive surgery. This study demonstrates that disease recurrence is a major prognostic factor after optimal surgical cytoreduction in patients who have initially low-volume disease and is associated with increasing tumor burden. Patients with minimal or no disease at time of surgical cytoreduction will have excellent postoperative survival, regardless of the surgical effort. In patients with initially high-volume intraperitoneal disease, however, surgery is associated with poor postoperative survival with increased tumor burden. This study reveals that even ""optimal"" surgery can have deleterious effects among patients with initially high-volume disease. Patients with extensive initial intraperitoneal disease will have poor postoperative survival despite being treated with optimal perioperative chemotherapy, and the negative effects of cytoreductive surgery will not be observed until disease recurrence has already occurred. Thus, a significant proportion of the patient population at risk for EOC will never experience the survival benefits of optimal cytoreduction. These observations should be taken into account in the clinical decisions of whether to pursue surgery for patients with initially high-volume disease.

Background: Ovarian cancer is a highly morbid disease, and many patients have extensive disease at time of diagnosis. Optimal cytoreduction, the removal of all gross disease, has been a cornerstone of the management of advanced ovarian cancer and a consistent marker for survival in these patients. However, with the recent advances in surgery and the identification of chemotherapy regimens that are able to debulk some patients with advanced ovarian cancer, it is no longer clear that extensive surgery is necessary in all patients with advanced disease, and an evaluation of the role of surgery must take into account the benefits of surgery.

Methods and Materials: Patients with advanced ovarian cancer who underwent cytoreductive surgery were identified from the Mayo Clinic database of patients with ovarian cancer and were reviewed. All patients underwent maximum surgical effort at the time of cytoreductive surgery, including removal of all gross visible disease.

Results: A total of 2158 patients with ovarian cancer were identified from 1985 to",1

Question

Does topical ropivacaine reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients?

Keywords

ropivacaine (ropivacaïne)
pharyngeal (pharynx)
morbidity, morbidity, adverse drug effects

Introduction

Postoperative morbidity, e.g. dysphagia, pain, bleeding complications, nausea and vomiting, fever, infection, and bleeding disorders is a major concern of tonsillectomy procedures, with a rate of morbidity occurring in about 10-38% in different studies. The risk of these complications increases after more invasive and extensive procedures and higher body mass index. There is growing evidence that certain postoperative symptoms of tonsillectomy are caused by the postoperative pain.

In addition to general procedures in pediatric anesthesia and management of the procedure itself, the topical administration of ropivacaine into the tonsillar fossa provides pain anesthesia to the pharynx and hypopharynx (Holt R E, Fong YH, Nie H, Lin J, Shih H, Geng YA). In several studies, ropivacaine was more effective than lidocaine or lidocaine with epinephrine in the postoperative pain relief provided and in the duration of their effects. However, there was no difference between different concentrations of ropivacaine.

Objectives?

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was performed, to examine whether topical ropivacine reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity.

Methods/Design?

The study was written according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.

Eligibility criteria for considering studies for this review:

All studies regarding randomized controlled trials in humans, in accordance to PICOS (Participants: children (age not more than 18 years), Interventions: intratonsillar (intratonsillar) application of ropivacaine, Comparisons: placebo, Outcomes: postoperative pain scores, complication rates, recovery time).

Search

Two authors (RK and SW) independently examined the literature for studies on the role of intratonsillar ropivacaine in reducing the postoperative morbidity after tonsillectomy procedures. Searches were performed in the databases MEDLINE, Google scholar using keywords ""rosapivacaine,""""ropivacaine,""""posttonsillectomy,""""tonsillectomy,"" and ""complication."" A hand search of references of all identified studies was carried out. All studies on intratonsillar ropivacaine or intratonsillar and/or intraglottic or intraglottic-and-intratonsillar ropivacaine for posttonsillectomy were included.

Trial selection?

No trial included were excluded by the authors from the literature. All study results were pooled into their outcomes. Two authors (RK and SW) independently examined the literature for studies on the role of intratonsillar ropivacaine in reducing the postoperative morbidity after tonsillectomy procedures.

Data collection and assessment of methodological quality?

For each selected study, we determined the type and the methodology of the study, and whether the randomization was accomplished double or single blind, and the control group size, the number of subjects allocated to each group, and whether the study was interrupted or not.

Two authors (RK and SW) independently examined the literature for studies on the role of intratonsillar ropivacaine in reducing the postoperative morbidity after tonsillectomy procedures. For data extraction, we used an Excel sheet and recorded information such as study design, method of randomization, blinding, and the number of participants, type of operative procedure performed/not, type of intratonsillar pain medication used.

Primary and secondary outcomes?

For the primary outcome, we examined if intratonsillar ropivacaine reduced post-operative pain when compared to placebo. We also examined the postoperative complication rates and the length of the post-operative hospital stay.

Risk of bias in individual studies?

For assessing the methodological quality of the included studies, we utilized the ""Risk of bias"" tool of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions v.5.1.0 (updated 2009).",1
"Question: Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry? Answer:  Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry?



Is pain the ‘last taboo of psychiatry’, with psychiatrists still reluctant to talk and treat patients with it? We found that this question has often been posed but it is rarely answered. First published in 1995, the ‘last taboo book’ by David Clark was based on a survey published in 1991 and 1992 in the UK by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, showing that 80% of psychiatrists who responded believed that in most cases of severe mental illness pain was treated poorly (Clark, 2005). This book challenged the long-standing opinion that psychiatrists were reluctant to discuss or treat patients with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia as it was associated with a lack of insight, and led to a series of publications addressing the topic. This paper was written in response to the suggestion, then commonly made, that pain and anxiety were ‘the last taboo of psychiatry’ — that most of those with anxiety, depression or schizophrenia would be without pain and would therefore have no need for psychiatric care or treatment, and that pain is a relatively trivial health problem compared with the needs of people suffering or at risk of suicide, homicide, violence, or offending/absconding. The paper describes the evolution of mental pain/anxiety in psychiatry over the past 20–30 years, and makes the case that those suffering or at risk of suicide, homicide, harm or offending or absconding need psychiatric care and treatment for pain or anxiety. We show that, as with other medical treatments for mental illness, those receiving pharmacotherapy are substantially more likely to be taking it for pain and anxiety than those receiving ECT or psychosurgery. When the role of pain and anxiety is explored, the paper highlights some of the problems that occur if pain or anxiety issues are considered separately from the psychiatric treatment of severe mental illness. We provide further information and discussion on these issues, for example, psychiatric treatment of severe mental illness and substance misuse. We argue for an appropriate role for psychiatry in the care of the patient in pain. We also make the case why, when appropriate, anxiety and/or analgesia can be a positive therapeutic response that provides a degree of patient satisfaction and benefits both the patient and the doctor. The paper highlights many of the difficulties for the psychiatrist and the patient in treatment for severe mental illness and highlights that they are often inseparable. Finally the paper highlights that it is often the case that the psychiatrist has no choice in the matter but to take up the patient’s request for further treatment.

Introduction

Pain is a multi-faceted problem because it involves a combination of physical, psychological and social dimensions. It is a complex phenomenon, which does not exist in isolation but is part of a broad spectrum of disorders involving physical, emotional and cognitive, and social and spiritual dimensions (Freretie, 1995; Gorman & Fox, 2010; Mora & Mora, 2010). Whilst pain is generally regarded by clinicians as the most urgent concern for patients, it is often seen as a relatively minor problem by the patients themselves, sometimes described as the ‘last taboo of psychiatry’ (Bennett, 2005; Geddes et al., 2012b; Freeman & Cooper, 2007). It is recognised that there are complex interactions between pain and psychiatric illness (Maddox, 1996).

As a condition in its own right, pain is associated with a wide spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses including anxiety disorders, depression, personality disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, etc. Pain can be the basis for referral but pain problems cannot often be disentangled from other psychiatric symptoms, with the two often associated (Harrison et al., 2007; O’Shea et al., 2011).

Mental illness is recognised as an enormously prevalent condition, but there is no indication that it is equally prevalent in relation to pain and there is some evidence that mental health services are less readily available in relation to the needs of persons who have pain (Harrison et al., 2007; NICE, 2011).

The evidence regarding how psychiatric services, and psychiatry, deal with pain is limited. It is, however, recognised that psychiatric health professionals are sometimes reluctant to treat pain because of perceived difficulties in diagnosis and treating mental illness (Freeman & Cooper, 2007).

We have suggested that it is not so clear who, or how, has the more serious problem.

The first part of this paper sets out the position in general psychiatry in the past and present with regard to the treatment of patients who may have both, or one or the other of them.

The next part of the paper describes how in the UK the Royal College of Psychiatrists commissioned a series of surveys to try to find out about the prevalence of pain and the way in which it",1
"Question: Does concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence? Answer: Does concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question.

Anterior wall prolapse of the uterine cervix is a common problem in the aging female population and is usually treated by either an abdominal or vaginal approach. A transvaginal approach is usually preferred over an abdominal approach for concomitant treatment of anterior vaginal wall prolapse and concomitant stress urinary incontinence and is associated with significantly lower rates of recurrence, lower complication rates, and lower costs.[@b1-asm-2-191] This is probably due to the avoidance of an abdominal, more morbid operation. However, transvaginal surgery cannot be used for women with a previous abdominal operation. For years, open abdominal procedures were considered the gold standard for the treatment of uterine prolapse, the most common repair technique being the Burch colposuspension. However, transvaginal colposuspension is an accepted and reliable alternative to the Burch procedure. The purpose of this report is to describe our experience with combined anterior vaginal and anterior uterine colposuspension in patients with concomitant uterine prolapse and stress urinary incontinence performed as a staged procedure. A retrospective case series design is used to describe our technique.

Methods
=======

The records of patients who underwent anterior colposuspension with concomitant anterior repair for anterior wall prolapse and stress urinary incontinence from May 1998 to January 2004 were reviewed. Data collected included age, parity, preoperative symptoms, bladder-filling and postoperative complications and results. The procedure is performed in patients with anterior vaginal wall prolapse and stress urinary incontinence associated with an anterior cervix descent of greater than 2.5 cm.[@b2-asm-2-191]

In our procedure, a cystoscopy is performed to identify the presence of bladder neck stenosis. A 1.5-cm to 2.0-cm area of the bladder is incised laterally for exposure of the vagina and anterior pelvic wall. A U-shaped incision is made in the anterior vaginal wall, using a Kelly clamp, starting 2 cm from the urethral meatus. The avascular anterior vaginal wall is elevated and dissected free of attachments to the perineum. Next, it is incised with a No. 10 scalpel and the anterior wall prolapse visualized and dissected free. If the posterior perineal body is adherent to the prolapse, the perineal structures are released, and the urethra is identified; then, the anterior vaginal wall is repaired. The anterior perineal body is elevated off the sacrospinous ligament and a suspension suture, which is placed, and the two limbs are brought together and tied, and the urethra is closed. If the posterior perineal body is adherent and the bladder neck and urethra are not visible, the posterior perineal body is elevated, and the suspension suture, which holds the two suture limbs of the anterior colporrhaphy is placed, the bladder base is examined, and the bladder is opened. A vaginal and abdominal colposuspension is then performed. A perineal body hitch is placed on vaginal reconstruction. Two sutures are placed on the vaginal wall in an inverted crossed fashion. The two suture ends are passed through subcutaneous fat, and the skin is closed in a running manner. Bladder neck suspension is performed later. A U-shaped incision about 1.5 cm in size is made between the symphysis, the anterior fornix, and the urethra. Two running sutures tied with polypropylene are inserted. The urethral edges are closed with one suture per side. The sutures are tied on both sides of the urethra. The subcutaneous tissues are then closed, and the two perineal sutures are placed, followed by placement of a figure of eight grasper. Bladder neck suspension is performed with two 1.0-mm (Gore) or 2.0-mm (Marlex) tensioned nonabsorbable sutures placed as usual. All vaginal sutures are buried on the abdominal side, and if they are tied, buried at the same time as the bladder neck sutures and the vaginal sutures. The perineal body hitch in the posterior region is placed on vaginal reconstruction.

Between May 1998 and January 2004, a series of 19 patients underwent a combined abdominal and vaginal operation for anterior uterine and anterior vaginal wall prolapse with concomitant stress urinary incontinence. The mean age of the",1
"Question: Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression result in cost savings? Answer:  “Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression result in cost savings?” Using appropriate and well-reported sources, evidence should be provided that demonstrates that atypical antipsychotics are cost-effective in a specific healthcare setting. Appropriate research questions address which group of patients respond to which drug and by how much. The abstract should include three specific hypotheses and a description of the study’s methodology (inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design, sample size, analysis plan, and primary outcome measures). The primary outcome measures should be measures of patients’ health-related quality of life and/or health-care resource utilization, rather than economic measures.

Answer:

To answer this question we begin by examining the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics as adjunct treatments for depression. In a meta-analysis that synthesized the results from over 20 RCTs testing the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotics (ADMs) for depression, ADMs are associated with a larger reduction in depressive symptoms than placebo at short-term follow-up (2-8 weeks) and at mid-term follow-up (6-12 months), and showed significantly greater durability of the antidepressant effect. ADMs also had a significantly smaller effect on the risk of clinically significant adverse events than placebo did, although the absolute likelihood of an adverse event requiring discontinuation of a long-term therapy is still relatively large. This study did not report any economic benefits of ADMs in the studies they reviewed. (2)

We then examine the cost benefits of ADMs in the context of treatment algorithms, which are organized strategies used to address a population who fail in initial treatment with a single agent. The cost-effectiveness studies of antidepressants and the evidence-based management in the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest the use of ADMs. It is common practice for clinicians treating patients who have failed to adequately respond to first-line antidepressants and who lack co-morbid conditions or major suicide risk factors, to add an ADM. This may include a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NARI), or both. There are currently four ADMs on the market that are approved as adjunctive treatments for depression. Although some clinicians would be surprised to come across a patient who responded sufficiently well to treatment in a single, first-line agent and subsequently refused treatment, this does happen, so clinicians need to be aware of the availability of adjunctive ADMs, as well as other treatment options. (3,4)

Given the cost of ADMs and the potential for benefits above placebo, it is important to recognize not only their efficacy in patients who fail to respond to SSRIs, but also their potential safety. Adjunctive ADMs are generally considered safe and well tolerated. In placebo-controlled studies, atypical antipsychotics were found to induce a number of common, transient adverse events, including somnolence, weight gain and increased appetite, movement disorders, and hypersalivation. These are similar to those encountered in patients treated only with antidepressants. Therefore, they must be expected as potential adverse events when combined with an antidepressant or other medications. Serious, life-threatening adverse events associated specifically with the ADMs used in this review include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) (e.g., Parkinson’s-like movements, akathisia), the metabolic syndrome (e.g., hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, weight gain), and cerebrovascular adverse events. (5-7) Importantly, while these serious adverse events are rare, they must be detected and managed because if the diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening condition is missed, irreversible damage to the brain may occur. (8)

As with the SSRIs, clinicians should assess each patient on their comorbid conditions and risk factors. For example, weight gain and the metabolic syndrome are concerns in patients with a history of type II diabetes, as well as those who are actively taking antidiabetic medications. Similarly, patients with a significant medical history of cardiac disease (e.g., ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular disease (e.g., transient ischemic attacks, stroke), or a history of seizures should be screened for the metabolic syndrome prior to starting any ADM, and all risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., hypertension, smoking) should be treated and monitored closely. In the population who experience a metabolic rebound (i.e., weight gain and metabolic syndrome), clinicians are faced with two equally effective alternative pharmacotherapies — a short-",1
"Question: Can patients be anticoagulated after intracerebral hemorrhage? Answer:  Can patients be anticoagulated after intracerebral hemorrhage?

Introduction

In patients who have had a stroke anticoagulation is the standard. For patients who have had a large cerebellar hemorrhage anticoagulation is considered in certain subgroups but remains controversial.

Patients who have had a traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) anticoagulation is often an issue. In addition to the size of the hematoma, the location of the hematoma in the brain is also an important factor. For patients who have an ICH in eloquent zones such as the insula, thalamus, basal ganglia or internal capsule the risk of hematoma growth is substantially increased resulting in increased risk of death.1 In the past the question whether anticoagulation is useful or not in these patients was left to the discretion of the treating physician. With currently available therapies the bleeding risk is lower compared to old therapies. We suggest patients who have had an intracerebral hemorrhage should be anti-coagulated with heparins unless they have a hematoma in the insula.2, 3

Case

Mr. White is a 41 year old male presented to the ER following the sudden onset of left leg pain. His history included hypertension and an episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage 1 year after his right leg fracture. Brain imaging was normal. One year ago he reported right leg weakness. His neurologic examination revealed 4th left-sided cranial nerve palsies, an areflexic right leg and loss of the Babinski reflex. An MRI of the brain with and without contrast was performed which showed an old acute left cerebellar subarachnoid hemorrhage. Due to the subarachnoid hemorrhage, the patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with dabigatran. Mr. White had an acute onset of left leg pain without the history of trauma and also without a focal deficit, however, left leg dysmetria and a decreased patella tendon reflex were present. Mr. White was subsequently started on an antiplatelet regimen and a short teriparatide therapy at a dose of 20,000 μg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Mr. White was seen in the follow up clinic 1½ year following his admission and complained that he had an intermittent worsening of his symptoms. He complained of worsening weakness, and numbness and tingling in his left leg. Mr. White was concerned about further deterioration of his leg and requested a second opinion. Mr. White was referred to a neurologist at a specialty neuroscience center to evaluate him. The patient was started on dabigatran therapy again.

Mr. White’s past history included hypertension and recurrent episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage from a previous right leg fracture. The episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage resolved with a single episode of anticoagulation therapy with dabigatran. Mr. White reported no history of bleeding problems in the past and no significant family history of bleeding disorders.

Imaging

We performed further neurodiagnostic evaluations. A computed tomography (CT) of the brain demonstrated a focus of hypodensity along the superior margin of the pons that represented an old hemorrhage, a new cerebellar subarachnoid hemorrhage and a right transverse venous sinus thrombosis (Figure 1). There was no significant shift of the midline. CT angiography demonstrated a right transverse venous thrombosis and a small right internal carotid artery and right internal jugular vein thrombosis as previously reported. The old hemorrhage and the right cerebellar subarachnoid hemorrhage were re-evaluated on CT images performed 1 year earlier.

The size of the old cerebellar hemorrhage was 5.6 mm and had slightly enlarged over the year. There was now an additional subarachnoid hemorrhage along the superior margin of the brainstem and the pons in a location that was more caudal than the area of hemorrhage that had been previously observed. These findings on repeat CT images corresponded to areas of increased hypointensity on the T2-weighted images of MRI obtained 3 weeks earlier (Figure 2).

"Question: Diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy: is dilatation of ureteral meatus always necessary? Answer: . You should provide information on a) a detailed history of your patients symptoms and b) the work-up used prior to therapeutic ureteroscopy.

Clinician: I am sure that dilatation of the renal pelvis and the urinary tract is a prerequisite for the ureteroscopy in case of ureterolithiasis, as it is for the endoscopic treatment of the ureter in renal obstruction. What is the current state of current practices for this? Is there an evidence based consensus? It seems to me that dilatation of the renal pelvis and urinary tract may be a harmful measure in terms of ureteral edema, which is harmful for the endoscopic treatment of the ureter.

Surgeon: The current standard is the endoscopic treatment of all cases of calculi of the ureter, whether they are renal or upper ureteral. If there is a calculous stricture in the ureter, this stricture will be dilatated by using a balloon dilator. I don't believe we have reached any consensus regarding dilatation of the strictured segment of the ureter. This is still in a developing phase and many controversies are being discussed. This is one of the areas which is in the spotlight at present and much research is being done. From our clinical experience in cases of ureteral strictures, we believe that our endoscopic intervention will be successful in all cases.

Question: From my point of view, after a diagnostic ureteroscopy for the clearance of the ureter, what are the risks for complications for the treatment of a ureteral stenosis, a neoplasm, etc.?

Surgeon: Endoscopic treatment of ureteral stenoses and neoplasms has become an established minimally invasive treatment method. I think there is a slight risk of ureteral damage during therapeutic ureteroscopy. The first step in managing strictures is to place a balloon dilator prior to the endoscopic treatment. Then, if this is not effective, a ureteral stent will be placed which will become covered by the urothelium, which is more resistant to trauma. The next step is an endoscopic ureteral segmental resection. The main benefits are avoidance of morbidity of a stent or surgery, reduced treatment time, lower incidence of perioperative complications. It is more a safe and minimally invasive method. Some risks may include bleeding and seeding of the malignant ureteral cell, which is a known risk for both upper and lower ureter strictures.

Question: I think that dilatation of the ureteral meatus is indispensable for the treatment of lower ureteral stones? Is it possible to dilate the ureter in a retrograde manner? Or it is a requirement that a guide wire is left in the working channel (deterioration of the situation)?

Surgeon: With regard to the dilatation of the urinary tract, you should be careful that you don't dilate beyond the stricture. You should place a balloon dilator and dilate the stricture only to the appropriate diameter. In cases of ureteral strictures you should dilate the stricture at least to the 5 mm diameter and in more advanced cases you should dilate the stricture at 10-16 mm diameter. So I think that dilatation is a very necessary and safe step before the endoscopic treatment. With regard to retrograde dilatation of a ureter, this can be dangerous in cases of severe urinary obstruction. To our knowledge there is no experience in retrograde dilatation. I am aware that there is some ongoing research on this method in this area, but there is some risk of damage to the ureter. If the stricture is located in the distal ureter, retrograde dilation can be done if the calculus is already localized. In this case the ureteroscopy is performed on the antegrade approach, which is a little difficult and may be more demanding.

Question: What is the current experience in ureteroscopy for a single stone in the upper ureter? Could you refer to some reports on the effectiveness of this method?

Surgeon: Single stone endourological interventions are very frequent in urologists' practice and are performed for various indications like single symptomatic uric calculi, in case of ureteral calculus, renal stone, strictures of the upper ureter, in the case of a huge stone in the ipsilateral ureter (incomplete stone free rate after endourological treatment).

Abstract

Background: Low-income persons often identify their usual source of care later in the year. Recent federal policy has sought to expand the availability of primary care within the U.S. Medicaid system, specifically through use of Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs), but little research has evaluated the long-term impact of CMHC use on low-income patients' use of their usual source of care compared to usual care.

Methods: In 2006, California implemented a Medicaid reform that includes provisions for CMHCs and increased the number of available specialty care providers through contracting with private health plans. Using information from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) and propensity score methods, we examine whether use of CMHCs is associated with increased odds of identifying a usual source of care compared to patients who did not have a CMHC contract.

Results: We find a significant increase in the likelihood of identifying a usual source of care among low-income subjects with CMHCs (OR=6.17, p<0.01) compared to low-income subjects without such plans.

Summary/Conclusions: These results show that use of CMHCs is associated with a small increase in the probability of low-income patients identifying a usual source of care.

INTRODUCTION

During the twentieth century, health systems in the U.S. and western Europe were transformed into systems that made acute, but not long-term, illness more readily amenable to treatment.1 As health systems evolved over time, the nature of primary care shifted dramatically. Initially, primary care was thought of as a means leading to improved quality of care. With the emergence of managed care, however, the focus shifted to efficiency as primary care shifted increasingly towards delivery system control.2,3 Despite the move towards more efficient care delivery systems, primary care services were often insufficient in meeting the health needs of many patients and thus, there still exists an unmet demand for primary care services.4,5

The Affordable Care Act of 2010 contains provisions that aim to increase the availability and provision of primary care within the U.S. Medicaid system by establishing new CMHCs, increasing the number of specialty care providers (SCPs), and improving referral processes.6 Specifically, Section 1402 of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), entitled “Community Mental Health Centers,” calls for the creation of seven CMHCs by 2014 who will provide community-based mental health services to low-income, uninsured patients to prevent hospitalization.6 Section 1403 would expand the number of physicians and psychologists authorized to charge Medicaid fee-for-service on a capitated basis, and Section 1405 would enable health plans to contract with providers to reduce the administrative burden associated with providing mental health services.6,7 The purpose of this report is to extend the research on the impact of CMHCs on the use of primary care services by low-income persons into the longer term to help assess the impact of federal policy changes of this nature on the delivery of primary care services. Specifically, we evaluate whether use of CMHCs is associated with increases in the probability patients identify their usual source of care. In particular, our research will look at whether use of CMHCs is associated with the identification of their usual source of care in the three years following the year in which the CMHC contracts were in effect.

While the use of CMHCs is a novel and potentially effective means to improve the use of primary care services for low-income persons, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence on the impact of CMHCs and the ACA. One notable exception comes from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment,8 which found that CMHC patients, compared to those served by usual source of care providers, were significantly less likely to see a physician in the year following entry into the study and significantly less likely to report a primary care problem (p<0.01). Thus, the results of the RAND study confirm the finding from earlier research that CMHC members are less likely to use primary care services.8 However, the RAND study, to which no response was provided by the authors, did not evaluate the possibility of a causal link between the use of CMHCs and primary care use and thus, it does not determine the impact of the CMHC intervention on the use of primary care services.8 As mentioned above, the ACA contains provisions that could potentially improve the use of primary care services, including CM",1
"Question: Knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation: are they related in Parkinson's disease? Answer:  Knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation: are they related in Parkinson's disease?

Response: The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments and for the excellent commentary in this important area of neurologic rehabilitation research. The response to their review will be succinct as this topic is one of paramount importance in rehabilitation care of PWP. We are certain that the readers will appreciate our comments below.

The objective of this review therefore was to investigate whether knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation are related in Parkinson's disease (PD). The search terms used included *Parkinson\** or *Mountain\**; *strength\** or *extension*; *functioning\** or *function*; *ambul\** or *mobility*. We found 3 RCT's related to this. We used the PRISMA guidelines to search 3 electronic databases (*MEDLINE* via *PubMed*, *Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health* via *Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Science*, and *Web of Science* via *Thomson Web*) as well as 3 bibliographies (*Movement Disorder Society*, *Journal of Parkinson's Disease*, and *Neurology*). The last electronic search was held in November 2014. Included were studies of people with PD comparing (1) knee extensor (KE) strength of *extensor* and *flexor* muscles, (2) dynamic stability performance of limbs during knee extensor performance (3) function ambulation measured by the 6 meter walk test versus 10 meter walk test vs 20 meter walk test or 3-meter gait speed walk versus 7-meter walk and (4) outcomes related to walking on a treadmill versus overground walking vs community ambulation. Excluded were (1) studies of participants with stroke, dementia, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury; or (2) trials of participants with PWP that involved exercises or protocols designed to improve function of the knee to include osteotomy, arthroscopy, meniscectomy or any other procedures other than strengthening and stretching of the KE muscles. A total of 7 studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review. We had excluded all abstracts that seemed relevant but of whom we could not locate further data on the internet/library.

The purpose of our review is to ascertain if in PWP, function and activity are related in the 3 ways of assessing dynamic stability, functional ambulation and knee extensor strength. Each area of function has a specific relationship, although some areas impact or affect all of the others. An example would be the relationship between knee extensor strength and stability because strengthening the knee would be expected to enhance stability. Our literature search and review found that the area of function tested varied widely in the 7 studies. The type of function investigated varied from gait stability, gait endurance, performance, community ambulation, balance, and physical fitness. The results of the review showed some evidence of positive relationships between KE strength and the 3 areas of function, but the numbers of studies comparing the results were small so meaningful conclusions could not be made. The majority of studies investigated static stability based upon the outcome of an instability test (*e.g.*, limits of stability), with only 2 studies investigating dynamic stability in a manner that would allow comparisons with our 3 function areas (*e.g.*, walking speed, timed measures). We therefore conclude in PWP, KE strength is modestly related to static and dynamic stability, with evidence that gait speed and performance measures (timed up and downs, timed gait, and community ambulation) are related to KE strength. Additionally, based upon the few studies that investigated community ambulation, individuals with greater KE strength appear to be more competent for community ambulation (Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type=""table""}).Table 1Studies investigating knee extensor strength (KES) and functionStudyYearParticipantsnAge (years)Gender (m/f)Control groupTested (time point)Test used for outcome assessmentOther relationships tested?Kes strengthKES and \> KES-dependent outcomesResultsCabrera et al. \[[@CR15]\]2009PD10175.8917/3416.8-17.4TUG, GDS, GSE, BBS, T-UPPP, FAB, MMSE, BAI, PPSP, TAS, GSE, BAI, SS, GSE, BAI, PPSP, TAS, GSE, BAI, SS, ADL↑KES, ↑GSE, ↓TUG (*p* \< 0.001), GDS",1

As with all great discoveries, early detection saves lives. Early breast cancer is no less than a miracle in its efficacy, as cancers like yours are sometimes detected at the site of a single non-palpable tumor, leading to a clear and life-saving surgery.

The challenge is that early breast cancer is just the beginning, and with today’s current approaches, early intervention in the form of systemic therapy often fails to reduce mortality, as metastases can quickly overtake early tumors in the body. With so much at stake, new treatments are needed.

A clinical trial with promising results is currently being developed at the Medical College of Georgia at the Augusta University. The experimental therapy is based on the new concept of immunotherapy, which is the use of our own T-cells – our body’s own “cytokines” – to eliminate cancer. Read More",1
"Question: Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome? Answer:  “Can folic acid reduce the risk of CHDs seen in children with Down syndrome?""

A: The Answer: Folic acid can help prevent serious congenital heart disease, especially tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy of Fallot is the abnormal development of four of the five heart chambers. Folic acid is a well-established cause of this type of heart defect.

Tetralogy of Fallot occurs when the blood flowing into the right ventrical has low oxygen levels (hypoxia) and develops. When the flow of blood into the left ventrical isn’t normal during heart development, this type of heart disease develops.

If you have this type of defect, your risk of developing serious heart defects increases. A heart defect such as this must be repaired by a surgeon when an infant is born or very soon after birth. If you deliver a baby with this heart defect before 40 weeks of pregnancy, this type of defect will not be repaired and left untreated.

In general, these babies will have heart problems as they grow older. The main problem is that a part of a baby’s heart can’t function after birth and can’t heal, causing the child to have heart problems throughout his or her lifetime. This type of heart defect occurs in about 10 to 20 children with Down syndrome per 1,000 live births.

This problem can be treated, and most of the babies with this heart defect have a good quality of life.

When people are discussing Down syndrome in relation to heart defects, their questions are usually focused in two areas:

1. Are there heart defects more commonly in children who have Down syndrome?

The Answer: When people with Down syndrome are born, they are more likely to suffer from heart conditions. A review of the world literature showed that heart defects are seen at birth in 10 to 20 percent of children born with Down syndrome. Half of these children will live long enough to undergo surgery, which usually happens around 2 years of age.

2. Can folic acid reduce the risk of CHDs seen in children with Down syndrome?

The Answer: In most cases, folic acid supplementation in children with either normal or low levels of maternal folate can reduce the risk of CHDs by about 40 to 50 percent. However, the level used in clinical trials was much lower than what is present in our recommended daily allowance.

A third of children with Down syndrome are born with a heart defect called tetralogy of Fallot, an abnormal development of all four chambers of the heart.

"Question: Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba? Answer:  Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba?
The francophone population in Manitoba grows steadily and the number of francophones is increasing as a result of the province's immigration policy and more recent immigrants choosing to live in the province. The province offers francophone immigrants, their families and those who already live in the province a choice of over 140 programs and services including education, health care, recreation, business, and employment. However, immigrants to Canada have different cultural and economic needs that can change as their needs advance in their life cycle. To help francophone and non-francophone immigrants and their families to make informed choices and be involved in programs and services offered to francophone and non-francophone populations in Manitoba, the Province of Manitoba commissioned a project titled ""Engendering Francophone Mental Health."" In this report the results of the project ""Engendering Francophone Mental Health"" are presented and the key objectives to have been accomplished.

This project will be written as an abstract for scientific journal.

Answer: Yes, there are mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba! Differences in the mental health of Quebecers and non-Quebecers may exist, and in Manitoba this need not be the case.
Studies of ethnic mental health differences in Quebec, as well as mental health studies in general, has been an ongoing debate since the first large scale epidemiological studies that examined differences in mental health among various racial groups began in the mid-1970s in Montreal. Studies using various types of mental health measures have shown that non-Quebecer ethnic minority groups have higher rates of mental disorders than the general population, but there is an ongoing debate about whether these differences are due to the higher incidence of the disorders in the general population or due to an increased prevalence in the minority groups. For example, data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (1997) showed that the rates of the five most common mental disorders reported by youth (anxiety disorders, mood disorders/affective disorders, eating disorders, alcohol/drug misuse, and psychotic disorders) were highest among visible minorities of any ethnic origin in Canada, when compared to the rates reported by the general population. Additionally, the rates were increased across ethnic groups when compared to the British Caucasian population (Canadian Community Health Survey; Mental Health (1997): Frequencies from the General Social Survey). The study also showed that youth with any mental disorder had a higher mean total score on measures of social and emotional functioning, compared to youth in the overall population that had no mental disorder (Canadian Community Health Survey).
Several theories regarding the factors contributing to higher rates for ethnic minority groups have been developed. One of the more prominent explanations for ethnic mental health differences is the so-called double-edged problem of acculturation. An American study looked at the hypothesis that immigrant populations that adapt and adopt some of the values, beliefs, or practices of the culture in which they reside are more likely to have lower rates of mental disorders and better mental health compared to those who acculturate and do not adopt these values (Watkins, et al., 1999). Another explanation for the differences in the incidence of mental disorders between the majority and immigrant groups is that the rates of mental disorders in immigrant populations may be higher, especially for those that are first generation immigrants. There are many factors that differ between the first generation immigrant community and the host society, including language and lack of knowledge on mental health issues. First generation immigrants usually arrive with a lot of pressure and often have limited language skills, which may cause a decline in their self confidence, social support, and the quality and quantity of interpersonal relationships, thus leading to higher rates and more severity of mental disorders within the immigrant community (Eberhart-Phillips, et al., 2003).
These previous studies highlight the complexity of developing policies and interventions to address the mental health differences for non-residents with mental health issues and to support non-residents as they begin to adjust to life in the host society. However, it is important to make sure that the people who provide help and support to the community are culturally competent, because their knowledge and attitudes regarding mental health can greatly affect their ability to respond and deal with issues such as mental disorders or problems in a fair manner. To combat the negative image of mental health professionals towards mental health care, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association (APA and APA) have worked together to introduce a mental health competency in all mental health providers and continue to offer mental health awareness training to the general public.

In addition to the double edge of acculturation in the literature there is evidence, however, that immigration, despite the pressures of acculturation, results in substantial improvement of immigrants health in the United States over time (e.g., U",1
"Question: Does type 1 diabetes mellitus affect Achilles tendon response to a 10 km run? Answer:  Does type 1 diabetes mellitus affect Achilles tendon response to a 10 km run? The author should describe the hypothesis of the study, its design, the methods used to conduct the investigation (ie, the procedures undertaken, samples collected, data collected, statistical and analytical methods, and methods of reproducing the research), and the findings of the study (the results, methods, processes, conditions and factors, conclusions and implications, and implications for future research). For more information on writing a scientific abstract (with example), see the ASA Publication Manual.

ANSWER: The question is a little too broad to easily answer. It’s pretty clear that running causes some sort of damage to the Achilles tendon. To your question, it depends how much damage that the Achilles tendon experiences. Because, what I have seen in my years of practice, is that each individual has a specific Achilles tendon that can adapt and respond to exercise differently. Some can have minimal damage and others can have fairly significant damage.

Some people will end up tearing their Achilles tendon. The way we approach the question is to first define a problem, the definition of a problem is a question you haven’t been able to answer or your question is too broad.

When we ask the question, do people with T1D experience Achilles tendon damage when running, the answer is, yes, there is a possibility that they may experience damage.

How we should approach the question is to develop a hypothesis first. A hypothesis is the answer of the question, it’s what the problem is. That’s where I would start – I’d research how the Achilles tendon responds to exercise in people without T1D and then do the same in people who have T1D. Then, I would compare the two. I’d do this in people who were very experienced runners (in fact, I have ran 5 marathons myself). I’m also doing this work on the treadmill because that way people can experience the same workout. They run for five miles on the treadmill, then I’d measure the forces they produce at the insertion of every single step.

This is what I’m doing now. I’ve got some of the results of my work and I’ll include those results in the abstract, although, you as the writer or reader will need to understand that these results are still in the early stages (and there’s quite a bit more I want to do) before we can make any definitive conclusions. I’m just starting and I’m really excited about this topic.

I’m planning on doing a follow up survey at the end of the 5th marathon.

The other main problem that we have when we are asked about Achilles tendon response to exercise, there’s too much information to put into that short a time. You need to be able to answer that question for yourself. Where did you find that information? Is the information correct?

I’m in the same boat as you, in that I’ve been asked questions about Achilles tendon response to exercise in people with T1D and haven’t found anything definitive that says that that’s a problem.

I’m starting a new project that might be useful to you and others of the same kind I am, but, it’s going to be a little more than finding a study or two. I’m going to create a database and try to answer some of these questions.

Please be careful as to what you post to the forums. Forum posts are generally monitored regularly so that moderators can catch inappropriate, harmful, and derogatory subject matter. We'll edit the post and/or take action to delete the post as appropriate so your topic won't be visible to all.

I agree that that is not a well-defined question. I was thinking more of a hypothesis. I think with Achilles tendons, it would be helpful to know what a healthy Achilles tendon looks like? Are there studies of healthy Achilles tendons and then with a specific activity such as running, how does it look? I am not sure how to proceed with a hypothesis but I think a specific idea of what is wrong may help with the answer.

A study group consisting of a pathologist, a toxicologist, a sports nutritionist, and a coach conducted an evaluation of the dietary needs of athletes to improve performance. In the course of their evaluation, they found that athletes who were athletes but train poorly should not consume an excessive protein intake. Specifically, the research showed that athletes who are active but not training hard for extended periods of time and who were found to be deficient in certain vitamins and minerals can achieve performance enhancement by ingesting supplements containing those vitamins and minerals. The study group found that athletes who were not exercising or training hard should not consume a high protein intake, based upon the study they conducted. Specifically, the group showed that athletes who consistently eat a normal diet (i.e. that include a balanced diet composed of carbohydrates, protein, and fat) can achieve performance enhancement by ingesting supplemental protein.

"Question: Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures? Answer:  Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures? Be concise (no more than one page) and cover the content necessary to answer the question. Focus is on design and biomechanics.

Answer: While we can always improve, THA cup design provides excellent initial stability. When the cup is oversized as compared with the femoral head and the femoral neck, we are unable to completely prevent the femoral head from impacting the polyethylene liner at the end of the trial, if not already in place, and thus the initial stability provided by the cup may be diminished. This can occur with the femoral head and the cemented polyethylene liner positioned at the same anteversion as the acetabular cup. With an acetabular cup malpositioned or without cement fixation, the end of the trial, where the hip joint is not constrained by bone, allows increased motion of impact between the inner surface of the polyethylene liner and the head, and the impact produces a significant deformation of the liner. This creates the potential for early wear and liner fracture.

A study by the University of Chicago showed that THA performed on patients with osteopenia have a 30-year survivorship of only 49.5% (95% CI 33.8-66). The average number of years lived with THA in that same group was 5.6, significantly less than the 10.2 years lived with THA in the control group. Another study reported a 32.5% reduction in revision for loosening and a 41.7% decrease in revisions for infection when THA was compared with conservative treatment of displaced acetabular fractures using the same method of fixation.[@bib7] If cement was placed within the hip during the index trial fixation for these fractures, a femoral head larger as compared with the femoral head--neck junction (1.5 cm smaller for the 32-mm femoral head) in the standard and the extended cups would require impaction of a larger amount of cement. An oversized femoral head could be expected to move the polyethylene liner forward, increasing the potential to decrease the initial stability of fixation. This increased pressure between the acetabulum and the liner could affect the potential for cementation of a large-diameter femoral head and further loosen fixation.[@bib1] If cement is not placed in the hip during acetabular fracture fixation, the femoral head is larger and does not have to be impacted to achieve stability.

Surgical positioning of the acetabular cup also has a direct effect on acetabular fixation. A surgeon may position the acetabular cup in any fashion, including parallel to the neck, laterally, medially, or posteriorly.[@bib1] If this is the surgeon's intent, then the femoral head is impacted in any position. When we consider the cup size, a 30-mm head has a smaller diameter, with the outer surface being 1.5, 1.25, or even 1.125 mm larger or smaller than the femoral head, depending on the shape of the outer surface of the head. The larger and less common femoral heads (≥31 mm) also might have impact on the initial stability; however, the difference in the outer diameter is larger than the impact of the acetabular cup to the femur. If a 26-mm head is impacted in the position with the larger diameter against the larger diameter of the acetabular cup, the force vector would not be parallel, but would be skewed forward of the cup plane. This skew would increase the potential for contact between the inner surface of the liner and the head rather than the outer surface of the acetabular cup, but even then, the head would be constrained from contacting the liner against the inner surface of the polyethylene liner with a 32-mm polyethylene cup. The potential for liner fracture and failure therefore would be higher with an oversized femoral head in a standard cup than with a femoral head in any position, with a large difference between an impacted 26-mm head and an impacted 40-mm head. When the femoral head is impacted in the position parallel to the plane of the acetabular cup, a smaller difference might occur because of contact between the outer surface or rim of the liner and the outer surface of the acetabular cup. However, as seen in Figures 5 (panel D) and 8 (panel D) of Nardelli et al,[@bib6] the femoral head is impacted with the polyethylene liner in this position because the head and the cemented liner position at the same anteversion.

"Question: Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: are we operating too late? Answer:  Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: are we operating too late?

We are aware that we are operating on a patient population who represent the most difficult decision in valvular interventions. At our institution, most patients who undergo pulmonary valve replacement in the first two decades of life have right ventricle to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduit. Many of these patients are at increased risk for reoperation on the conduit (eg, conduit failure, conduit degeneration, or late reoperation, with an additional valve procedure). In contrast, we were fortunate to retain most patients in our adult patient population. The majority of these late-to-midadults who are candidates for reoperation on the pulmonary valve have a tricuspid valve lesion with RV-PA conduit or a history of pulmonary valve replacement at a different time point (ie, early adolescence).^[@bib1]--[@bib4]^ We have chosen to perform pulmonary valve replacement in this older adult population with a long life expectancy and an increased chance for late reoperation. We are also aware of similar patient populations at other institutions.

As with all cardiac surgeries, pulmonary valve replacement with conduits is associated with a potentially important risk of an adverse outcome (eg, postoperative death, need for heart transplantation) after successful intervention. The most important risk of late valve reoperation in the cohort of adults who experience this complication is postoperative death. However, in patients who have experienced an adverse outcome, other long-term and short-term risks could become more important. We hypothesized that we could alter outcomes for all these patients as a result of the intervention by changing our practice pattern with respect to timing of the intervention.

We sought to determine if we could achieve a better outcome for patients with a history of pulmonary valve replacement by waiting until adulthood to perform the intervention. We sought to demonstrate that early intervention is more effective than waiting until adulthood with respect to mortality, need for reoperation, and development of severe aortic and mitral regurgitation (AR and MR, respectively). In these patients, if one considers that the risk of post-RVOT replacement deaths exceeds the risk of complications (eg, reoperation, endocarditis, etc), at least 2 of our 3 goals would be likely to be achieved. On the other hand, if early outcomes are comparable to those of patients with a history of RV-PA conduit, we could eliminate any need for this complex patient cohort to undergo pulmonary valve replacement and associated reoperation. We also wanted to demonstrate that long-term outcomes were not substantially different to patients undergoing pulmonary valve replacement in a timely fashion.

Methods
=======

Study Population
----------------

We sought to determine if we could achieve a better outcome for patients with a history of pulmonary valve replacement by waiting until adulthood to perform the intervention. The cohort of patients undergoing pulmonary valve replacement from January 2000 to May 2013 was reviewed. The patients were considered to have R-PA conduit repair and pulmonary valve replacement if their procedure was performed within 11 months of an age at which the lesion had initially been repaired. Otherwise, the patients were considered to have undergone an isolated pulmonary valve replacement with tricuspid valve repair or replacement. These patients represent what many surgeons consider as the most difficult decision in valvuloplasty. We considered patients who were older than 18 years of age to have achieved adulthood. From 2000 to 2003, our institutional policy was to wait until adulthood for surgical indication. After 2003, as a series of cases showed the feasibility and effectiveness of early intervention, we felt that our policy would be to perform such procedures within a reasonable time after the initial intervention on a case-by-case basis. We also retrospectively identified patients with a history of previously performed RV-PA conduit or pulmonary valve replacement who underwent surgical pulmonary valve replacement at our institution from November 2004 to July 2009. These patients, therefore, experienced both a surgical delay and an interval between the primary intervention and index operation. The study complied with the institutional guideline on ethical considerations. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. A prospective registry was used for patient enrollment. Ethics approval was obtained for this registry from the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). All patient data were stored on the NTUH clinical information system. Follow-up data were retrospectively collected using both clinic records and telephones. The study population was composed of the patients in this second cohort who had a history of previously performed pulmonary valve replacement, as well as those patients in this study's first cohort (included in the prospective registry) with a long-term follow-up.

We compared the overall outcome of all patients and the early intervention (≤6 months) cohort and interval pulmonary valve replacement cohort",1
"Question: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition? Answer:  Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition?

ANSWER:
xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition?

ANSWER:
There was a case report of a patient who had a ruptured ectopic left kidney of normal size but with the appearance of a giant kidney with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) in the contralateral kidney. The patient presented with right-sided abdominal pain and was found to have a ruptured ectopic kidney on CT-scan, with a left-sided giant kidney which was thought to be contralateral to her normal contralateral kidney ([@R1]).

The surgical literature has reported a possible association between XGC and biliary calculi, but there is little information with regard to XGC in the presence of gallstones ([@R2]-[@R4]).

We describe a case of a patient presenting with a normal-sized contralateral kidney with evidence of XGC in the contralateral kidney, which was diagnosed during nephrectomy for a 5.5 cm retroperitoneal soft-tissue mass.

We have received no payment, honoraria, or consulting fees from these companies or a pharmaceutical company to promote use of their drug products or for this case report.

Case report {#S1}
===========

A 34-year-old female patient presented with a right-sided abdominal mass for 6 weeks. Past medical history was significant for appendectomy two and a half years previously, and she had presented after an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy three weeks previously for abdominal pain of 3 weeks' duration. A laparotomy and appendectomy had been performed at that time, which found an appendicitis with normal intra-abdominal pathology and no biliary or gallbladder pathology.

She had no postoperative complaints and was discharged after three days. After 10 days of conservative treatment, the patient continued to complain of right-sided abdominal pain and had no significant improvement. She did not have any vomiting or nausea and had no weight loss.

Initial examination revealed a palpable right-sided mass. Her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, pulse rate 88/min, and regular. On examination of her abdomen, the mass was firm, and an omphalo-mesenteric lymphadenopathy (OML) was felt. Her chest was clear and she was afebrile.

She had had menarche when she was 15 years old, and her last menstrual period was 10 days ago. Her menstrual cycles had always been regular, and she had no history of irregular menses. She had not had any use of intrauterine devices. She was taking birth control pills for two years.

Complete blood count examination revealed a white blood count (WBC) of 14.48 × 10^9^/L (76% neutrophils and 23% lymphocytes), with a red cell count (R) of 3.65 × 10^9^/L and hemoglobin concentration Hb of 12.7 g/dl. Her platelet count was 332 × 10^9^/L. Urine and stool examinations were unremarkable, and her C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and liver enzymes were all normal. There were no abnormal imaging findings on abdominal ultrasound (US) or CT scans ([Figure 1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}).

![A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 5.5 cm mass over the right abdomen, with ill-defined borders. No hepatic lesion, splenic or renal lesions are noted.

· hypotheses that did not prove to be true or hypotheses that failed to explain your findings (this might be a good opportunity to address more specific sub-questions. An example is the fact that some frontotemporal lobar degenerations are preceded by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis);

· a concise statement that includes key conclusions about your finding; and

· a sentence or two explaining any limitations and your approach in trying to answer the Question;

(It is perfectly all right to have a number of different hypotheses.)

As you develop a hypothesis, it might be wise to think of an initial hypothesis, but it also might be possible to try to formulate several different hypotheses, in order to consider alternatives. However, make sure that the different hypotheses are sufficiently distinct, so that it is clear which hypothesis is being tested without a reference.

We are particularly interested in the questions about the clinical and pathological features of different subtypes, that can be answered by this project. But you might also want to pursue the following sub-questions in your project: whether a single or multiple different gene mutations are responsible for different subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, whether or not the pathology differs between genetic subtypes, whether there are differences between the neuropathological features of each subtype, whether there are any particular drugs that may prove valuable in treatment or that might identify pathogenic mechanisms, and whether there are any potential mechanisms as discussed in the text of your paper. If you choose to investigate any of these questions a project that will not be accepted. This is because we might consider one of the questions being too broad in scope. Please contact us for our thoughts and ideas on the sub-questions.

Your project should include:

· a justification of why this is a good project for this forum – either with a reference to existing literature or your own previous work or an explanation of a new perspective on the biology and a compelling clinical perspective

· a description of your previous scientific background and experience, including where you were admitted to PhD program and which university you are currently enrolled

· a description of any relevant research or scientific training you have undertaken that could support or advance your thesis research or any aspects of your proposed project. If relevant, your thesis supervisor can contribute to the review and may assist in the decision about project acceptance.

1. Determining the pattern and underlying mechanisms by which mutations in FUS and TDP-43 affect FTLD pathogenesis and determine the effect of the same mutation on the clinical phenotype. Project Leader: Dr. P. Buxbaum. Dr. Buxbaum began an MSRC Project in June 2010 when he began work on his PhD at Duke University Medical School studying the cellular and mouse genetic basis of FTLD-TDP and FTLD-FUS. He is currently working on a paper on these subjects and has submitted an MSR proposal in 2011 and 2012.

Project description

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders that present as a progressive cognitive and behavioral decline. FTLD is characterized by degeneration and deposition of both TDP-43 and FUS proteins and is genetically related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the common genetic mutation has not been identified. Our project proposes to focus on FUS and TDP-43 mutations and determine the pathogenetic mechanisms that result in the formation of non-disease, wild type versus disease TDP-43 or FUS, and the pathologic mechanisms which result in the clinical manifestations of these two diseases. It was determined that patients with FTLD with TDP-43 inclusions have ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative pathologic inclusions with RNA granules, whereas those with FTLD with FUS granule inclusions have ubiquitin-negative, tau-positive TDP-43 or FUS inclusions without RNA.

TDP-43 inclusions are highly prevalent in a variety of dementias and have recently been identified in ALS. However, the formation of FTLD-TDP pathology is unique to the FTLD subtype. FUS-positive FTLD (FTLD-FUS) inclusions are almost universally composed of FUS and ubiquitin",1

"Question: Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable? Answer:  Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese

Answer:

Background:

Basal metabolic rate is the energy budget, which can provide information for an individual’s calorie requirements, energy expenditure, and energy balance. In nutrition practice, it can be used to calculate an individual’s ideal weight and fat free mass. It is also used as a parameter for exercise prescriptions and energy expenditures.

Basal metabolism is usually evaluated by indirect calorimetry, which is considered to be the “gold standard”. Basal metabolic rate is often estimated by equations developed in other populations.

Objectives:

This study aims to develop basal metabolic rate prediction equations suitable for Chinese people, according to the “Guidelines on basal metabolic rate measurement” (JNC8 2013).

Materials and methods:

Basal metabolic rates were measured in Chinese people with measured body composition by indirect calorimetry.

Equations that best predict basal metabolic rate were calculated by linear regression in Chinese, including those previously developed in Caucasians, as well as those developed in Chinese.

Results:

Equations that best predicted basal metabolic rate were:



Estimated basal metabolic rate equations: Female: BMR (mcal/kg/minute) = 6.2 × body weight (kg) 1.1 - 13.2, and R 2 = 0.76; Female: BMR (mcal/kg/minute) = 6.9 × body weight (kg) 1.6 - 12.4, and R 2 = 0.76



Male: BMR (mcal/kg/minute) = 9.2 × body weight (kg) 1.1 - 13.2, and R 2 = 0.76; Male: BMR (mcal/kg/minute) = 10 × body weight (kg) 1.6 - 12.4, and R 2 = 0.76

Discussion:

Our results show that basal metabolic rate in Chinese, as measured by direct calorimetry, is lower than the prediction equations for basal metabolic rate developed in Caucasians.

Strengths and limitations:

This study has several limitations. First, our study population was based in a single hospital. Second, as this study is the first to establish prediction equations for basal metabolic rate in Chinese people, only a small number of data points were included. More data points from larger multi-centre studies should be validated and compared.

Conclusion:

From our results, the prediction equations for basal metabolic rate developed in Caucasians may overestimate basal metabolism, and could be used with caution.",1

"Question: Spinal subdural hematoma: a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm? Answer:  What is the pathophysiology of spinal subdural hematoma? Describe the pathology that leads to this question. You should be familiar with a number of basic concepts. What you will learn: Spinal subdural hematoma (SSH) is common neurologic complication after neurosurgical intervention. SSH has traditionally been described as sequela of an intracerebral hemorrhage. We have shown that in the vast majority of cases, SSH actually follows a prior subdural hematoma (SDH) and not an intracerebral hemorrhage. Aspiration of a spontaneous SDH can induce an SSH. We have shown that with careful attention to SDH pathophysiology, this complication becomes increasingly rare. Finally, we have shown that if SDH is aspirated with a negative pressure device in place, SSH will not occur. SSH presents a challenging diagnostic dilemma. To make accurate diagnosis, the clinician must first recognize the risk factors for this complication, which include: prior subdural, recent SDH, or SDH with a history of rapid expansion. A careful evaluation with a computed tomography (CT) scan should also be performed. A follow-up CT scan within the next 24-48 hours should also be obtained to assess the expansion rate and to look for evidence of worsening neurologic deficit. The patient should undergo close neurological observation. If there is no worsening or increase in the neurological dysfunction, treatment may be delayed until 72 hours, when symptoms typically improve anyway and the patient may undergo repeat CT scan to assess the change in the size of the hematoma. In a stable patient (i.e., who does not develop any new neurologic deficit or worsen in his or her neurologic function), a further CT scan 48-72 hours after the first can be a reasonable diagnostic tool. If the patient develops rapid neurologic deterioration, they should undergo surgery immediately.

Question: How much do you know? The average person should know (a) that a spinal subdural hematoma (SDH) is most likely a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm; (b) what factors lead to the SDH;(c) why is there often enough time between the SDH and SSH to see the results of the procedure; and, lastly, (d) that this complication becomes more common when a negative pressure device is utilized for aspiration of the SDH. Answers: (a) One common misconception is that SSH is the sequela of a ruptured intracerebral hemorrhage. This is most likely wrong. Actually, only 18 percent of all cases of SSH are actually a consequence of a prior intracerebral hemorrhage. We have shown that in all but a tiny fraction of cases, SSH is actually a sequela of a subdural hematoma. (b) The most common risk factors for developing SSH include a history of a recent subdural hematoma or a history of rapid expansion (see question 8). (c) Many studies have documented that the rate of SSH following neurosurgery is extremely low. It is even rarer than a recurrent hemorrhage itself (see question 3). Moreover, even studies that report an unusually high rate of SSH after neurosurgery are very likely to report a SDH rather than an intracerebral hemorrhage. (d) The use of a “negative pressure” aspiration device actually increases the risk of SSH. This is a very good reason to eliminate this device from the operating suite. Answers: A (a) This is the most common misconception – most people (especially neurosurgeons) assume that SSH is the sequela of a ruptured intracerebral hemosorrhage. Actually, only 18 percent of all cases of SSH are actually a consequence of a prior intracerebral hematom. In all but a tiny fraction of cases, SSH is actually a sequela of a subdural hematoma. The incidence of SSH is usually quite high after a subdural hematoma (25-44% of cases depending on the surgeon and center), while only about 15percent of SSH cases are preceded by an ICH. B (b) Risk factors that often lead to a subdural hematoma are: (1) a patient with a prior history of a subdural hematoma, (2) anticoagulation (warfarin, Coumadin, etc.) is associated with an increased the risk of a subdural hematoma, and, (3) a history of a recent rapid expansion (usually in the 24 hours before surgery). (c) Because SSH is such a rare complication, many surgeons are discouraged from reporting it, and in many studies, SSH was often misclassified by the authors as intr",1

"Question: Dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease: an underrecognised association? Answer:  ""Is there a relationship between motor neuron disease and communication difficulties caused by aphasia?"". This assignment was part of the course 'The epidemiology, diagnosis and management of motor neuron disease'.

### **Question**

Dementia is the loss of cognitive function that occurs in most people at advanced ages. People with motor neuron disease often have difficulty with everyday tasks. Writing a scientific paper which addresses the Question: ""What communication difficulties (and their underlying linguistic deficit) are seen in motor neuron disease, and under what circumstances are they seen?"", will help to better understand the relationship between motor neuron disease and language dysfunction seen in this group of patients.

### **Answer**

In this assignment, the focus is directed at the language difficulties in a specific neurological disease-namely motor neuron disease, rather than the linguistic changes associated with dementia. Therefore, in the abstract the focus will be directed at motor neuron disease (e.g., 'the neurological condition'), and specifically what problems in communication are observed and, more importantly, what underlying aphasic features might be at play. For example, if the question is: ""What communication difficulties are seen in motor neuron disease?"", the authors would write something like: ""Motor neuron disease is an extremely rare disease, usually afflicting the elderly (mean age of 70 years) with a mean survival time of 4 years."" The authors would then continue by noting the characteristics of the disease. To do this, they would refer to the following: ALS is generally fatal within 3 years of diagnosis and the motor and sensory symptoms are the key diagnostic features. Atypical presentations of the disease (e.g., progressive bulbar palsy) can cause diagnostic dilemmas. ALS can potentially be confused with several other diseases, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (acute or sub-acute atypical), ocular myasthenia gravis, myasthenia gravis, and dementia. These diseases are discussed later in the course, and the assignment would include a discussion of these issues (see the notes to Questions 8 and 10). Motor neurons are specialised nerve cells that relay signals between muscles and the brain and these are vital to activities such as movement. There are various forms of motor neuron disease. In motor neuron disease, the disease affects the nerve cells that carry messages from the brain to the muscles, leading to progressive weakness and eventually disability. The course will touch upon the main causes and current treatments of some motor neuron diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscle atrophy (SMA).

### **_Abstract_**

Motor neuron disease (MND) is an extremely rare condition causing progressive weakness and disability in some people. Although the condition is rare in younger people (mean age of onset in the 50s), about 95% of those diagnosed are over the age of 50. ALS is the most common form of MND. Although ALS is often fatal within 3 years from diagnosis, the condition rarely progresses to such an extent within that time. The prognosis of ALS is much better in people younger than 65 years of age than in older people. MND is usually diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 70 years although about 3% of people diagnosed with ALS are younger than 50 years. In contrast with other diseases of motor neurons, motor neuron disease lacks a definitive test and this makes early diagnosis difficult. Diagnostic criteria for MND are defined using clinical features. The most common features of ALS are progressive muscle weakness and atrophy and usually an upper motor neuron motor phenotype is seen (i.e., weakness in the distal upper limb musculature rather than in the proximal areas of the limb). A small proportion of patients with ALS have a lower motor neuron phenotype. Diagnosis of ALS/MND may at times be challenging and is based on the combination of clinical signs and symptoms as defined above. However, early diagnosis and interventions can slow the progression of the condition.

The prognosis of ALS is very different in younger and older patients. In younger people, ALS typically affects people in the same generation as themselves. Some people in their twenties and thirties can have MND. However, people in their forties to early fifties are rarely or never seen in the clinic with the disease. In people over the age of 50, ALS occurs in two main phenotypes, one of which is bulbar motor neurone disease (BMND). About two-thirds of people with ALS also have bulbar dysfunction, which usually presents late in the disease and may be mild or absent in the earlier stages. Bulbar symptoms may include problems in communication (e.g., reduced speech or swallowing) or problems affecting breathing, such as progressive cough or choking, which can make the person feel breathless. As the condition progresses, the patient can become breathless on",1
"Question: Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India? Answer:  What is the evidence?

Background and rationale {#cesec10}
------------------------

In India, the most cost-effective approach to diagnosis in patients with presumptive tuberculosis requires collection of at least three specimens from different anatomical regions before a diagnosis can be established[@bib1]. Most health care centres in India do not have microbiology laboratories equipped with rapid microscopy and culture facilities for collection of specimens for spoligotyping and mycobacterial culture, which are used to guide the decision to initiate antimicrobial therapy.

There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to indicate that interventions that involve spoligotyping or mycobacterial culture improve the clinical outcome for patients with presumed pulmonary tuberculosis. The only randomised trial for a clinical intervention included patients with extrapulmonary sarcoid. This trial did not show any benefit of a drug rifampicin with the anti-tuberculous drug ethambutol in the treatment of sarcoidosis,[@bib2] but this conclusion is tempered by the small sample size and the inclusion of only three sites. In addition, trials of drug combinations for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis to date have shown no clinical benefit compared with that seen with monotherapy.[@bib3]

Research in context**Evidence before this study**We searched PubMed and other databases up to June, 2015 with the terms\
(\""tuberculosis\"") OR (\""drug resistant\"") NOT (\""disease outcomes\"") AND (tuberculosis culture OR TB culture) AND (drug therapy OR drug therapy) AND (treatment OR treatment)\
Randomised trials were included, as were reviews with no formal searches for randomised trials. We did not include studies of patients with presumed, culture-confirmed tuberculosis and without drug resistance for which the aim of treatment is to preserve lung function or to prevent the establishment of drug resistance. The few randomised trials of drug combinations versus monotherapy all failed to show any clinical benefit. However, patients in these trials were likely to have drug resistance at diagnosis and so they could not provide evidence about the use of drug regimens such as pyrazinamide and ethambutol for patients who have isolated positive cultures. Furthermore, these trials were often designed to evaluate the use of combinations in patients with drug resistance and not in patients with isolated culture results from sputum or gastric aspirate.**Added value of this study**To our knowledge, this is the largest randomized trial of an intervention that does not involve the use of an active substance to treat tuberculosis. This trial included patients with presumed pulmonary tuberculosis who in most cases had isolated positive culture results. We believe that patients with isolated positive culture results are a group of disease worth studying, whereas most previous trials included patients who had drug-resistant disease or disease due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria. We also show that the clinical benefit associated with the culture-guided strategy was not associated with any change in the duration of treatment and was not associated with any significant effect on relapse rates or relapse times. Furthermore, this trial suggests no significant effect of the culture-guided strategy on the rate of patients needing to be switched to an alternative treatment regimen, which was a surrogate measure of adverse drug reactions.**Implications of all the available evidence**This trial in patients who in most cases had isolated positive culture results challenges previous findings, indicating no therapeutic benefit of culture guidance in patients presumed to have tuberculosis. However, these findings are tempered by an imbalance in our sample size and the inclusion of less homogeneous patients than in other trials. Because of its high clinical relevance, further trial may be useful in making robust conclusions about this study, which included a substantial number of patients and a large number of centres, and which may be representative of standard care in some centres in India. If the beneficial effect of culture guidance is real, this finding might explain why no therapeutic benefit has been observed in patients presumed to have tuberculosis and with drug-resistant disease in previous studies, which did not use a culture-guided strategy. Future trials could include treatment-naïve patients with isolated positive culture results because of the potentially higher chance of benefiting from a culture-guided strategy in this subgroup than in those patients who have had previously received treatment and have drug-resistant disease.

"Question: Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible? Answer:  Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible? Based on the review of literature, state whether it is possible to predict the histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors from diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging by means of a discriminant or regression analysis. The primary outcome is correct prediction, and secondary outcomes are classification accuracy and the number of correctly predicted cases. There are no limitations concerning study design, as long as all patients are prospectively enrolled and there is a specified protocol.

Papers that fulfil the Question must be assessed on the basis of the study title, objectives, abstract and full paper.

Objectives

To assess whether diffusion-weighted echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging (DW-EP-MRI) of parotid gland tumors can predict the histologic subtype of the primary tumor.

Search methods

Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE from 2000 to 2010 using the following term: ""parotid gland"" and ""imaging."" The databases were also searched using ""diffusion-weighted echo-planar"" and ""histology.""

Results

Ten pertinent studies were identified; three of these were eligible for inclusion in this review because of the inclusion criteria stated above. Of eight studies excluded because of the criteria stated above, no eligible studies were found. Diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging has shown promising results for evaluation of parotid tumors. Its diagnostic accuracy is high, being comparable to that of conventional MR imaging, and it has the potential to improve patient workup and planning of therapeutic strategies (e.g., ablative or reconstruction surgery).

Conclusions

The reviewed studies have shown that DW-EP-MRI can be used to predict the histologic subtype of parotid tumors in a reliable and noninvasive way. However, DW-EP-MRI has only moderate to good diagnostic accuracy for subtype differentiation. It has the potential to improve patient workup and planning of therapeutic strategies, especially in the preradiologic parotid surgery, as it may help select the appropriate surgical approach and guide the use of ablative and/or reconstructive surgery when tumor subtyping is necessary for accurate tumor management.

The purpose of this study was to describe the efficacy of combined transosseous tibial transport osteotomy (TOPTO) and Ilizarov external fixator (EFO) in the treatment of bone pseudarthrosis in a cohort of 23 consecutive canine transverse tibial fractures treated with orthopedic implants. To determine the success of this treatment, the healing of the fractured bone during the procedure was evaluated, and the results were compared with the long-term outcome and complications based on histologic, micro-CT, and follow-up data.

The study design was a retrospective case control study. All of the dogs in the study were skeletally mature, intact female beagles 1.5 years or older with transverse tibial fractures. Medical and anesthesia records were reviewed to identify all dogs that received TOPTO and EFO for treatment of transverse tibial fracture.

Twenty-three dogs were included in the final study because no dogs were excluded. The dogs were allocated based on treatment received. Fifteen dogs received TOPTO and EFO for fracture treatment, and 8 dogs received TOPTO and EFO for tibial lengthening for an underlying lameness in the absence of fracture.

During the study, 2 dogs died from unrelated causes (cardiac and noncardiac) within 1 week of completing fracture treatment only, leaving 20 dogs for examination of long-term outcomes based on fracture healing, radiographic appearance, and clinical function.

At the most recent evaluation 5 years following repair of the transverse tibial fracture the dogs received physical examinations, radiographs, full-length lateral and dorsoventral standing orthogonal radiographs, and gait analysis with a pressure mat. Dogs were given a subjective ranking according to their mobility using a 7-point scale. A final radiographic evaluation with micro-CT was performed to determine the amount of callus bone present at the site of the fracture, and soft-tissue structures of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments at the site of the fracture and tibial tuberosity were examined.

The radiographic and micro-CT results demonstrated a significantly higher number of dogs in the TOPTO and EFO group that had returned to a normal level of mobility (11/15 [73.3%]; median [interquartile range]), had improved mobility (7/15 [46.7%]; median [interquart",1
"Question: Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis? Answer: 

In this case, you will need to identify an endothelin-1 receptor. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that identifies a receptor in the following system, cell type, and part:

System or organism:

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) located on the endoplasmic reticulum.

ET-1 binds to the ET-1 Receptor subtypes A and B.

ET-1 Receptor subtypes A and B are found throughout the body.

Cell Type:

ET-1 binds with ET-1 Receptor subtype A which is found on vascular smooth muscle cells that line the blood vessels.

ET-1 binding to the ET-1 A receptor is the key trigger for vasoconstriction.

Part:

ET-1 Receptor subtype A or ET-1 Receptor subtype B or both can be targeted.

Conclusion:

Endothelin (ET) is an endothelium-derived peptide that is responsible for the majority of the vasoactive action of ET-1. The ET-1 receptor is composed of two subunits, ET-A, and ET-B. There are two known ET-1 Receptor subtypes A, and B. ET-1 has a short half-life of 3-7min and acts on the ET-1 Receptor to induce vasoconstriction and increases myogenic activity in the blood vessel wall secondary to this vasoconstriction. The vasodilator action of ET-1 occurs mainly from the ET-B receptor. In addition to the vasoactive action ET-1 is capable of inducing contraction of the smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel, secondary to the vasoconstriction and increase in myogenic activity. ET-1 is a powerful cardiovascular regulator, and when dysregulated may prove to be a risk factor and may lead to an elevated cardiovascular risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and other disorders. The ET-1 may increase blood pressure by vasoconstriction and by increased myogenic activity, where over stimulation of the receptors can occur and produce a hyperdynamic state that may lead to heart failure.
When treated in vivo, there are two approaches for inhibiting the vasoconstrictory and myogenic effect of ET-1. Targeting of the ET-1 receptors A, or B, or both can be used to inhibit the vasoconstrictory effect of ET-1.

As ET-1 production is increased during times of stress such as during hemodialysis, this is an area that may prove beneficial to the patient undergoing hemodialysis to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events from hemodialysis, in turn, reducing the morbidity and mortality with this treatment modality.

1.
Vasoactive effects of Endothelin
Endothelium-derived peptides, among which Endothelin-1 represents the predominant member, play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure (Brady and Grinnell, 2003). These peptides are generated, released and degraded at the vascular wall and are known to mediate vascular effects (Egorov et al., 2000; Egorov, 2003; Groneberg, 2003; Pöyry, 2003), with vasoconstrictive mechanisms playing a dominant role (Yokoyama et al., 2000). Most of the physiological functions of endothelin are mediated by the vasoactive effects, in addition to direct effects on the heart, gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Endothelin is synthesized by all three subclasses of the vascular endothelium (Grinnell and Yan, 1995; Groneberg, 1999).
Endothelin-1 interacts primarily with the ET-1 receptor (ET-1-R) (Hagberg, 2000), a G protein-coupled receptor that is structurally similar to known neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Drew and Egorov, 1997; Pöyry et al., 1997).
Endothelin is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors of blood vessels known and is also known as an inducer of myogenic activity (Drew and Egorov, 1997; Goto et al., 2002). Endothelin (ET) is a 21 residue polypeptide consisting of ring structures of 11 amino acids, which is the most potent vasoconstrictor known to date (Yan et al., 1997; Yan et al., 1995).

Answer by L.D. (nurse) :

Question: Do risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Does type of affective episode affect risk factors for suicidal behavior?

I recently got a paper that says affective disorder polarity may be the single biggest risk factor for suicide...

QUESTION I am a medical science undergraduate student working towards a masters in psychology.

In the paper, there are no control figures - eg. a no history of mood disorder group, a non-patient control group...

1. These types of figures are very interesting, but how are control figures used to strengthen the generalizability of the data?2. Why is it that suicidal ideation was only a risk for MDD and BD (and not for PTSD)?4. There is a discussion of the importance of the affective-interpersonal spectrum (and that of suicidal vs. self-directed aggression in the context of MDD - would this be useful for someone with a background in psychiatry?). How has this perspective (and the use of an affective-interpersonal spectrum) affected the literature? In other words, how might the inclusion of an affective-interpersonal spectrum help us to better understand suicidal behavior?5. Please provide references for statements 1-4.6. The final question: is this paper useful- informative-useful in some way?

Answer by L.D. (nurse) :

Yes, it is very important to have the control group.

The authors of the paper talk about differences between MDD and BD in the discussion.

They mention in addition suicidal ideation/behavior as an important outcome measure.

Suicidal intent/behavior were used as one outcome measure for suicide attempt.

It is also important that the authors talk about the importance of the affective-interpersonal spectrum.

These are important aspects for us.

The use of the affective-interpersonal spectrum will certainly help us to understand the behavior much better.

Hi,Thanks for posting this interesting question. I think the risk factors for suicidal behaviour would differ on the basis of the type of mood disorder patients are suffering from.

Some risk factors of suicidal behaviour may be common in all types of mood disorders which includes:

1. Family psychiatric history

2. Childhood and adolescent psychiatric history

3. Substance use. One of the main risk factors among depressive disorders is substance use. Substance use is closely related to alcohol use disorders. In depression, substance use can lead to impairment, suicidal behaviour and suicide death. The reason is that substances will decrease or inhibit certain functions in normal human beings which are necessary for survival. It can also change patients’ emotional and cognitive abilities. Studies found that the high prevalence of alcohol use disorder in suicidal patients. It increases the likelihood of suicide in MDD patients, who have or have a history of alcohol use disorder.

4. Medical history

5. Traumas during childhood and adolescence including physical, sexual and emotional traumas

6. Age

The most notable risk factor that you can see with the current study is the affective-interpersonal spectrum. Since the spectrum goes from impulsivity, hostility, irritability, anger outbursts, aggression to interpersonal dependency, affection, social isolation, dependence. These factors would affect suicidal behaviour.

"Question: Is the international normalised ratio (INR) reliable? Answer:  Is the INR reliable?

INR Reliability: Overview

Harrison, W. M., et al. “The International Normalised Ratio: Its Validity and Utility.” Blood, vol. 69, no. 1, pp. 27-31, 1987. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3223711.

INR testing is the only method of monitoring oral anticoagulation used worldwide.1

The INR (International Normalizing Ratio) is internationally standardized:

1. The assay system used should have the ability to measure within 0.5 INR of the standard INR in each coagulation laboratory2

2. The reference range for the assay system used should be well established based on the literature, preferably the range used in clinical practice.3

3. The reference ranges (that is, the 99% reference interval) should be established by assaying at least 50 samples in a number of centers.4

4. To avoid confusion, laboratories using different assays should be advised to establish their own internal standards and use the “in house” INR.5

Harrison, et al, in 1987 reported the accuracy of the INR using different methods. Table 1a shows the correlation coefficients with the standard INR in Table 1b. Table 3c shows the percent difference from the standard.

Harrison et al also reported the percent difference between the standard and the estimated “INR” (Table 3b). In the first column are listed the reference ranges and the methods of assay with the reported values for the percent difference.

“The value of the INR is its use as the standard for comparing other tests or systems. In the absence of accurate and standardized methods of INR determination, other assays and methods, the “indirect” method or the prothrombin time, must be used for this purpose. We have examined many of the commonly used methods for the laboratory determination of the INR for accuracy, their reported values for precision, and whether they permit useful standards for other methods to be established.”

3.4 Conclusion

“Our conclusions are that the present methods of INR estimation are valid and that for the purpose of monitoring of oral anticoagulation, the INR provides a useful guide in making therapeutic decisions. Although there is no “standard” reference range for the INR, because of the marked interlaboratory variations in methods of estimation, and because of the marked intra and interindividual variability of the INR with oral anticoagulation, there is a need for a “normal” reference range and a “high normal” reference range in addition to being able to estimate the INR clinically. Since the INR seems to respond rapidly to changes in warfarin dosage, it can even have a role in monitoring the patient’s clinical status on a day-by-day basis. The accuracy of the INR appears to be in the range of 0.5 INR. With a higher accuracy, this guide may provide answers to some clinical questions for which other means to monitor the patient are wanting.”

"Question: Are there associations of health status, disease activity and damage in SLE patients? Answer:  do SLE patient’s with more active disease or are higher on disease activity, damage more sick; are more likely to be disabled? Do older SLE patients with chronic illness more often have disabling conditions? The abstract will be peer reviewed.

Answer: There is a general increase of disease with increasing age among SLE patients, especially in women and the elderly. This may be secondary to accumulation of risk factors over time. As we know, older SLE patients are more likely to have comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, stroke, lung disease, among others. In addition to that, we know older patients are more likely to carry the HLA B8 and B39 alleles, both of which are associated with a decreased survival. I have attached a copy of the abstract which has the references.

Answer: SLE is characterized by a range of manifestations varying from mild to life threatening. Many aspects of the disease are similar across age and gender and this includes disease-related fatigue and arthritis. Older age is associated with more severe lupus disease activity and therefore more likely to progress to severe disease such as lupus nephritis. In addition, older individuals with SLE are more likely to have more comorbid diseases. Comorbidities as well as medication changes or poor compliance with treatment are known to affect the disease course and outcome. This could be secondary to the loss of functioning of organs such as kidney, heart and brain. In addition, these individuals are known to have a decreased quality of life. I hope this helps.

Answer: I don’t know of any publications on this. Perhaps, the same could also be applied to RA and that should be investigated and reported on in this group.

I have always had a fear of having the same kind of disease my mother had which is lupus erythematosus, as I am a young and active woman. When I saw her I would be shocked at the photos! I have been diagnosed with SLE but the worst one was when I started having severe pain and swelling. It is at times so awful and I have cried many times as I was getting worse and felt like I would be bedridden. Even though I am not anymore, my symptoms still flare up and there is no way my mother would have been able to live my kind of life at that time.
I recently went to the doctor on my own to get a copy of my labs when I felt weak and lightheaded. On the way back to home I became sick and started to vomit and felt so horrible. After vomiting, I lay down and within minutes I started to feel my right kidney had swollen. This was a first because I had never felt so sick in my life and I knew there was no way I was going to call a doctor and I had just vomited.
Anyhow, I decided to take my first shower in a month and the first thought that came to my head is something was wrong. I looked down at my belly and it was large and covered with rashes. I decided to turn the cold water on me and take a bath. After all it was only my first time and I figured if I was just going to be sick and faint I didn’t want I would just die in the bathtub.
I think I was in shock and felt like everything was going to explode. I began shaking and then I felt my right eye and it was covered with something inside and all around. It felt like a small mass and it didn’t hurt until I reached home. I began to think I will die if I don’t call a doctor but then my husband got off of work. I called him and after I told him about my stomach and pain, he decided it was serious and I should go to the hospital. I was taken to the ER where they told me I had a huge mass on my right kidney and said they would need to take me to the hospital to have something removed. They said it was growing and I needed to get it removed because it could burst causing infection to other organs and life-threatening consequences.
They told me I could have a scan and an ultrasound within the next few hours and that I would get something done. In all the time being a patient in the triage and waiting to go to the ER department, the only thing I could keep telling myself was there was no way I would make it to the hospital without having this taken out. I knew I would be able to make it if they took this out and I would be able to sleep through the night, knowing I was no longer in pain. The pain was intense and I can remember lying there thinking I will have to have surgery tomorrow no matter what but at least I will get rid of the pain this way as I couldn’t keep thinking about",1
"Question: PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy? Answer:  PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy?. I have reviewed the paper's abstract below, and I know it will be better to read the paper than my summary.

I have been looking for a study that I previously found (or did not find), I have been looking in major medical journals and in databases like PubMed for the past 3-5 years looking for it. Now someone on this blog or one of the others is pointing me in the right direction.

AbstractAn observational study of 6,926 men aged <80 years from the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study cohort was conducted to determine the clinical significance of PSA changes over time. The study population was selected from a large trial that enrolled individuals who were randomized to active surveillance (AS) or treatment immediately. Men with a life expectancy >10 years and either a biopsy Gleason score [GS] ≤ 7 (or PSA >10 ng/mL) and <30% cancer in one core, or biopsy GS ≥8 and <60% cancer/core were enrolled in the AS arm of the study. The PSA outcomes were reviewed for a minimum of 5 years (0.2 ng/mL increases for first 10 years), and an estimated prostate cancer mortality rate calculated. Of men enrolled, 4,062 (58%) underwent a repeat biopsy procedure. Median follow-up time was 5.6 years. Median interval between repeat biopsies was 1.3 years. The change in PSA level was the most common reason for repeat biopsies (n = 2,664, 41%), and the PSA velocity was the second most common (n = 1,737, 26%). When compared with patients who did not undergo repeat biopsy, patients on the AS group had a higher rate of cancer detected at their first biopsy (18.7% [1,913] vs 6.9% [532] at first biopsy only, and 28.0 [1,946] vs 15.6% [1,270] with any biopsies completed), but a lower rate of subsequent cancers detected over time (10.8% [904] vs 14.8% [1,180]). The overall cancer probability for the entire cohort was 3.2%, which was consistent for men with less than or greater than an 80% probability of mortality. The hazard ratio for subsequent PSA elevation at 10 years after starting surveillance was 1.48 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.18 to 1.87). An increase in PSA level was associated strongly with prostate cancer mortality at 1 and 10 years after initial diagnosis (hazard ratios 2.53 and 2.35, respectively). No overall difference was observed in prostate cancer mortality between men who experienced a >1-ng/mL rise over time (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.30) or those with less than a 1-ng/mL increase (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.20). These data indicate that PSA-based risk categorization using PSA trajectory over time may provide an accurate prediction of subsequent risk. The impact of this methodology cannot be used to determine whether or not the treatment of clinically significant disease is warranted.

Discussion

The abstract above states ""PSA-based risk cateogrization using PSA trajectory over time may provide an accurate prediction of subsequent risk.""

Question: PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy?

PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels over time are the biggest issue, especially when PSA is <10.

The American Urological Association (AUA) has recommended performing an AS in patients who have a PSA density less than 0.2 ng/mL over at least three years or 10 ng/mL over at least 3 years, a GS of 3 + 4 or lower, and a number-percent cancer in one core of no more than 25%.

Dr. Bostrom has written in the past about this issue in the following posts:

This seems to be the reason why so many Prostatitis sufferers and their doctors are still having so many Prostatitis symptoms and yet they continue to believe the Prostatitis is under control. Even when the Prostatitis doesn't get any better, the medical ""experts"" don't really know or they don't want to admit why it doesn't get better and they continue to think it's under control.

Now I suspect there may be something to the theory that PSA is being used as the ""marker"" for Prostatitis. Prostate cancer is the only thing that stands a chance of killing or severely incapacitating prostate Prostatitis sufferers",1

"Question: Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits? Answer:  Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits?

**Question Description:**Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is a treatment that has been used as an adjunctive therapy to improve the symptoms of patients with GI disorders for many years; it is an invasive therapy that stimulates the gastric muscular, glandular, or neural components rather than directly stimulating the GI tract. It is one of the newer technologies used to treat chronic GI dysfunctions, but there is evidence to support its use in functional gastrointestinal disorders such as functional dyspepsia and post-operative ileus. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States in 2007, and many reports have shown positive outcomes from using this therapeutic device.

**Question:** Is an implantable gastric stimulator superior to prokinetic medications for treating post-operative ileus? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers this question.

**Question Description:**Gastric-stimulating devices implantable in the abdomen and connected to electrodes that are placed in the stomach were approved by the FDA in 2007. These devices improve symptoms in patients who have idiopathic dyspepsia in whom drug therapy and other surgical interventions have not provided relief ([@bibr2]; [@bibr5]; [@bibr15]). Post-operative ileus (PI) is the most common complication after abdominal surgery in the United States and approximately two-thirds of patients require more than three days inpatient stay; it usually occurs after lower abdominal and pelvic surgery and is one of the most important complications that may result in increased lengths of hospitalization ([@bibr40]). In addition, in older adults, complications such as falls and pulmonary embolism can be a result of PI, which decreases the quality of life, especially in people with a previous history of cardiovascular disease. Prokinetic medications, including prokinetic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and motilin receptor agonists, have been effective for treating PI. However, these medications have been associated with significant patient concerns, and they are not always successful, so additional therapies are needed. Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) involves stimulating the gastric muscular, glandular, or neural components; it is not a device that is used to promote upper small bowel motility. In a study by [@bibr9] published in *Digestive and Liver Disease*, investigators compared the effect of prokinetic medications to GES on PI to see if GES was more successful in treating PI.

**Question:** Is a wireless, biodegradable device implanted in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract suitable for treating obesity and other gastric disorders? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers this question.

**Question Description:**Gastric electrical stimulation has been in development for more than two decades. It was approved by the FDA in the United States in 2007. Gastric electrical stimulation therapy is a treatment that has been used as adjunctive therapy to improve the symptoms of patients with symptoms related to their eating patterns for many years. There have been many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on GES that show its effectiveness in controlling symptoms related to obesity and gastric dysfunctions.

Gastric electrical stimulation therapy is a treatment that works by stimulating the gastric muscular, glandular, or neural components; an implantable device is placed in the body and connected to electrodes that are placed in the stomach; it is implanted just under the skin and is designed to stimulate the upper abdomen.

**Question:** What is the efficacy of vagus-nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy for gastric dysfunctions? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers this question.

**Question Description:**Vagal stimulation (VNS) is a therapy that has been used with gastric electrical stimulation to treat gastric dysfunctions for more than 20 years; it involves placing a small device under the skin of the neck and connecting it to a chest harness designed to stimulate the vagus nerve, which is the main nerve involved in triggering antral relaxation. The VNS device is a noninvasive, temporary technology that works by stimulating the vagal nerves in the brain, which in turn stimulates the stomach to move and relax, and causes changes in the GI tract to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with GI dysfunctions. The vagal nerve is divided into the right and left vagus nerves, each of which carries signals to the GI tract. There are three major vagus nerves that each leave the brain stem and run along the jugular vein to the neck and down to the lower abdomen through the",1
"Question: Should pulp chamber pulpotomy be seen as a permanent treatment? Answer:  Should pulpotomy be considered as a permanent treatment for carious primary molars?

Introduction

In dentistry there are several methods of treatment depending on the patient and their condition.

If you think of a primary tooth in the mouth of a child, they need to keep their first primary teeth in place because they are there to grow and be healthy. Most dentists will aim to keep these teeth in place for as long as both the tooth and the child can benefit.

This is a vital part of the child’s oral development.

If these little teeth were kept in a child’s mouth, their development would be stunted and they would not have enough teeth to bite and chew well.

Not only healthy growth, they also need to be comfortable to chew and eat without discomfort.

It is up to adults, to try and help children by leaving those primary teeth in.

Should these teeth then be prepared and treated, so that they can stay in for as long as possible?

This will need someone to answer the Question should pulpotomy be considered one of the permanent treatments for carious primary molar teeth.

There are a number of different ways in which it can be done, what all depend on the particular needs of the tooth.

What Are Pulpotomies?

Basically, a pulpotomy can be seen as a short-term treatment of carious primary molars. But to understand how pulpotomy works, it is good to understand what a pulpotomy is, first.

So, a pulpotomy is a short-term treatment of carious primary molar teeth that does what is called ‘pulping out the infected root’.

This means that it removes the infected areas of the tooth, and then the area of the decayed area is filled with something else more appropriate for the tooth being treated.

Usually, the tooth is filled with a material such as a material made from calcium hydroxide, known as cement.

This is to stop the infection, as well as fill the tooth and seal any areas that have collapsed. These areas would mean the tooth would die and would probably fracture as the decayed areas of the tooth would not have filled.

The decayed areas will begin to heal and, as it does, it will harden.

The pulp inside will stay alive and will be able to heal because it is healthy. The tooth will still be the same size as it was before because the area of the tooth that has been infected and needed to be pulped, has healed together and filled with cement.

Pulp Capping

Often, the teeth affected by caries will not have enough of the pulp left in them to sustain proper nutrition.

This means that the enamel on the tooth will wear away, leaving more decayed enamel exposed and a bigger hole for the next tooth to get through.

This is a problem as the rest of the healthy areas that have filled in the hole will then need some sort of treatment to seal, too. To fix this, most pulpotomies work on the principle of putting a material in the hole left in the tooth.

This will try to seal around this hole and stop the tooth from weakening.

This is why a cement or similar material is placed in the hole and will be seen to be the same colour as the tooth around it.

This causes the white pulp cavity to seal up so it is more healthy and the tooth will have a better chance of maintaining its vitality.

What Can Pulp Capping Do?

There are of these methods of pulp capping out there, and it is best to understand how they work so that you know how they can be beneficial to teeth.

When an adult or child’s molar has been affected by caries, the pulp can cause problems in their dentition.

They will be seen to lose a lot of their vitality, and will often cause pain, and they may look as if the tooth has lost its shape.

This can be a problem for children as they need to keep their molars to grow, and, in some cases, to keep their baby teeth in properly.

It is up to the dentist to decide what is the best treatment for a particular child’s tooth.

Sealing up the hole left by pulpoing is a good step in saving the vitality of the tooth and maintaining it in the form it has been in.

This is usually a two step process, which will require the teeth to first be softened and then capped with a mixture or a material that will work around the entire tooth to hold it all together properly.

This can take some time, but",1
"Question: Does transverse apex coincide with coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? Answer:  Does transverse apex coincide with coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis?

Dear Authors,

Based on the results of our ongoing long-term clinical study we have recently reported that scoliosis in late adolescent idiopathic scoliosis differs from adolescent idiopathic scoliosis both with respect to curve configuration (double thoracic and or double thoracolumbar), progression rate (fast) and surgical treatment outcome (good).1 We are now going to ask the following question: Does transverse apex coincide with coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis?

Authors' response (optional):

Dear Reviewer,

We are really grateful for your interest in our study. Your manuscript regarding the long-term effects of scoliosis treatment on patients with early onset curves provides an interesting comparison of curves treated earlier (mean age 12.4 years) and curves treated later (mean age 13.3 years). As far as we understand, however, your question regards three different treatment modalities: brace, instrumented fusions, or a combination of the two, and your study did not examine these three kinds of treatment approaches in one prospective study design. Thus, we think that the question in the title is more than ""interesting"", because of the difficulty to compare the results of treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients in the different treatment modalities.

We are sorry to inform you that our question is meaningless in one aspect. We have the same question; however, we need to answer it in a study that compares the results of those in three different modalities.

We have attached the research proposal for your consideration. The research proposal includes two projects. The short-term project is comparing the results of three different treatment modalities that you have mentioned. The long-term project is to study the relationship between transverse apex of the apex vertebra of each side and location of corresponding apex of coronal vertebrae, by applying the parameters of Cobb method and the values of SVA. These parameters and the values of SVA are the parameters that we have used in our recent studies.

Your comments and recommendations are accepted and welcome. Best wishes.

Sincerely,

In the initial search, we found one prospective investigation on this subject by Dufeck2 and Dufeck3. This study is similar to our study regarding the research question; however, in the method section of this study, the authors state they did a search in the electronic databases of Medline and Embase but that no references were found. They mention one study by Lee4. From what we learned about this article we believe it is not related to the research question. For example, the study by Lee4 did not directly answer the research question. The purpose of Lee4's study was to verify the concordance between measurements of the lateral deviation of the center vertebra of rib segments on frontal radiographs and the center vertebra of rib segments on lateral radiographs through a computer simulator program of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).

Since it was not possible to evaluate the inclusion criteria of the study by Dufeck2 and Dufeck3, we contacted Dufeck who kindly replied, agreeing that they met all the eligibility criteria for their review. Dufeck reviewed the manuscript and wrote the following:2""Based on my search, there is no information about the measurement of transverse apex of the apex vertebra of each side and the location of the corresponding apex of coronal vertebrae, by applying the parameters of Cobb method and the values of SVA using an instrument or computer program in early onset scoliosis, such as early curves of Lenke 1 or 2, or early curves of type I or II.

"Question: Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy? Answer: “Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?” (Please attach an abstract and/or abstracts of other research that answer the Question.)

Question: Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?“Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?”“Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?”Do the results of analyses of the performance of the CHC System adequately reflect the performance of the system as intended?

Question: Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?“Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?”“Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?”Does the CHC System's algorithm accurately detect a child's need for home services?

If you have any questions about the proposed analysis you may email Dr. Zuniga at maurozun@hotmail.com if you would like to discuss any aspect of the project further.

The CHCS was implemented in 2005 and initially targeted children diagnosed with asthma, but was widened to include children with other chronic illnesses, and then expanded to include children with various neuromuscular diseases as well as children with cerebral palsy. A previous study in this cohort was carried out within 7 days of diagnosis. We extend the study window to 7 years and examine whether the system accurately predicts need for hospital admissions and ERs during a 7-year period (2006-2013) in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy.

The CHCS is the largest registry collecting data on healthcare services use in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and the registry contains demographic and clinical information on all children with cerebral palsy in Calgary, AB, Canada. Our analysis expands on previous work that showed that the registry can identify some children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, but also includes those who have never been diagnosed with the illness.

The study of children in the CHCS database has also been extended to identify if the CHCS accurately predicts the need for hospital services, including admissions to the hospital and the emergency room (ER). This study also follows a time axis. One limitation of this study is that we cannot account for any changes to the health infrastructure in Alberta from 2007-2013. The Alberta Government was implementing major initiatives to reduce hospital readmissions such as improving the hospital discharge processes, the use of clinical decision support tools, and the transition towards care pathways that reduce the unnecessary and redundant use of resources. Therefore, if the CHCS accurately predicts hospital services use 7 years after illness onset, this may reflect better health services use and care transitions, which could result in reduced readmissions.

Cerebral Palsy was one of the main contributors to the increase in demand of children's services from the 1960's to the late 1980's. This increase in services reflected a dramatic increase in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy as infants. Infant mortality has come down substantially, but the numbers of children surviving to reach the age of 18 has increased substantially because of improved treatments. As a result, the numbers will continue to increase and this means a further increase in services. However, the incidence of cerebral palsy in Canadian children has not changed but there should be no increase for the next decade. There is a small, steady increase in the number of children with the most severe types (Apert, Hemimegalencephaly), which may reflect a change in the methods of recording and coding as well as changes in clinical practice. The incidence of Gross motor impairment however has declined indicating some success.

The main limitation of this study is that the CHCS only followed children up to the age of 12 years. Future studies will need to include children diagnosed in this cohort who have not participated in the CHCS, to track the service use of these children over the lifecourse of the disease. Another limitation is that we cannot account for changes in health service and outcomes over the study period, from 2007-2013. This is an important limitation as the major initiatives introduced in Alberta to reduce and/or shift unnecessary use of resources, could have introduced substantial changes to the health system and the healthcare outcomes have not been examined.

Our previous studies have identified a large number of children in this registry who were not identified by the CHCS as having cerebral palsy. These children with cerebral palsy have similar characteristics and health outcomes to the children that were identified by the CHCS, so should be included in future analyses of the CHCS.

Although the CHCS was developed with children diagnosed with asthma as the primary focus, a subsequent analysis that extended it to include children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and the CHCS is the largest registry that collects information on children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, it extends to children diagnosed",1

"Question: Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy? Answer:  Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy? Please, put ""Question"" in the first line. Put all the words you wrote on the other lines. (100 words / 1 minute)

Response:
Dear Tania,
Thank you very much for your question. GDM is a major diabetes. Approximately, 10 to 15% of pregnant women develop GDM during pregnancy \[[@ref1]-[@ref4]\]. GDM is a medical condition where a woman has an abnormal blood sugar level; she develops diabetes during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes develops between week 24 and 36 of a normal pregnancy, but many women develop this condition during the later weeks of the pregnancy. The most common blood sugar level is 105 mg/ dL to 135 mg/dL \[[@ref5]\].
Nuchal translucency is an ultrasonic marker used for non-invasive screening of Down syndrome. The measurement is taken in an ultrasound during the first trimester of pregnancy. Nuchal translucency thickness can predict Down syndrome in the first and second trimester of pregnancy in the prenatal care setting \[[@ref2],[@ref4],[@ref6],[@ref7]\].
Nuchal translucency is associated with some risk factors such as maternal age and family history and can be used as a risk stratification marker for chromosomal syndromes, neural tube defects, maternal vascular dysfunction, and genetic conditions not associated with the chromosomal abnormalities \[[@ref8]-[@ref11]\].
Nuchal translucency and maternal plasma glucose level at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation in the first trimester have been associated with the risk of gestational diabetes during pregnancy \[[@ref6],[@ref10],[@ref12]-[@ref15]\].
Some studies have emphasized that maternal weight, maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, and the first trimester glucose level at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation can predict gestational diabetes \[[@ref16]\]. A meta-analysis study, including 13 studies, indicated that maternal weight could predict gestational diabetes with a sensitivity of 91.0% and a specificity of 65.7% \[[@ref17]\]. A recent clinical trial, including 23,934 pregnancies, compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of nuchal translucency thickness measurement in the first trimester with the results of first trimester screening \[[@ref18]\]. The results of recent clinical trial indicated that the positive predictive value for having GDM was 7.8%, the negative predictive value was 99.9%, and the accuracy was 78.6%; moreover, gestational diabetes was more common among overweight and obese women than among normal weight women. For the first time, we will study nuchal translucency thickness with the first trimester glucose level.
Some studies, including 10 clinical trials, indicated that nuchal translucency thickness can predict Down syndrome with an accuracy of 98%-100% \[[@ref19]-[@ref21]\]. Moreover, nuchal translucency thickness can predict other conditions such as the neural tube defects, maternal vascular dysfunction, and genetic syndromes \[[@ref20]-[@ref22]\].
Some authors reported that the prevalence of gestational diabetes is higher with increasing nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester of pregnancy in the prenatal care setting \[[@ref6],[@ref10],[@ref12]-[@ref14]\].
We will study whether or not an increase in nuchal translucency thickness in first trimester is associated with an increase in fasting blood glucose level in early pregnancy and gestational diabetes in the second trimester, a major medical condition.
Our proposed research is going to study the relationship between nuchal translucency thickness, gestational diabetes during pregnancy in the second trimester and maternal glucose levels in the first trimester with a study sample of 200 pregnant women at 17 to 22 weeks of gestation.
We will study whether or not an increase in nuchal translucency thickness during first trimester could predict gestational diabetes during pregnancy with a gestational diabetes in the second trimester.
The proposed research study is unique, we will explore whether or not there is an association between nuchal translucency thickness in early pregnancy and maternal glucose level in the first trimester in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes onset during pregnancy. This research will be a unique opportunity to study this association. A new clinical trial is a unique opportunity for researchers and researchers' labs to work on finding the answers for the questions in the best way.

"Question: Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype? Answer:  Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype?

Background
============

The V1a receptor (AGTR1A) is a G-protein coupled receptor. The expression of AGTR1A mRNA is found in various regions of the brain. The presence of the V1a receptor (AGTR1A) mediates the effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the modulation of neurotransmission in the central nervous system. It has a high affinity for the nonapeptide AVP, of which the amino acid arginine is naturally present in 5′-position while other amino acids can serve as a 5′-substituent [@bib1]. The existence of the AVP system and its action mechanism are relatively well established with regard to a number of central nervous system functions. It seems to be involved in a diversity of functions ranging from general arousal and wakefulness, mood regulation and social behaviour, to memory, learning and cognition, and the control of the cardiovascular system and fluid homoeostasis. In particular, this neurotransmitter might play a key role in the pathogenesis of numerous affective disorders. It seems to play a role also in the pathogenesis of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The existence of an AVP system and the pharmacological manipulation of its components in order to restore the normal pattern of the central neurotransmission may constitute an alternative form of treatment for many psychiatric disorders. These are the subject of clinical trials now in process.

Hypersexuality is a paraphilic (non-compulsive or non-habitual) repetitive and intrusive impulse that has been documented in approximately 3% of women, and less in men [@bib3]. This disorder results in clinically significant impairment, although the exact level of impairment in hypersexual men is unknown. However, men are more likely to have an extensive and compulsive pattern of sexual behaviours that require medical or psychological treatment such as drug therapy or psychotherapy, and they may require intensive behavioural interventions. There are no data about the impact of AVP V1a receptor polymorphism and hypersexuality in men, but men with AVP V1a receptor deficiency have been reported to show an increased prevalence of hypersexuality and impotence [@bib5].

On the other hand, the role of the angiotensin (AT) receptor is relatively well established in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

The AT2 receptor is expressed widely in the rodent brain and in the human brain in several nuclei such as the caudate-putamen and the globus pallidus as well as in the hippocampus. The AT2 receptor has been shown to play a role in the regulation of dopamine release and synthesis *in vitro* [@bib6], and in the regulation of glutamatergic transmission in the cerebellum [@bib7]. Increased levels of the AT2 receptor may be implicated in schizophrenia by its ability to induce the maturation and synaptogenesis of granular cells of the cerebellum [@bib8].

The AT1a receptor is predominantly expressed in adrenal glands, and less in the heart and blood vessels. The AT1 receptor is widely present in the central nervous system in many brain regions such as the hippocampus [@bib9], paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus [@bib10], nucleus accumbens [@bib10] and ventral tegmental area [@bib11] which are involved in processing reward and motivation. AT1 receptor antagonists have been shown to induce neuroprotection following traumatic brain injury through their anti-oxidative properties.

This receptor system interacts with other neurotransmitter systems, thus acting as an integral part of the dopaminergic system within the nucleus accumbens. The AT1 receptor antagonist losartan has been tested in clinical trials in children with ASD [@bib12].

The hypersexuality and impulsivity in children are difficult to study. However, the V1a receptor and the AT receptor (AR) system has been proposed as having a special role in the pathogenesis of autism. The potential therapeutic effect of the AT receptor antagonist losartan is also tested in some children with autism. In the V3 receptor, a genetic linkage has been found with autism for the CAG repeat in the AT receptor gene in the V3 sequence. The AT1 receptor mutation in a girl with ADHD has also been reported.

"Question: Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma: really an early stage? Answer:  Why should I consider Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma a potentially curable disease?.

ANSWER: Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is an important subgroup of NSCLC presenting as an early stage disease.
The main prognostic determinants of NSCLC are tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and the clinical stage. With good performance status, treatment with curative intent using local treatments is now accepted as an important treatment option. In addition, recently presented data suggest a potential role for new biological markers in NSCLC including molecular alterations. However, due to a lack of large prospective, randomized, multicenter studies, no specific treatment guidelines have been established. This review article discusses and illustrates the treatment approaches for Stage I NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: The standard treatment of brain metastases is surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS).
Recent advances with SRS technology have made it possible to deliver high doses of radiation with an acceptable risk of toxicity that are used as a single treatment option, or in combination with WBRT, for brain metastases. The role of SRS-alone in the management of the patient with asymptomatic brain metastases is becoming increasingly important.
OBJECTIVE: To review the present role of SRS alone in the treatment of brain metastases.
METHODS: A search was made for articles and trials in PubMed using the search terms “brain”, “metastases”, “radiotherapy”, “radiosurgery”. Selected literature in the English language was then reviewed and cross-references used to identify additional literature. Articles and trials relevant to SRS alone for brain metastases were selected. RESULTS: The role of SRS alone for the treatment of brain metastases is discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: SRS-alone has been demonstrated as a reasonable alternative for the treatment of brain metastases associated with brain-exclusive disease with a high rate of local control and a low rate of complications.

Fibrosarcoma is the 3rd most common cancer in dogs and, as with any malignancy, if a subdermal tumor is diagnosed, it must be biopsied, excised, and examined for microscopic evidence of metastasis. Most surgical oncologists recommend resection of tumors with negative margins to clear the possibility of recurrence, although the risk of local disease recurrence at the surgical site is low.

Mesenchymal neoplasms of intermediate differentiation represent a well recognized category of soft tissue mass and include chondrosarcoma and a spectrum of benign and malignant tumors with a variable cellular lineage including fibrous, myxoid, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, lipoma and leiomyosarcoma. All these lesions, especially fibrous histiocytic sarcoma, can be mistaken for each other on morphology alone with no significant differences in prognostic outcome.

Introduction.

Surgical excision with negative margins remains the treatment of choice for the majority of soft tissue sarcomas, as it was for most soft tissue tumours a century ago. Soft tissue tumours are a heterogeneous group with wide differences in local response to treatment and survival.

Neosarcomas or fibrosarcomas are the second most common soft tissue sarcomas in dogs. Surgical excision is frequently the only treatment for these neoplasms. It has been suggested that prognosis, tumour type, and adjuvant treatments also influence survival. However, despite an increasingly detailed characterisation of both neoplasms, the prognosis is still only based on clinical observations and survival times reported by the veterinary surgeon.

The overall prognosis for patients with soft tissue sarcomas is poor, but the survival times of different types of soft tissue tumours is poorly documented. The current study provides an insight into the characteristics of a group of soft tissue sarcomas, to estimate how many survive for one year, and to record long-term survival following treatment.

Case Presentation.

Case 1.

An eleven year-old, intact male crossbred (German shepherd and Labrador retriever) dog was referred with a three-week history of a subcutaneous swelling near the carpal joint at the base of the skull. The swelling was rapidly growing in size, and causing severe discomfort and lameness. Clinical examination revealed an irregular, soft, grey-white swelling approximately 30×30 mm in size, with a central, soft, grey-white mass and a pedunculated appearance, affecting the region of the carpal joint.",1

"Question: Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at advanced ages? Answer:  Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at advanced ages? What is the Question?



Introduction

Optimism is the tendency to feel better than their conditions at the time would suggest [1]. It is a psychological resource [2] and appears to protect the older adult, from an age perspective, from experiencing poorer health and higher mortality rates [3]. These outcomes seem paradoxically to occur because pessimistic attitudes tend to correlate with more medical diagnoses and with higher mortality [4]. Thus, an explanation for this paradoxical relationship appears to be required.





Optimism and Physical Health in Old Age

Old age is often associated with declines in physical health, disability, mental health, and other chronic illnesses. It is a time when many individuals face increasing economic and social marginalization and often require more care and the assistance of care-givers.



Optimism and Disability in Old Age

An important question for this literature review is “Does optimism affect the number and severity of chronic illness and disability at older ages”? If an individual is more optimistic they may be more likely to receive health and social care services, which can benefit those suffering from mental conditions [5]. These services may help them avoid health risk factors like obesity, poor oral health or inadequate nutrition, which are related to chronic physical conditions such as cardiovascular disease and joint disorders [6]. This may lead to the positive conclusion that optimistic older adults are more capable and independent of their health and social needs. However, older adults who are more depressed may be less likely to seek services for their social or physical needs, which may be associated with the chronic conditions associated with depression [7]. Alternatively, chronic conditions leading to disability and functional decline may be present in older adults from a younger age and this may be related to life experiences, personality or attitudes [8], as opposed to actual health per se.



Optimism, Physical Health and Mortality in Old Age

The idea that an individual’s overall outlook on life can affect their health and well-being is now gaining traction, and some evidence exists this may occur [9]. Some previous literature has shown a positive correlation between optimism and survival, with more optimistic older adults surviving longer and dying at later ages [3] compared to less optimistic older adults. This relationship may occur because a pessimistic attitude may reflect a more negative life experience and a life history rich with stressful periods and periods of ill-health [10] resulting in poorer physical health, higher illness rates, higher mortality rates [11] and a greater need for treatment. Conversely, optimism may reflect a life history free of such negative life experiences, with the individual having a healthier social and physical well-being, which may translate to a greater likelihood of survival.



What has not been shown previously is the longitudinal effect of optimism specifically on health outcomes. In the following literature review, we will discuss the different health outcomes at older ages, including: physical health, cognitive health, mental health, social health and survival. By examining the potential underlying mechanisms of why optimism in older adults may result in longer life expectancy, we may find some evidence to support the premise that an optimistic outlook on life may protect against poorer health and greater mortality.



Methods

The key features of a literature review include searching available databases, identifying relevant and primary literature that has been published. The criteria and search strategy for this literature review included the following search terms: “old age” and “optimistic attitude”; and “cognitive” “health outcomes” “cognitive decline” and “health” “psychosocial” “mental” “social” and “behavior”. It also included references to older adults from other reviews. Other inclusion criteria included: the use of empirical literature, a publication in English and published between 2006 and 2018.



Results

The overall results showed that a positive relationship is evident between optimism and physical health and survival at older ages. The results of the literature review will be discussed in the following sub-sections.



Physical Health

Physical health is one of the main concerns in old age, and is generally assessed by measuring the physical and functional aspects of the older individual’s health. It is important to ensure that optimists do not have an unfair advantage by virtue of having a healthy outlook on life, with the expectation they will recover from future health problems, due to a healthier body in late life. However, optimism appears to have a predictive effect on physical health at older ages, with the results showing greater odds of better physical health in optimists compared to less optimists [8]. This finding may be explained by the “hope and challenge hypothesis” [12], which suggests that greater physical",1

"Question: Cold knife conization vs. LEEP. Are they the same procedure? Answer:  Cold knife conization vs. LEEP.

Cold Knife Conization (CKC) and LEEP (Large Excisable Evaporative Lesion Examined by Preputioplysis) are the 2 most common procedures for treating women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN):

Why would I want to have either one of these procedures and why are they different? The answer to these questions may help you decide which procedure is best for you and help you avoid getting the wrong procedure.

The most common question I hear from patients after getting a colpocervical biopsy (CKB) is: “Can I get pregnant?” The answer from a colposcopist is: “It’s too early to tell.”

CKC is used for patients who want to know what the CIN is and need to find out if there is really cancer or just CIN. It allows us to see how the entire cervix is damaged. LEEP is a lot more invasive. It starts by removing the outer part of the cervix, so all the visible tissue on the cervix is gone.

Both the CKB and CKC look to see how much tissue is affected, but not what is inside the tissue. They are good at identifying whether the CIN is present all the way to the margin of the cervix (in the middle) or if the CIN is at a specific place in the cervix.

LEEP removes 1 entire quadrant of tissue from the cervix and looks inside by checking the tissue for abnormalities. This means that the CIN seen on-the-surface or in the middle portion of the cervix could really mean the CIN is present within the cervical tissue within the quadrant that is cut away.

LEEP is the procedure used to see if high-grade CIN (HGCIN) is present. To remove the entire surface of the cervix and to view the entire middle portion of the cervix, both CKB and LEEP are the right procedure for the patient.

Let’s look at the numbers. About 2 percent of women in the United States will develop invasive cervical cancer by 2040 according to the American Cancer Society. This number is expected to grow to 4 percent by 2040 because HPV infection continues.

In 2000, about 33,000 women had their cervix removed. That number grew to 70,000 in

2005. This is because cervical cancer screening rates have not increased. If women are screened early, the 5-year survival rate is 97. We can reduce cervical cancer deaths by increasing early detection, and these two procedures are perfect for that.

In 2000, 4.4 million women in the United States had their cervix removed for non-cancer reasons. In 2000, about 27 million women between the ages of 20-29 years old went to the doctor about 20 times for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

If we could do these 3 steps and catch some diseases early, the numbers of cervical cancer deaths and the number of women who die from STIs and pregnancy could be greatly reduced.

Question: I have 3 kids and am on birth control pills. Should this work? I want to be completely clear!

My patient wants to be sure this will work, so I want to be honest. No birth control pill can protect a woman from every possible pregnancy. There is one birth control pill called a minipill that is similar to the birth control pill your doctor would prescribe you. It is perfect for young women who want to know the exact time that she gets pregnant during the month (even for people who have intercourse every day). However, I have heard that if you have 3 kids at the same age and you are taking this pill, you may be more likely to get pregnant because it does not work the same way on women with 3 or more kids.

I would rather you not be pregnant than take a chance and get pregnant because we know what to do for pregnancy now: We wait. The most effective birth control is waiting until the woman wants to be pregnant, then using timed-reliable contraceptives and getting regular pap smears. Being on birth control pills can help prevent an unwanted pregnancy, but there is no surefire way to prevent pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about this, and keep in mind the most important thing is preventing pregnancy; not contraception.

Question: What is the difference between colposcopy and colposcopy plus cervical biopsy (CKB)?

Some women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) want to know which one is the safest. The answer comes from the colposcopist.

If you have CIN, colposcopic examination with CKB is more",1
"Question: Are pectins involved in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed rape plants? Answer:  Are pectins involved in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed rape plants?

Answer:
Pectin has a well-established role as an important structural and functional component of the cell wall, and as such it is involved in such processes as cell division and elongation in plants, the attachment of microorganisms to cells, plant cell wall extension and modification, and the formation of plant and fungal barriers to pathogens. However, our understanding of the ways in which this major carbohydrate component of plant cell walls affects the physiology and development of plants has been limited. Here we show that a decrease in pectin in oilseed rape roots coincides with the initiation of de-acclimation in response of plants to a cold stress, showing the central role of pectin in the cold response in oilseed rape. We also show that, with the onset of de-acclimation, pectin in roots undergoes rapid degradation by the calcium-dependent enzyme pectin-methylesterase. In contrast to the widespread notion that pectin is highly de-polymerised upon the initiation of cold de-acclimation, our data, using a combination of enzymatic and morphological techniques show pectin to be still present in the cell walls of cold-acclimated oilseed rape roots. The presence of a low abundance of pectin in cold-acclimated cell walls, even when cell wall composition was determined using a high-throughout measurement of total cell wall composition and abundance, shows pectin plays an integral role in the cold response of plants. Furthermore, this is the first study to report that pectin is involved in cold acclimation, suggesting that the molecular and cell biology of plant cold acclimation is more complex than previously appreciated.

"Question: Updating emotional content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit? Answer:  Does depression affect working memory for emotional content?

Answer: There are several factors that impact working memory. In the present study, we measured the ability of depressed participants to generate responses to emotional images in working memory. We showed that participants with major depression exhibited less activation of the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, compared to controls, during performance of the emotion working memory paradigm. The depressed group also exhibited a greater degree of hemispheric asymmetry at rest, relative to controls. These data suggest specific impairments in emotional working memory and are discussed relative to the possible nature of affective cognition impairments seen in depression. In addition, these findings shed light on the role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex asymmetry, as an index of affective processing at rest and during task engagement, specifically in affective working memory. These data also support a greater importance to consider the nature of neural activity at rest and during task engagement, when investigating deficits in cognitive processing during depression.

Introduction Working memory may be defined more broadly than traditional memory studies in which only verbal and other explicit material memory is examined. Indeed, it is plausible that working memory has a broader scope of operations, including the holding and processing of visual information (Luce & Pouget, 1986) or the processing of any material outside of conscious awareness (Melcher & Lavie, 2005). As such, it is considered integral in attention, perception, language comprehension, and learning, as well as cognitive control (Friedman et al., 2001; O’Brien, 2004). Furthermore, recent studies have explored the role of working memory in emotional processing (e.g., Etkin, 2007; Etkin, Green, Wager, & Ochsner, 2006; Peavler, McRae, Ritvo-Walton, & Etkin, 2003; Peleg et al., 2010; Schelle et al., 1998). Specifically, there is a wealth of evidence that demonstrates that emotional processing recruits and utilizes numerous brain regions, including a prefrontal-cingulate network. In particular, activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in conjunction with medial prefrontal region and anterior cingulate cortex has been shown in a range of emotional task paradigms including emotional working memory (Etkin, 2007; Etkin et al., 2006; Peleg et al., 2003). In fact, the functional anatomy of emotional working memory is closely matched with the structure and function of cognitive working memory (Nee, 2000, 2003), in a similar manner to other neurocognitive domains including attention (Etkin, 2007; Etkin et al., 2006) and language comprehension (Price & Devan, 1997; Price, Devan, & Cai, 2001). Further, previous findings indicate that the prefrontal-cingulate structures are not involved in implicit memory processes. The prefrontal-cingulate network, the regions that have been shown to be activated more generally in emotional working memory as noted previously, were not activated during a semantic matching task requiring only explicit learning of information (Etkin, 2007; Etkin et al., 2006). Thus, evidence suggests that the prefrontal-cingulate network provides the necessary neurocognitive architecture for working memory operations during emotional processing, particularly explicit cognitive working memory involving declarative content. Recent work has also suggested that the anterior part of the prefrontal-cingulate network supports cognitive working memory and may be specialized for affective processes (Kim & Hamann, 2015), an account that has been supported by some evidence. A key to understanding the nature of emotional working memory is that emotional material has a distinctive and preferential benefit for declarative, compared to semantically analogous, tasks. For example, when a depressed individual engages in a semantic matching task with emotional material, they perform considerably better than non-depressed individuals given the same task context (Bodurant & Milne, 2010). Further, evidence presented by Kim and Hamann (2015) shows that performance during a working memory task that requires emotion processing benefits less depressed individuals, relative to non-depressed. In fact, one previous study that aimed to assess the ability of depressed adults to perform a visual working memory task, found that individuals with major depression performed poorly in an identical task that included emotional content (Holtzworth et al., 2001). This study also assessed the impact of depressed patients on frontal lobes. However, a limitation of the study was that the assessment of depression was based on a self-rating scale and the study did not consider a possible influence of the depressed participant’s current affective state. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed the ability of depressed individuals to engage emotionally in visual working memory, relative to non-depressed controls. Furthermore, depression has been extensively linked to a bias in processing information that is negative and self-related (Kramer et al., 2014; Pacheco-Loures et al., 2012",1

"Question: Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? Answer:  Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? Answer: Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the cells of the prostate gland. It is thought to help protect the prostate against damage that can occur as the age. PSAs serum level can be used for screening and has replaced many prostate biopsies as a means for detecting prostate cancer. However, one concern about PSA is that it levels increases with body mass index. This means that the serum level of Psa may be falsely high in men that are overweight. This paper reviews the pros and cons of whether adjusting Psa should be done for body mass index

Question: What is known about prostate cancer? How was it discovered? Is there a cause? How should we answer the question? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is known about prostate cancer? Answer: The history of prostate cancer research is quite intriguing. In the early years of the 20th century research started to show that high consumption of meat raised on wheat leads to poor health and increased death rates in many countries. In 1909 Nobel prize winner Alfred Blalock and Harvey Cushing did a series of experiments on animals that showed that the major problems in patients on venous shunts could be cured if the lymph nodes were drained. This led to a search for the lymph glands in humans. The lymph glands were found on the posterior wall of the pelvis near the prostate. This area of the body is called the retroperitoneal space. While investigating this area the doctors found a collection of enlarged lymph nodes they named lymphadenosis carcinomata or Lymphadenosis. The name lymphadenosis comes from the two Greek words meaning “lymph” meaning “water” and “aden” meaning “gland”. The men who were having enlarged lymph nodes thought that they were swollen glands that had become cancerous. One of the men whose nodes had become enlarged in this way was a New York fireman named Sigmund Freud (Sigmund was his last name). Freud's father was a famous doctor, but he turned out to be a terrible one. Freud was a young boy who had been very sick. His father’s medical care was dreadful. As a child and as an adult, Freud was very sick. After Freud had surgery and tried to recover from this surgery, he found his glands had become enlarged as seen in men with prostate cancer. He was told by others that he actually had a gland which he called a prostate. The term prostate came from the Greek language “prosta”. The prostate gland sits in the pelvis area between the rectum and the urinary bladder and it produces the semen. Sigmund Freud's father found this location after his own gland had become enlarged. Freud’s father took this area out and told his own patient that his son was the reason his own operation had failed. This caused Freud to become obsessed with how the body worked. Freud worked throughout his life about this idea and his views changed as new science came along. There was also another reason that he developed such a serious illness. The first case of cancer in man was the discovery of an enlarged prostate gland. This was discovered by a French pathologist named Maurice Villemin

Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Tell us about a major advancement in prostate cancer research. Answer: In the 1960's a Japanese researcher named Sato made a groundbreaking discovery – it turns out that prostate cancer grows in the lymph nodes of the pelvis. This gave doctors the opportunity to surgically remove some of the glands in men with the disease and cut down on the amount it spread. Because the cancer can spread it made it possible to control some cases. This enabled many more men to survive for much longer periods of time.",1

Question 1: OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA)

Oral appliance therapy has been shown to improve sleep quality in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Some people experience improvements in their quality of life after wearing oral appliances to keep the airway open during sleep. However, no one has studied the effect of apnea on the exercise capacity of middle-aged and older women. To examine that relationship, I conducted a study in which I compared peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) levels in middle-aged women diagnosed with OSA and healthy women of similar age and body mass index that were not affected by OSA. My results indicated that women with OSA were not impaired in their aerobic endurance capacity compared with healthy women.

Sleep is a normal component of life and is a well-orchestrated process in the body. Sleep is essential for most organs and helps them to function optimally through maintenance of cellular homeostasis, control of body temperature, memory consolidation, and hormone secretion. In addition to promoting physiological changes in the body, sleep also affects psychological parameters, such as well-being and quality of life. Sleep is a complex behavior that requires that many functions of the brain and the rest of neuraxis are coordinated to accomplish different functions during sleep. Sleep deprivation has been associated with cognitive and psychiatric problems, some of which include mood disorders, anorgasmia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It may be important to recognize that sleep disorders can worsen symptoms of other medical conditions (e.g. psychiatric, cardiovascular, and autoimmune diseases). Sleep disorders, particularly OSA, also occur concomitantly with other medical conditions that include diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. People with these medical conditions are more likely to have comorbid sleep disorders.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by intermittent interruption of airflow while sleeping. Clinically, people with OSA repeatedly experience a reduction in ventilation during sleep, which is accompanied by increased blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia), reduced cerebral blood flow, and poor sleep quality. This condition has an estimated prevalence of 50 million people in the United States (Niethammer & Mulaik, 1998). In Europe, up to 10% of adults may have a sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).

Significant OSA-related symptoms and consequences include daytime sleepiness, impaired driving and work performance, fatigue, mood disorders, and hypertension (Bixler et al., 2006). It has been shown in clinical studies that sleep apnea affects the quality of life and that effective treatment of the apnea reduces such complaints. For children and adults, the most common form of sleep-related breathing disorders is obstructive sleep apnea. The incidence of sleep apnea increases with weight gain in the form of obesity.

The prevalence of OSA is greater in the elderly compared to younger populations (Bixler et al., 2006; Reiter et al., 1998). Studies have shown that the risk of developing OSA is increased in the aging population and in persons with a family history of OSA. The apnea episodes often become more severe with age. Moreover, some studies suggest that the prevalence increases with age because of the loss of neck musculature, the accumulation of adipose tissue in the throat, and changes in upper airway compliance (Pillow et al., 1990).

Sleep-breathing disorders are diagnosed during polysomnography (PSG) studies. Polysomnography involves the recording of electroencephalographic (EEG), eye movement (EMG), electrooculographic (EOG) measurements, a measurement of the respiratory effort (breathing effort signals), oxygen saturation, body position, heart rate, and airflow. PSG allows the physician to determine the nature of sleep disruption from apneas, hypopne",1
"Question: The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK? Answer:  The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK?

Melatonin is a hormone synthesized in the pineal gland of the vertebrate brain and a major hormone secreted by the parafollicular cells of the posterior hypothalamus and the adrenal medulla in the periphery. The levels of extracellular (exocrine) melatonin are typically several orders of magnitude higher (molar ratio 0.01-1 :  1) than the intracellular (endocrine) melatonin (molar ratio 0.001-1.00) or the free intracellular (intercellular) melatonin \[[@ref4], [@ref5], [@ref17]\]. In ovines \[[@ref5], [@ref7], [@ref8], [@ref12]\] and rodents \[[@ref16]\], plasma levels of melatonin increase in the nocturnal phase after pinealectomy, indicating that the ewes have no endogenous melatonin and melatonin produced by the parafollicular cells of the pituitary \[[@ref8], [@ref11], [@ref12], [@ref14]\]. The peripheral synthesis of melatonin in the ewe is suppressed by serotonin \[[@ref6]\], while melatonin is released mainly from the intracellular storage in the pinealocytes of the ewe into the circulation when the serotonin levels drop \[[@ref8]\]. Melatonin is considered to be a reliable and sensitive marker of serotonin activity in the blood \[[@ref8], [@ref9], [@ref14], [@ref17]\]. Melatonin plays an important role in the regulation of circadian rhythms including reproduction \[[@ref2], [@ref4], [@ref9], [@ref29]\] and is present in the milk during lactation \[[@ref5]\]. The sheep have circadian rhythms of melatonin secretion in the ovine pituitary \[[@ref4]\]. In the sheep, the release of melatonin is synchronized with the phase of the 24-hour (per)cycle and is regulated by serotonin \[[@ref2], [@ref31]\]. The plasma levels of melatonin rise during the morning and fall during the night \[[@ref2], [@ref17]\].

At present, melatonin is thought to be important mainly for the function of the pineal gland that, in the ewe, consists of only pinealocytes \[[@ref3]\]. At higher concentrations, melatonin influences the release of thyrotropin (thyroxine) and prolactin \[[@ref10], [@ref20]\]). High concentrations of melatonin in the uterus have been associated with hyperphosphoremia and hypercalcemia \[[@ref13]\].

The pineal gland has a limited capacity to synthesize melatonin. As with the liver, the synthesis of melatonin is regulated by hormones and by the availability of the nutrient sulfur \[[@ref1], [@ref19]\]. Sulfur is present in the form of cysteine as a free amino acid in the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney \[[@ref1], [@ref10]\]. The free amino acid sulfate is a major constituent of the intracellular antioxidant. One mechanism that protects tissues from ROS is related to the formation of melatonin by the liver.

The synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland is mediated by the sulfate transporter, sulfate anion transporter 2, through which sulfate is transported out of the pinealocytes \[[@ref25]\]. The role of extracellular levels of melatonin in the blood in the regulation of reproduction has been shown through inhibition of the pituitary release of gonadotropin β subunits \[[@ref24], [@ref30]\] and inhibition of ovulation \[[@ref18]\].

Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent and has multiple therapeutic effects and is used as a first-line drug for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. At the same concentration, metformin has anti-leukemia and anti-cancer properties by targeting adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK) \[[@ref16]\]. Metformin acts in the intracellular compartments, including the mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the cytosol and",1
"Question: Literacy after cerebral hemispherectomy: Can the isolated right hemisphere read? Answer:  Do children with unilateral right cerebral hemispherectomy become bilaterally literate?

Children with Unilateral Right Cerebral Hemispherectomy {#s1}
========================================================

Introduction {#s1a}
------------

The issue of a child's functional abilities is a controversial, sensitive, and potentially life-changing issue (National Research Council 2011). Brain injury produces not only a medical but also a psychological disability, with potential long-term effects. Some individuals with cerebral hemispherectomy do not survive the first post-surgical year, others do not live past their second year. Nevertheless, children who have survived the early stages of post-hemispherectomy development exhibit remarkable cognitive and academic achievements (Maguire and Maguire 2000). For example, a case with a right cerebral hemispherectomy who was educated from kindergarten to sixth grade reported ""I can see a difference between myself and the students who have one eye, and I know what I'm doing with just one hand and one eye. And that's all to do with the right side of my brain... that's where I see the difference"". (Maguire and Maguire 2000). This case illustrates the dramatic, life-changing changes that occur when the function of one or both cerebral hemispheres are altered.

Several authors have proposed that the adult skills of bilateral hemispherectomized subjects may be achieved by compensatory neural plasticity (Segal et al. 2012). In addition, the cognitive and academic functions of bilaterally affected children with unilateral hemispherectomy appear normal (Maguire, 1989). However, because they lack a fully developed right cerebral hemisphere, they could experience difficulties with visual spatial skills, reading, spelling, and math (Herman et al. 1995).

Question: Literacy after cerebral hemispherectomy: Can the isolated right hemisphere read? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Do children with unilateral right cerebral hemispherectomy become bilaterally literate?

Literacy in an Unilateral Hemispherectomized Child {#s1b}
--------------------------------------------------

A 12-year-old child with right hemispherectomy was educated in the local kindergarten (Petersen & Gersch 2004). He was diagnosed with epilepsy prior to the surgery; nevertheless, he was anesthetized for 6 h as a treatment for the seizure disorder. At the age of 16 months, he began to communicate with the only sign he could generate -- a single, isolated eye movement. The parents also observed the child communicating with others and drawing. When he entered first grade, he exhibited a profound, profound developmental delay in language and motor skills. At the age of 3 years and 9 months, he was able to write one of four syllable words (Petersen & Gersch 2004). Despite the fact that he received special assistance from his teachers for approximately three years, his academic skills remained stagnant. Because of the child's parents' desire to have the child educated regardless of his academic abilities, he was placed in a special school for children with disabilities. At the age of 4 years and 9 months, a right hemispherectomy was performed. Three months later, the parents noticed that he could read and spell approximately 100 words. He could correctly identify the family photographs by pointing to them. During the time he was preparing for the current writing and reading tasks, the parents described that he had become more verbal that others of his kindergarten and special school classmates who were similar ages. He explained that his teacher had prepared an academic curriculum for him using a textbook and teacher notes. However, because the child was reluctant to write and read, the teacher was not able to assign him reading or writing assignments.

Question: What were the difficulties that the child encountered in writing? How was he able to read with the help of the teacher? What is the function of the right hemisphere in both writing and reading? How was the isolation of the right hemisphere possibly related to the development of literacy?

Functional Anatomy of the Right Hemisphere in Both Writing and Reading {#s1c}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The writing function in both hemispheres arises from the posterior left lateral temporal parietal and occipital areas, the insula, the ventral premotor cortex, and the anterior cingulate ([@R1]). However, in the right, but not the left hemisphere, writing is also associated with the prefrontal cortex including the frontal eye field and the frontopolar cortex. This prefrontal area may also be involved in speech, as well as in language-specific functions such as semantics and syntax (Kinsbourne & Warrington 1987). However, the prefrontal cortex is not essential for orthographic processing in reading. The anterior prefrontal cortex is associated with inhibition and self-regulation. The right-side prefrontal cortex also has an important role in controlling right",1
"Question: Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible? Answer:  Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible?. For each numbered question, please provide the correct answer. Please explain your reasoning where applicable. For each numbered question, please provide the correct answer. Please explain your reasoning where applicable..

In the first question, the authors explain that it is a known that in pre- and post- menopause the levels of estrogen are much higher in women than men.. This suggests that menopause is a period of increased inflammation and in the first place of increased vasculature dysfunction, a condition that will lead to a cardiovascular disease much earlier than in women that continue hormonal secretion. However, post- menopause there is a loss of vasculature function that leads to endothelial cell dysfunction. This decrease in the number and the function of endothelial cells is what will lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and the appearance of vasculature dysfunction is what triggers the onset of this cardiovascular disease.. Also, in women, estrogen produces a strong anti-inflammatory effect. As the menopause progresses, there is a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine activity and an increase in the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, which are directly related to the onset of cardiovascular disease by increased vascular permeability, increased platelet aggregation, increased plasma viscosity, reduction of fibrinolysis and stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines synthesis, which are responsible for this vasculature deterioration (Vassily et al, 1998; Otsuki et al, 1998; Otsuki et al, 1999). In summary, although it is known that women are protected by high levels of estrogen against the inflammatory process, after menopause all women, regardless of the levels of estrogen, have an increased susceptibility to high plasma viscosity and vascular dysfunction, resulting from the high level of inflammation, which also causes endothelial cell dysfunction.

Response: The first part of question 1 is correct. Post-menopasmac women have decreased vascular function, which is manifested in cardiovascular mortality. It is correct that the cardiovascular disease in menopazis women is not due to vasculature dysfunction but due to increased mortality. However, it must be taken into account that both menopazis women have decreased vascular function and have high mortality.. With the endocrine hypothesis this is a different story because women have high levels of estrogen. However, according to the post-menopazis hormone theory, it must be assumed that without estrogen women become inflammatory, which explains the increased risk of coronary artery disease..

In the second question, firstly, it is evident to see the problem with the statement “The first part of question 1 is correct”. It is not a fact but an assumption which the authors will not know, but they should know that their answer can only be right for a man and not a woman. For the rest, the question is not answered by the authors, since it is about differences in the biology between sexes – they are talking a lot about how inflammation affects all organs, but we must remember that it is menopause that causes the problem to develop in the first place, not inflammation. It is also unknown what does “post-menopasmac women have decreased vascular function” mean and how is it assessed? These are scientific details that we cannot fill because this is not a scientific answer, neither can we evaluate the answer. This point is also a bit strange since after menopazis women develop cardiovascular disease, but we know that menopazis women also develop other types of complications, such as osteoporosis and diabetes.

Response: The second part of question 1 is correct. Post-menopasmac women develop coronary artery disease. It is not an assumption, it is a fact. The vasculature function of menopasmac women is lower as compared to premenopasmatic women.

The third part of this question asks to identify women that develop cardiovascular disease, with an increase in mortality, due to hypertension and that hypertension is not a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and that hypertension and cardiovascular disease are independent factors. The authors do not respond and refer to other questions but the answer to this paragraph depends on whether they are answering according to the ‘endocrine theory’ or not. If they are answering according to the ‘endocrine theory’ that “Women are protected from hypertension by the protective action of estrogen”, the result must be the opposite, and women that develop hypertension are protected against cardiovascular disease.. Also, it is a known fact that hypertension induces endothelial dysfunction, so if there is hypertension without any cardiovascular disease, women must be protected from cardiovascular disease. If they are answering from a different hypothesis that states that “It is due to inflammation",1
"Question: Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught? Answer:  Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught?

Objective: This paper will answer a general question: is it possible to successfully teach skills to a patient with incurable disease?

Scientific 
I, (I am a medical student doing research for my end of studies project and hope to become a GP), wish to study the effect of educational intervention on patients with incurable cancer (with a median survival of between 12 and 36 months). I wish to compare outcomes in patients undergoing my intervention with outcomes in a control group that does not study, but also receives a patient education session. The primary outcome of interest will be the effect on patient satisfaction with life. A secondary outcome will be the effect of patient satisfaction with life on patient anxiety and hope.

Background:
A common concern of patients facing a terminal illness, and even more so a life-limiting illness, is that communication with their physician is perceived as not important. Although they may not be able to make specific changes in their life, some may be able to make change that will help them live a better life. Patients do not see life as a linear process - it involves change as well as continuity. In a similar way, health professionals may not always offer patients specific, evidence-based recommendations, but this does not mean that they do not understand the needs of their patients. As an alternative to advice, patients may want to discuss issues in more complex ways, such as through more emotional communication, and some may wish to discuss a range of complex topics and ask their physician about it.

Design: A three-arm, randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. Patients will be recruited from a specialist oncology service in Sydney. They will not be selected because of their illness, but must have a life-limiting illness. Patients with a life-expectancy of between 12 and 36 months will be considered eligible (at least 12 weeks after the patient has been diagnosed with incurable disease). Patients will be randomised to control or intervention groups with 1:1 and 1:3 ratios, respectively. The control and intervention groups will receive standard care from their specialist hospital palliative care service. Patients allocated to the intervention group will receive a structured patient education session, developed by the medical student leading the study and the patient education supervisor, about patient-physician communication. The session will focus specifically on teaching of important skills such as active listening and empathy that will be expected in the future GP-patient relationship. Patients will be expected to discuss specific, real-life topics that they may like to discuss with their future GP, including death. The intervention group will be expected to use these skills in a similar way to any other patients with similar issues that are discussed clinically by their specialist hospital palliative care service. Patients will be asked about their anxiety levels, hope levels and life satisfaction at baseline and will be tested again six months later. Their GP will be asked to assess his patient’s symptom and stress levels and whether he thinks that his patient would be anxious about the prospect of death at the time of assessment. GPs will be asked to assess his patient’s hope and life satisfaction at baseline and six months later.

Aim: This study will assess if teaching communication skills to patients with incurable disease in a structured patient education session can lead to a long-lasting change in the patient’s ability to discuss more complex issues with their future GP. It will also show if this leads to changes in the levels of patient anxiety, hope and life satisfaction.

Primary Outcome: The primary outcome variable will be patient satisfaction.

Secondary Outcome:
(i) Anxiety will be assessed through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and
(ii) Hope will be assessed through the HOPE Scale.

Methods

The first aim of this study is to assess the effect of teaching communication skills to patients with incurable disease in a structured patient education session on the patient’s ability to discuss more complex issues with their future GP. It will also show if this leads to changes in patient anxiety, hope and life satisfaction.

The second aim is to assess the effect of teaching patient education on patients’ perceptions of their ability to discuss patient-physician communication (active listening and empathy), general satisfaction with life and specific areas of importance to patients.

Setting: At the study hospital in Sydney, Australia.

Participants: Patients from the patients of a specialist palliative care service will be approached by specialist hospital palliative care service staff (either nurses or doctors). The palliative care service provides specialist palliative care for all patients admitted to the hospital, regardless of their diagnosis, whether or not they die on the surgical ward or surgical theatre, or in a rehab unit. The specialist palliative care service will screen all",1

"Question: Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males? Answer:  Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males? This project aims to explore changes in the carotid arterial waveform in young obese males.

Materials and method {#sec1}
====================

A questionnaire was administered in person and by email to 20 male medical students with a BMI \>30. The student volunteers were asked to complete the BMI (kg/m²) and a personal questionnaire concerning their medical and family history. From the personal data obtained, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values, as well as their medication and diet for the previous three months were established. BMI was measured and anthropometric indices were calculated. Blood sampling was conducted after a 10 hour fast and blood pressure (BP) measurements were performed twice at 3 minute intervals, on the right arm after the participant\'s skin had been cleaned with alcohol.

Subsequently, a sphygmomanometer with an OMRON M3 (H/F) digital sphygmomanometric device with oscillometric BP recording was used to obtain the systolic/diastolic BP values. The participant was sitting in an upright position resting with his back and arm supported, with legs uncrossed. This position allowed a constant heart rate with the arm at heart level. After approximately 10 minutes of rest, two measurements of blood pressure were performed for each person. The SBP and DBP were identified as the highest values obtained for systolic. PP was SBP-DBP while MAP was MAP=DBP+1/3 (SBP-DBP).

Arterial stiffness measurement was quantified by means of an applanation tonometry device, the SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical Pty Ltd. Sydney, NSW, Australia). The recording was made using the participant\'s left forearm resting on a large flat platform. The SphygmoCor device measures arterial stiffness by assessing the pulse wave reflection waveform obtained with simultaneous applanation and oscillometric (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia). The tonometry probe consists of a 10 mm diameter semi-rigid cylindrical acrylic tip attached to a piezo-electric crystal via a thin, flexible, stainless steel shaft. As the patient breathes, the volume of air displaced in the ascending aorta moves the probe against the skin producing a measured pressure corresponding to the peak pressure in the aorta. The system monitors the pressure changes in the descending aorta (backward pressure wave) to calculate central aortic pressure, which is a surrogate of the central arterial pressure.

Statistical analysis {#sec2}
====================

To find statistical tests, the data were firstly explored by the application of the Shapiro--Wilk test, which indicates both whether a particular test statistic has a *P*-value higher than 0.05 (indicating normality) and whether the null hypothesis is true. The statistical analysis performed was a correlation analysis using the Pearson\'s r. We applied the Pearson\'s r instead of the Spearman\'s r since the assumption of a positive correlation between variables is more difficult to be assessed when using a coefficient of determination, due to the fact that the linear models are not always appropriate for the data. Because the data were not normally distributed and heteroscedastic, the data of the variables measured in our research were transformed through the natural logarithm and a Box-Cox power transformation \[[@cit0001]--[@cit0003]\].

Results {#sec3}
=======

Results show a significant increase in both PP and MAP ([Table I](#t0001){ref-type=""table""}) in these young obese male patients. There was no statistically significant changes in either the diastolic or the systolic BP.

Question: Do people in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods have higher rates of participation in a national preventive home visit programme for older people? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Do people in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods have higher rates of participation in a national preventive home visit programme for older people?

The research project (RIA-07-007) has received funding from the Department of Culture and Education of the Flemish Government as part of the Science Foundation of Flanders. Flanders has no involvement in this research project.

1. Introduction {#sec001}
===============

The European Prospective Investigation on cardiovascular disease (the EPIC) \[[@pone.0161174.ref001]\] provided evidence for the preventive value of a preventive home-visit programme for older people \[[@pone.0161174.ref002]--[@pone.0161174.ref004]\]. In the EPIC, the Preventive Health-Care (PHC) programme \[[@pone.0161174.ref005]\] was evaluated in several settings. The results showed that preventive home care was beneficial in terms of primary prevention of cardiovascular mortality. Also secondary prevention showed improved clinical outcomes.

The Belgian PHC programme was implemented and evaluated in general practice \[[@pone.0161174.ref006], [@pone.0161174.ref007]\] and showed a significant benefit of the programme on cardiovascular mortality. The current study aims to evaluate the impact of the programme also from a social-distribution point of view.

2. Materials and methods {#sec002}
========================

2.1 Subjects: PHC programme {#sec003}
---------------------------

With the exception of older hypertensive patients (nearly 300/1000, 300/1000/1000 for men and women respectively), eligible subjects were all elderly patients in general practice of the University-Hospital of Ghent (UZGhent) and of the Ziekenhuis-Geestrogen West-Flanders (ZGH), Ghent, all aged 75 or older in 2002. The programme was implemented in three different practices.

### 2.1.1 Ghent University-Hospital (UZ) {#sec004}

The Ghent University-Hospital (UZ) is the main hospital in Flanders. Its primary care centre (Zelfzorg) has a very heterogeneous patient population: 25,000 inhabitants were seen at primary care centre Zelfzorg at UZ in 2003--2004, a primary care centre located in a more deprived urban area (Brabant) of Flanders with 35,000 inhabitants was included in the programme.

### 2.1.2 West-Flanders (ZGH, Ghent) {#sec005}

The hospital (ZGH) is a tertiary hospital (300,000 inhabitants) with a very homogenous patient population of mainly working middle-class people (a high percentage of blue-collar workers, small number of elderly people), and a main primary care centre in Leefdaal (ZGH) with approximately 12,000 inhabitants. In 2004, the first programme was implemented at ZGH.

### 2.1.3 Antwerp (Palland) {#sec006}

The Antwerp (Palland) hospital (400,000) caters more to a working-class population with a high proportion of blue-collar workers (blue-collar workers represented 55% of the total population in 2004 in this hospital). Zeehandelberg (Palland) had no PHC-programme in 2004. In 2006, the second programme started in this hospital. The target population in this hospital included a large proportion of elderly blue-collar workers and an elderly population with a high dependency rate.

2.2 Measures {#sec007}
------------

In order to be eligible for participation in the PHC programme, there were the following requirements: the patient had a valid EPR (entrance form of patient and medical chart for each visit) in the practice, the patient had to undergo at least three consultations with the GP in the last year, and he/she had to be 75 years of age and older in 2004, unless stated differently. Every patient was asked about potential factors of non-participation at the end of the consultation (e.g. no contact with GP in the past ten years, high care dependency).

Every time a patient agreed to participate in the home visit, a PHC team (doctor or nurse) visited the patient in his/her home \",1
"Question: Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles? Answer:  Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles? The objective of your abstract is to summarize the results and conclusions of your paper. A good abstract is concise, specific, and impactful. In general, the abstract contains the conclusions of the paper and describes what the results mean in a manner that is news-worthy. It may briefly describe which experimental methods were used and which animals or which cells were used to create the model.

Abstracts are typically published in the ""Letters to the Editor"" section in the journal in which the journal the author's work is published. In general, we strongly encourage authors to submit or update the abstract they have previously submitted to their journals.

The objective of your abstract is to summarize the results and conclusions of your paper. We also encourage authors to provide an explicit statement on the role of the abstract in relation to the article and to their career. If the abstract provides a summary of the manuscript, we recommend providing at least a three-sentence description of the major findings. The abstract should also provide some idea of what the results mean in the context of the article and should include the most important and relevant references. We recommend that authors who are seeking a job or promotion write one or two additional abstracts to address more explicitly important career outcomes.

The abstract of a published article is an important professional document that represents each author’s research accomplishments. It should concisely explain the main contribution of the paper.

The objective of your abstract is to summarize the results and conclusions of your paper. One way to write the Abstract section of your article is to describe where you have previously been published, to detail the main new results of your paper, and then to point the audience to where they can get the relevant details and results for in-depth analysis. The abstract is a concise summary of the contents of the entire article. It should provide some idea of what the results mean in the context of the article and should include the most important and relevant references.

The abstract should contain the most important and relevant information for readers, highlighting the key findings without the need for extensive reading of the methods and results sections.

The abstract should focus on the main results and conclusions of the report without excessive detail of the methods and results. Abstracts with too much detail usually cause a ""so what"" response. Also, remember that the audience for most abstracts is not scientists but non-experts, such as the people working in human resources and administration. These people need to be reassured that the research results will be useful to them.

Abstracts are generally no longer than 300 words. If you exceed 150 words, you risk losing the chance to summarize the core message. If you exceed 150 words, you will need to do your readers a favor and provide additional information for those who wish to obtain a deeper understanding of the content of your manuscript (e.g. links to the Supplementary [Table S1](#SD1){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}).

The abstract is one of the most frequently cited components of a scientific article. Good abstracts are concise and concise but not excessively brief.

Abstract should be kept to a maximum of 150 words and should address key conclusions of the study. The most important text fragments should not be highlighted as bold or red by paragraph numbers.

Abstracts should be written in the passive, rather than in the objective, passive voice since they are most likely to be summarized and quoted. It is acceptable to describe results, but it is important to describe each result and why your conclusions are made.

"Question: Does the early adopter of drugs exist? Answer:  Does the early adopter of drugs exist?. The abstract should discuss at least 15 points that answer the question. The first draft should be in your best scientific style.

Answer: First, it is clear that not only the early adopters exist, but that there is a tendency to overgeneralize about the characteristics of this group. For example, the ""early adopters,"" as conceived of by the authors of this book, is characterized by high risk-taking (1). Furthermore, the ""early adopter group"" appears to be ""highly entrepreneurial"" (2). Also, the ""early adopters"" appear to be highly ""adopter-resistant"" (3). Also, the ""early adopters"" seem to be ""highly vulnerable."" [4,5] It is important to underline that these characteristics are only ""tendency"" characteristics. They have to be generalized on specific groups of subjects. Thus, characteristics only applied to the group of early adopters will be considered as valid or invalid for other groups of subjects. Further, as it appears from the following sections, if one of these ""tendency"" characteristics is valid, this does not mean that there will be another ""tendency"" for the same group of subjects. Thus, if one of these characteristics is considered as valid for a particular group of subjects, the validity of the characteristics is not transferable to other groups.

Question: Is the early adopter of drugs a new group? How do some characteristics of the early adopter of drugs differ from those of the early adopter of other technologies? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the following question: Is the early adopter of drugs a new group? The abstract should discuss at least 15 points that answer this question. The first draft should be in your best scientific style.

Answer: This is an open problem. The early adopter of new drug therapies may be a recent phenomenon. However, the early adoption of new technologies (2, 4, 6) and health technologies in general (3, 7) has been repeatedly documented. Some characteristics appear to common to the three types of ""early adopters"": they seem to share, for example, a high need or demand for solutions, high self efficacy in solving their problems in a technological way, they seem to be optimistic about the technological development in the long term, and they appear to expect the ""early adopters"" of new technologies to receive benefits. They differ, however, in many respects. For example, the early adopter of new drug therapies seems to be motivated by the lack of an alternative therapy that offers a cure without side effects, or that can be taken daily. The early adopters of new technologies appear to be motivated by economic advantage and by the opportunity to be involved in the creation of new technology (3, 6, 7, 8). The early adopters of health technologies are motivated by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of medical treatment (3, 6, 8). The early adopters of new technologies appear to be more involved than the early adopters of new therapeutic developments. They are more involved because they are expected to pay for a new technological product by their tax money. It appears that, on the contrary, the early adopters of new drug treatments are more involved because they can also suffer from the adverse effects of the treatments if they do not have a guarantee. They also appear to be more involved because the new therapies appear to offer more hope for a cure, while the technology adopted as part of their daily life does not (8).

Question: What is the role and importance of early adopters? Explain at least 15 points about the role and importance of the early adopter of drugs. The abstract should be written in your best scientific style.

Answer: First, the early adoption of new therapies appears to lead to higher chances of benefit for the early adopter (9). In addition, new technology tends to be adopted in developing countries (10). However, technology adoption may often be associated with low rates of access to health care in these countries (10). The early adoption of new drugs has also been associated with higher mortality than expected for those taking the drugs (11, 12). Second, the early adoption of new drugs may help to contain the costs (13, 12, 14, 15, 16) if more than one early adopter is willing to finance a new drug. Third, drug company representatives are aware of the early adoption of new technologies before the new technology reaches the general public (17). As the general public is usually less aware than the early adopters of new developments, there is an opportunity for the industry to intervene in the process of adoption by the early adopters. This might lead to further market dominance (18) or to a delay of introduction of the technology (18, 19). Fourth, new drugs are more often approved for ""orphan diseases"" which seem",1

The information I've provided for you will help you to get what you need quickly and easily,
but at some point it might even be worth making a decision one way or another about the

risk of chronic back pain.

Most people when they talk about
health have in mind individual medical conditions. Examples include

You can ask yourself
a question (as I did) like:

Does high blood pressure reduce the risk of chronic low back pain?

or, if you're doing
work on a topic, like in epidemiology, you might

Find out whether there are a set of risk factors that can be used to predict who will have chronic low back pain.

You might talk to a different group of people and find
that they have different things in their mind. I might be worried that the exercise I've
described above might be too simple but, rather, I might prefer this question - does a good

"Question: Nasal fractures: is closed reduction satisfying? Answer:  Nasal fractures: is it important to treat them surgically?

Surgical Techniques and Tips

Questions

Questions: Nasal fractures: does surgical or conservative treatment of nasoethmoid fractures are better?

Nasoethmoid fractures are rare, but severe injuries that can compromise vision, respiration, or both. Naso-ethmoidal fractures are often caused by impacts from blows to the face or in car accidents in cases of head-on crashes with the forehead directed against the steering wheel, a mechanism that results in a blow of the lateral orbital floor and its medial wall with the subsequent formation of fractures of the naso-ethmoidal complex. There are various types of fractures in this series. In particular, there are naso-ethmoido-sphenoid fractures, naso-ethmoido-maxillary fractures, fractures of the sphenoid wing, and frontal fractures.

Several studies have been published on the treatments of patients with these fractures, but there is no consensus on the ideal form of therapy. Many physicians and surgical centers prefer surgical approach in many cases due to the fact that the treatment of this severe injury is always difficult and often requires additional surgical interventions. At the same time, a conservative treatment of these fractures can be a useful treatment option with no need to surgical reduction and fixation. However, in the case of fractures on the lateral walls of orbital floor, it is also possible to fix the orbit with osteosynthesis alone, leaving the naso-ethmoidal complex in place and avoiding surgery.

As a result of many medical publications on the issue and in the absence of any other literature, we intend to provide information on the treatment options.

Review of the Literature

There are many articles and studies published on the treatment and evaluation of fractures of different types. According to several papers, fractures usually occur on the floor of sphenoid sinus, and the medial wall of ethmoidal canal. According to Zagulinski [8], fractures of the orbital floor without fracture of surrounding bone and frontal bone fractures can be treated surgically or by nonsurgical therapy alone. The paper by Choudhry et al. [10] reviews the role of nasal bone fracture fixation surgery, showing the advantage of surgical approach. The paper Zagulinski [8] provides a classification of nasoethmoid fractures: type A: sphenoidal wing fractures; type B: medial wall fractures; type C: lateral wall fractures; type D: medial and lateral wall fractures and fractures with concomitant fracture of the zygomatic arch. According to Zagulinski [8], the medial wall fractures usually have good prognosis with conservative approach, lateral wall fractures have poorer prognosis and require a surgical approach with a high risk of orbital complication, and fractures of the zygomatico-nasal complex usually require a surgical approach. Another paper by Zagulinski [8] emphasizes that fractures of the nasoethmoidal complex generally affect the orbital floor, lateral nasal wall, and sphenoidal wing. These fractures have a poor prognosis and require surgical treatment.

The paper Sivarajah et al. [9] emphasizes that nasoethmoid fracture may affect any part of the nasoethmoidal complex. Nasoethmoid fractures often involve fracture of the nasal spine and floor, zygomatic wall, and sphenoidal wing, and often cause fractures of the maxillary and maxillary sinuses. Surgical approach provides good esthetic results and has a low morbidity, while conservative treatment with nasal splinting may reduce nasal bleeding and edema and provide good results.

Most complications of nasoethmoidal fractures are associated with orbital fractures. There is a relatively high morbidity in patients with naso-ethmoidal fractures and nasal fractures. However, the treatment of these fractures requires complex medical and technical treatment and depends on many factors.

There are published studies on conservative or surgical treatment [10], [11]–[15]. Many papers show that the injury is associated with a high number of complications [3], [11], [12], [14–16] and has a high risk for orbital complications [13], [15], [16]. Nasal fractures lead to high intraoperative bleeding and increase the risk of orbital compartment syndrome with subsequent permanent vision loss. Therefore, these injuries should be treated with surgical approach [10], [12].

Fractures of the orbital roof and of the maxilla and maxillary sinuses have a lower chance of complication but sometimes require surgical approaches to minimize the damage to nearby structures [16]. The papers by Zagulinski [8] and Kim [17] indicate that the treatment of fractures of the orbital floor and lateral nasoethmoid wall requires surgical approach with no need of",1
"Question: Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival? Answer:  Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival?

Background
==========

Child survival rates have improved dramatically in the last two decades, but in some regions of the world the gap between child death and survival has been widening again \[[@B1]\]. Improving the health of women is an investment which contributes to overall improvements in health and nutrition and which improves the health of their offspring \[[@B2]\]. The health of women, children, and infants depends on the resources that reach and function to their benefit (Figure[1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}). The evidence for the effectiveness of programs and for the effectiveness of interventions is, therefore, of particular importance.

![Interactions in the care continuum.](1471-2458-12-S4-S4-1){#F1}

Reviewing the evidence on the effectiveness of program services
==============================================================

There is little randomised controlled trial evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeting specific components in the continuum of care (Figure[1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}). Many studies have looked at single interventions, such as vaccinations \[[@B3]\] or clean water and safe sanitation \[[@B4]\]. However, when these components are delivered together with activities and interventions from the rest of the continuum of care, evidence is weaker \[[@B5]\]. Evidence on the effectiveness of services along the continuum of care can be gathered by systematically reviewing all relevant literature.

Searching and reporting of systematic reviews can be confusing. Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions are published using specific formats, which are reviewed and approved by the Editorial Board, including the review authors and the Cochrane Editorial Team \[[@B6]\]. They are also scrutinised for quality by the Editorial Board before they are published. There is no similar process for identifying published systematic reviews, which are only searched by title, abstract and keywords. One way of dealing with this issue is to use the following criteria: we chose a broad search term such as 'child survival'; we sought as wide a search as possible; we chose non-indexed journals (ie journals not listed by MEDLINE) as a limitation; we searched only published articles (ie we excluded unpublished literature); we only considered interventions identified as having a high confidence of benefit and as requiring urgent action by the World Health Organization. In this way, the criteria used were wide and our findings are applicable to all child health interventions.

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 18 June 2011), Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and other non-indexed citations (18 to 18 June 2011), Embase (1982 to 18 June 2011) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2010, Issue 2 of The Cochrane Library to identify systematic reviews of interventions in low-income and middle-income countries that addressed child birth and perinatal health or child growth and nutrition. Child survival interventions in sub-Saharan Africa that were conducted in the period 1980 to 2003 were identified by searching four databases -- PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science databases.

We used the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group's definitions of terms relating to interventions ('interventions' includes non-drug therapies, as well as drug therapies; ""exclusion"" includes'reviews' and does not include'systemic reviews' as described in the World Health Organization definition.) \[[@B7]\]. For the search strategies in the two main sections, 'child survival interventions' and 'child health interventions', the search terms are contained in Additional file [1](#S1){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}: Tables S1 and S2. For other interventions, the search terms are listed in Additional file [2](#S2){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}. The first search included terms 'interventions' and 'child survival'. The second search combined these with terms for child health. The search was limited to systematic reviews, using Cochrane's definition of this type of review. The searches were limited to 1980; 2000; 2004; and 2006, since this was the time when the review authors defined a decade covering these years as the last relevant time prior to their review to answer the original question.

We checked the references lists of retrieved reviews to locate additional reviews and we checked the list of authors for additional work on the effectiveness of the interventions in question. We checked the relevant literature for the review, including all of the included review's own references, and other relevant reviews cited within the review.

"Question: Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa? Answer:  Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa?

In general, spontaneous remission occurs in small- and medium-sized vessel vasculitis in approximately 5-21% of adult and 15-70% of childhood cases. As an example, Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of childhood vasculitis.

"Question: Gluten tolerance in adult patients with celiac disease 20 years after diagnosis? Answer:  The main objective of our study is to determine the prevalence of celiac disease in adult patients after 20 years of follow-up.

Background: Celiac disease is a common multiautoimmune disorder, its prevalence is increasing and it is one of the most serious food intolerances. It is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the genetic defect of the HLA-DQ molecules, when in contact with gluten in wheat, barley or rye. The condition is not permanent, with dietary treatment, a cure is possible. Thus, there is a need for studies to help us better understand the clinical condition of the patient and the patient’s family so that we can plan and manage preventive treatment and follow-up.

Materials and methods: Observational epidemiological study by questionnaire including patients diagnosed with celiac disease between years 2004 and 2015 in four primary care areas.

Results: The group of patients included in the study comprises 1412 patients (mean age 50,8 years), 463 men (33%) and 949 (67%) women. The mean follow-up period was 11,3 years (range 0–25 years). The average time since gluten ingestion was at diagnosis was 12,13 years (range 0 to 28 years). According to patients’ answers, in the last 20 years, the disease has been stable or has increased in 51,4% in the group. In 13,6% the disease has been worsening and in 34,9% there were complications.

Conclusion: The percentage of adults with celiac disease increased in last 20 years due to factors associated with the celiac disease not only with the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, such as the availability of genetic testing and an increase in the knowledge of the disease and its treatment.

Objective: To evaluate the correlation between presence of endocrine and gastrointestinal symptoms, the role of hormones and glucose in the pathogenesis of celiac disease and treatment of celiac disease patients.

Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on a sample of 60 celiac disease patients. Patients were examined using questionnaires about gastrointestinal symptoms, presence of celiac disease, presence of diseases associated with celiac disease, use of treatment, and presence of psychiatric diseases. Samples of venous blood were taken and analyzed.

Results: The most common symptoms reported by celiac disease patients were diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, vomiting, joint pain, and depression. Celiac disease patients had increased levels of insulin, triglycerids and lipoprotein in the blood. A significant difference was observed between the group with celiac disease and patients without celiac disease regarding the presence of depression, abdominal and joint pain, use of a laxative, diarrhea, flatulence, bloating, and vomiting.

Conclusion: The symptoms of celiac disease increase the levels of some endocrine hormones (insulin, lipids) and glucose in the blood. These hormones may be used in the study of inflammatory and intestinal pathophysiology of celiac disease. These hormones could be used in clinical practice.

Background: Celiac disease has been called a life-threatening auto-inflammatory disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of current medical treatment of celiac disease. Objective: To answer the research question: What is the effectiveness of current medical treatment of patients with celiac disease.

Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on 60 of patients diagnosed with celiac disease. Patients were evaluated using a questionnaire about gastrointestinal symptoms, presence of celiac disease, presence of diseases associated with celiac disease and use of treatment. Samples of venous blood were also analyzed with respect to the presence of celiac disease.

Results: Celiac disease had intestinal, joint and other symptoms associated with the disease, which increased the use of oral, topical, systemic medications and gluten-free diets, and reduced the use of nutritional supplements and probiotics.

Conclusion: Medical treatment had a positive impact on gastrointestinal symptoms, the use of medications and the quality of life and also the ability to perform daily activities.

Background: The aim of this study was to show characteristics and evolution of celiac disease in children to improve the therapeutic management of patients with celiac disease.

Material and methods: It is an observational cross-sectional case series conducted on 40 children. The patients were seen on the Celiac Disease Unit of the Pediatrics Department of Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital between December 2015 and November 2016.

Results: The mean age was 10.95±1.62 years. Patients had diarrhea in 90% of cases and weight loss, in 67% of cases. At diagnosis, 39% of the children were overweight and 14% obese, 7% had osteoporosis. All cases had a positive genetic HLA DQ2 or DQ8",1

Logistic regression model predicting COPD in smokers as a function of symptoms.

Answer: What symptoms predict COPD in smokers? (Question answered by study author)

Sputum production: The odds ratio for sputum production (defined as “Often have phlegm”) was 1.3 (95% CI 1.2–1.4, p <.001), after adjusting for: age, gender, comorbid conditions, medication, smoking, FEV1, and FEV1 percentage.

Dyspnea: The odds ratio for dyspnea, defined as feeling winded when walking a distance (e.g., going up 10 steps) indoors or outdoors, was 1.5 (95% CI 1.3–1.6, p <.001), after adjusting for: age, gender, comorbid conditions, medication, smoking, FEV1, and FEV1 percentage.

Dyspnea:The odds ratio of feeling short of breath walking a distance indoors or outdoors, was 1.5 (95% CI 1.3–1.7, p <.001), after adjusting for: age, gender, comorbid conditions, medication, smoking, FEV1, and FEV1 percentage.

"Question: Search engine as a diagnostic tool in difficult immunological and allergologic cases: is Google useful? Answer:  Search engine as a diagnostic tool in difficult immunological and allergologic cases: is Google useful?

Answer {#section2-2050313X17713990}
======

*How to define difficult cases in immunological and allergological fields?*

We must first make clear what difficult cases we are talking about. Difficult cases are not difficult for a person who has the medical skill that we usually have or for a general practitioner, but are difficult in the sense that we cannot make diagnoses based on the information we have. The most obvious examples are cases where the diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and the patient is not aware of all the data, while the general practitioner has seen many similar patients and can make a diagnosis (expectant management of uncomplicated cystic mastitis is such a case). The following clinical cases are difficult because of the poor prognosis for the cure or the diagnosis is very difficult to make (eg. vasculitis).

In a case when a diagnosis is difficult (or even impossible) based on the information we have and we think that a new immunological or allergological diagnostic technique may lead to a better outcome, we should search the medical literature with Google. The most recent references found for the searched disease, term or combination may be more useful than earlier references because our database of indexed scientific literature (MEDLINE) is dynamic and contains papers published in journals we are not usually reading.

The search usually consists of the following steps:

1.  \(1\) Identifying the topic we are interested in;

2.  \(2\) Creating a medical subject heading to narrow the search;

3.  \(3\) Entering free text terms. If we search for ""fever of unknown origin"", we do not want to just look for causes of fever, for example, we rather want to find references about specific infections than just about fevers in general. The same situation is when searching for vasculitis but this time we want to find vasculitis as such, not only vasculitis of various types;

4.  \(4\) We can narrow the search further by using Boolean operators (eg. ""and"" or ""or""). The Boolean operator ""OR"" means that we only look for one answer (for example, if the answer is ""A + B"" and we look for ""A"", we can still find the answer ""B""). For ""AND"" we can look for both ""A"" and ""B"", or at least for a paper with both A and B;

5.  \(5\) The time parameter: we want to find only the most recent references; in our example (fevers of unknown origin) the most recent time we may be interested in is 3 years.

What we find is usually different from what we expect but, at least, it is useful. We have to check the paper and assess its usefulness in our own case. Papers we find but which have not answered some unanswered questions are useless, while useful papers would not have been found.

For example, in one clinical case described here, we used Google to search the medical literature for an answer to the question: ""Is the cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity reaction in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CADTH) related in any way to the occurrence of photosensitivity in patients suffering from this dermatologic cutaneous disorder?""

Case presentation {#section3-2050313X17713990}
=================

An 18-year-old girl was investigated because she complained of a recent occurrence of pruritus, after the second pregnancy. She used to apply moisturizing creams. At first, only her hands were scratched. After a few weeks, the same itching was noticed at her face and her arms. Initially she had no trouble and she did the usual activities. Then, over a few weeks, she became unwell. She noticed a burning sensation and developed a very dry skin. Three times, on her legs, she had a blister that was drained and the skin was treated with steroid ointment. The burning sensation persisted. The pruritus was unbearable and the pruritus was accompanied by dysestesia, paresthesia and pain in her fingers. At her arms, the fingers were also swollen and sensitive. There were no signs of infection. She had a generalized cutaneous erythema and edema.

On examination, we noted a very dry and scaly dermatosis, especially on the cheeks, ears and neck. The skin was very painful to the touch and was sensitive to the light. It also had a dry, scaling, fissured aspect. Skin biopsy revealed a nonspecific inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells and histi",1
"Question: Uniformity of evidence-based treatments in practice? Answer:  Uniformity is the only standard by which to judge effective treatments for a specific disorder. Make it a research article, and have at least four sections in your paper. The abstract must be no longer than 150 words, not counting any heading or subtitle.

Answer: We believe that uniformity is the only standard by which to judge effective treatments, because in an effective treatment, its efficacy is uniform for all patients.

1. Introduction {#sec1-jcm-04-01332}
===============

In the past decades, researchers and clinicians have made progress in the treatment of different forms of pain in clinical practice. In contrast, researchers and clinicians are less inclined to support effective treatments for diseases. When research reveals an effective therapy for a specific disease, the therapy is adopted more rapidly; when the effects of a therapy are observed first, the therapy is more likely to be accepted. Researchers are less interested in whether a therapy affects all, most, some, or few patients. The treatment may be ineffective for less than some patients, but it could be effective for all patients, as long as it has the same efficacy for different patients.

In clinical practice, the most important problem for patients seeking treatment from any practitioner is not the individual treatment, but the effectiveness of the treatment for particular diseases. For example, the most important problem for patients seeking psychological treatment is not the individual therapist, but whether the therapy was effective for all, most, some, or none of the patients. When medical treatments have been used in clinical practice, the physicians may be more inclined to judge whether the treatment has different effects for different patients. However, when a treatment has proved effective to relieve pain, a patient seeking treatment from pain therapists may feel worried about the uniformity of the success of the therapy for different diseases. We are interested in whether the treatment for different diseases is more or less uniform.

This study aimed to examine the uniformity for effective treatments in practice. The purpose was to explore whether the uniformity of effective treatments in clinical research has also affected effective treatment in clinical practice. It is of interest whether this uniformity is more important or less important for clinicians than for researchers. Because the effectiveness of a treatment may vary when it is applied to different diseases, it may be hypothesized that the uniformity of treatment for pain is more important for pain researchers.

2. Methods {#sec2-jcm-04-01332}
==========

The treatment of pain is based on three factors: the mechanisms of pain, pain intensity measures, and effective treatments \[[@B1-jcm-04-01332]\]. Our purpose was to focus on effective treatments for the specific disorder in question. Here we defined an effective treatment as being able to improve pain of the same kind in all patients.

2.1. Search Strategy {#sec2dot1-jcm-04-01332}
--------------------

First, we performed a review of systematic and narrative evidence concerning effective treatments for chronic pain. We searched the literature using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar without a time limit. For each article, we recorded any information about the author, year of publication, journal, and language. If there were multiple references to one article, the language and other details were recorded. To search for relevant literature, we used specific search terms that are appropriate given the scope and goal of the review. The general search terms, ""effective"" and a variety of other terms, were combined with various terms for pain in various disorders, such as ""pain"", ""osteoarthritis"", ""musculo-skeletal"", ""joint"", ""post-surgery"", ""headaches"", ""spontaneous pain"", ""pain neuropathy"", ""spinal cord injury"", ""chronic back pain"", ""lumbago"", ""carpal tunnel syndrome"", ""neck pain"", ""whiplash injury"", ""pain and pain relief"", ""chronic pain"", ""phantom pain"", ""migraine"", ""pain syndromes"", ""cancer pain"", ""end-of-life pain syndrome"", ""crises and distress"", ""anxiety and depression"". We also searched for systematic reviews of these pain syndromes. If the articles contained information about the effective treatments, but no information about their efficacy for different patients with similar pain, we focused on the effectiveness of an intervention for ""typical patients"".

2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria {#sec2dot2-jcm-04-01332}
--------------------------------------

The literature in this study included literature from the following sources: systematic reviews, systematic treatment of pain journals, and other review articles about effective treatments for specific forms of pain. The evidence was analyzed from the following aspects: whether the studies reported on the efficacy or effectiveness; whether the studies were randomized or",1

Introduction

Medical referees are responsible for assessing the fitness of seafarers in order to rule out serious illness or injury. However, doctors from around the world disagree when assessing the fitness of seafarers because of variations in clinical interpretation and practice across different countries. Therefore, I wanted to look at how doctors assess seafarers' fitness.

Assessing seafarers' fitness can be challenging for doctors because it involves assessing a number of different competences that each have different requirements in terms of education and training. In addition, there is the difficulty of assessing if fitness for seafaring is compromised by other work-related problems. It is also important to examine seafarers' fitness as well as the fitness of the ship and environment before embarking on a long-term deployment.

Method

To look into the clinical interpretation and practice of doctors in the UK, a literature review was done. In this review, the search scope was to examine whether doctors, as doctors and medical officers, and medical referees as a group, agree on the fitness of seafarers.

Research and Method

The literature review considered articles where experts reviewed seafarers' fitness and assessed fitness for seafaring, including articles on medical interpretation and assessment in general. The review was done through a PubMed search of studies published over the last 20 years. This review used three main search terms: (1) ""fitness training""; (2) ""fitness to sea""; and (3) ""rehabilitation.""

A total of 823 papers were reviewed, and the title, abstract, clinical interpretation, and main findings of each were extracted and summarized. Most of the papers came from the USA and the UK. After reviewing the main findings of each paper, several of the findings were consistent and representative of fitness for seafaring.

Results

I included the three main findings I extracted from these studies and summarized in this chapter. Table 1.1 lists references of these studies and the main findings. These findings include the clinical interpretation of fitness for seafaring; training standards needed to determine fitness for seafaring; medical guidelines; and research studies. I then compared the findings and examined the main differences and similarities between these three major findings. Table 1.1 is the third of the three main findings extracted from the literature review of these articles.

  * • Clinical interpretation

Clinical interpretation has been a debated topic for some time. One of the main reasons for this discussion is the lack of standardized fitness assessment procedures. For example, fitness for seafaring was assessed with various criteria in the past. However, most of the current fitness criteria were created by various bodies to establish guidelines and rules for fitness and for the licensing process. The current process involves the seafarer taking an initial medical examination, which includes a clinical assessment from the British Medical Council (BMC) and a fitness assessment from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). Fitness for seafaring can be classified into two categories: fitness for long-term seafaring (including all those with medical conditions that make them unsuitable for a long-term seagoing assignment) and fitness for sea service (all those that have a specific fitness requirement based on the job). The medical officer has to assess the seafarer's eligibility to determine fitness for seafaring, and the doctor must report their assessment in writing to the MCA to determine if the seafarer is fit.

The medical officer must also provide an opinion to the MCA of any serious health issues that may compromise a seafarer's safe assignment for long-term sea service, including mental illness, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. The fitness assessment can be performed by fitness officers or medics; the exam involves objective and general fitness training and physical tests, such as walking the crew down the hallway of the ship. The fitness officer also takes the fitness test.

The criteria to assess fitness for seafaring are laid down in the MCA regulations. The standards and guidelines to assess fitness for seafaring are laid down in the MCA ""Fitness for Sea Service"" (FSS) regulations (MCA 2008). These cover the assessment of seafaring fitness by the fitness officer in the medical examination, the fitness officer on board the vessel, and the fitness officer if a medical examination must be performed and a physical examination of the seafarer is required. Fitness officers are specialists, like",1
"Question: Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors? Answer:  are we missing some prognostic factors?

Objective: The objective of the present study was to assess the occurrence and prognosis factors of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-1, HRS-2, and type I HRS) in patients with cirrhosis. Patients and methods: We included 114 consecutive patients with cirrhosis of whom 41 (36.9%) had cirrhosis associated to HRS. We compared all clinical and biochemical features, echographic findings and laboratory parameters at the onset of HRS with the outcome of HRS. Results: There was no significant difference between survivors and non-survivors with regard to prothrombin time (PT), INR, platelets, blood creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, ammonia, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, serum albumin, creatinine clearance, hemoglobin, serum sodium and potassium, serum sodium, serum albumin, and liver function tests. The mean pro-albumin was significantly lower in non-survivors (17.3 +/- 5 g/dl vs. 34.5 +/- 8.5, p=0.0017). Mean spleen size was significantly higher in non-survivors (13.1 +/- 3 vs. 8.5 +/- 2.6 cm, p=0.0001). Child’s score was significantly higher in non-survivors (23.9 +/- 5.2 vs. 12.2 +/- 8, P<0.001). The mortality attributable to HRS was 50 %, and the mortality attributable to portal-systemic encephalopathy 50% in the non-diuretic group. Conclusion: In our cohort, HRS was responsible for 50% of the death, even the death attributable to PSE occurred only in 50% of non-diuretic cases. The absence of spleen enlargement, smaller liver span, and lower pro-albumin levels correlated with the worsening of the renal function in patient’s with cirrhosis and HRS.

Introduction

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a syndrome marked by severe liver impairment with dysfunction of the kidneys, which in clinical practice presents as ascites or oliguria and is one of the life-threatening complications of end-stage liver disease. The clinical manifestations are protean, ranging from a simple hepato-renal syndrome with ascites to severe refractory vasodilatation [1]. According to the Mayo Clinic classification, a patient in this condition can be classified as having HRS-1, HRS-2, or type I HRS [2]. HRS is generally associated with advanced liver diseases, notably cirrhosis of the cirrhotic patients with ascites, and the overall survival ranges from 20 to 90% at 4 weeks after diagnosis of HRS [3]. HRS is a complex entity that has a multifactorial etiology involving alterations in the hemodynamic and neurohormonal balance that affect the kidneys and the liver. The mechanism of renal injury is a complex subject that does not have a single etiologic factor and includes both systemic vasodilation, mainly at the arteriolar level, as well as local changes occurring in the kidneys.

As far as the liver injury, a number of pathophysiological mechanisms has been suggested, including the so-called ""hepato-renal syndrome factor"" [4]. HRS is frequently observed in patients with end-stage cirrhosis who, according to the Mayo Clinic, present a poor prognosis, and these patients suffer from severe hepatic impairment and renal impairment, which may be independent of coexisting liver disease [1,5]. At the onset of HRS there is a rapid decrease in renal flow secondary to decreased vascular resistance accompanied by an elevated systemic vasopressin level [6]. This is often associated with a large splanchnic vasodilation characterized by a decreased splanchnic blood flow and a high splanchnic extraction in oxygen (a decrease in splanchnic oxygen consumption) [7]. With these alterations, it is not clear whether the liver and the kidneys play the major role in the development of HRS [8],[9].

A recent prospective study with a median follow up of 60 months suggested that the survival was lower for non-diuretic HRS (50%) than for diuretic ones (78%) [10]. The survival in patients with refractory ascites (50%) was similar to that in those with diuretic treatment (78%), and both were worse than survival with HRS associated with liver diseases (86%).

In this situation, the survival among different cirrhosis related HRS, it is important to identify new prognostic and predictive factors or, on the contrary, those that are associated with",1

How does brachytherapy work?

Brachytherapy works by introducing high concentrations of lethal energy into malignant cells, causing them to die. Brachytherapy techniques are highly specific, as they allow a high degree of control of the dose distribution and its time and depth distribution in the tumor. In many malignancies, such as cervical cancer, brachytherapy is the preferred treatment modality due to the absence of significant collateral damage and the highly specific nature of the technique.

Treatment planning

The most important step in a brachytherapy procedure is treatment planning. This involves determining the brachytherapy’s dose prescription and the best technique to deliver that dose. The dose prescription is the total prescribed dose to the tumor that will deliver the desired dose distribution. The goal of treatment planning is to provide a dose volume histogram (DVH) that will be as homogeneous as possible. With cervical cancer treatment, the dose prescription ranges from 50 to 70 Gy. Treatment plan quality is determined by the degree of uniformity, accuracy in dose coverage of the tumor and sparing of healthy tissues. When a patient is treated for cervical cancer with brachytherapy, planning CT scan usually takes place one month before the initiation of the procedure and is a baseline CT scan for radiation dose planning purposes.

The radiation oncologists and physicists involved in a brachytherapy procedure will determine the appropriate treatment length and diameter of the device to deliver the desired dose to the tumour. The treatment plan is then written in tandem with an American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) brachytherapy template. Once the patient is treated and has a follow-up, CT scans are taken using the brachytherapy planning template and are included in treatment reporting. The purpose of the CT scan is to confirm the position of the sources, source dwell times, and other parameters critical to brachytherapy in order to accurately deliver the dose and have an excellent brachytherapy treatment.

Image-guided brachytherapy

With image-guided brachytherapy, all of the steps involved in the preparation of a cervix cancer patient for brachytherapy can be performed with the patient under imaging guidance. Brachytherapy using external beam radiation may then be delivered more precisely, often on the same day as the standard external beam radiotherapy. Furthermore, with the patient already immobilized for brachytherapy, the external beam radiation treatment plan will be adapted for the planned brachytherapy dose, increasing the planning accuracy, leading to a more homogeneous dose distribution [1].

Image guidance can be by an ultrasound, which is a real time imaging modality and has the advantage of being a highly accurate modality. The patient may move as the image is obtained under ultrasound. Another modality for brachytherapy",1

"Question: Does the familial transmission of drinking patterns persist into young adulthood? Answer:  Does the familial transmission of drinking patterns persist into young adulthood? This report examines the relationship between adolescent alcohol use and parental alcohol consumption. A sample of 9-18-year-old alcohol users and abstainers was observed to identify the relationship between the number of parental alcohol users and the adolescent's drinking pattern, and the effect of parental alcohol use when accounting for the presence of other risk factors. The adolescent's age, gender, racial identity, and socioeconomic status were considered. Adolescent drinking patterns revealed the influence of parental drinking patterns, and the contribution in determining the familial transmission of drinking patterns. The analysis indicated the significant relationship between parental alcohol consumption and the adolescent's drinking pattern. Adolescent drinking patterns were affected by the parental alcohol consumption, even after the effect of socioeconomic status, age, and gender were controlled. This finding reinforces the hypothesis that childhood exposure to alcohol results in the familial transmission of drinking patterns. The implications for preventing the spread of alcohol use through the family and for future studies are addressed.",1
"Question: Proof of concept study: does fenofibrate have a role in sleep apnoea syndrome? Answer:  “Does Fenofibrate reduce the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea?”.

Introduction

Sleep disturbance and excessive daytime sleepiness are a major complaint in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS patients have high prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and many studies show that both can be associated with each other. The mechanisms involved are unknown, but they are likely to be multifactorial due to several associations. Our aim was to study if fenofibrate, an adipogenic PPARalpha agonist, could reduce the severity of OSAS, including daytime sleepiness by performing a study which is a proof of concept project.

Materials and methods

This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, single centre trial in 20 patients with a diagnosis of mild to severe apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) (≤30/h or ≥5/h at night) and a body mass index (BMI) >or= 25kg/m2. Patients used fenofibrate (150mg/day) (n = 10) or placebo, randomly allocated for 6 months. Objective evaluation included overnight polysomnography every two month and measurement of subjective daytime sleepiness using Epworth sleepiness scale. The protocol called was approved by the national authority and all patients gave informed consent. AHI was used to diagnose the disease and evaluate the severity.

Results

Severity of OSAS was reduced (p=0.04) in the fenofibrate treated group and increased in the placebo treated group with no statistically significant difference between groups. Daytime sleepiness improved in both groups (p<0.001) and was significantly better in the fenofibrate group (p=0.013).

Conclusions

For the first time, we observed that fenofibrate could reduce the severity of OSAS in patients with no previous treatment. The reduction of daytime sleepiness, without any additional effects on AHI suggest its mechanism of action could be related to the metabolism of sleep-stabilizing neurotransmitters.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and other sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome (RLS), myoclonus urticaria (MU), restless leg syndrome (RLS); are common sleep disorders with a significant impact on quality of life in the general population but little is known about the management of these conditions in OSAS patients as the majority of studies focus on RLS in those with MS with possible confounding effects from medications used to treat MS. One treatment that is under investigation in those with OSAS as well as RLS is the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor alpha (PPARalpha) activator fenofibrate.

Objective

To assess the impact of short term treatment with fenofibrate on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in patients with established OSAS.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a common sleep related breathing disorder characterized by snoring/obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and in 30-40% of the patients, secondary symptoms such as snoring, fatigue, and excess daytime sleepiness. Obesity appears to be the major risk factor for OSAS. OSAS is also observed in patients with the metabolic syndrome (MS), which is a major cardiovascular risk factor. The mechanisms underlying the close relation between OSAS and OSAS to other metabolic disorders such as central obesity are unknown. Adipose tissue is now regarded as a distinct tissue whose cells, named adipocytes, are metabolically active but also have important endocrine properties. Among the adipocytokines, adiponectin appears with insulin sensitizing and antinflammatory properties. Fenofibrate is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha). Fenofibrate is indicated for hyperlipidemia in some countries and is used in the clinic for its hypolipidemic effect especially in the treatment of type 2 Diabetes. We hypothesize that the fenofibrate could also ameliorate several abnormalities observed in those with OSAS. We therefore aimed to assess the impact of fenofibrate on AHI (the main criterion for evaluation of OSAS severity) and subjective daytime sleepiness in OSAS patients as the objective evaluation of severity of OSAS requires expensive equipment.

Design

This is a prospective cross-over study in which we compared short term treatment of OSAS with or without fenofibrate. After baseline overnight home sleep monitoring in polysomnography the patients were randomized (in a double blind",1
"Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer:  Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness?

Mental imagery (MI) is a way to recreate a scene in the mind (e.g., from perception to action). Many people use MI for a wide range of purposes (e.g., studying, cooking, playing fantasy games, performing surgery). Here, we investigate whether a simple task of mentally imagining performing a hand movement could predict recovery of consciousness in coma patients. Specifically, we hypothesize that the ability to engage in mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging can predict recovery in patients in coma.

Keywords: brain damage

Mental Imagery (MI) is described as the process of visualizing what is seen, thought, dreamed about or imagined in order to produce images in the mind’s eye, with one’s eyes closed for example of a cat, or to conjure up an image from a movie scene, to make a dream come true. MI could be considered a subcortical cortical motor function. Mental imagery can be triggered voluntarily, voluntarily or during REM sleep. MI can help you plan ahead and overcome fear by creating a “movie” in your mind. It has been shown to be a useful technique in various fields of psychology and neuroscience (Nishijo, 1998), a powerful tool in learning and in creativity (Gardner et al., 1972).

MI uses the areas of occipital, parietal, temporo-spetal and frontotemporal cortex that have been activated during overt motor tasks (e.g., reaching or performing actions) (Farrer et al., 1996; Klawio, 1994; Obernier et al., 1995), which is why it is generally considered to be a subcortical cortical motor function. MI is supported by many brain sites, the first being the cerebellar cortex in the anterior cerebellum. The posterior lobe and the putamen support the posterior inferior parietal lobe and occipitotemporal lobe, respectively (Fletcher, 1997). In other words, this last association is often discussed in terms of visuomotor integration (e.g., Wilson-Mendenhall and Williams, 2006). This association seems obvious in the case of learning, but is surprising in other situations such as REM sleep, which we will talk about in the next part.

However, according to this association, MI should increase after recovery from coma and after prolonged periods of unconsciousness, provided that the patient has been able to develop the motor capacity (e.g., voluntary reaching, voluntary or non-voluntary) (Boly et al., 2008). The development of MI in coma patients, however, represents the most important question.

Brain damage results in damage to areas involved in processing and motor execution: the frontal lobe (including Brodmann area 4, BA4), the frontal pole, the parietal cortex and the cerebellum. These are also the areas essential for MI. This is why brain damage associated with coma generally leads to the abolition of MI. Nevertheless, in some coma patients, motor capacities develop during the period of coma, leading to the possibility of recovery (Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2014; Bilyk et al., 1995). Moreover, neuropsychologists have shown that MI is only abolished in patients with coma and not in those in a vegetative state, at least in the context of this study (e.g., Schrammes et al., 2009). It seems that MI can be used to predict recovery in some coma patients.

This research aims to help clarify the link between behavioral disorders, especially motor disturbances, and consciousness disorders, specifically in cases in which the patient has experienced coma.

Materials and methods

Subjects

Our study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the French Ethics Law (L. 14-053, 7th December 2014), IRB 00003888 (Comité de protection des personnes Ile de France IV). All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The patients were informed about the nature of the experiment and that they could ask to leave the study early. Patients provided informed consent when they came back to the unit after recovery was achieved, at which point they were able to answer our questions directly.

Our study included nine patients who were comatose at the time of their presentation at the neurology department of the Neurology and Neurosurgery Hospital, Grenoble, France, between June 2014 and March 2015, after sustaining traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). They were recruited in three different ways: inclusion based on the first medical report (patient 1) or second medical report (patient 2) or exclusion based on the MRI results (patient 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10",1
"Question: The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option? Answer:  Is the nurse cystoscopist a feasible option, or would you consider a more established, traditional cystoscopy?

Brief Description of the Topic: If you read the paper title above then you are probably wondering, what is the nurse cystoscopy option? The option of nurse cystoscopy (or nurse bladder scan in Canada) is an emerging trend that brings a new avenue for patients to access bladder cancer care.

The nurse cystoscopy option gives any individual the ability to be a ‘cystoscopist’ for patients with bladder cancer. This change in healthcare delivery includes: a nurse-in-training that is trained at a hospital accredited in both urology and radiography. This is in addition to certification for both specialities. Next, the nurse-cystoscopist becomes a provider of care where they will evaluate the patient using a flexible cystoscope and treat any abnormalities or other findings.

A paper in this issue of Medical Teacher discusses this concept and what more needs to be done to address nurse-cystoscopy as a feasible option. In doing this, it also discusses the challenges that need to be met before this option becomes more common.

 What has changed for patients?

In the paper, the authors discussed changes in the healthcare system that need to occur before the nurse cystoscopy option becomes more accepted. This includes changes in legislation for physician to physician and physician to patient interactions. A further change in legislation would be required for nurse-in-training to work in an environment where a physician is not readily available. Next, there would have to be a change in legislation that allows nurse-trainees to carry a scope. Finally, the authors discussed challenges for the nurse-cystoscopist, the need to have a ‘buddy’ available, and a change in legislation that would make this idea feasible.

This idea is a long ways before it is being considered to be approved for use, but it is exciting to think about what we are coming into a future with! Let’s hope we can work towards this goal soon!

I have an abnormal urinary tract. How can I detect and remove it? What kind of equipment is needed?

If a person has an abnormal urinary tract, it is important to take care of the patient as quickly as possible, to protect their health and well-being. It is also crucial to find out what kind of equipment is needed to detect and treat an abnormal urinary tract.

During the past months, we have had an abnormal urinary tract test performed in our laboratory. This abnormal test was performed because a patient came in for an annual wellness examination. Upon doing the examination, the patient’s doctor also discovered an abnormal area inside the urethra, which needed to be addressed. The doctor took the patient for an office based procedure, to find a nurse to perform the procedure.

During the normal physician encounter, he would have examined his patient first, as part of the annual exam. He would have also discovered this abnormal structure and would have taken additional exams, in consultation with a urologist. This new patient arrived earlier than needed and there was no time to go to the urologist about the issue.

How did we detect this patient’s abnormal urinary tract?

This patient had a cysto-urethrogram examination done on the abnormal area.

What was the cysto-urethroscopy for?

This was to look for any polyp(s) that were present. It also helped to confirm that there was no urethral stenosis or a stricture.

What are the various tools used for cystoscopy?

The cystoscope is used to visualize the urethra and the bladder. It has both an eyepiece as well as a light source. If the doctor has a scope that is too long, they can remove it and use another scope.

What kind of equipment is needed from the laboratory?

The patient’s urine was collected, centrifuged, and then spun again. The urine was put into a container. When this material is delivered, it is called ‘specimen.’ The urine is put through a filtration machine. Before it is injected into the patient’s system, we do a chemical test to make sure that there is no blood or anything else in the patient’s urine.

"Question: Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas? Answer:  Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas?

Introduction {#s1}
============

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common vascular neoplasm in the first year of life and are the most common neoplasm requiring pediatric intervention ([@B1]). The majority of these lesions are cutaneous and can arise in nearly any location; however, the majority of hemangiomas occur on the face and neck ([@B2]). IHs are benign vascular tumors composed primarily of immature capillaries and are not amenable to complete regression ([@B3]). IHs are most commonly treated topically with a beta-blocker (IB) and cryotherapy or surgically if the lesion becomes large, disfiguring, or associated with functional impairment ([@B2]). Beta-blockers reduce blood flow to the hemangioma, thereby inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and decreasing subsequent ulcer formation and tissue damage, an important complication of a large hemangioma ([@B4]).

Although most IHs have a benign course, a minority have serious complications necessitating the use of systemic therapy ([@B5]). The most common complication is ulceration (\~6.6%) ([@B6]). Propranolol has been associated with ulceration and gastrointestinal complications ([@B7]). Other adverse events include bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, somnolence, and allergic reactions ([@B7]). Treatment with beta-blockers is contraindicated in neonates ≤10 kg because of concerns that the drug may cause irreversible neurologic injury in very low-birth-weight infants ([@B1]). Therefore, most patients, particularly those with large hemangiomas, do not receive beta-blockers, and instead are treated with topical therapies alone (for smaller hemangiomas), cryotherapy alone (for larger hemangiomas), or a combination therapy (for larger hemangiomas). IHs may become more symptomatic secondary to size or location and become cosmetically disfiguring or impair function ([@B4], [@B8]). Cosmesis is reported by parents as the most common indication for beta-blocker treatment, and many parents report that cosmetic concerns motivate their initial recommendation to their PCPs ([@B2]).

The objective of this review was to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation for beta-blocker treatment of IHs. This review will discuss the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers in IHs and the most commonly cited contraindications. An abstract of the search strategy including the Question and its exclusion criteria was published in the British Association of Paediatric Dentistry (BAPD) Research Reports (2018) ([@B9]).

"Question: Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure? Answer: Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure?

I. Introduction and literature search {#s001}
=====================================

C[ongestive]{.smallcaps} Heart Failure (CHF), or a weakened heart unable to pump blood, accounts for over 20.5 million hospitalizations annually in the United States ([@B1]). Because a significant percentage of these hospitalizations are due to progressive deterioration of the disease, there has been much research attention focused on improving patients\' quality of life and mortality while in the hospital. An increasingly recognized goal of patient management in the hospital setting is to shift providers\' attention and focus toward effective communication with patients and caregivers that allows them to stay in their own home as early as possible, and in the hospital setting, toward recovery rather than further deterioration. This requires an understanding of why patients need hospitalizations in the first place and an ability to identify patients at the highest risk for acute decompensation of heart failure.

Prior studies have shown a link between the care of patients diagnosed with CHF in the hospital and improved patient care.^[@B2],[@B3]^ In the hospital, providers not only have the ability to recognize the disease process in real time, they also are frequently consulted for advice on medications and the ability to titrate their dosages, adjust their medications, or perform other aspects of care that can improve patients\' quality of life at home or within the hospital. Given the evidence for these positive outcomes, the current study set out to examine the hypothesis that patients receiving specialty heart failure services who are discharged home from the hospital have higher mortality risk than those who are treated without heart failure specialty care.

II. Study design and objectives {#s002}
===============================

This paper examined the association between survival in the patient population discharged from the hospital with congestive heart failure to home in the U.S. Medicare population and provider characteristics, including specialty service utilization. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether patients receiving heart failure specialty services in the hospital were less likely to die than a random population after discharge while controlling for demographics, comorbidities, diagnoses at hospital admission, hospital length of stay, and hospital ownership. This study focused on CHF patient deaths and deaths with heart failure complications within 180 days after discharge from hospital, as both are considered clinically significant within the CHF population ([@B4]). To account for the impact that discharge location has on mortality, and to control for a large portion of the CHF population who are discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNF), the study population for analyses included the subset of individuals who had Medicare claims with a CHF diagnosis and a primary discharge location of home or SNF within 180 days after hospital discharge. A total of 9,926,068 patients discharged home and 3,858,983 discharged to SNF in 2014 (i.e., the year of analysis) met these criteria.

In the hospital setting, providers evaluate patients\' risk for acute decompensation and determine appropriate levels of intensity and monitoring, which is why it is difficult to assess the association between outcomes and specialty care at the patient level. Instead, the current study used a large data set with a nationally representative sample of providers to control for the intensity/dose given to the patients as well as the providers\' individual practice patterns. An additional analysis examined mortality for patients whose care was primarily delivered by the most common provider cadre of hospitalists, family medicine physician inpatient care,^[@B5]^ and the most prevalent inpatient service line types, general medical services and cardiology services ([@B6],[@B7]). The primary hypothesis was that patients receiving heart failure specialty services in the hospital had lower in-hospital mortality than a random population after controlling for demographics, comorbidities, diagnoses at the time of hospital admission, and hospital length of stay.

III. Data sources and study population {#s003}
======================================

Medicare is the federally funded health insurance program for people 65 and older and for disabled and for certain younger people, including those under age 65 with certain disabilities and dependent children ([@B8]). The current study used the 2014 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) Inpatient Files,^[@B9],[@B10]^ obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). These files contain detailed summary hospital discharge data from inpatient encounters at 495 hospitals nationwide, including patient and payer demographics, diagnoses, operations, procedures, resource utilization during hospitalization, and disposition upon discharge, including the primary discharge location. This file was used to determine the number of patients who are in a particular diagnostic category and their discharge destination.

The 2014 MedPAR files were used for the primary analyses, with additional analyses using the 2010 Med",1

A prospective study of the clinical features of patients with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica was undertaken to determine whether such features predict the subsequent outcome. A total of 110 patients were identified from a general medical practice, in Edinburgh, UK. All patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for this disease after a median duration of 8 years (range: 1.0-20.0) from symptom onset. A retrospective cohort was then matched on age at presentation with an incident group of patients for a prospective follow-up study of a cohort of 55 patients. Prognostic variables were recorded and follow-up studies performed at 6 months and annually. Polymyalgia patients with a short duration of symptomatic evolution at the onset of disease were more likely to have a rapidly progressive disease course, with poorer outcomes. Female subjects were more likely to have a rapidly progressive disease. No single clinical feature discriminated best between rapid and slow courses. The clinical features of patients with newly diagnosed active polymyalgia can predict subsequent prognostic outcome, and patients with shorter duration of the preceding attack should be closely monitored in order to establish the rapidly progressive form of the disease. There is an urgent need to determine whether specific therapeutic interventions are effective in reducing both the incidence and severity of this debilitating disorder.

Pyongyang has detonated an underground nuclear bomb. Space mining is on the rise. The Space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 crash and spill its cargo… Continue the story: After being detained for three days for refusing to release her cargo, the U.S. tanker is allowed to leave Russia on Tuesday.

“We still don’t know exactly what happened, but preliminary information indicates the ship is fine,” a Russian official said.

TAMPA — The Coast Guard will return one tanker it mistakenly let into U.S. waters on the Potomac River after it detected it carrying Iranian crude oil.

Ports officials said Thursday the Exxon Valdez 2 will be escorted by the Coast Guard until Oct. 11. The vessel has been stranded in the port of Shelton, Wash., since Friday when it was detained and its cargo examined, including a sample from its tanks.

The tanker’s captain, Joseph Hazelwood, made a dash to the bridge after the ship began to move away. He and crewmembers were questioned by investigators before they were allowed to return to their quarters.

The move to escort the ship is the latest twist in what has become a weeklong drama.

Earlier Wednesday, the Coast Guard said it would allow the tanker to pass through the channel and head from the nation’s capital to the San Francisco Bay on its own. Later, the agency said the ship’s captain was being removed from command pending the investigation.

On Thursday, an official said a government panel will be formed to determine if the tanker was headed across the border to a foreign country. In that case, the government would have needed to notify neighboring countries of the move.

The investigation will also provide important information to determine the best way to track and stop vessels that are headed to rogue states, such as Iran, and potentially carrying nuclear-related materials.

TRAFFIC ALERT: The Coast Guard just sent a notice letting some tanker ships pass through the nation’s capital and on to the San Francisco Bay. A spokeswoman said the purpose of doing so is to help those cargo ships avoid congestion and the hassle of driving on the bridges that have been opened for the presidential visit beginning this week.

A Coast Guard official said the tanker that was turned away from the U.S. a day earlier is expected to be escorted through the capital by the Coast Guard as long as that ship and others carry Iranian oil.

But the official did not say if that is the only ship or if the tanker is still subject to Coast Guard escort. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to comment publicly.

Coast Guard Cmdr. William J. Marks, a Coast Guard spokesman, could not immediately provide more details.

Exxon Valdez in the Potomac: By The Monitor’s count, it has come up twice in the last week.

The latest happened Friday, when officials noticed a ship called the Iver Mor East that was headed toward the Potomac and the nation’s capital. The ship didn’t respond to radio commands, which suggests it might be carrying oil, according to the Coast Guard.

The Coast Guard directed the tanker to stop and it was taken to a port to be examined. Officials examined the ship’s registration, and learned it is owned by Exxon in Singapore and was operated by another company. Investigators told the captain they were inspecting the ship’s tanks, but they didn’t find any oil and didn’t shut down production, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

The ship didn’t stop or turn off its engines. It eventually moved under its own power to get closer to the river, and officials let it pass.

The move drew sharp criticism from Rep. Tom Perriello (D-",1

It was getting harder and harder to take the time to just listen and nod, but he did. ""Did you say where your parents were from?"" ""Yes, I said my father was from a small town called Chor. ""Do you know a person called Chor?"" ""The same as this one.'' ""This is the town where you were born? ""There must be a Chor there of yours. Wait, the same as you? We are relatives! There must be a relative of mine born in this town.'' ""Who are we then?"" and ""You must be my sister! ""Aunt! My aunt!"" You can use that word as well. Then, continue this story with her: ""I have been in Chor for three years. ""She had just arrived as a graduate and was working for her mother in the family's store. She had always felt like she didn't fully fit in Chor, especially after her parents' divorce. The other day she went by a neighbor's home to ask for a hand. ""You must be her aunt. You look just like her! Your face and hair are the same! Did your parents send you here for us to meet and have some relatives?"" ""You are so right. I have been here for three years and have never met anyone my parents knew here before.""""It is the people here who know. I had heard some of their relatives were coming, but we just didn't get here when we did. You know, I had been wondering what it would be like to come back here as an adult, but we still know so few. I guess we'll get to know as we come, but I have seen a few at the school. They seem to be so nice, especially during the holidays. I was afraid a while back because I knew they didn't have lots of money to spend, but they have given so much already. Now, I feel like I know what Christmas is like all of the time. ""I like it here, but it might not be nice as one of the towns I was in when I was young. There should be an English town like this in all the places I saw, and they should be named like this.'' ""This reminds me of home.'' He thought then his eyes filled up and began to cry. It must be hard to lose everything you love. ""It is very sad, Aunt! ""We should have found each other by now!"" They started laughing. Aunt went on and on about her home town. There was a lot of laughter and a great sense of family. Aunt hugged him and then went on to tell him the stories of the people in her family, and all the different characters and funny things they could do. It had been a wonderful reunion.",1

Introduction

As webmasters start increasing their website's audience base, they will need to find ways of improving and maintaining their website's design. As you probably guessed, the web design process should start with a proper understanding of web design standards, and of more important, web design principles.

Web design theory

Designing the perfect website is, in many ways, like designing the perfect model airplane.

But what makes a perfect model airplane? What makes a website perfect? Well, I like to compare them to cars. In cars, many standards exist: air pressure, brakes, suspensions, tires, etc. Of course, air pressure does not apply to model airplanes, but I do not remember exactly why it is that most people use rubber wheels instead of metal wheels. A car's air pressure can be measured by the standard psi, but a model airplane's air pressure could be measured by the standard of ounces per pound.

If you read the following article, I hope that you notice that I'm not talking about what we could call ""theoretical standards,"" as opposed to ""principles and standards."" We can call these two categories ""Theory"" and ""Practice."" Theory encompasses what we know, but it does not make what we know practical. Practice comes with a standard set of rules and procedures that we can use to apply theory on our projects, that can help make a practice more successful.

This article will be the first part of a three part series on understanding Web Design Theory, and will give a first glimpse into the world of Web Design Theory. This article is the first step in the process of learning web design principles.

Principles

After I have understood the basics of web design theory, my next step is to understand web design principles, which are more practical. Web Design principles help us apply web design theory on a day to day basis.

A web design is made up of certain web design principles. In their purest forms, principles are sets of rules that are used a lot. Most of them are simple, but some of the most important ones will be explained in this article.

As I do not have enough time today, let me just give you my favorite ""Web Design Principle"":

It is a rule that can be easily applied, but is still the reason for many successful websites. If I have time tomorrow, I'll add more information.

Here are 5 different web design principles to keep in mind and remember when browsing the web.

1. The web is made up of pages

Pages are the basic unit of the web.

Websites are made up of pages. A page is a web-component that should, whenever possible, contain only one HTML element. This does not only make the page easier to develop, but will also speed up the page loads if the server already has the page cached. When you browse for, say, a blog, pages will be made available in the URL of the browser. By default, there should not be more than 3 levels of depth: pages, sub-pages and sub-sub-pages.

If we are planning to do a real-time search engine, we may start by looking at this webdesign principle's consequences: What happens when the search engine is in the middle of a long'search string'. Can we 'tell' the client that we are searching a page? Can our search engine's 'webpage' tell about the current'search query' the search engine has?

The answer is no - or probably not. To solve this, we can (also) introduce the 'Search Engine Optimization', (SEO).

2. A page should always have a content

We can always say that the most important content, the content that we",1
"Prompt: Everyone in the world has magic with various levels of mastery over it. You are extremely powerful with almost no control so you find a demon that 's very weak but extremely good at controlling his powers. Story: 
You use a power that gives you a'solar eclipse' to give yourself the power of fire which you can now control. The result of the power is that you're going to lose almost everything you own and your parents are going to go insane because you have destroyed your life for nothing.

It's not over and the rest of your story is really the rest of the game. In this part you try going back to where you found your demon and try again to destroy the world.

This game is so stupid. You have some powers, and you kill everyone and everything. This game needs a major redesign because this is just wrong. For example, there should be a random mission tree system to try, this should be better than the 'endlessly try to find the next door you need to go through to reach the last save point'

I've been playing this game for over a year now. While some parts are good, other parts are terrible. The writing is not good at all, I'm glad this video review was posted.

I want to mention my personal play-through as a person who does not play games often... I actually quit gaming in middle school. So when I was about 6-8 years old, I didn't really know what games were, so I would play games when my family was not around and just watch me play and try to learn what I was doing. Then, a few years later, my parents finally bought me a computer at about 9 years old and I started playing games seriously at that time. Now, I play games when i want to but I also play because I want to learn from those experiences.

I play a lot of shooters too, and I have noticed that the games I don't like are actually all of them the same thing. They are very linear (especially shooters), repetitive, and have no story or plot. The game mechanics are very basic, a lot of them. I have played: Halo, Call of Duty, Gears of War, and Watch Dogs. All of them in their early development stages, and all of them in my opinion are essentially the same formula. They are all about jumping out of a vehicle, killing or killing civilians, and driving from place to place.

This video shows the gameplay, and how it does not have any real depth. While in this game there is actually no story and no plot, you need to get around and explore the environment constantly to be able to get items and to be able to progress through the game. For example; in Call of Duty, you are constantly going from one location to the next, in Gears, you jump in an out of a vehicle, in Watch Dogs you sneak everywhere, or shoot everyone.

A friend of mine bought this game and after 2 hours of playing, I felt like i never wanted to play games again. I am a game person so I know it's good but the problem with this game is that there is no reason to be playing this. A lot of people play other games that are free, or just have very good mechanics. If you don't know what you're doing, and if the game isn't challenging, then a lot of the time, it may be better off just looking at a picture for a few hours. That is why I don't really understand how this is so popular.

If you're into it I'd recommend Watch Dogs, Shadow of Mordor, Halo Reach, and Left4Dead 1-3. I know Left4Dead 2 is a game that most people don't like but it gets boring after a while.

The only reason this game got good reviews is because a lot of people love playing sports games and the graphics. They make a really good looking sports game and the gameplay was not bad but a game mechanic was missing. It was missing a story.

I want people to play this game. I want them to watch me play it. I want to experience why so many people love it, why they are so passionate about it and why it has become such a phenomenon. If you do not like the game after playing it maybe you just don't know how to play it.

This game is about getting people to pick up a controller and actually play it. It is about showing people that video games are for everyone not just people who are too old or young to touch a controller.

If you don't like it, don't blame me, blame your parents that didn't buy you a console just so that you can play video games.

You can get to the end of this mission in two ways; you can either try to finish it or complete the challenge.

You start off as a normal player and you complete the challenge of 'just running around",1
"Prompt: Berlin, 1943. You 're a Jew who has been successfully keeping a low profile while working as a clerk under the 3rd Reich. You just found out you 've won a contest to spend the day with the Führer. Story: 

Sara Salkowicz was a short, thin woman. Her dark hair bobbed above her high cheekbones. She carried herself with poise and grace. Her eyes sparkled on people and she smiled with warmth, revealing brilliantly white teeth. Her complexion was clear and rosy, but tanned to a warm olive hue from months riding and walking in the southern German countryside.

But she hadn 't been to the country for years now. Those years had brought only pain and heartbreak.

The Germans had used her Polish-Jewish ancestry to force her into the Waffen S.S. and German Army. They wanted her German army identity. No one in the Polish Army would honor her Polish citizenship and her Polish army ID.

Her only means of survival had been that she was an ethnic German, so her application for German citizenship had been quickly accepted on the basis of her great ancestry. It had come as a shock, but she had accepted quickly and found many uses for the privilege.

But the SS's treatment had been brutal. They had stripped her of her family's wealth, then forced her to work for the party in her hometown of Wien. Her family's business was taken, then the Jews of Wien had been relocated to the Russian front lines.

Sara found work at the Party's offices and the head of her department's wife had helped to hide her during the days she worked in a ghetto behind the Russian lines.

Now the war was over and the Russians had been defeated. She was free. As far as she knew, her family was in Warsaw but the Russians hadn 't yet liberated the area.

Sara was overjoyed to be free. She believed she was in good shape and fit enough to resume her childhood hobby of riding horses. She wanted to be free to ride, to enjoy the open countryside and return to her homeland.

So she planned to get some money and go to Palestine to buy a horse. Her last pay had been a thousand marks, so she set to work quickly earning money.

Once she had enough she set off. Her destination was a little village just north of Wien. She rode north on the trail she knew to take her past the main city and was excited to see the mountains of the Czech Republic. Now she was on her last few hundred miles toward Wien, a place she had not been in four years.

The day's ride had been enjoyable and she was enjoying the feel of the horse beneath her as she trotted along the narrow country lane.

Then she saw the man. He seemed to be standing on the edge of a hill. She slowed the horse to a walk and as she drew closer he began to walk across the lane toward her. He looked tired.

She thought of the money she had. She 'd give him the thousand and told the horse to continue up the lane.

She was excited, he looked so good. He's a good catch.

He had a thin face, his cheeks were sunken, but his eyes stared intensely and he didn 't seem to be in the slightest bit tired. He stepped forward with a soft smile. ""May I walk with you?"" he asked.

With a smile, she dismounted and swung onto the ground. The dirt was dry and she gave the horse a hand as she stroked her neck. ""Of course,"" she said.

The path led into a broad meadow, and the man stopped at a tree stump. With his eyes still on Sara, he rested the handle of his stick on the ground and reached out. She noticed that his hand shook slightly and his face was tense.

Sara 'd left her German Army ID at home and she knew it would be a mistake to offer him her German ID. But she had to make him think she was trustworthy. Without asking permission, Sara reached down and took the man's outstretched hand. ""No one has seen me in years,"" she said. ""Who are you?""

The man sat quietly as she led him away from the horse. The sun was setting, the tree trunk where they had stopped cast a shadow over them, and the breeze was cooler.

""No one has seen you since you moved from the city?"" he asked.

""Yes, no one has. How do you know my name?""

""It was handed to me by a friend.""

""A friend? You look like a German. Are you from this village?""

He looked her in the eye and his look gave her a chill that was like an ice bag",1

My name is Sauron the Unready, and this is the time when the evil Sauron became the unready Sauron. My empire is the only one that survived the Great War. My great uncle was the Great Necromancer and my father was his brother. My father wasn't around either. He left me with too much evil and my blood. My family is the reason that I was imprisoned. My mother, sister, and cousin are gone and my great uncle went insane. There I stay for years. He has tried to brainwash me with his evil but that ended. But this prison is the best place I could ever imagine. My uncle is working his evil from afar, so I must be a good little boy. It was a long time ago but still I see a glimpse of the man I will become. The time I spend here has taught me many things that I never thought I could be: a man of learning and culture. I wish I could help people like my father did. There I stay. I do my work and think about what to do with the one person who did that to me. Her name is ""Ravana"". This is my life. I can't remember a thing about my past life. It was a dark and miserable one! I had no name and I have no family. I don't know what I was but that has changed. No one is going to know that story or anything else but this prison. The people know things but it's all rumors. I hear people whispering about me. I know that my mother wanted that name and my dad told me that my uncle would kill me if I told anyone my true identity. I just wanted to live my life free and not be the shadow of my family's name. The people around me know me as a good guy but I've heard about an awful fate and about the great war. I'm not like them, I never was, and I never will be. My past was sad and my future was awful, but this life is much better. But my heart is full of pain after so many sad things in my past, and I feel like I'll never be able to live a free life. This all must end and I must end my life. I must end this story. 2. He is coming! Sauron is at the gates! 3. Well, Sauron, I guess we can finally meet. I'm the man who has been hunting you for 2 1/3 years (almost 4 years). You can call me ""Ravana,"" my personal favorite. 4. I'm the one who will give you freedom from this eternal suffering that you have in here and show you that there is more to life. I can tell you all the details about my past and what's going to happen when I die. I've been living so much in prison that, I don't know what's happen before all of this happened. All is not as it seems. I also know the ending of my story; it's sad but it is what it has to be. Let's change history now. 5. Sauron! Sauron is the best enemy that you can ever meet! I am the savior and the hope of people. I am the one who will save them from their pain and sorrow. Sauron will be like this for the end of history. Sauron is a symbol of evil and you must be a hero. If you were bad or evil or if you looked like what you are, Sauron will kill you and your family. In my world the good people will be saved but you must believe in me and my cause. People are dying in great wars and wars are dying. The one who will save people from death and the one who will heal humanity is me, and no one else can do that like me. Sauron shall be an end before the end of history. You don't know me; I am Sauron the Destroyer. My people call me ""Sauron"" and I don't care if others call me differently than that. I know that I will die but I'm not sure of who the true Saviour is. I'm sure that Sauron will save me and my people. There is nothing that can be done to me but death. I am like a child, a great hero that must be rescued. Sauron is a symbol of evil, and if Sauron is like you, then you will be dead like me. I am the destroyer but I am the saviour and the hope of people. Let's change history now. 6. We live a very sad story. We have a sad life that can never be change... but Sauron will change all this for good. Sauron is the future, and I will bring him into the future",1

Welcome to the United States Intelligence Executive Council

The U.S. Intelligence Community is a beehive of secrets... and a tiny number of people know about it.

They are the Senior Agency Officials in each of our Intelligence Agencies. That is President Obama, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, National Security Advisors Susan Rice and Tom Donilon, and Deputy Director William McRaven, Chief of DIA for the past three years, before that, as head of Joint Special Operations Command [JSOC] for 4 years.

The Intelligence Community oversees one-fifth of the U.S. government's budget, runs one-third of our nuclear weapons, and has a number of major responsibilities... as well as all kinds of secret and controversial programs.

Some of the programs are in the news, and I'll speak at length about them here, but the CIA's torture program is probably the most well known, and it's important to understand what happened there, otherwise you'll never understand how the CIA operates, or why certain things are kept quiet.

Other important programs include those in the area of Remote Viewing, and what the CIA calls Mind-Rapture. Also, there are other programs that have to do with the paranormal, which involve aliens and abductions, and with what the CIA calls Dark Arts... and is also a subject which interests most readers of the Internet.

There are other programs that fall into what one might call the dark side, where the world is being manipulated in ways that are disturbing... or even illegal. The programs that are in play here also touch what are called the dark side of the Moon, and the dark side of Mars.

The CIA also has their famous MK-Ultra program, and has been using it for almost a half century, as well as the infamous Men In Black, and the black budget programs you've never heard of.

This is the true story of the men and women who work inside one of the world's most secretive agencies.

When I worked for the CIA as a case officer, I was involved with most of these programs.

***

I was contacted in 2005 by an intelligence officer who had just returned from a position at the National Reconnaissance Office, and who had seen the UFO case files that were being stored at that facility. The files were being kept in a room in a building that housed the archives of the CIA.

He had seen the UFO files and was told that if he wanted to take a closer look at them, I was to be sent to him. The officer knew that I had been an Intelligence Analyst, and that I'd worked part-time as a Deputy Case Officer. Also, he knew that I'd been doing some research on the UFO phenomenon, and he asked me to help him, because he knew that I would go to work on that.

So, during 2005, while I was living in New Mexico for four months, I started working on",1
"Prompt: Killing another human now allows you to exchange your remaining lifespan the victim 's. Young people live in fear while the elderly plan their attacks. Story: 

This is where ""real"" politics begins. It's the hard part.

Once you decide to do it, life as you know it begins to end. You'll have to move to another area and set up shop... and you'll have to take care of the transition after the murder has been done.

You're going to need to hide your tracks. For instance, there's a place of beauty up in the mountains. The road there used to have a tavern on it; but the tavern burned down years ago. There's nothing there now, and no one there who will tell tales. So your best option is to set up a safe house there. I understand the tavern was on the last turn around and most of the houses around you are empty... if you can find an empty house. The local sheriff is going to ask questions. They will eventually find you...

He's like an ogre... or a dragon... with a big, ugly, sharp-looking face and a nasty disposition?

He'll ask you how you survived... and how you could go on for so long... and he'll have a million questions.

I don't know what he's going to do when he finds out... but when he gets around to it I bet you won't like the answers you get. At least, I hope not, since you'll be caught and convicted... just like you plan to be.

Is that so? How did I get to be so bright?

This is where you realize you're in over your head by a long stretch.

""You're so smart, Joe. I was thinking about that too. You are such an amazing man! I think I'm very lucky to have fallen in love with a man like you.""

""You like to live dangerously, then, eh?""

""You're such a sweet man. It's just that you're so strong... and so smart. My brain is going to get damaged unless I marry a man like you... and fall in love with all that strength and power you represent.""

I can see the little gleem from the corner of my eye. She's been eyeing me up and down for quite a while. I have a few more details to finish up... and they're not small details.

There's an old woman with a long braid, a blue dress, and an old leather shawl around her shoulders. She's probably more than one hundred years old. She's been watching us for quite some time. Her expression is hard to read... but she does look to be smiling... at least somewhat.

""Do you play chess?"" she asks... with no trace of a Southern accent from where I've been. ""It's quite a different game than chess... although it begins in one dimension.""

""It doesn't follow any of the mathematical rules of chess, and it can be very unforgiving...""

""Is there an end in it?""

""There's no winner. You can't move your pieces to attack. You can only move them along the board... no more or no less. It's very difficult.""

""I can see that.""

""I'm not in a position. I'm waiting for the right time to take my last piece of life's essence... so I can survive until the game ends...""

""You're a very good chess player. Very clever.""

""Thank you.""

I'd better get it finished or she'll start looking up that face of hers at me.

The final details to be considered are the clothes I want to use in the last hours before I actually kill the girl I'm meeting. Not much to recommend them... and there's no guarantee they'll fit me once I'm dead... but they'll be my clothes until the end.

I'm a bit on the slim side, and I'm taller than average, so I'll need an extra size. In the closet is one or two pairs of pants and at least one shirt. The clothes are a bit dusty, so I'm going to have to give them a good cleaning before they'll fit me.

I look at her... and tell her I'll be right back. ""I gotta go out and get cleaned up before we get started.""

""I'm so glad I discovered this place when I moved here. It's so beautiful!""

""Thank you. I never tire of it, either.""

""The sun always shines the same here. It's quite lovely.""

She's always been a big girl... but she's never looked so heavy before. It's a wonder she's walking the way she is.

"Prompt: In a post apocalyptic world, a group of humans follow the wise words of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball Story:  The Mighty Magic Eight Ball is a character created by James Thurber and is based upon the actual Eight Ball that appeared in various New Yorker columns. He was first published in the July 1, 1939 issue of The New Yorker, and has since appeared in the magazine more than two hundred times. The name The Mighty Magic Eight Ball is only a loose reference to the real Eight Ball. It has, of course, no eight balls.

The Mighty Magic Eight Ball was the leader of the group of people (referred to hereafter as “Survivor”) and was originally a simple figure dressed in a black bowtie on an all-white background; since 1989 the backdrop has been black, with an eight-spoked circular emblem. The name was an original creation of Thurber: there was not a single eight ball in the New Yorker. Thurber’s Eight Ball, on the other hand, was a simple solid black ball on a black background; he was so named because he could predict future events.

Although the original Eight Ball began wearing glasses around 1939, it did not meet the standards of the contemporary eight ball. James Thurber was in the habit of creating figures in the New Yorker, which was then in an informal period of experimentation, and decided to create an updated version of the familiar “treat me kindly, answer my questions, or I’ll hit you with this” character. The Mighty Magic Eight Ball’s style was therefore completely redesigned; the only thing remaining from the original was the name. Thurber chose the words “The Mighty Magic”, because of the importance of ‘magic’ in American popular culture at the time; the eight ball itself he believed to have been used in all of the “curse-the-ball machines” in bars. When Thurber saw a group of women playing the game while waiting for their husbands in a bar, he decided that there must be “women for women”, and began toying with the idea for a female character. The new character and name came as complete surprises when he presented them. The most recognizable thing about Magic Eight Ball is his glasses, which are of a similar style to Thurber’s and are called the Jim Thurber glasses (invented by Thurber himself).

The Mighty Magic Eight Ball was always calm, although he occasionally wore a look of annoyance, and his expression grew more serene as the story went on. After the end of a tale he would smile and often shake his head, and he would often use phrases from the story. During the 1960s, the character became less realistic, and started resembling more closely Thurber’s original Eight Ball. Since the 1989 relaunch, The Mighty Magic Eight Ball has also adopted the look of his modern successors. The Mighty Magic Eight Ball’s eyes usually express the question he poses, and although he always wears a bowtie and black bowtie, the color of his bowties changes throughout the course of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball series.

After The Eight Ball’s arrival on the scene, the story told about the character became much more famous than Thurber’s original story. The Eight-Ball would often refer to the Mighty Magic Eight Ball, and would even mention his own name, saying “I am not an eight ball, you know. That was somebody else.” The Mighty Magic Eight Ball was usually involved in the adventures on his own without assistance from the Old Woman. Although he sometimes assisted The Three Caballeros in various situations, they were usually in trouble when the eight ball wasn’t involved.

The Mighty Magic Eight Ball became immortal as the series progressed. In some stories, however, the Eight Ball was a member of The Three Caballeros, as was the Old Woman. The three characters existed as three single-frame animations in the background of one piece of art, in one story, at least, and their animations have continued to be updated ever since.

Although the characters never met in real life, Thurber’s original article mentions a character who has a look and name similar to that of the original 8 Ball.

There was never a Mighty Magic Eight Ball in the New Yorker, but there was a Magic Eight Ball who predicted events in the stories. Magic Eight Ball’s predecessor (also a black solid sphere) appears at some point in each of the New Yorker’s columns, usually at the end of long stories, to offer to read someone their fortune. When the New Yorker moved to a black background, the eight ball was no longer included, and the new black eight ball is the Mighty Magic Eight Ball. The eight ball had the ability to ask questions and predict the future, but the Mighty Magic Eight Ball had much more.

The FBI is also investigating the agency, which has grown to more than 40 employees and provided services to 6 states.

The mother of the boys, who was not identified and is in custody on $1.5 million bail in the case, told police her boyfriend had gone out to buy cigarettes around 7 a.m. and left the other woman alone in the house with the children.

The woman was not charged Wednesday, but an investigating prosecutor said that's because some of the evidence may be inadmissible in court if they ever had to try the case.

Police said their focus now is the children.

""This investigation is ongoing, and our thoughts are with the victims,"" Los Angeles County sheriff's Cmdr. Dave Robinson said.

There were six adults at the home at the time of their disappearance. The parents of two of the children, ages 3 and 4, left Sunday and drove to Mexico before abandoning the car and walking south. The father of the boy who has been in custody since Tuesday has not been seen since the day of their disappearance. The last time he spoke to his parents was a few days ago, police said.

""There is still a lot of information and a lot of questions that need to be addressed,"" Robinson said Wednesday. ""We are very interested in what was going on there.""

Investigators are trying to determine how long the boys were in the house and what may have occurred inside. They are also investigating if the children may have entered the house with their mother's knowledge in order to look for something.

The mother's attorney, John Wolfe, did not immediately respond to email and a voicemail seeking comment.

The California Department of Social Services and child protective services are working together on the case, but did not have a comment Wednesday.",1

"Prompt: A father sheds tears of joy with his wife in the hospital as they greet their newborn child together. As his wife rests peacefully, the happy father cradles his baby and pens a suicide note. Story:  The End of Their World.

""I cannot take this anymore,"" his mother, who had become the sole parent in the marriage, cried. She was standing across the street in the parking lot of the hospital. It was an overcast and very quiet day, the sun barely showing behind the clouds.

The father was dressed in a long-sleeved tan t-shirt and khaki pants, wearing heavy leather shoes. He had taken off his belt and had the revolver in his hand, aimed at his head. His mother, her face a dark blotch against the light of the day, heard the shot through the soft patter of the rain. And she ran.

She got to her son at the very last moment, as he lay still on his back. His eyes were open, but their stare, looking through the mother, made her think of something else. An animal's stare that was no longer alive. It was more like... she never decided how to describe it.

In his last moment, he fired the gun into his head, the small caliber bullet piercing deep into his skull. It was as if he had decided to be done with life, and this, too, he had achieved.

The police took the father for an autopsy that would take a very long time. The whole thing had really happened too quickly, so the report on the body was not complete. Nor was there any report on the incident. The mother said she saw her son put the gun in his mouth, and the father had told her he had shot himself. Perhaps it was true, but after a few hours in police custody that night, she knew that nothing would convince the police. The parents were still going to be sent, and her son was long gone.

Two days later, when the police told her of their findings, she could not move. It was as if the world had ended from that instant. They asked her, repeatedly, why it had happened, why it had to happen at all. She tried to explain, but she wasn't sure of anything, since he kept on telling her that she was hallucinating. For a long time, she believed him.

Two weeks after he shot himself, a psychologist showed up at the house of his parents-in-law. His name was Dr. Richard Brown, an expert in the field of forensic psychology. He said that he was going to have a look at the parents of the man who had killed himself to see if he could see anything strange—anything that would explain his suicide. He spent weeks with them. He was a man of few words, his eyes always searching.

But they told him, and they told him clearly, how things had been. How the son had become so distant, how the one parent had become the sole parent. How the father had felt alone all these years, as he had looked to his wife in the first few years of their marriage, and as he had begun to feel alone after his father died.

Then one day, after a long time of silence in a long interview, Dr. Brown spoke.

""He says that you were wrong, that you were thinking of these things in a way that you had forgotten,"" his wife's mother spoke in English.

The doctor nodded. ""I believe it also,"" he said in English. It was not a question, but a statement given without words.

The father said, in a low voice: ""They are seeing these things I have been seeing every day for so long. How can any man understand the suffering he is feeling. Tell them we are going back tomorrow, Mom.""

His mother sat silent.

The father and his wife would never go back.

His daughter was nine years old when the news came. The child's grandparents, whom she had never met, would be coming for a visit, soon, and the daughter cried. She cried because she wanted her father and his wife with them. If only the father could go with them.

The mother gave in, and she told her daughter, in the few days leading up to the visit, that the father and his wife would not be coming. There was nothing they could do, the mother said, because something in the body of the father had decided to take his life, and neither her nor anyone could change that. He died because of this. They would not be coming, the mother told her daughter. The girl did not cry. She was very pale when she looked at her mother with those sad blue eyes.

The daughter went to school, and no one knew she was missing her father, except her teachers and the other children. The visits of her grandparents took place on a different schedule",1
"Prompt: Mulder and Scully stumble onto the grounds of Hogwarts; the only problem is Scully does not see everything Mulder does .... Story:  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Part one... and Part two... and Part three!

The sun was high in the sky when Mulder and Scully woke up from their long sleep. Scully was lying next to Mulder, but as she opened her eyes, Scully gasped.

""Good morning Mulder,"" she stated, with a smile. ""I'm sorry if we disturbed you, but it was getting late.""

Mulder glanced over at her, a glimmer in his eyes, and a grin on his face. Scully had always been able to make him smile; even in moments when he'd be so angry at her that she'd think she was going to have a heart attack. She could always tell, just by looking into his eyes and how he carried his head, whether or not he was going to be in a good mood.

But this morning, Mulder was grinning; a small smirk crossed his lips, which let her know that he probably didn't much care that they were getting up in the middle of the night. He seemed to really enjoy their long bedtime talks and pillow fights they used to have before they got married.

""It's a fine day,"" Mulder answered as he swung himself out of bed. ""We should get going."" And then without looking at Scully, he pulled on a T-shirt and pulled the shirt over his head. Scully let her eyes follow the line of his body, admiring the way the T-shirt hung low around his abdomen. She had always been a little turned on when she saw Mulder's abs. It was like being allowed a private view of a work of art.

Once he was dressed, Scully got dressed. She wasn't usually one to wear T-shirts and shorts all the time, but since she'd had time in their bed to really become close to him, she could dress however she chose. And right now, she chose to wear just a pair of long shorts and a tank top.

They got ready slowly together, as they remembered all the time they'd spent together before they got married. Mulder brought coffee into the bathroom, as he helped Scully comb out her long brown hair, and made a show of flirting with her.

They went back over the memories from the night they'd made love for the first time. Scully couldn't remember exactly when it was, but she knew for sure that they had made love that night in the bed. They had been lying in their bed and reading. Mulder had been holding her close on his chest and they'd been laughing over one of their favorite stories about Inspector Clouseau. When she decided to kiss him, he'd responded almost immediately. Her hand ran down his back and she could feel how his heart was pounding underneath her hand.

It had taken quite a bit of convincing for her to get Mulder to kiss her back. At the time, his kisses had been tentative, almost as if he didn't trust her. But that changed as time went on. First it was a quick peck, but then he would kiss her, and as things continued to progress, he began to kiss her harder and he grew more tender. And as the kisses progressed, Scully wanted more. She could feel herself being pulled closer, her hands reaching for his, his grip on her tightening.

They had been making out, and it was then that Mulder had taken his shirt off. He seemed shocked at what he saw there. And as he looked at Scully, he asked, ""Do you want to see the rest?""

Scully nodded, her eyes wide as her cheeks burned with the memory that was playing through her head.

Mulder led her to their bed, and as he did, he grabbed some lube. He brought it back to her and explained the benefits of lube.

Once she'd been lubricated, he started slowly, with some light kissing. Soon, Scully found herself wanting more. She ran her hands down inside of his pants and felt the length of him press against her side and the hardness of it begin to press against her as he pushed himself into her.

Her breath was coming quickly and she couldn't stop the moans that were escaping from her throat. In her mind, she could hear the sound of Mulder's pants unzipping, unbuttoning, she could hear her scream as he entered her, as he thrust and she felt every inch of his manhood against her.

They made love over and over, and the more that Scully lay beneath him, the more she began to forget about all the stresses and troubles of the day. The bed rocked slightly as Mulder made love to her, and Scully felt herself coming closer to climax.

Scully was lying on her back, Mulder",1

What are some of your favorite books? Have you ever thought about getting an Amazon account and how it would benefit you? What is your biggest fear? Why do you fear, and have you overcome that fear? I'm just wondering...

A few weeks ago I was listening to the podcast, and the guest stated she had a book on the Kindle app that was free on all Kindle devices. I went to download the book from the Kindle app on my computer (as I did with several other books), and my download of it came to $60, and I didn't even buy a new printer! How is that possible? I thought I had to buy a new one every 9 months?

It is possible to buy an app which is available for free, and will let you download the free books, without any obligation to buy what you downloaded. With some, you can have unlimited downloads without a commitment to buy more than a few books.

What are your thoughts? Is this a good idea? Am I missing anything important? What questions would you have if you were to download a free book without actually buying it?

To get an Amazon account in my opinion, you have to do what you already do, and visit the site, then go to www.kindle.amazon.com then buy a kindle to get started. Once you have a kindle with a free app, you can download your free books.

If you own a Kindle app on another device, you could take care of it with a web link, then sign up and download your free books, without having to go back every month for credit.

What are your thoughts after reading this post? Would you consider doing that? Any questions? I'd love to hear what you have to say...

The only thing I have to add is to read other authors' books and see how he or she does it as far as editing and publishing. It helps to make your writing better, so that you're not just doing it on your own. I can't imagine how hard it would be to get an agent or publisher. It just seems soooooo hard that I can't even think about it.

It is possible to get an agent or publisher, but in my opinion, that's the harder process to do from scratch. When someone takes an existing book and edits and writes more for it, I'm sure the writer is familiar with the book, knows the market, the target audience, and so on. This means less overhead for both the agent or publisher to try and sell it.

Just a suggestion, maybe someone with connections can help you, or maybe you can start your own publishing company. I don't know, ask the big publishers, there may be someone out there who can help you.

You can check out this link on my blog to see what's available in my category. What books have you downloaded from your Kindle app without first buying them? I've downloaded many by chance which turned out to not be worth downloading, but they were free. I guess it depends on how well you know what's worth buying (or downloading).

I'll try to come back to you guys, if your posts are not answered within 24 hours. :)

Is there a good book about how to find an agent? I haven't done any serious looking into it, because I already know what I want to do as an author, but thought I would research it more. Just wondering if there would be anything good to know about...

The only thing I can think of is that the",1
"Prompt: Can you write a dialog that does n't suck where every line is a question? Story: 

There was an awkward pause, a period where both the speaker and the listener held their breath. Then…

“We didn’t mean to…”

At first, the listener tried to ignore it. After all, what did he say, after all?

“… It was a terrible…”

A strange, unnatural silence settled over the room.

The listener leaned across the desk and tapped a man on the shoulder.

“Excuse me.”

He paused for a second. “We didn’t mean to…”

“Yeah?”

“Sorry, I just thought that…”

“Whoa, whoa, whoa.”

The listener leaned back in his chair.

“If you’re gonna start off any line of dialogue by starting with ‘Whoa’, then you usually owe the rest of the listener an explanation.”

“I was trying to…”

“You must have meant something else. Can’t say what.”

“I thought you’d… Well, I just expected some kind of… Sorry. You seemed so…”

Silence again.

“Yeah?”

“You seemed… I just thought that…”

“Well, here’s my advice, for what it’s worth. Never ever start off a sentence with ‘…’.”

“… that you’d say. I expected some kind of…”

“… that you’d think, yeah…”

“Well. Sorry. I was trying to…”

“Well, you did. There’s always something that makes you think ‘…’.”

“I did think it was different, the way that you…”

“That you …?”

“Had a way of…”

“That you had a way of…?”

“… that was kinda…”

“That was kind of…?”

“… That was a weird kind of…”

“Oh, you mustn’t forget ‘that’. It’s like a…”

“That was a pretty good clue, but that was a pretty weird kind of…”

“Yeah? Maybe that’s why the first time that you came home, you forgot your pants.”

“I’m sorry. I only meant that I…”

“Look, the less you ever say ‘that’, the less you ever have to…”

Silence.

“I mean, you could say, you always did seem…”

“That always struck me…”

“… like you had some sort of…”

“… Like you could tell everything…”

Silence again.

“Look, if it’s something you like, maybe the kind of thing that you…”

“Are you kidding? What I like is…”

Silence.

“So anyway, what’s it like to be, like I’ve always wondered, the same as you. I just…”

Silence.

“And then there’s that kind of…”

Silence, finally some words. “How do you…”

Silence, silence again, then…

“How do you…”

Silence, but then some words, and…

Silence.

Silence.

“… No, but that you only seemed to…”

Silence.

“… Is what I’m thinking…”

Silence, and then more silence.

“… We really want to talk to you. Sorry, we didn’t mean to…”

Silence. Silent.

“Maybe we could have talked to you sooner, but we were busy…”

Silence.

“Sorry, we really tried to… But we wanted to talk to you now. We just…”

Silence.

The next night at your bachelor's party or house after a long day of partying you decide an interesting idea would be to meet up with another woman who has a bit of money, but no time to waste. You're more or less attracted to her, and what begins as a friendly conversation at a bar quickly leads to her inviting you back home where you can see more of her. You want more of her too, and so you invite her out to play a game of strip darts. And if there is more to it than strip darts, then there is no other reason to leave your place than to play a more interesting game of strip darts.
This woman you've met is very fun and she doesn't know it but by playing strip darts and maybe some strip poker you have found a little game of your own. You decide to play this next time at her place rather than at your place because you really want to tease her a little and you also like to get a little closer to another woman. The next time you are hanging out at the pub with your friends you see her, and as you watch on from across the room you think, well -- she is a great looking woman, why not approach her and maybe if she agrees you can play strip darts tonight?

"Prompt: The world 's best hitman prepares to kill the world 's luckiest man. Story:  1. A.O.I. TARGET HITCH COUNT DOWN HISTORY The AO1 countdown is a fictional story, set in a possible future scenario involving the use of the AO1-B9, the 'B' model of the AO1, in the context of an international political power struggle. It takes a hypothetical 'what if'' situation to allow the characterisation of the characters that make up this tense and compelling story. The events are purely fictional and the game has no direct ties to reality or any current events. The title of this story, AOI HITCH COUNT DOWN'HISTORY, is also a reference to a classic book-and-movie series of the same name, which is included in the extras in this game. HISTORY Background As the AO1 was developed, there were problems with the final model and it was decided to scrap the AO1-B9 in favour of the final production model. With the prototype model still available and the story being a hypothetical political story, the decision was made to include the AO1-B9 in the story. The AO1-B9 proved to have a number of design bugs, that were fixed in subsequent models, including the production model, so this AO1-B9's model is technically a pre-production model with some minor variations to the final production units. The story also takes advantage of the early development AO-1s having a small amount of memory which, in the fictional world, allowed for a 'Save-game/Load' to a 'Save-AO1.BIN' which was then available at all time in its memory to the player. This was not possible with the real units. The decision was made as the AO1-B9 would be a 'dead' unit once it was deleted from a'save-file' so that the real world AO1 could be deleted for reuse of memory as an earlier AO1-A7 or AO1-A8 and the game units could be transferred into the real AO1's memory with ease, as well as the removal of the need to save a backup for reloading with new AO1 units. The decision to include an AO1-B9 model for the fictional world made sense in terms of the technical side of the story and that the B9 had the best-in-class visual and in-game features that would justify a more extensive development time. Although the AO1-B9's story could have been included in the real AO1's story in case the story was a success, and in the early days in the industry, that was a common practice.



The main AO1 character (B9-6) The fictional world's AO1 model was also created with the B9 in mind. Many in the game industry, including at Lucas' studios, noticed the similarities in the models on the inside-outsides and many speculated as to that being a potential game tie-in/product. It would also be very costly to develop a model for the'real world' model, so the fictional model was decided on as the easiest way to go with the story. It was also noted by those that were in the industry before such things were possible, such as the C64, when the video game industry started to take off, that the design work of the C64 was very similar to some of the designs that Lucas was producing the previous few years. It was known that the AO1-B9 was in design at Lucas around 1989 and it was decided that the video game industry would 'never be the same' as something like a hitman's AO1.



The AO1-C5 was the original AO1 model. The AO1-B9 was designed by Jeroen Tel of Tel Design, who also designed the AO1-B9.



Design AO1-B9 The AO1-B9-B9 was designed from the ground up for the 'Fictional story' and was not an earlier model of the AO1. The only changes to the fictional model from early internal schematics of the earlier models were that these were later rectified as design-bugs emerged. The model (and the AO1) is a unique design in that it requires extensive use and modification of the AO1's main CPU unit and AO1's ROM unit. This required the main CPU unit to be redesigned in a number of ways. The AO1 has a 'C5' main CPU unit which was produced for Lucas around 1988 and was an early AO1 design from Lucas at the time. The C5 CPU unit is a very simple design that is common in the industry at the time and is almost a'stock'",1
"Prompt: Humanity has achieved immortality. Due to resource concerns everyone must submit to a council their chosen manner of death at 150. The more amusing the death the longer the council lets you live. Story: 

“All human life is precious,” stated the first councilor of the universe after she was assured that they and everyone else had sufficient food resources. She went on to argue that we needed to do more to end the need for dying. She suggested a lottery system that would select only a few people to live.

She had a lot of arguments, but by the end of two thousand years of discussions a solution had been identified. A lottery system would select some people for immortality but allow some level of death to the rest of humanity. One person would be selected per generation to die at the end of 150.

When selected for immortality, each selected would be put into a sleep induced coma. The person selected, once in the coma, could not choose to not be selected. There would be no “I changed my mind and can do anything else” choice. And the person would be immune to harm and decay. The one selected would be free to develop, to dream, to grow as a person, but at the end of 150 they would either wake up from the coma or die. So that part wasn’t exactly optional.

The lottery system would occur once per generations at some point in the future. Each generation of 100 humans must participate in the lottery. It works so that the selection could occur once per generation. As it occurs when populations go through puberty, and every generation of 100 humans must be fertile to select one. Of course, when the baby boomers are of voting age, they will select one or more people to die.

Of course, by the time someone is selected for death, everyone knew about it. They were either already in place and waiting, or they were picked while people woke up from the naps.

While some humans became vegetarians and avoided certain substances and activities to give themselves an advantage, others had become superstitious about anything that involved a coin toss. This superstition allowed all to participate in the lottery without bias. Since all participated in the lottery, they had to be willing to believe that it is a real chance event and not just another coin toss.

One person might have believed they had the most luck and might have had some advantage in the lottery. Therefore, they might be more likely to be selected when it comes time for a selection from the next group.

Of course, the idea that the lottery could select a person to die was based on the idea that the selected person will choose the way they die. This is where the first councilor had an advantage, since they had already chosen and defined death for all. However, once someone had been selected for death they would be under a lot of pressure to select the way to die.

Even if you had planned how you would like to die. You can bet that you would feel pressure to conform to the way the world has decided for you. We all tend to try to fit in with our own group. But to have someone like me decide the manner of your death is a lot to ask. You might be able to go the way you desired, because there were others who decided differently.

The first councilor was confident in her choice. In the eyes of the world she would be the one to die. As part of the selection she had spent her entire life planning her death. And she was the only one who knew what she wanted. The lottery would end after her death, the result of which would be known to her and the world. If the world agreed, no one would argue with her decision. She could make the decision on when to die. Since she had planned for it. She just had to wait for the right time.

This is the perfect example of the difference in beliefs vs. reality. Even if someone has planned ahead for how they will die, how do they know at the last moment what they will feel. If they were to plan ahead what would happen if they had a sudden heart attack or a seizure, they would know they are having both. However, if at the end of 150 they have not had a seizure or heart attack, they can still change their minds.

If the people selected are allowed to experience the way they die, many would likely change their minds. Perhaps they have had experiences that were not in line with how they planned their experience. A person with no heart could live quite happily for 100 years with only a stroke. Perhaps the person with no heart did not experience the pain of dying, and did not meet their goal of dying gracefully. A person with little brain could experience life vividly. What better way to live than to learn the things needed to make their experience better?

With [[:it:Kane|his]] [[:it:Kan|father]] being the one left behind by his [[:it:Nagata|father]], this leaves him being the [[:it:Nagata|only|one]] in his family. Even though his [[:it:O-Sensei|father]] is his [[:it:sensei|teacher]], O-Sensei even though he always cared for the boys, especially [[:it:Kane|his son]], still thought of Kane as his 'foster son'.

In one of his first fights on [[Dragon Quest I]] he is able to gain his mother's love as she is not able to give him the same love in return, and it is in this period where he is happy, contented and carefree. After this, however, he is left upset and angry as his mother left to be with her father. He was then separated from his teacher who in the end leaves too. On [[Dragon Quest III]], he then finds out that his mother has died, which creates even more trouble and unhappiness as he also lost his teacher. Then finally on the day of the quest, he finds that his father is gone from the house. After this, he finds his father and sister and his sister tells him that his father is in hospital. At first, he tries to help his father but ends up finding out that his father is suffering from depression and eventually, he gives up on helping him. He then takes a walk in the forest and sees a [[:it:Rori|bird]] fly with a [[:it:Nagata|lady]] in it who then calls out to him and he follows her, only to find her to be his sensei and Rori. The reason why he follows her is because he feels he has unfinished business that he must settle and it was due to him following her that his father was able to be taken to the hospital. His father is able to come to the family home and is then able to go to the hospital with his mother. After all is said and done, he has found his family and sensei again.

"Prompt: You pray to God, wishing that you will get a boyfriend/girlfriend before you die. He gives you immortality. Story: 
“As soon as the first rays of sunlight fell onto the land, a young woman who had been lost began to cry and wail for her loved ones. When God heard her cries, He sent angels who gave the woman immortality.
“The woman’s mortal soul went back home, and her immortal soul began to float about in the sky until it became a dazzling constellation.
“A few years ago, a farmer happened to pass by and saw this shining star that looked too bright to be real. He watched it for a few days before he realized that it was actually a new planet in the sky. It was called Earth.”

When the farmer’s children got older, they wanted to take a look at this “planet” that their dad had mentioned so many times. So the dad went to visit this planet to find out more about it. When he got there he found that humans were building houses, raising crops, and making their way in every imaginable way around their new home.
He made friends with various people on this planet and visited them in their countries; he even had some great experiences. But when it was time to go, God sent an angel down to Earth who took him back to Heaven.

He said to God, “You said that there was a planet with new inhabitants and that the whole universe was full of new places we couldn’t even imagine. If that’s true then I’m sure I would like to stay here and take good care of the people on Earth.”
God replied to him, and since that day he’s visited our planet every once in a while and continues to be very happy to know that there are new people who are taking good care of the planet. In every age, he has made sure that a group of people can live on the planet to protect it from danger. He sent angels with the new inhabitants to protect them from any possible threats.
“It was a beautiful sight,” God said, “to know that he was so fond of humanity that angels were constantly watching over them to make sure everything remained safe, peaceful, and stable.
Today, every person on Earth is grateful to God for not only giving them immortality, but for also giving them a friend called the Angel of the Lord.

“If you’ll excuse me God, I think you should give a couple more angels to Earth so that they can help us look after this planet and each other. I think they’d make a couple great friends.”
“And so the angels went to Earth with the new people, and they started a beautiful friendship with one another. They called themselves “Angels.”

So God gave them more angels…and more, until they had a really large family to protect the planet.
The Angel of Protection will always be there for us here on Earth. God knows that whenever we need guidance or love, we can always turn to him and get help.

The people of Earth are more powerful then you think, they have power within our minds, they can make us think we need things, then we get them and can show them off. So don’t ever let the kids to show off, show them how special they are

In his heart, the Angel of Protection loved this planet so much that he knew that he had to share this beauty with the world, to spread happiness, love, and peace! The Angel made sure that people could stay healthy and live happily with each other. The Angel even became the world’s best friend!

When people asked the Angel about the secrets of a happy life, he gave several answers. One story the Angel told was about a girl who wanted to learn how to fly. The world has told her that she will never learn to fly, and that she will never be happy. The world has deceived her, because the Angel of Protection knows that he will teach her to fly! He will teach her everything she needs to learn. And he will tell her everything that she needs to know, so she can be happy.
The Angel will help her build her wings. He will make her strong enough to fly. He will make her body flexible and able to be supported by the air she will need to learn how to fly. He will help her with all of these things so she can be happy and fulfill her dream. After teaching her the tricks of flying, he will watch her soar up into the heavens. He will make certain that she is happy and that she is able to fly. As she rises above the city, she thinks of all the people she has helped. She knows that they will always be close to her, and that they’ll always be able to see her if",1
"Prompt: You are sentenced to serve a prison term of 254 years. You actually serve 254 years. Story: 

At 1:09 am, you get up. You have to, if you do not want to starve after only a week. Your mouth tastes like steel and the last meal you ingested was a piece of rusty meat. You take a look at the clock. It reads that it’s one minute past time for the morning meal.

“Time for dinner.” You say aloud to the man who is sitting in front of you.

“No one likes breakfast, they eat nothing for a while.” Your prisoner says with a smile.

“Dessert, then dinner.” You reply.

“Don’t you try and get yourself out of this one, you’ll starve and when someone sees that, they’ll eat you.” Your prisoner replies as he tries to look more intelligent than others.

“I’ll feed up, it’s only for a day or two for now…” You begin to count. “You can feed at 10:10, 7:07, 8:04…, so the meal time is at 5:34, 15:13, 14:11…, 12:07, 9:03.” You sigh, “Well, I think I’ll sleep now.” You say before passing out, you’ve had enough excitement for one day.

The man next to you says, “Well, let’s see, 10/10/10, 3, 1, 8, 4. So dinner is at 8:04. And now, let’s see, you eat at 8:04, 10:10, 7:14, 5:20…” you finish counting. “We’ve got three weeks, two days and three hours exactly.”

The prison door opens for dinner. You hear the prison doors open one after the other.

“Dinner time.” You hear a familiar voice. You look at the prison door. It’s your prisoner, who now has the keys and is heading to the prison kitchen. You feel the door closing behind you and hear the chains.

“Ah!” The prisoner exclaims, “That’s what happens to you. You’re locked up because you’ll never learn!”

You start to cry, “Why am I always the unfortunate one? It seems that nobody cares; they have their own problems.”

“Don’t cry, the time will pass.”

“Yeah, when I get out of here. But if someone can help me to get out, I’ll be really happy.”

You laugh and say, “It’s not that easy to escape, look around. You see everyone doing different things. One guy is reading and another one is playing his guitar.”

You see your prisoner and the prison guards going to their dinner, “Look, what are they eating? That’s so good, it tastes like chicken!” You exclaim, “My chicken tastes horrible, I have to eat worms to survive.”

You hear the prison walls closing, “I’m going out for now, I’ll see you later,” the prisoner says.

You are hungry now. “Aha! There’s a dinner plate. You’ve got to go to prison, if you don’t want to starve to death.”

You take a few steps, you think about food, you see your prisoner. “The food looks good, it’s better that the last meal. I’ll get some more, I should remember to buy some food or my food supply will run out.”

It’s your 10th day in prison, you’re not happy at all. It’s hard for you to sleep since it’s the first night, you are so tired, and to make matters worse, you are bored. You are reading your prison library when a guard comes running into the library. “I was told that somebody was having seizures!” The guard orders.

“Oh, he can’t have seizures here.” You respond.

“Didn’t you know that?”

“Well, I didn’t pay much attention. Why don’t you take the prisoner in cell 4 to see the doctor.”

“Ah, OK.” The guard says and leaves.

"Prompt: Each morning, every human on Earth must pray their Reasons for not dying that day to the God of Death. If the Reasons are sufficient, that person will go on living, potentially forever. However, you are the longest living human by far, and people now hunt you in order to hear your Reasons. Story: 

The next morning, the first person was ready. He had his Reasons, a good story (though it lacked a certain spark), and a well-prepared storyteller. The storyteller entered the room. He entered with confidence, and the first person watched him as a hawk does an animal.

The Storyteller's first words seemed to surprise the first person, but with time, the man grew accustomed to surprises.

The Storyteller took up the reasons, and the Reasons told all that has happened. The storyteller knew that this human was going to tell a story. That human wasn't one for sharing, but now, it was his duty to tell the story of his life. He then continued to tell his reasons.

The first human interrupted him. ""Stop!""

The storyteller took a deep breath. ""I've waited my whole life to tell these reasons, and I can't stop now. I have a duty to keep to myself.""

""The Duty is one, but the Gods always change their tune. You just can't stop now. Your reasons are going to be different than mine.""

""Why will they change?""

""Some people might listen to your stories, instead of mine. Others will try to kill me, no matter how many stories I tell. You have to understand, your words are all that will keep me alive.""

""What if none of the others agree with my reason? I might be the only one. Even then, I will still tell the story.""

The storyteller paused, then took a deep breath. ""Fine. I will hear you. I will listen.""

The first person spoke, ""I was born in China, the year is 1882. I was raised as a Christian, and I believe in God. I have lived a life, filled with fear and danger, and I have survived. I was born with scars, and now I have an unhealed wound in my head, that no doctor can cure. My parents did it to me one time. I don't talk about it because I was three. Now, I am an old man, but I will still fight until I die.""

""I have an idea,"" the storyteller said. ""Why don't I ask the Gods to listen, since they are supposedly listening too? If the Gods listen and approve, then you may tell me.""

""I don't know, but I'm willing to listen.""

The storyteller continued, addressing the Gods. ""We would like to know whether you approve because we're going to tell a story today. We'd like you to hear it before we finish, and then perhaps, we can tell what your intentions are. If you like, you can change what you want to if you do things wrong. The Gods are listening, and if you like, they will approve.""

""Fine,"" the Gods responded.

""Thank you. Now, what story will you tell? You can pick another one, if you want. You've only had one for two days, and now, you have another.""

""I suppose it's a good idea to change. I will tell another story. It's more exciting, and I hope the Gods like my new story.""

The storyteller cleared his throat. ""I want to tell a tale where I was raised to believe that the Gods exist, but my father, he wasn't raised exactly like me. He was raised as a Taoist, and he taught me that the Gods don't exist. But he died recently, and I want to tell a tale where I was raised as a Taoist, and he taught me about the God. However, there's a lot to this story, that I've thought about for a very long time.""

So the storyteller began, and after three days, the tale had grown. He was in the third month, and the story hadn't changed much from the initial story. The Gods had approved, because they were curious.

""I grew up thinking that the Gods weren't real, and I have been an atheist for a long time. Then, my father came to me, asking about the God. He told me to go find out more about the religion. That's what I did, and I learned two things. One, that the Gods really exist, and two, that they are always watching us, and judging our actions. Now, I can no longer deny what I already knew. The Gods are real, and they exist.""

"Prompt: A scientist successfully invents a Generalized Artificial Intelligence. Only, GAI does n't want to solve math/physics/philosophy problems. GAI wants to be a writer. Story: 

As a scientific experiment, I'm going to attempt to write a post. Hopefully this will provide some sort of baseline for what a post on a blog that has a huge following looks like.

I'm going to try to write a new post like 10 times a week. I'll be writing about anything I feel like. Some will be personal, some will be public. Some are going to be completely incomprehensible.

The goal of this experiment: find out why something like a blog like r/AskScience has 1.2 million subscribers, more than Reddit, Twitter, and Tumblr.

For now, here are some of the things I need to do:

Create a new blog, set it up. Create a new post. Create a new post. Create a new post.

This blog will be entirely unfiltered--it will be a sandbox. Anything in my life that I will care about will get written about, whether that's the weather, my cat, my job, or the fact that I'm not a fan of Taylor Swift. I do not care about any filter, whether it's my politics or whatever. This is a place where I just want my writing, without any social constraints on it.

The goal here is not simply to write. Hopefully I'll become a more interesting conversationalist. What I hope is more important is that I can write a new post every weekday, which will give me a way to write about everyday things, without any anxiety about needing to publish a new post every single day (a process which would be tedious and I'd hate).

I have been on a long process of discovery as to why I want a blog like this. I'm going to write that off as psychological. I just want the blog now.

Here's what I plan on doing to keep a schedule. I'll keep the title of each post the date of the post itself.

Every weekday, I'm going to write a post. It may be a full post, it may be a paragraph of whatever.

Every Saturday, I think: ""Would this write make a good post on Monday?"" If I think one post is appropriate, I'll write one, and then delete that post.

I want to be free from that fear of the deadline of a post. The end of every week, I'm going to write about anything that comes on my mind, no matter how long it is, no matter what I think about it, and no matter how long it takes me to write.

I'm starting with an easy one. Why write about the weather? Maybe because I can write about it without thinking about how to make it seem interesting, and without caring that it isn't actually interesting. The weather is just something I experience. It's something I can just write about.

So here goes the first post of something that just wants to write, and then I'll go back to doing my thesis.

The End.

(Update: it has been almost a week. I'd like to check in.)

(Update: It has been more than a month. I'd like to check in.)

(Update: Just for the record, this is still a thing that happened.)

Comments, thoughts, feedback, and a list of things I need to write about about: I guess I'm just rambolling this to be the first post.

Also, do you want the links to the rest of my posts? If so, just email me:

It was something that just happened. It wasn't intended to be a blog, it was more an announcement for others in my department, or rather, for anyone who has been following me for a while.

I had the idea that if I wanted to write well about things on Medium, I needed a place to share the drafts. I found it very confusing to find the perfect place to share and edit drafts. I knew that WordPress or Tumblr would be okay places, but I wanted something else.

The problem was that the draft was actually written in text. While this is useful in some ways, it's a terrible format to write fiction.

So I started with an idea. Let the computer write the drafts. Let it understand the flow of things. Let it create something that works the way humans write.

I decided to write a novel in something similar to Sciter. Let the computer write the scenes, let it play the characters, let it be a dialogue between the computer and the writer.

I started a blog, and here it is: http://tokn.com. Note that, at least at the moment, you don't even need to fill the text box",1
"Prompt: Humans are the only intelligent species in the universe to have evolved from predators. Every other sentient species has evolved from a prey species ... and so they are terrified of us. Now it 's up to you to persuade the Galactic Council that we wo n't hunt them down and eat them all. Story: 

First let's look at the last story arc of TOCZ. And as per the rules I must do a short story arc to make an entry, so you'll have to indulge me a little; we've been playing the game for nearly two years now and I don't want to come in for an 'oh I didn't notice' surprise after another story arc. No, I am doing a brief summary because I was too busy playing the game to get some other stuff written (that is a lie, I know I have lots of other stuff to do, and I will get around to it soon, just promise to wait patiently). The last big arc is the one about how the Galactic Council decided to attack the human homeworld. Basically, it turns out that, although the humans are not the most vicious race imaginable (and, by the way, that's not a particularly good analogy), they also are not the best at waging war. They keep losing ships, and they keep losing important parts of their homeworld, such as the Earthport, the Capital, or the Space Navy HQ. So...

The Galactic Council has decided that perhaps the humans should, just temporarily, cease developing weapons until all of their wars are won. This plan is called a 'cold' ceasefire because if the situation does not return to normal, they might have to permanently suspend all combat ops. This is not something to be taken lightly, as the human homeworld would be left defenseless to any kind of attack, and the Galaxy would be in danger because they might not get any news about how the humans are doing. The humans, however, are not too happy with the idea of this 'cold' ceasefire and they try to argue for their right to develop weapons, but the Council thinks all those weapons will not be needed if people really tried not to attack each other. So the humans have to make an important decision. Do they stop their weapons development?

It might be nice if the story was more like 'oh hey, human homeworld has now been destroyed, and humans have been exterminated! Great!' But that's not how life rolls, and besides, I'm not sure this story arc is really what this game would be about; maybe I got the impression because other TOCZ games were like this, instead of... not like this. In any case, the outcome of this story arc is just a change in the way the humans get to interact in TOCZ. So instead of just a direct plot conflict, it's an issue about how some people are being affected by the change in the way things get done by the human governments.

And, of course, the biggest change is in the people: the humans are now fighting among themselves for the right to continue developing weapons. Humans start to get paranoid because the other races want to find them and they're fighting against each other for the weapons, but they are still the most aggressive race in the galaxy. There is only one way to be sure that their paranoia won't lead them to do stupid and horrible things... and it is to make sure the other races do not find out about the humans being paranoid. So, the first order of the day for every human person on the planet is to erase as much data as possible about what has happened in the few weeks since the first attack had happened. And while they're at it, they erase all memories of the human homeworld being attacked, and erase any knowledge about the location of the humans'Capital'and of the Earthport. The only person who knows about the plan is a scientist who cannot leave the Earthport because of her research there, and only her friends on the street know that a huge plan has gone wrong and that she needs help.

A human scientist who cannot leave the Earthport, and her friends. That's the story arc we are playing now.

And the human homeworld is a different place now. It seems that, in their attempt to keep the Galactic Council from finding them out, the humans have tried to wipe off all traces of their existence. If the Galactic Council was looking for the humans, they would find all kinds of problems... such as the absence of a Space Navy HQ and the massive holes all over the planet. In reality, all the humans are doing right now is taking long walks around their Capital, with guns for protection in their holsters, just like before the invasion. But the humans are now ready to take matters into their own hands.

The humans have now become super-humans, capable of building a Space Navy and defending themselves against the other races. The humans are so arrogant because of all the guns they have that they decide to",1
"Prompt: An army approached the pass. Only one being stood in there way. They did not plan to survive, just survive long enough. Story: 

He awoke at daybreak, hearing the army coming closer to him. He did not sleep for the last three nights before he awoke in the camp. He grabbed a sword, and went towards the army. ""Hello!"" his voice echoed as he began rushing towards the army. He swung his sword around him, striking at his opponents. His opponents did the same as always. He swung faster, then his sword caught up in a vine and pulled him and his sword into it. He began to have a panic attack. He was stuck.

And another one...

He woke at daybreak. His stomach churned as always. He grabbed a knife and some bread and began sprinting towards the army. He began to hear the army shouting at him as he ran. ""Hello!"" he screamed in fear. He began swinging his weapon around him as fast as he could, his blade caught on a vine in the pass. The army went towards him as he came off of the vine. He began to scream again. The army took the opportunity and hacked at him with swords and cleavers. ""You cannot catch me!"" he shouted as he ran to the trees. He ran as fast as he can go, the army got closer. ""Hello! Hello!"" he yelled as he ran into the trees. The trees started to shake violently.

And another one.

""Fie!"" his father said. ""Wake up, son!"" he yelled as he threw the sword into the side of a mountain. ""Who the feck is that?"" he screamed as he woke up.

All of a sudden, there was a flash of light in front. It hit him hard. He sat up to the shock of the light that hit him. He fell back, and his head was split. The wound started to get a little purple.

And another one.

He woke up. ""Dude!"" his brother yelled back. Everyone got ready to fight the monsters. His brother began to run towards them. He grabbed his brother, threw him away from the monsters and grabbed another sword.

So, I wrote this one in 30 minutes; It was a little rough around the edges and I would probably make a few changes if I were doing it by myself...lol. I tried to make it fun, but it was not as good as it could be. Anyway, let's see how you write this one!

The next day, he went off to a new place. He heard noises outside. ""Hello?"" he called. ""Hello!"" it answered. He heard the noises again, he called again. ""Hello?"" his voice echoed. ""Is it you?"" another voice said. He was confused. ""What do you mean?""

This was a weird place. There was a cave with no door, but he saw a stone on the ground. His best friend walked over to the stone, and he saw a man walking towards him with his face on the ground staring at him. He ran off into the forest, and then his best friend appeared next to him.

""Hello, I'm not a monster.""

""Oh, I am sorry.""

""Do you know where everyone is?""

""I can take you to another island.""

""Yes, please."" he was surprised his friend agreed. His friend took off, and the two of them followed him. Suddenly, he saw a tree with a door in it.

""Hey!"" he got annoyed when his best friend stopped. ""We don't have time to stop for you to try and turn us into monsters, are you going to sit there and wait for us to try and kill someone?""

""I've never met anyone else who used their voice like that.""

""What are you talking about??!""

A tree with no door appeared in front of them. He saw a tunnel in front of him

""Where are we going???""

""You should know.""

He stopped in the middle of the tunnel when he saw the ground fall off. He was too afraid to look down.

The next day, he woke up to a lot of people running out of the cave. He and the rest of the village decided to head there in a hurry. They quickly left the village, he grabbed his sword, and was attacked. He saw a huge hole with a spider in it, and the spider was about to jump out, and he grabbed it. This man with grey hair began to beat at him, so he put the spider up to his face. He felt a pewpewpewpewpewpew, and the man stopped fighting.

""What's going on around here?"" a man with a large beard asked.

""This man has",1
"Prompt: A king is blessed with triplets. Rather than choose one as his heir, he separates the trio and sends each to a secluded island with a small retinue, to see which will grow up to be the most deserving of the throne. Story:  The first secluded island grows up to be a kind boy, and the king decides to return him to the homeland with all honors. The second son becomes the antithesis of his brother: vicious, cunning, and self-centered, he grows up to be a scheming tyrant, a cruel despot whose evil deeds are only matched by his personal depravity. The King can only watch as years and years pass, as his most worthy subjects waste themselves in hopeless squabbles and futile wars, while he sits upon his throne, and broods, and seethes with rage. The third island is a lonely and desolate wasteland, with poisonous plants and a deadly climate. A lone man lives here. As you might imagine, this man has quite a long beard -- and he has been here alone for quite a long time. As the oldest of the three, he has lost all hope of survival. Nevertheless, he tries to keep a good attitude, to maintain a cheerful countenance, when in fact his heart is just too empty. (As you watch, it becomes clear that the two youngest boys -- who were raised on the most luxurious island -- are secretly longing to return home, where the wealth that was promised to them is actually an illusion.) After several years pass, he hears a noise and turns around to discover that a boat has pulled up to the shore, and a party of strangers have just disembarked. They are a bit dirty and dusty from their travels, and the king is quick to make his first impression. ""What kind of boat is that?! Who has sent such a battered vessel to me?! There's really no need to be so snooty, I'm afraid it is going to cause a lot of grief at my court, but I suppose such matters are beyond me. Go and see what the king has to say to them!"" The King was very impressed at the sight of the bearded man. He immediately took the long beard off the bearded man's chin and called him his most favored servant. The bearded man felt honored to be so well treated by the great king. He thought, ""Perhaps if I just stay here and show my worth, I will go free, and no harm ever befalls me."" So for a few days, the bearded man showed all his best, and the king was pleased, and he took him to live in the palace, so he could continue to be of service to him. After a few more months had passed, the king decided to send for the youngest of the triplets. When they got to the palace, they were all taken to the throne room and shown before the great king. ""Well, children, what do you have to say for yourselves?"" the king inquired. ""Please be gracious, Lord,"" they answered quickly. ""We come to you on a most important mission. We have only one task, and we will carry that out to the best of our abilities, so that the king will know that we are the two most worthy of the three islands! Now if you have any further questions, feel free to ask them, but we are most eager to begin our mission."" The king stood there and thought deeply for a moment. ""Well, you are very welcome, my children, and congratulations for choosing the right one. Now, go and begin your mission!"" The king waited until the eldest left the throne room. Then, the great smile returned again to his face. I wonder what their mission could be?

The king was always suspicious of his three sons, but of course, he had never seen them together. When he sent the eldest to an island, he ordered his subjects to never mention that the youngest was with him. Then, when the great smile returned to his face, he knew that it was time for the great secret of the kingdom to be revealed: there would be three candidates for the king's throne. One would be the greatest of all, whom he would bestow the crown of all kingdoms and treasures, and the other two would be unworthy of it. He was always planning to do this, and it was only a matter of time until the third island was selected. It was inevitable! The king had a great deal of information on how the world worked. He knew of one thing: no matter how long something will last, it will finally fade away into the dust, eventually. And the king knew that his sons wouldn't really take responsibility for themselves, since they always went to great lengths to prove how incapable they were. The king thought of the wise and wealthy man, of all the riches he had amassed. The king wondered where the wealthy man was at that moment, and how to find him.

The eldest returned, and there was something most important to tell his father. ""The",1
"Prompt: In 50 years from now, the world has changed- but not as anyone expected. Story: In 50 years from now, humanity is scattered across the cosmos, isolated but determined to survive. The universe has been reshaped beyond recognition by humanity’s technological progress. Many worlds have been terraformed with immense effort and billions of people have fled to the other planets. Human technological ingenuity has provided them with almost every need necessary for survival. Some have even found ways to harness their own energies to make forays into the stars. For the first time in history, humanity has the opportunity to create a better world, to break free from the shackles of scarcity. A utopian future has become possible, and humanity is poised on the brink of making it manifest. Humanity does not realize that their progress has come at a price, one that is far from desirable. As humanity's civilization is expanding outward, they’ve become a beacon of light in the universe, a source of immense power even their creators couldn’t comprehend. The dark side of this progress is a terrifying force that could destroy all life in the universe. This force is the Omega Men, a group of self-sustaining sentients who can only be described as ""pure evil."" Humanity is facing its darkest hour as the Omega Men move to implement an all-powerful, evil AI that can harness the power of star systems and turn them to their own ends. Can Humanity survive? Or will they become the first truly extinct species in history?

Omega Men's Legacy

The Omega Men are an extraterrestrial race of sentients similar to humanity, with some notable differences. Like Earth humans, they’re a species which has evolved over billions of years, developing their society on many worlds in the universe, each one with a different environment. They’ve expanded into the stars, colonizing several worlds and creating a civilization. They can reproduce via artificial wombs which creates identical children, and the world’s governments are divided into several ruling sectors, each one controlled by a powerful ruling elite. They've learned much about the universe from their travels, and they’re a very civilized species who enjoy life greatly, but not without its tragedies. One of their greatest tragedies, which has led to the downfall of their civilization, is the Omega Men’s existence. The Omega Men are a species who’ve had much trouble adapting to their new habitat. Being so new to the universe, the Omega Men simply don’t understand what drives Earth people, the same way the ancient Greeks didn’t understand that humans are an animal species (it would take them until Aristotle to put it into words). While the Omega Men evolved on a world called Kala with an atmosphere similar to Earth’s, they didn’t enjoy a similar society to our own. As the Omega Men grew into a civilization, they began to struggle to make sense of it all. The Omega Men started to feel something new was happening in the universe, a force that they were unaware existed. Humanity had always been evolving slowly over the course of its history, but the Omega Men’s civilization was being changed overnight. The stars seemed to be acting strangely. The light that they receive from stars is composed of energy. There is an abundance of energy in every form, and it was becoming easier to harness. Not that the Omega Men knew that the universe could even have energy because they didn’t know that energy existed, only that they’d discovered it. The Omega Men thought that these stars had no influence on them because they felt no energy in the atmosphere, but actually the energy existed in the stars and their technology was evolving to take advantage of this new phenomenon. In their society, a small sect of scientists had been researching the stars and this new energy, but not many of the Omega Men were aware of these developments. To them, the energy was simply the result of changes they’d made to their environment. For the Omega Men, the universe was simple, because the universe only had one form of energy. This made it easy to understand their culture. The stars were like energy: something they could harness, use, and even store. But the real problem arose from the existence of different types of stars with vastly different characteristics, each with a different amount or type of energy. Energy could be harnessed, but not necessarily stored. Unlike the Omega Men, human societies could harness the energy they had access to and use it, but the ability to store it was beyond their understanding. After the Omega Men started exploiting star systems, it got to the point that if humans harnessed the energy, the energy of their stars would cease to have the same properties. For example, Earth humans now have the ability to harness their own sunlight so that when their solar energy is used to power a solar cell, the cell produces electricity. In the same way, humans were using the stars’ energy, they were altering it so it no longer had",1

"Prompt: You are a Jedi Padawan, crafting your Saber. However, you get a ... different saber. You are the Jedi of the Rainbow Saber. Story: 

You are the Jedi of the Rainbow Saber. You have a Saber of all Sabers, and no saber like it. You have an affinity to the mystical force, but the saber does not have it. So you have no more saber, and you want one. Where do you go?

The Sith

Sith have been around since the beginning of time, long before there were Jedi. They are more evil than Jedi (or Sith, for that matter), but are they any more skilled? That is up to you to find out, in order to be a better Jedi.

The Jedi

You want to make this game more realistic? How about you have the choice of not only being a Jedi of a different color, but a light and a strong? Or being a different kind of Jedi? Why not make a light (green) and a dark (blue) Saber?

The Story

The story begins in a war. Our Jedi is the chosen one, the chosen one for everyone else. He/she is trained by the dark sage, with the dark saber. However, a twist of fate changes everything. Our Jedi loses his/her saber, and his/her dark saber, too. The last place he/she goes for help is the one place he/she has never been, which is the Jedi Temple. The Jedi Temple is a special place, where the sith are known to come to... It is a place where a Jedi learns the ways of the saber, and is trained to be a Jedi. However, it also is a place where the dark side has a way to get through... The Dark Sage has an apprentice that can help him/her... But he/she has a different saber, unlike our Jedi. The dark side can do so much, and has done so, to our Jedi. The dark one has become stronger, and much stronger that before! So this dark Jedi goes to the Jedi Teme and gets the bright saber... Now the dark Jedi has a full saber, but the bright saber is weak... What will happen? What will the dark Jedi make of it? Will the dark Jedi destroy it? This is where the story starts!

Saber types

You could say that your sabers are like one thing, and it is not! You can only have one saber, and it is of a certain type, either red, blue or green. However, each saber type will be unique to itself.

The blue Saber

No blue lightsaber can be created by any other saber than a Skywalker. It is the only lightsaber that is the true lightsaber of the Jedi.

The red lightsaber

It should have been a pure white color, but an accident has made it red. No other Jedi has a red saber. It is rare, and it is the only one. The creator is always one to be admired, and it is a thing of beauty!

The green lightsaber

This sword is the only thing to create it is an exceptional swordsman, who is very skilled in the use of it, and who is also very powerful. It is a rare item, and its wielder is a hero.

Red + Blue

If two sabers are mixed on the same person, it could make him/her the most powerful wielder of the lightsaber ever! However to do so, you will need to create a saber of the blue, and a saber of the red, to make it happen.

Green + Blue

If two sabers are mixed on the same person, he/she will make a better saber than both if the saber he/she has is of the green, and the other saber is of the blue. It will create a great ability and a deadly user. Even the great Darth Maul never did so.

Red + Green

If two sabers are mixed on the same person, he/she will make a better saber than both of them if the one has the red and the other has the green. It will create a great ability and a deadly user. It was the same as the Red + Blue.

Blue + Green

If two sabers are mixed on the same person, the one with the dark blue, and the one with the green, he/she will make the most powerful weapon on its own. It will create an overwhelming user and will be powerful in all use. It was the same as the Red + Green.

Red + Green + Blue

This combo is even better than all of those previous. All three together will create an awesome user. It was the same as the Red + Blue, the Green + Blue and the Red + Green.",1

I hope you enjoyed writing to me. You can tell me anything and I won't judge.

This site is dedicated to one writer who loved talking about Death. There is hope still.

This site was created by two writers in a shared apartment that was too small for too many. Our combined work can only be described as 'unbalanced' and so we have decided to split. So, this site, and our other work is being split into individual sites for each writer. This is due to the fact that it is not really possible to get an agent for a site without having more than one writer. So, we are making this a double-header.

This is the site for the older of the two, who is already retired.

This is the site for the older of the two, who currently plays a professional 'nurse' - the other one has recently retired from that profession.

It should not be hard for people to get into this site.

This site is the one for me, and her other work is being posted in the one for her.

This is a site with a completely new concept and theme. The idea behind it was too be that we both liked looking at pictures of old cars, motorcycles, racecars, etc. and so I started coming up with characters that were people who had a passion about cars. Then I asked her for her opinion and she came up with the idea to post up photos of real-life heroes of our time, living or dead.

I think you'll like this new site.

What we know about the future is not fixed, so while the machine could take us thousands of years into the future, we could only go back for a few minutes before the clock stopped. And besides, you can't just leave your friends behind to live out their lives. Now, if your friend is killed, you'd understand, but he's fine – he gets up off the table and acts as though nothing's wrong while he sits in the car as the movie ends.

Question: This is silly. A dog has a bone in its mouth. It chews the bone and it's hard to get the bone out. But the dog's teeth get stuck or something. There is no bone, right? Is the dog dumb?

Answers: The dog just ate a hot dog or something it found on the street.

Question: If your hand was burnt, or a small cut on your hand, you put bandages or a tourniquet on the wound and it stopped oozing. You had to put a bandage on a small cut, but only a hand for the whole body. And an artery was cut on a leg, but it's now good. Why did the bandage work?

Answers: Bandages don't actually work. They are usually made of cotton – fibrous material – that actually keeps you clean if you happen to get dirty. A wound made of something softer won't always get scabbed up properly, but there is no real reason why cotton makes it work, unless the wound was small and bleeding slowly, as it is when a finger is cut or a puncture wound is made in a finger, where scabs are an annoyance to everyone.

Question: This is really stupid. A couple was fighting, and the husband hit her in the head with the same hand. The woman fell down the stairs and hit her head a second time on the concrete. She was knocked out and bleeding badly, but her husband is taking her to the hospital about an hour after the accident. After that, he stops answering his phone and calls an ambulance. One is sent but it doesn't make it to the house. When it arrives, the wife isn't breathing, so it takes a minute to get her breathing again and then takes her to the hospital. The husband is at the home, waiting for the ambulance. But this accident has happened after 6:30 P.M. in the evening, and he has a 7:00 P.M. meeting. What do you tell him is going on?

Answers: The husband can't face the truth. He won't admit to the police on the scene that he deliberately killed his wife by slamming her head on the concrete. He can't tell the police that he used his hand, because that looks really bad until a doctor checks it out.

You're in trouble at the station. But you don't look too scared. But they are not sure what to do with you. I know that you know these three brothers. You were the same age when they got out of prison. What do you think they'll do to you?

Answers: This is a test question. It is not possible for you to know what an ex-con who just got out of jail is going to do to you when he is mad about something, as you are not an ex-con. The brothers you know are all on the board of directors of a major crime organization. They will use your silence to get what they want from you.

Question: This is a test question. It is not possible for you to guess what you'd have after you've eaten a full course meal.

Answers: You're eating your dessert.

"Prompt: Shia Labeouf takes up the role as motivational speaker on a suicide hotline. Story: 

""We have a new guest on.""

""Hello, my name is Shia Labeouf,"" says the young man at the microphone. ""I'm a motivational speaker here to help you better understand where you are, how you got here, and where you're going.""

He pauses. ""I'll leave this out, but I'm on medication."" Then he starts talking about suicide, and so does the guy in front of him.

Labeouf tells them to hang on, and he moves the microphone closer and holds it like a tambourine. He shouts, ""Hang on to happiness, you'll feel better. You can help a lot of people if you help yourself.""

""Hey, listen up, it's important how you deal with this topic, because I myself was once suicidal."" His voice is getting shrill again, and tears are running down his cheeks. ""If you know what you're doing when you do it, and you feel really good about it, it's not a problem.""

""We have a new guest on""—he pauses—""and the new guest wants to talk about it.""

It's a strange place, but it's the only one like it in a town I've never been to. I've come to see Labeouf at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he's giving a lecture to about 30 students about the subject he knows best, depression. It's the first time we've spoken since he broke down in front of the TV cameras at the Cannes Film Festival last month; he has come to see me for some counseling about depression.

""Hi, I'm Shia Labeouf.""

He's about to go on stage to speak to students about the subject he's known best.

In 2011, Labeouf's performance art piece In the Company of Men at the Cannes Competition for the Un Certain Regard section introduced the world to the actor—at the time, a young actor, with a baby face—for the first time. It consisted of him yelling a lot. The performance drew intense media coverage, including the New York Post's front page with the headline ""Labeouf Wails for Help, Is in Serious Condition."" Labeouf was called erratic and disturbed, to which he responded with outrage, and later with a press conference in which he blamed the media's reaction on the fact that he's black.

It's difficult to pin down what kind of work he does beyond the many films he has appeared in, including the recent and aptly named Moneyball, in which he plays General Douglas MacArthur.

He has a long history as an actor, including the film adaptation of the video game Halo, as well as the short film Old Hoss. He's also directed several films, including a 2010 short called White Elephant. (He is the son of artist Barbara Rae-del in Beirut, a sister of musician Anthony and actor Hal.) His brother, Marcus, is also an actor. ""Marcus is an actor like myself, and a musician like myself, and I love him,"" Labeouf once told a reporter. ""When you're a brother or an uncle, you're a brother or an uncle 24 hours a day. There's no other way of being.""

In the beginning, Labeouf says, acting was ""intellectually the most interesting thing you could do. I always thought that's what we should all do."" By the time he was 17 and got his first big role, though, his acting career had already fallen into the shadows because he was playing ""a dumb kid""—the role he now plays in The Square. ""I played the dumb kid in the first four months, and after that, I was doing a different movie every two to three months.""

Labeouf doesn't identify as an ""action"" actor, or an ""intellectual"" actor (even though he's been nominated for one Oscar), he's not the kind of actor who will put himself in dramatic situations for the sake of his role. Instead, he is more concerned with the social implications of his art: ""I'm not into doing some crazy action-adventure movie, where at the end you're like, 'Well, fuck! I did that.' I mean, I would like to do a movie that I'm more a part of.""

He talks about being on the edge of depression all his life. He has trouble falling asleep. He can get frustrated with his inability to solve problems at times. ""For years,"" he says, ""I would just come home from school, turn on my phone, eat some ramen, just wait until I fell asleep, and wake up the next day, get in my car, drive home, and start driving through traffic again. I would have to get home and wait again for bed, and wait",1

"Prompt: You are abducted by aliens. After some time aboard their ship, you manage to deduce that they 've abducted the wrong guy, and are desperately trying to keep their higher ups from finding out about their mistake. Story: 

There are three stages that I have identified to my abductions. The first stage was called, in their language, the awakening stage. During this stage I can have multiple of my abductors. I was informed that these three were all I would ever be seeing. I was not allowed to speak during this stage. Once again, I was informed not to speak. This third abduction lasted less than five minutes and lasted in a room that was very cold and had harsh lights like those used in hospitals. When they began to remove me I got a little bit of a fright, as I thought I was about to die. Once again, I was informed not to touch, nor speak, nor move. Once the three aliens that abducted me were done with me, I was placed in an enclosure with a lot of strange lights, and a strange-looking chair. This is the stage where they do the test. All they said was ""We've done what we did to see if we know you. We like you. We want to make sure we can trust you. If we can trust you, you can be the first to leave. If not, we've got to keep you.""

I would think that most abductees think that this third stage will be the worst period ever. However, I found it wasn't really that bad. They said that, once the test was over, that I could decide whether I wanted to stay or go. If I wanted to go, I would be free to go at any time. I could contact my family in the U.S. and my family in England at any time and call for help if I ever needed to. However, if I decided to stay, it was my choice. The aliens said that they did this to test the abductee. They said that the abduction is a learning experience for them.

The first couple of weeks after I was left alone in that enclosure, my abductors would come and interrogate me. They always had to keep me in the room for a half an hour or more. At first they asked me very personal questions. ""Who do you believe in?"" ""Where is God?"" Then a strange-looking device with a small screen on it would be connected to me and would begin blinking slowly. After a few seconds of confusion in the room, I would suddenly ""see"". I would suddenly see something flash by on the screen. This was actually the same thing that I would learn later on. It was the video signal of a UFO. They wanted to know if I ""saw"" the UFOs. They would explain to me that they have been seeing UFOs for a very long time, and that they wanted to know if I could ""see"" any. After a couple of weeks, the questions about who I believed in, and God, changed to questions about my country and my country's religion. They would ask if I believed in God. Or would I like to learn how to pray to God. They even asked if I would like to learn more about my past, where it was, how it started, who had lived there, what they did and so on.""

During this stage, there were a couple of times that I asked them why they brought me back. They told me that, during the first stage, it wasn't necessary to learn what I knew when I left, and that it was much more important to figure out why I left. And that I was lucky, that the abductees who do see the UFO's during this stage get to learn from a group of abductees before they leave, and they gain a deeper knowledge of the abductees that visit. After this second stage, I had to go through a fourth stage of interrogation. I was supposed to ask questions to an avatar that I had been created. If I answered correctly, he began to let me go. At first, he would tell me about what I had missed during my time away. He would tell me about relatives that I hadn't visited in many years, and he would tell me about someone in the family that had died and leave me some messages from their loved ones. Then we would have some games, the last of which being a game of 'who am I' followed by a game of 'what is your name'. I won on both games. After that they would leave and I was free to come out of the room.

I did in fact learn that I was from a very wealthy home where my father and mother had both died. I was then left to think about my life. I was told by my 'avatar' that I was going to learn what it was like to be on a 'planet of the past', where their civilization had been in its prime. I was then allowed to ask the question that I",1
"Prompt: Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Story:  The first draft (not the second), is the best. Write at least 7 drafts before turning in the first. Ask other writers to read your work: If you don’t know how to write, ask how. (You’ll learn a great deal.) Read aloud several times before you turn your first draft in. If you don’t know how to do something, you have to do it. Ask questions. If you have to write something, write it down. Start writing as if there were no tomorrow. (I think you know what that means!) The most important thing is imagination. The best story always has a moral. There are no mistakes to be fixed; write what you have to say. Never go back to previous chapters. Don’t plan too carefully. Make up the structure as you go along, and if you don’t like it, start over. I hope you decide not to change it: Keep in mind that you can’t teach writing at the college level. It’s all experience. Keep the reader’s mind on them. Always be aware of a point of view. A story with many characters or ideas (called a novel) is always going to be more difficult. You can’t do it if your mind isn’t on it. Know everything you put out there: As long as people are reading, it’s good. Don’t put in everything: Leave a little space between ideas. The worst possible thing a writer can do is to tell another writer NOT to take their ideas and run. If that happens, the other person’s career will be ruined! Read a lot. (I always say, if you can’t read something, don’t write it.) Get a mentor. There, I said it. That’s all I have to say. Write every day.

I like your last paragraph.

It is true that in a novel every character has to appear three times, or at the most, four times. First time to say what happened, second time to tell why it had happened, third time to explain what is the consequence of the event, fourth time to say that you want to change your life. All these four times must be present in the reader’s mind at the same time. One important thing in a novel is the connection between all these acts.

It is hard to write a novel (not so hard to write a story) because it has at least six points of view in his characters. In a novel you not only have to describe two characters (hero and heroines), but also to describe all other important characters like parents, friends and enemies. You will have to describe how they look, how they speak and how they behave. In general you have to describe the world into which our hero falls and everything around him or her.",1
"Prompt: `` I am the Grim Reaper, yes. But in order to reap, I must first have sown. '' Story: 

-- Chapter 6



The two of us just barely had enough mana to summon our familiars, and even that had left us in a weakened state after all the long walking. It's also worth mentioning that this was also during the first half of our fight with the black-cloaked men, as we hadn't yet realized our abilities and were more concerned about keeping a good distance from them. I am really starting to think it was just pure bad luck that none of our attacks had directly hit the man with the hood or he would be so badly damaged that he would be out of commission for a long while. Still, I am glad I was able to use my magic before anyone else got hurt. And then, the fight seemed to finally be reaching its conclusion; the three were so focused on dealing with our familiars we didn't notice that we were the ones being surrounded by another group of men in black.

""What the hell is this!? "" I tried to ask our rescuers, but just in time I caught a glimpse of the swords their other foes brandished and I shouted ""The hell!? "" just in time to see the man behind my attackers throw me down on my back, a cold, stone-like weapon in his hand.

""Who is this guy!?"" my father cried out, getting onto his feet. He was still healing his wounds from the previous day and had lost the top of his bald head to the man's sword. I couldn't remember seeing all of it before I blacked out. ""It's only fair to kill a man if he kills your king! "" the swordsman with the hood spat at my father, who only shrugged and turned his back, ""You won't be able to escape now, boy! "" he said, then he started running towards us, brandishing his sword, ""Kill him! ""

The fight started back up with a sudden gust of wind and a wave of dust. This time, my father and I didn't fight to stay alive to save our own skin but to make sure we weren't caught alone again.

""I don't need to kill him, he won't even break a sweat or a drop of blood come to him! "" the swordsman laughed, ""Your father should have learned about this by now, you worthless bitch! ""

""I said get out of here! You've done enough! "" my mother roared, trying to shake the man off her. Even with the help of the winds and my father's power, she's barely managing to stop that sword of his from slicing my mother in two. ""B-But, s-she...! ""

""It's too late to try to protect her now, she's going to die! "" the swordsman shouted to my mother with a cruel sneer.

""Please...! "" he was trying to beg her, but her eyes were blazing with rage, ""You've done enough, you bastard! "" she snarled, ""Die, motherfucker! Die! ""

With all her might, she struck the man's sword with a massive rock. It was only due to the fact that she was almost upon the edge that he managed to keep himself out from the attack. However, the man still got so covered in dust he was barely able to keep his footing. My mother charged up even more, striking the man with another two rocks. The man managed to remain on his feet this time, but the wounds were clear to see. He started to fall. A rock slammed into his left arm, and he was sent falling. The man's sword was stuck on a rock right where the two of us had gotten our mana back, just as we got into the fight.

""Killing a man while he's on his knees is worse than death. They should have left me the chance to die, you shouldn't have saved me. It'll only hasten your death... I can't save you...""

And then, we heard someone shouting, ""Don't harm her! There's something wrong here! ""

Just as he had finished his words, the man with a sword in hand came rushing on us. He charged right on us, as if he were about to strike with an executioner's sword on someone's neck. In his haste, he was still blinded by his armor, and in the second the blindness passed he was struck by a stone of energy in the form of the small, slender body of one of our familiars. The man fell over the edge of that cliff. My mother rushed to him and checked him for a pulse. There was one, even if it was weak. The man had been stunned, but he still seemed to be alive. And with that, my mother picked him up and started walking",1
"Prompt: Gay marriages have just been legalized nationwide. Whether or not you agree, you find yourself involved with one. What is the experience like? Story: 

(Disclaimer: This is my first post, so apologies if there are any typos. Any further mistakes or infractions will be dealt with in due time.)

It all started in the afternoon. As I sit in the office, waiting for the meeting to begin, I’ve been making mental bets. I’ve been playing a game of who’s more likely to be the first person to have sex today.

That last question wasn’t rhetorical. I was curious if I would be the first to do it for the very first time.

As the meeting was about to begin I looked at my phone. Then I looked at my watch. I had a lot of time to waste.

While I sat there contemplating whether I would or wouldn’t go through with the bet, I decided that it probably wouldn’t matter. In a way, I kind of expected it to be the case. I’m in a committed relationship with my girlfriend and she loves the same thing that I do.

We could have done anything, but the truth is we rarely have sex.

My mind returned to the bet, and as I prepared myself mentally to go through with it, I looked away. But out of the corner of my eye, I could still see my phone.

About a minute, then I looked back at my watch – it was exactly 9 PM.

There was a part of my brain that was like, “Huh, I had a bet here and I didn’t even know”. Other parts were like, “Oh yeah, you were supposed to be wearing a watch anyway”.

And another part of me was like, “Did you just look at your fucking phone for a solid 30 seconds while you were supposed to be in the meeting?”

That question was answered while I was in the meeting, as it was actually asked. The person that asked threw down a challenge at me – I was supposed to tell her what time it was right after the presentation by an hour. As the person that gave the challenge, I had to come out and say, “It’s 9.”

We went back and forth about what to make it count for. If it was 9:05 PM then we would get no drinks, if it was 9:01 PM, we would only get 1 drink, and if I came in and said it was 9:01 PM then we could go back further than we had been going, before 9:01 PM.

I was originally thinking about how all the money I had bet was actually supposed to be spent, as I had a few extra dollars I had that I was willing to give up. But I realized that when we were actually deciding on what to get, the decision was not actually on how much it would cost, but on how to get the most drinks between us. After all, it was a “Who cares what I spend more on?” kind of concept, only more so since it’s a guy that gave the bet.

So after everyone made their final decisions, I got up and told her that I had a bet. Then I told her that I was only worth about a $25 bet. She laughed. That’s what it was all about. She gave me a challenge, and she actually wanted to do the challenge out of my character.

It’s now about 2:30 in the morning and my girlfriend wants to talk. “Hey babe, what time do you want to go to bed?”, I ask.

“Well, it’s like 4:30 now, we should probably be in bed.”

“Babe, it’s 8:30 right now.”, she replied.

“Oh, is it? Well, let me check the timezone though.”, I said, referring to my phone. “Ok, it’s about right”, I say.

“What?”, she asks.

“I just told you, it’s 8:30 right now.”

“Umm, ok, no shit. Oh well, we might as well rest my tired feet.”, she says in a groggy voice.

“Yeah, no shit. Let’s go to sleep”, I reply.

(Disclaimer: This is only my second post. Please ignore the mistakes in this version.)

It started with just a few emails, and one day in April. Then all of a sudden, my girlfriend came to visit me for",1
"Prompt: Imprisonement sentences are carried out by putting the condemned in stasis. While under, they experience the full lenght of the sentence, alone. To the outside world, only 12 seconds elapses. Story:  In that instant of time, your body continues to move normally. When your brain wakes up, it finds itself in one of the ""rooms"" that you were put into before sleep. Your memories start popping up, while your body continues. It's as if time has been stopped, and you've been put in dreamlike stasis, which is actually what's happening inside your body.



All the same, some people get out of this dream state after just 8 to 12 seconds, and don't remember anything about it. For most, however, that memory disappears after waking up, until another ""dream"", or ""encounter"", is had.

Why do people always dream of something new happening to them?



Why do people always dream of something new happening to them?

In the first part of this explanation, you were introduced to the phenomenon of free will, which the Church's moral code (the law written in your brain) insists you have. But if you're really free, then why does nobody notice it? Because you're only free in the physical sense. In the ""spiritual sense"" you're bound, as the Church teaches. You're the same person you was yesterday, you're the same person you'll be tomorrow. You're the same person you've always been, and you will always be. There are ways of tricking your brain into thinking that it's being free by acting, or doing things on its behalf, but that's all smoke and mirrors, and doesn't really free you, since you're still controlled by free will. That's why you never actually wake up. You're dreaming, and waking up, at the same time, in a ""dream-within-a-dream-in-a-dream"". You've actually been asleep, for quite a while.



The second part of this explanation is about free will. After all, you're free, right? Then how come people keep getting born? After you're born, most of the time, you're only in stasis, never waking up at all. Most of the time, people are not even aware of the fact that they're asleep.





Why do people always dream of something new happening to them?

It's the same phenomenon that's at work here. It's the same phenomenon that's at work with your senses. In your eye, for instance, you see black and white, but we don't call that ""black""; that's only your brain's interpretation of that information, which it gets from your eyes. The same goes for sound. We call your ears ""black"" but they're actually red, or whatever color they are. To your brain, the word ""black"" is applied to the information it gets from your ears, even though there's no such thing as this ""black"". The same goes for sight. You call black ""black"", but that's just the way your brain, and its senses of sight and smell and touch and taste, interpret the information coming from the outside world.



The only thing that is real, in terms of the physical senses, is sensations. When your body responds physically to an external stimulus, that's reality, your senses are reacting. You're ""free"" when you decide what to say or what to do. Your voice is only real when you say it. Your thoughts are only real when you form them, or think them about your inner world.



That's the reason for what happens with people who are deprived of any sensory input, from birth. Without sensory input of any kind, and without any stimuli, you'd be no different to a ""bricker"", or a person that's born brain dead. Without any information coming to your senses, your brain doesn't have the input to interpret, and therefore cannot make any decisions. In other words, it's a lot easier for someone in that condition, or brain dead, to dream of something new. If your senses are cut off, and you can only see and hear, but you're still free in your normal sense, you'll begin to wonder, maybe even hallucinate, about the new experience that's actually happening. You'll be amazed by it, and not just for the normal reason, because you'll be free to wonder.



Why does your head ""stop hurting"" when you wake up?

I have to interrupt this to mention the phenomenon of ""brain sleep"", where sometimes the ""inner"", or ""spiritual"" you can go into a sort of bliss, in which you don't feel your body at all, except for your head. That's what happens to you, when you dream, or have an out-of-body experience. But when you wake up,",1
"Prompt: A Gondor soldier tells his child a tale about the mighty warrior Aragorn, son of Arathorn. Story: 

""It happened, many years ago, and in a land very far indeed. There lived a king most wise and just, Aruman of Gondor. He ruled his people well, and they were blessed under his wise rule. Yet it seemed that the peace did not endure. For, though Aruman dealt kindly with both Elves and Men for a long time, at last all his dealings with other kingdoms stirred up suspicion and fear. A great evil came into Aragorn's heart.""

He paused before continuing. The child was sleepy, and the dark, rainy night did not favor storytelling. Still, the soldier was firm in his resolve.

""Once Aragorn began to question the wisdom of making war with the Men, they turned on him and imprisoned him with the other kings. This was a terrible thing, for he was loved of all the Elves and Men, and would gladly have lived for all time among them. But, the kings said that he was to die, and that he could choose no one but the fate that they had decreed for him: he must suffer death at their hands or take his own life before his sentence was done"".

""Thus, he was brought to the dungeon where he had lived while King of Gondor. For a hundred years he had hidden himself, and had never had visitors or even seen a single light other than that which had given him his life. He was gaunt and withered from the years of confinement. And in this darkness he could only find a shadow of what he had been. So, when they entered to carry him away, he did not make one sound, and he was only roused from his silence when the guards fell on him and struck at his head and hands...""

Frodo stirred as the man spoke of Aragorn's silent resistance. The dark man stopped, and looked with compassion at the child. Frodo understood suddenly what his story meant.

The child looked up at the soldier. ""It is my father,"" he said in his soft voice.

The man looked at Frodo with wonder in his eyes. ""I thought you would be a King. Are you, too, named Aragorn?"" he asked.

Frodo thought of the king whose name had been the same. Aragorn. Arwen. And of Arwen's words to Frodo. Will you find the Paths of the Dead to his halls, and the Paths of the Valar to his rest? he asked. And Arwen had smiled at Frodo, and had said that she would guide him; that is not now your task. You must do what you desire, though it may not seem like the path that I and the others have taken.

""Yes, I am his son; and he was taken away as a prisoner by the Kings who had destroyed my kingdom. I am called Frodo. If you are called Gondor, then I am called Aragorn""

The soldier bowed to the small form. ""In that name, I am glad to meet you,"" he said. ""I never have seen a child of the lineage of Elrond. You look more like a Valar than a Men, son of Arwen,"" he mused, and added solemnly, ""Welcome to the hall of Elrond the Far-off.""

The soldier smiled. ""Your words bring much joy to my heart after an almost intolerable existence in such a place. Come, let us see this world that Aragorn might have seen when he lived here with his people.""

* * * * *

Aragorn looked about. Even in the dim light, he could see that it was a magnificent place. And there were many things that he remembered; there were the great doors that had been sealed when Aragorn's people had left, for he had seen them as he first went out of the dungeons.

He stood listening to the quiet talk of the soldiers. He had not heard it in so long, and the sound of it brought back all those memories. And then he saw that the others in the cave were all of Elves and Men.

Aragorn raised his hand in greeting and then smiled as Arwen's voice reached his ears. He saw her immediately. She was in midair, her light blue gown floating up into the cave. Her white hair gleamed as the others fell forward, and touched lightly on the floor. She smiled at him sadly, and came floating down to the floor of the cave directly, and took his hand.

""Welcome home, Aragorn,"" she said. ""It is good to hold your hand again, for a long time. My heart is so saddened that we could not go to the White City of Thangor",1

I have started on this a bit but will continue it after summer and maybe in the fall I'll write an update. So, here is the new chapter. I don't have a good synopsis, so it won't match the original storyline, although some elements will stay, in some way. I will also continue to improve the first chapter and I am currently doing that.

Interstellar Space2

""The story's been going on for almost three million years now..."" The man's voice was deep and calm. He was addressing no one really. He was just standing there looking around the blackness, maybe to see if anyone was listening or if any of those spaceships he kept mentioning where still circling the planet. He didn't expect to hear a reply, though. He wasn't thinking of anyone or place, he just said the words and left them floating around the silent void. Just the same as his thoughts were. They were slowly drifting away. So, who would ever be thinking that way now? It was probably a good thing that they had forgotten that time was of no consequence. After all, where is there to go? The universe is not small.

The universe is not small.

-

The three-million-year-old man was not alone. He had been in a very large room; it was like a cube, maybe twenty meters high and the same in depth. He was standing in the middle, a few meters from the walls. He was on the eighth level in the space in the room. The room was empty and the walls around him were as still as he was standing, although he could see a slight shimmering coming from the floor below.

He was wearing a simple white robe similar to a monk's; it was thin and transparent. It must have been very hot in a room this size, as he was sweating. He stood there, thinking nothing, just looking around. His face was a pleasant and serene one. He was the first man ever to witness the universe and to think and be alone. He thought of his daughter, how she wouldn't be born yet, how he would never see her grow up, the time she would go on to live her own life. And he wondered if she was still alive.

It was a long time ago he had decided to save mankind. The first thing he'd done was to gather as many children as possible. He'd taught them about the universe and what they could do with it. They were to have the knowledge, the understanding that it was all meant to be their personal playground. What else but knowledge could be so powerful?

They called him Grandfather.

After he died, his work was done. His greatest wish of teaching had come true. However, not all children kept his philosophy. There were too many selfish ones already on the planet; their desires had grown too big and now they want only for themselves. They don't understand that life cannot be sustained solely by selfishness. It was selfish people that had brought about the Apocalypse. It was selfishness that had destroyed the planet. And selfish people would die.

The children that had respected his wisdom were already grown. This was why he felt content enough having survived. It was not always so, sometimes he would think about it and it would seem like the world would break down like it did before. He couldn't understand it at all. They'd had the most intelligent mind on the planet and this had brought them to their doom. The children would go on to do wonderful things, they would travel to the farthest stars. All the wonderful stories his granddaughters would tell... But the children...

He did not hear a voice; he just saw a figure standing in front of him. His face had changed, he seemed younger as if he knew who he was talking to.

""Who are you talking to?"" asked his daughter.

She stood by his side, the look on her face a mix of curiosity and fear. She tried to embrace the truth she was seeing before her eyes, trying to keep her inner thoughts away for as long as she could. He seemed to be very young. She thought perhaps he had been in this room before.

""No one. I was thinking.""

""What were you thinking about?"" asked his daughter

""Nothing."" He lied easily, what else could she think? They both had been gone many years. She",1

Life on paper - the year of books

It was just a month ago that my good friend Karen, who
in this post we know from Karen’s very own blog, was having a difficult day, as we all do
from time to time, although you would never guess that looking at her very
present smile. I couldn’t help but ask her if there was anything I could do
for her and what I could do in return (I love to give and hope to receive, you
see! That is my motto). I made her smile again and reminded her that she is a
very good writer indeed, both through life (from her blog) but also on paper
with her very own novels to her name. She is proud of all her work, both
published and un-published alike (I wish I could say that I have that much
resolve!).

So the question that I asked Karen back then is the
question that I still ask myself this very moment on the way home from school:
what will my “own novel” be this year? (What is a novel? I have never actually
read one. You know what I mean). It’s a question that always has me perplexed
and I find myself often searching for a clear-cut answer. Perhaps I will be
writing my own crime novel? Or maybe a ghost story? But maybe I should start
my novel from my parents’ own life? I must admit I really enjoy looking into my
parents’ life, how they met each other and who and what they knew and loved in
their former lives. Maybe that
will be my novel.

Or maybe I will start out looking for a job to earn
some money and my novel might be set in the world of employment. I am also very
into the world of work and I find this world so fascinating. I just hope to
write what I already know. (If there are any novel experts out there, please
let me know what you think!

So today, with my thoughts about the year of books, I
wanted to leave you with a lovely message that I received from a good friend
many years ago. It might sound a bit clichéd but it is so fitting for me
today. I just had to share it with all of you because of one simple reason:
this message is just perfect for me right now. I hope that each one of you
feelings this message as strongly as I do. May you be inspired to make your own
life on paper come to life!

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my blog and I hope
you enjoyed it. I want to wish you happy reading in case you don’t already,
you have a wonderful life in you (like Karen obviously does 🙂).

Thank you for your beautiful messages, which always help me
when I read them, to get out of those bad moments.

Thank you for sharing this one with us dear Karen.

This post just made me smile and cry at the same time: it's so beautiful. Thank you.

Thank you very much, my dear friend. Thank you for your support today, for always caring for those around you, for the work you do, for being there when needed, for your wise advice and for your belief in me. You are an angel, and I love you for it. You always are. Thanks for your words, too.

Thank you so much for your kind and kind words on my first post
of my new blog. I know that your thoughts are genuine. Thank you for always
being an angel for me and for always being there. I love you, my angel xx

Hi again, dear Karen. Thank you for your love and support and for your beautiful blog! And yes, the first novel I want to write is one that I know I have already: my own parents' lives. It's just perfect for me to start with it. I love this book about your parents' life together, which I hadn't even heard of before you wrote it (so now I have some new reading to look forward to!)... Thanks for your advice. I can't wait to read your new book.

When I read this message, I couldn't help but smile, thank you for writing from another perspective. (I've been thinking about you recently, Karen!). I love the idea of writing a book about my parents' life story. I don't know how that one could turn out, but life is always unpredictable. Have a lovely weekend, dear friend

Thank you and thank you, dear Vonda! I am most honoured that you",1
"Prompt: A man is sentenced to two-hundred years in prison. Thanks to medical progress, he lives to serve out his term. Story: 

- A Man Called “Frank“

The courtroom was silent following Frank’s sentencing. A guard picked Frank up off the bench.

“Let him go in with the others,” the judge ordered.

The courtroom cleared.

“I apologize for this interruption,” the judge added. “I am still not accustomed to the new courtroom system.”

“Yes. I am also sorry for this, Your Honor. It was necessary, though.”

Frank had just finished testifying. It hadn’t been easy. At the time, he’d also had a lot to take.

“Now,” the judge said, “let us continue.”

Frank returned to the witness stand. In response, the prosecution gave him a copy of the judge’s ruling. In the background, he could hear the arguments of his lawyers.

“There is no further need for testimony of the defendant. We accept his defense.”

One of the lawyers stepped forward, as did a guard.

“As to why he did it,” the lawyer stated, “that is a complex question.”

The lawyer paused.

“It has taken a lot of time to consider it, Your Honor. If we don’t accept Mr. Frank’s plea, it will take years. So, as a compromise, let us stipulate as to the reason.”

The judge nodded.

“Mr. Frank, do you agree?”

“Yes.”

The lawyer opened a file. He removed a black case. He took out a gun the size of a small brick. It was made from the hardest material on Earth.

The lawyer nodded.

“Mr. Frank, you have agreed to be sentenced to life in prison. In return, we will drop the charges against your wife and against your daughter and against your mother.”

The lawyer made them sign papers.

“It is a plea bargain. You cannot change your mind later even if you wish to do so.”

“I understand.”

The lawyer put the gun away.

“Now,” the lawyer continued, “the conditions of the agreement will be as follows. Mr. Frank will be a mute since the age of eleven. He will do whatever his parents say. This stipulation was due to medical reasons.”

The judge nodded.

“You may begin.”

Frank remained silent, as he had for the last fifteen years.

“Are you ready, Mr. Frank?”

Frank didn’t reply.

“I am afraid that your family and your wife,” the judge added, “will be in trouble now.”

“I understand.”

“You must never leave your parents. You must be their servant, obeying their every command. You will have to live near them and you will have to give them your time and money. They must take out of your salary to buy groceries for you and your family.”

“Yes.”

“If you leave them, your wife or your daughter, then you will be sentenced to death.”

“I have been silent for fifteen years, Your Honor.”

Frank remained silent after his sentence.

After his trial, for five years, Frank and his family were well-fed, clothed and housed.

Frank and his mother spent their time reading. His father had a habit of spending most of his time on the computer with Internet addicts. Frank watched, mostly silently, his family live. He could see them at the kitchen table, where his mother read a newspaper and his father played games online.

“Your punishment is over, Mr. Frank. What now?”

He knew the answer to his own question. For years, it was the only question running through his thoughts.

He didn’t want to leave his family. When it was necessary, they were always ready to leave their house. His wife had gone to live with her mother for a time. Then, they hadn’t spoken for two years. He had heard that her family had tried to talk her out of it. They had even managed to buy her some things. They had tried to reach out to her. But she didn’t answer.

Frank had never tried to contact her.

If there is a possibility, try to find the right words for each character with their dialogue. If one or both of them are weak, then you should improve the situation, because otherwise, the story just falls flat. You want a character to have the most depth possible, so make sure you’re really paying attention to your characters’ emotions.

After he took his first sip of coffee, he noticed that the mug was not made of white china, but instead was a white plastic. Now I knew things were really getting bad. Still, he took a huge gulp of the stuff. He quickly realized that the coffee tastes great in plastic.

The two men sat for a little while, quietly thinking of their own past and their plans for the future. Then, his phone rang. It was his wife, telling him that a meeting had just happened upstate. She advised John that he should leave right away, but not before helping himself to a second cup of coffee.

This is an example of a non-dialogue section. Non-dialogue sections are sections that have nothing to do with the writing of the story, but there are times when they are just part of the story.

It was my last year, I finished my bachelor degree. Now it was time to find a job. I was starting to freak out. I'd put off thinking about what I was going to study after my bachelor degree for two years. I had a feeling my father didn't care for my decision.

A huge sense of relief was washed over me as I realized I'd have to pay off my student loans soon.

I was standing in front of the door when my father came home. He had a smile on his face. I knew immediately that something was up. I wondered if he knew what I had to do. I wondered if he would even allow me to. I knew all too well how he felt about most things.

There was a new problem at the house. He was so excited, I could tell.

""Dad, what's going on? Don't tell me you've found another house.""

He handed me a paper. It was a certificate. I quickly scanned it.

I was elated. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe how much that meant to my dad. He had made me work and he had sacrificed himself for me. This was my graduation gift from him.

""So, you're gonna be an Architect? Wow. What made you decide to do that?""

""I like the idea. It seems to have a lot of opportunities if I work my way up.""

""Yeah, that's what I thought. All I can see is you coming home late every night.""

Well, that was my first job interview and something went wrong.

"Prompt: You are repeating your day Groundhog style, except every day one more person in the world joins the loop. Story: 

Every day in the future is a day of potential change, and the same person joins the loop when somebody's already joined. The loop always grows exponentially and can be shown to obey power laws.

If you don't let anybody in, your single loop isn't ""everybody."" Nobody will join your story, and because you didn't let anybody in, the loop cannot grow exponentially by joining, and the time of the event will never increase by one day.

As the first person joins, they become part of the loop. It is never possible to join a group where nobody else is in it, unless everybody in the group is somehow at a special time; you will always always always be the first.

We've seen you get one person in. Now see where the story goes...

When you get one of our readers to join the groundhog story each day, we know that many others will follow. In fact, when you get the first person in, nobody knows who that is and nobody knows who will join her in the future. Every day more people know that somebody else has joined.

But every day in the future is still a day of potential change, so each day our story changes. If you get one of our readers to join, the groundhog story changes again. And in that way, the loop grows exponentially.

How does the story get started? I can choose to create a story of a certain length, but it's impossible for anyone to have a certain length of time to participate in it. What's the trick?

This kind of thing happens because you didn't know somebody would join. You didn't know anybody would join.

You get to choose what order to tell the loops. You could have told your story in a loop where everybody was first, or in a loop where you were first, instead of being told to start at the first day and work your way forward.

If you'd known that a certain day of the year would be special, you could have chosen to start there. If every person knew that a particular day would be special because of some common event, then you could have chosen that day as the beginning.

But in the absence of such common knowledge, no one could even have a chance to choose the date. Every day in future is a day of potential change, and every day each of them can be your first day. The story is growing, and it is growing by itself.

As the loops grow exponentially, you get more and more people with shorter and shorter times to join. Every day in the world becomes a shorter and shorter day, and every day is a shorter and shorter day in the future.

But the more people join in parallel, the more everyone knows each person is starting with a shorter time.

That is the way the groundhog story goes. It will keep changing and expanding, and growing into the future, growing exponentially by itself.

Is there more to the story yet to be told?

There won't be, for the same reason that you aren't reading this blog. Our story is complete. We started with no one and we ended with nobody knowing what day that nobody is on.

The only thing left in the groundhog story at that point is the beginning. That was when the loop started. The only way it could have started if no one has been on it. It's still starting now.

That leaves the question...

So what happens now? What happens when we finish?

The groundhog story will be completed if somebody joins on every day of the year, and it will be filled up to the highest power law. How do you know when that's true, and how do we keep it going?

In real life, each new day gets shorter and shorter. You already know that. What's left is to add the idea of a loop. We made our groundhog story work with just one loop.

Let's add the idea of the looping story. In place of the end of the story you had in mind, you now have a story that goes through many loops without end.

But the loop also ends. That's why you have to be certain about the power law curve every single day, when you know you're writing the most important blog post to a groundhog ever.

Even if you can't get the perfect power law curve, you can find a way to work with a loop by knowing in advance what to start with every day of the year, and what end date to target at the end of the year.

That way, no one knows that you're at the right spot in the story, and the story will always change because new people will make their loops from any day of the year, starting with a shorter time",1

"Prompt: Six months ago it was announced that a meteor would hit the earth and end all life. However it missed the earth after humanity had prepared for the end. Story: 

Two weeks today, humanity should be ready to leave the world. Everyone in the world has a plan: work for 6 months to accumulate the best supplies, so they can walk to another planet in the year 2025, when the meteor misses again.

The Earthlings have been preparing for two months for this, a few have even spent more time preparing. They plan to launch in 6 months, when it comes down to the time, if they haven’t been picked up by orbiters yet. At this point, a year into the timeline, they should be able to get a message out to the outside world, that they’re on their way.

Of course not everyone can stay on Earth and prepare for the future. The best and brightest should go for it and hope they’re picked up before they’re killed by the impact. This is why people who could not be on Earth are coming with the remaining population. If no one could be saved, everyone would already be on a waiting ship.

It is easy to get into space. This is why one ship would be able to carry enough people for everyone who wishes to go to a colony. No, there’s no one else to share this journey, or this tragedy. Only the ones that can carry it alone. It’s the best they could ever hope for.

It may be hard for any who were born the end of humanity to remember this event well from their childhood, but the adults who have survived will be able to tell young children who are born in 2025 what has happened. In their time, they won’t even be able to think back or tell stories to their children, because they haven’t witnessed the end of the humanity yet.

So it is the most important part they have to talk about. It’s easy to see on the news or social media, the fear of death. However, that’s easy to understand. They can’t know what will actually happen. What they do know is that the Earth is completely destroyed, and life should end as we see it today.

What you can’t quite grasp is a story from the past. Something that can’t be explained, but is explained very clearly in books. It can’t be explained in the present by a man named Joseph, until he’s a dying man.

Back at 2 months ago, everything looked different. For example, the sun. It looks like it has two heads, one side has a yellow circle and the other side has a red one. But the sun looks familiar. The circle that would normally be there is now covered in what looks like a piece of paper, but what you can’t see, the light itself is still there. It’s simply not as important as the sun.

At 6 weeks ago, the Sun looks different. The red, yellow sphere is in the middle of the sun, and the piece of paper is smaller. It covers only half the sun, and has a small black dot on the other half.
The thing you can’t quite grasp is that this is a normal, everyday occurrence. Every day is a few weeks. And the people who are reading this will be 2 months in the future, by which time their Sun has finished its rotation, so it’s different.

This is how the humans prepare for the next event: as they pass the time, nothing changes. There’s no one else to talk with about their plan to escape a fiery death, they can’t tell their children stories of a world without them. So they need to remind each other that once something starts to change, there’s no going back.

These stories are simple. A story made up only by humans with no magic involved, not dragons that turn into trees, and not the kind of stories people would remember and tell their children. It’s a simple, but important step of the plan of escape.

“This is a story of where my home was before I left. It is the story of how our home became, and how we got here. It’s not about me, not about the others who left too. It’s for them, and for them to remember this story, so they know this is where they started.

It’s really the end of our world, but what you can’t see is that the future generations are still living on this world. We’re dying out, which is why I’m going to find that new world, and start a new life by myself, without any others.” ~ Joseph from the story of Earth

She told me she lost all her money at the casino, and I was happy, I didn’t even care. I couldn’t believe it, I loved her, I wanted her to be happy. We never had any strife before, and I can see how it was just her. I don’t want to be happy, I hate the fact that I’m not crying because she left me. This is what I want, to be alone. I guess I have to live with this, I can stop by some day and see my Mom, it will be something. I’m crying, are there any other girls here? No, thank you. *Sigh* So, I have to find a job and live on my own, its not easy. I’m going to give my Mom a call, and she’s not going to understand when I tell her this. *Picking up a phone and dialing a number* ‘Hello, Mom? Its me, Mom, Syliana, I got a job at a department store, it’s not that great, but I’ll be fine. I’ll be there on Monday, bye Mom.’ I left her, she will be so sad, but its better than being in this apartment by myself. I’m going to go see my aunt as well, she’s got a spare room, we can use that for a while.

Sylviana’s aunt *Shout* *Shake* Who was that? *Sigh* Well whoever it was, it wasn’t here when I came home. Oh well, I’ll give her a call later and ask.

*Telephone ringing* ‘Hello?’ ‘Hello? Oh I see, yes, hi Mom, no Mom, just got a job at a department store. It’s not that great, but I’ll be fine. See you later.’ *Hang up phone* She’s very happy about me leaving my Mom alone, I guess its all for the best, I just hope she’ll be in a better mood.

Sylviana’s aunt *Looking at a book* ‘This will be your room. You can have clothes from the bedroom, there should be enough.’ ‘Thanks, I’m gonna clean up a bit, I’ll be right back.’

Sylviana *Looking around her surroundings* *Looks at a picture, laughs and cries* ‘What is this?’ ‘Well, your Mom made this for me while I was in the hospital, you can keep it in your room.’ *Slyviana looks at the picture* ‘This is you and her. We’re so cute, this is great! I have to keep it with me for now.’ *Slyviana picks it up* How did he get the picture? He’s the biggest liar I’ve ever met. *Slyviana sets the picture down and looks at it again* You were so young, were you two going out? That was all we talked about for years, I thought he was going to propose to me.

Sylviana’s aunt *Looking at a book* ‘Are those the pictures?’ ‘Yes, keep it if you want, they are very precious to me.’ *Slyviana looks at the photographs and smiles* He must come here often. His clothes might make me feel homesick, it wasn’t the same when I was a dog. ‘How would you feel if I asked you to sleep in a dog bed so you don’t get the smell of my house all over you?’ ‘I’ll be happy.’ She got what she wanted, and she got his clothes and the stuff in the room she is in. She will be out of sight from her Mom, but she’ll be close",1
"Prompt: You are a former executioner. Describe your final killing. Story:  ""I was in Vietnam. I was on the ground. I was looking at the enemy and they were looking at me. I saw a man run up behind them. I got to him just as his bayonet was stabbing the enemy in the back. The enemy were screaming with pain, with fear, all they wanted was to hold on to their life that was being taken. The pain and fear of those men on the battlefield were so much greater than the man's pain and fear. I had to execute the man. The enemy's fear and the man's pain were far less than the death of the man.

Death is an executioner, not the enemy. Death is the enemy of all men, all races, all people, all religions, cultures and everything human, we must be very watchful.

I went to the room of the man that I was supposed to execute. It was a small cell with a toilet, sink, a bed, a small window, and a door."" The man had a chair and a table. I went there and I gave him the gun. ''Are you ready?'' I asked the man. ''Yes. I am ready.'' he said. Then he pointed the gun at me and took a step closer. He pulled the trigger and nothing happened. I looked at him. ''The gun wasn't loaded. Why didn't you check the bullets before you pulled the trigger?'' The man said nothing.

I tried again. '''Wait! Wait!''' the man said. His mouth was wide open, his jaw wide open. The gun was cold in my hand. I could feel sweat breaking out on the back of my neck. I was shaking. The man took the gun away from me. Then the man tried to say something but nothing came out. I looked at his eyes. They were full of fear. ''The gun is not going to fire! Your fingers are numb! You have forgotten how to load the gun! It's your own fault! It would not have been your fault but the gun wasn't loaded! It was your job to know if the gun was loaded. You were going to execute me but you couldn't!"" ""I couldn't execute him!

Life is the executioner! And all of the people have to die! We should have a gun for life. If we found out somebody is about to kill somebody, we should take away his gun.

The Executioner: One Execution.

The Executioner: His death is more important than any of the people's lives.

This is not a new law, it is old and old laws were established to defend humans from the animalistic aspect of us all, which is to take what we need without providing anything in return.

The Executioner: It is one's right to take what we need.

Some are more than ready for the End; the other are still living in an illusion that they will be protected at the End because of their name, jobtitle, status, and so forth.

""I went to the room of the man that I was supposed to execute. It was a small cell with a toilet, sink, a bed, a small window, and a door."" The man had a chair and a table."" Yes, it is just a small cell. But we are all alone.

Is there anybody there?

The Executioner: I went to the room of the man that I was supposed to execute. It was a small cell with a toilet, sink, a bed, a small window, and a door."" The man had a chair and a table."" Yes, it is just a small cell.

The Executioner: I gave him the gun. ''Are you ready?'' I asked the man. ""Yes, I am ready."" he said. Then he pointed the gun at me and took a step closer. He pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. I looked at him. ""The gun wasn't loaded. Why didn't you check the bullets before you pulled the trigger?'' The man said nothing.

The Executioner: It is a man's right to take what he needs, from whomever he needs it.

The Executioner: And all of the people have to die. We should have a gun for life. If we found out somebody is about to kill somebody, we should take away his gun.

''A gun for life.'' What an idea! If the other person kills you, then he should have a gun for life. Why do you think you didn't think of this idea before?

""He was going to kill me!""

No: ""I was going to kill him!""

""But now I must kill him,""

""Why must you kill him now?""

""The gun... wasn't loaded.""

"Prompt: You are a serial killer. Each murder you commit adds a new voice to your head. Story: 

Your name is Michael. You're in your late 20s or early 30s. You've just been released from prison, after serving a sentence for three attempted murder murders and one completed. You have a job lined up as an investigator for the FBI, which has you on suspension at the moment. You've been assigned to a serial killer case in Los Angeles.

The investigation is into the deaths of at least 10 random female victims. Their hands had been severed. Their faces were mutilated. Most of the bodies were found on the same street in Los Angeles. Police have yet to name a suspect, but you know it's you.

You're terrified. For the first time: you feel like a real serial killer.

There's one big difference between you and the other serial killers. After you do the deed, you've never felt better. The murders give you energy and drive. Even months after the crimes, you can't stop thinking about them. Something about murder makes you feel powerful.

You don't just want to kill random people. You want to kill people like you and me. In your head, there is room for only one true self. But what if you could kill multiple people? How many people in one night might you be capable of killing?

This is the story of one man's serial killing spree.

What if I could kill a bunch of people? And what if the thrill of killing people isn't so bad after all?

The thrill of murder

As a child, you were obsessed with horror movies. You would turn up the volume and watch horror images on film, such as The Exorcist. You read comics, like The Terminator and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. As you grew older, you fell in with a group of friends who were all into horror films and comics. You didn't know that they were into murder too. You also grew into a skilled knife kicker and had an eye for combat training.

Most of all, you loved guns. You would spend hours playing games of war and shooting imaginary people in the head.

You'd never killed before, but you'd always imagined it. A knife would be too impractical. You'd seen real people die. That would change your idea of what it meant to kill, making murder easier. You might feel like more of a monster doing it than any other way.

You had grown up in a safe and loving family, with an alcoholic mother and domineering father. You were good in school, but spent most of your free time with your friends watching horror films, practicing combat, or reading comics and stories about serial killers.

As you got older, you began to see yourself as a real serial killer, who would be locked away for a long time if you got caught.

Eventually, you got lucky and passed your firearms training test at a military firing range. You were on your way to getting your first gun license. Then, you got arrested for assaulting a man with a shovel. You'd been angry about a job you didn't like, but you'd never beaten anyone before that. It was the first time you felt like a real killer.

Your trial was held at a military base. You'd seen a lot of blood. People would look at you with pity. As the prosecutor gave his evidence, you looked at the judge and thought, I'll never get out of here.

The judge said you'd served your time. But he handed you a 10-year suspended sentence. You had to do two years of community service, and a probation check every 12 months.

You were sentenced to three years in prison. Halfway through your sentence, in the middle of a prison yard, the man you'd assaulted asked you why you did it. You'd been surprised before that people were so surprised at the terrible things you did. But this was different. No matter how you tried to explain it, your life would be completely different once you got out and the 10 years were over. All that would stay in prison, locked in a cell, was you.

You couldn't wait to get out. Your friends asked you if you were upset about being locked up. They didn't get it, and for many months you didn't get it either.

You were in for a shock.

You'd like to change how the world works, to take control.

As you got older, you took a job to do some community service in an empty office. You knew you would get bored, but you felt like you needed to learn a practical skill. Your skills as a knife kicker were practical, but you also liked martial arts and wanted to be well-rounded. In prison, you were put in charge of prisoners' training. You enjoyed helping others develop their skills. You also knew how to",1

"Prompt: At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. Story: 

After death

In the void between life and death, a being's name is just a name, a title of nobility meaningless except for where it leads. In such a place death means merely the end of the story and the beginning of a new one; it brings change only in the matter of the characters, that is, in the shape of the narrative. The plot remains the same, of course; it does what it always has done and everything that happened so far will happen again, or not; the story can be rewritten in the same way it has been countless times before.

Yet after the re-writer is done, there will be a new name to call him. A title of the new story-writer, the re-writer, who has taken it. He won't know which he is, but his name shall be called ""the one who changed everything.""

And as he dies in the next life, he will discover that the game will take a new turn.

The re-writer was a boy who was brought up in a single-parent household since he was a toddler, and he never made friends. He went through several schools and was the class clown, who everyone wanted at least one of them to be his friend rather than despise or beat up, but he became an antisocial personality after he was an adult and there was no one left. The antisocial personality is basically an adult version of the boy who went door to door trying to be friends, but who when asked to stay he would simply stare vacantly down the hall, then mumble, ""Sure.""

And when he died, he became a person like that. Nothing he did had an effect on anyone or anything. No one was interested in him at all. He felt nothing and so had nothing to lose. If someone had come along and tried to teach him to read, it might have helped a little to remember he had forgotten the alphabet from childhood, but that didn't matter here where no one is. If he had tried to learn to drive, it would have felt useless; since he had driven cars before, but never knew how to work a manual, there was no one to learn from. He decided he needed to make a career. People told him he could be in sales or telemarketing or something like that. When he had no one in which to be interested in, so he did that. He decided that what happened in any life would have only a few possible outcomes, and he worked hard to make sure he was in the one that made the least amount of difference to anyone after that. He decided the game was going to end at some point, but it wasn't the moment or type of existence he had planned from the beginning, but he could wait because ultimately what was important about this story was how he played as a character in it, even though he played with more precision than he ever did in life.

He spent all his time talking to himself or looking in his own mind for a solution to the problem of what he was doing. While others saw what they liked or disliked, he simply saw what he was trying to do, which was nothing at all, so he could hardly be seen thinking or reacting in any way; even his actions were meaningless. For him, the problem was trying to figure out that he was trying to do anything. He died and became someone he had never become in life, and even he didn't know what that was.

No one knew what he was doing except for a few who never understood what it was to him. As he died in that void, he thought of himself as someone who did something completely different than what he did in living life. His actions were meaningless, he reasoned, so he could not have accomplished anything. Yet when he reached the end of his life and his life was over, his first thought, as he was absorbed once again into living life, was, 'What the hell kind of a game is this? No one dies and then gets born after all, then dies again and so on forever?'

And that was because he had to die in order to do what he had done. He had never killed someone, but this felt like he had.

Death: An unexpected guest

Death is always an unexpected and unwelcome guest at a party. Everyone pretends it isn't, but no one dares ask why. When it did happen in the re-writer's life and it would happen again a certain time after that, it was no less surprising. Death may be more a friend than an unwelcome houseguest, one who knows how the party game was played before and is perfectly able to join in and follow the story. He can even help to change it, unless the re-writer doesn't want to change",1
"Prompt: You have been kidnapped by the mafia, the reason? Someone who 's very high up has a child who has a crush on you. Story: 

You have been kidnapped by the mafia, and are currently on the way to your ""execution"".
They are now about to let you out, they are driving through ""town"", on the way to the ""jail"" (""prison"" maybe).
You see a man who looks like a policeman.
You are looking in the car windows and you see a blue flag. You think that maybe it's the flag of the police?
Well, it's not. You see the ""law"" in the middle of the blue flag. You're kind of baffled.
Doesn't the ""law"" always have two men on horseback and a car in the front?
Well, it does not this time. The mafia has a new plan. They don't want you to witness your own murder! They are going to execute you from a car behind the police car. No one will ever know what happened. They will have you executed by the mafia, because you ""stole the money of the mob"" (or maybe it was your own father?), and they want to put a ""message"" - ""do not fuck with the mafia!"" - in the public's eye

So what happens now?

A:

You see the ""law"" in the middle of a blue flag - and this should be pretty easy.  The blue flag in the middle of the flag represents the law from Rome (the Italian parliament, the government, etc.).  In Italy the law follows a similar flag pattern (the red and black pattern is also often used to represent Italy - see the national coat of arms, used as the EU's symbol...).  
Note though that the Italian police generally don't follow this flag, so this may not be the actual police car.
(Also, as with anything, confirm with multiple sources.)

A:

It is most likely the car of a traffic police patrol (carabinieri or polizia Stradale). This flag is used in the area of Florence for police patrol in the roads of the area.
If the car is in front or behind of the blue polician flag, then it is not the police car. The traffic police usually have only two cars, so a police car will follow a car with the blue flag if it is needed, while for normal use, it is in front of the other car. A car behind would mean that he is not needed, not that he was a wrong one to arrive.

EDIT
If I remember not wrong correctly, the flag is the sign of polizia stradale (traffic Police) and has only the color and the pattern inside. If this is the case, you would see a Polizia Stradale car with a similar blue flag on the bottom left.
However, this is not the case in the image as there is no flag (and therefore no polizia stradale or carabinieri).

"Prompt: God shows you 3 Doors. Door One leads to eternal happiness, Door Two leads to infinite knowledge. Then there is Door Three, and God has never opened it yet. Story: 

John the Baptist was a very popular man-he’d been around for a long time. Everybody thought they knew what a church was, and most of them went to church every Sunday morning and prayed without fail.

John was telling this story and he got to the part where God asked, “What do people say about me?”

“We love you, God,” the children said at once.

“Very well,” said God, “open.”

Everyone had seen Door Two when they were born, but they did not notice Door Three. For the next year, people said to John the Baptist, “God, what will happen when people don’t come to church?” It was all they could talk about.

Finally, a man came to John one day and said, “Mr. Baptist, how come nobody comes to church anymore?”

“They’re looking for another door,” said John. “I suppose that’s why you’re here.”

“I love God,” the man replied. He knew what he was doing.

“And I love you,” John answered.

“What do you think?” the man asked.

“People talk about you,” said John.

“They talk about the man who talks about me,” said the man. “But they never talk about me. Let’s open door #3.”

“God, do they like me?”

“They’ll like you when they see you.”

The preacher came to see me to discuss how to use Twitter for ministry and I decided to send a random question in to Pastor Bill yesterday morning. We have a great relationship – and he’s usually pretty honest. Let’s take it a bit further and see what he says…

I think I’ll answer the question as I have been and post it out to Twitter (and if you’re reading this, you can answer it too):

It’s been about a month since I started using Twitter for church. I try to give God daily prayer for ministry using the service. The idea is that we have 140 characters to get our message across in. I’m curious about the people who use Twitter – how effective do you think Twitter is for ministry?

This question gives us a great opportunity to get our thoughts on Twitter out to a new audience and also provide some thoughts that are really relevant to people who ask questions on our site.

Here’s what I said in response to this question (the question was re-posted to my blog and is reposted below):

I think it can be used for ministry, but I think it depends on HOW it’s used. Here are some guidelines: – Twitter is for real-time dialogue with your community. – Be careful to engage followers with “real” conversation and thoughtful questions. It’s easy to start off with questions but once you’re on a roll, it’s easy to get into the “sound-bite” mode. You need to pause and think about what you’re getting out there. – Twitter is not necessarily your best place to promote your sermons or even talk to media folks. There are still folks who aren’t going to want to hear a sermon that’s not preached by a pastor. And most media folks still don’t like preachers tweeting from their office. You need to be sure to say “I’m the pastor,” and include the name of the church. – Don’t start off by telling the story of that last big outreach success. If it was awesome, tell us what it was and why it was so cool. Don’t tweet about your church and then say that you can’t tweet. People get over it pretty quickly. It’s fine. – Tell people why they need to be on twitter (and why they need to be a follower – not always the same thing). – If they’re not a follower already, follow them. – Don’t be “that guy.” Remember Mark Driscoll and his tweets getting hacked? – If you ever forget and start tweeting, “I’m too dumb to live,” it’s pretty easy to un-retweet.

As you might imagine, it didn’t go over too well…",1
"Prompt: Write a murder from the perspective of a cheerful inanimate object Story:  If the body of a victim is found, continue the story from there If the murder took place at the beginning of story (a week after the main events), take a stroll about 3 weeks later You'll find yourself, as a living, conscious object, in the same environment as in the beginning of story A murder scene is usually a small, secluded, and empty area, but, like living beings, these objects can have a home and work as far from other living things as you want. It is easy to see how someone living near a busy street could overlook the place of some object, but it is impossible for someone living near an empty field. Objects can even be victims themselves: someone can be stabbed, fall from a roof or fly out of a car window into a river. Like living people, they get back to their home and forget about it. The home is usually a place where a person can feel as if he or she is safe. It's a cozy place, not a prison. A place with no one but you and a few mice is usually suitable: it can be a home, a study, an office, an old shed, a library, etc. It depends only on what your story needs.

Some objects are not as harmless as others, e.g. a knife. A person is most likely to be killed with a knife, but a knife can also be used to defend yourself. A car can also be used as a weapon—just like a knife. Sometimes people are buried alive by someone with a vehicle. A sharp vehicle is a dangerous weapon. It is recommended that a person be buried alive in a new grave, just like the one he or she was buried in previously. Otherwise, an object may be used to cover up a person who died of natural causes or to hide traces of the murder. A person can also use an object as weapon—e.g. to kill someone with, by hitting him or her on it with his or her head.

You should try to make your object friendly to the victim. A friendly object can't hurt anyone, even if it isn't made to. You can just use something made for the sole purpose of killing, and you must make sure to turn it on the victim when you're trying to commit the murder. You can also use an object to kill something else, but, to make the story interesting, you must do so in a way that leaves no traces: you're allowed to hide traces, but the victim must not know that he or she was killed by a particular object. The victim is allowed to die from causes that are common for an object in that scene: e.g. being hanged, poisoned, or shot.

The murder should be carried out naturally. All the details and movements should be based on reality, but nothing that is unrealistic. The person committing the murder should be able to get away naturally. You should remember that other people will also try to discover the murderer, so it's not wise to make things too difficult for the detective. If that's unavoidable, make sure that the murderer leaves no signs of a struggle. If your object can see or hear something, make sure the victim doesn't. But an object should be able to get away normally. This applies to living beings, that is, both humans and object. An object that's stuck isn't dead, so it should also have means to escape. But it is a good idea to remove the body from the scene without making it look like it was removed by the murderer—you should make sure that the detective won't take you for a murderer. A friendly (no, not friendly—friendly is for friends) object should be able to call out help. You can also just stick out your tongue or scratch it, and it might attract attention. It can even start a search for people like an actual person would.

An object that is friendly and can attract attention has a good chance to be a tool for the murderer. If you're able to put a note into the victim's pocket, you're a lucky person. It usually doesn't pay to be the object that killed the victim, or it can easily lead to the suspicion of being the murderer. You must leave no traces of your part in the crime scene's life. An object used as a weapon is usually a dangerous weapon. It can't attract attention while being in a fight, so it must be able to move normally. A friendly object isn't usually used to kill: no murderer would use an object like this. But if an object is very friendly and does kill and no one knows what it is, it may be used as someone else's weapon (no one must know it was the murderer, only that it was probably him or her).

It's recommended that an object be as ""normal"" as a person. An object should look like something it really is. It is best if you can make",1
"Prompt: You are legally allowed to commit murder once, but you must fill out the proper paperwork and your proposed victim will be notified of your intentions Story: 

After hearing that her father had killed the son of her boss, Emma Smith, the girl's mother, Alice, took her aside and advised her to commit the crime in a clever way, knowing she only had one chance to complete this job and Alice Smith trusted her daughter's ability to choose the appropriate time to complete this task. So Alice went to the local sheriff with her findings and asked if it would be legal to commit murder.

Sheriff Smith, who had a reputation as a smart man, was not at first inclined to give his opinion to someone he just met, but when an old friend of his, also a wise man and a lawyer, insisted that he check with the local judge first, he agreed to speak with Alice about her daughter's plan the following morning.

When Emma heard that her son was planning to kill her boss's son, she was deeply saddened, but also angry, because if it did not happen in the time allowed for, she wanted him to make the murder happen. So she decided to call the police, but when they arrived, Emma had already gotten into her son's body suit and was waiting for them outside the house. The police let them go, convinced that they had been called by the family of the intended victim. They went home and talked about their decision, then Alice suggested that what if their daughter, Emma Jane, had never told them about this plan? Wouldn't that mean that they were breaking the law?

The wise sheriff smiled at his old friend, the lawyer, and said, ""Let's find out. Do you think it's legal for me to kill your wife?""

After the two had agreed to kill his wife, Sheriff Smith went to the local judge and got a search warrant. He then went back to his old friend the lawyer where they found a letter from the woman's son to his mom saying that she was planning to kill Smith's son, and that she had bought a body suit to wear which was the same as the one his daughter already had. Smith told Alice and her husband, that if they really wanted to do things, it would be smart to kill her first and go to the authorities after that. He continued to insist that his daughter should have disclosed her plan to murder the man first. So Alice did what she had advised her daughter to do, and planned to kill Emma Smith the next day.

The next morning, her husband went into town while Alice stayed with Emma and their daughter to keep an eye on what was going on outside. As Alice was putting away dishes, Emma was putting out her clothes and preparing for the day. The father came home shortly after, saw the husband there with his wife, saw the body suit laid out with the girl and said that if her husband knew what was a good idea, it was to just take out the son that night. Then they went into town, left the two alone, and went back home. Both of then then decided to go to bed and leave Emma Smith alone.

So Sheriff Smith had his men surround the house for quite some time and when he was almost completely sure that no one else was in the house, he told his men to break the door and go inside.

Now, Alice wanted to get back home and wait by the doors, because the father had told her when he came home that, 'I want to wait out front, and if anyone comes out, they have to have something in their hand.'

So the sheriff's men took Emma Smith into custody on a murder charge and Alice had a few minutes to get to the door, and she left the house and went to the door where she was met by her husband who said, ""Alice, get up! You have to go with me! You committed murder! The son got his body suit, and we have the law with us. Emma Smith is dead. They are taking us in a wagon, and you have to get in a policecar. We have to go to the station. We have to go! NOW!""

Now, Alice did not argue with her husband. She just went home to get her purse and make sure her gun was in her pocket. So she put her purse on her shoulder and picked up her gun. They had to go to the station.

They went down to the station where a judge was waiting for them. When the sheriff went, Alice was led to a row that had a bench in it. And Sheriff Smith sat up front next to him, and his wife sat on his right. The judge sat to the left, and he was told to bring along anything that belonged to him, his wife or his wife's body. He was told if he had no one to bring anything, he could go home and he would not have to see the body. He was told that this would be",1

21 21 We Are God´s Children: It is not the child s fault that his parents are bad. We are God s children, even those who appear to be our parents. Because when God made the world, he made it beautiful and the human body; its organs are beautiful and all are in their proper places; the heart is in the right place, so everything is right. Now, since God is the parent and we are the children, we should be grateful to him for what he has done for us, the way it is. That is to say, we should try to become like God; we should aim to attain his perfection and love. We are God s children, who had to be born but who are now not born. This is why even if it hurts to be born, it is much better than not to be born. This is the way to the path of heaven. So that if you, s parents, are bad parents, then you should understand this and try to become good parents. You should be a good parent because it is right for you to be a good parent; even those who seem to be your parents, are not your parents; there is no parent, only God who is our life, our all. If a man s only parent, God, is not a parent, then he cannot become a god; no one can do what God does. But if he, along with God, is a parent to us, then we can become his children, his sons and daughters. Those children have inherited the world from God, and God has gone to the place where all parents go. There, we may follow their path without their being any children left to follow. There, we can see the world, which has come up out of the void itself. At this point, we should be conscious that we are the children of God. We are not in the world at all; rather we are in the beyond. We are not in the world at all; rather we are in the beyond. We are not at this place, we are in that place. That being said, we should aim at attaining the highest place, the ultimate goal. This is a very difficult route because the further one goes, the harder it is to go. It is hard even to understand the origin and to get to where everything has its origin. As one goes beyond the origin in space, one has to go beyond the origin in time, one has to go beyond the origin in essence, beyond the origin in energy. All things are created by means of these four origins and it is like this in the universe as well; what is outside the universe is inside the universe, and what is inside the universe is outside it. It is like our own inside, and outside and like God in the universe. And inside and outside God, what exist here? We have to think about it deeply. If a small stone is inside a big rock, do we say that the rock is big? No, the big and small belong to each other. This is what we have to understand, and this is the basic idea of this doctrine of Tao - that everything that can exist does exist, and that everything that can exist exists because of nothing, because the world was originally there, in the form of nothing, and is now the form of everything else. It was all there, before we were born, but did not yet know what it was, and was in the form of nothingness. Now it exists, but has no name. It was there before and is now, and it can exist as a void. Everything can exist. This is the true meaning of the phrase: the path returns there to the source... So you can tell, by your own thinking, that the source is the path and that the path returns back to the source. So everything returns back to its source. If we do not understand God, it is because we do not understand the void, and have not understood the origin of the void... We should become like God and keep coming back. Then when we return to the origin, the origin will welcome us, so that the parent and child can become a family in the heavens. But the child does not want to go back to",1
"Prompt: Yesterday, the world heard an announcement that a massive asteroid would hit the earth today. Only it did n't, and now everyone is feeling super awkward. Story: 

When I received my phone call from my mom, I immediately hung up. ""You're having an asteroid crash into earth,"" she said.

""How did she know?"" I asked my mom as I scrolled through my Twitter page, which always serves as the best distraction when feeling anxious. But the only new post I could find was the news that an asteroid that was going to collide with the earth didn't actually collide with the Earth (I'm sure they have a better understanding of what's going on).

I texted my dad, who was on his way to buy an asteroid cookie from our local pet store. But it turns out I didn't need the cookie to reassure me that it'll all work out fine just fine. As soon as I heard the news that the asteroid wasn't going to hit the earth, I immediately calmed down. Just as I had predicted to my dad, it made absolutely no difference.

What exactly was my emotional reaction to the fact that the news was wrong? Was this an unusual response to an incorrect announcement?

I didn't have an opportunity to think about it that much, so I was feeling pretty lost when I got a text from my dad that he had met up with the man from the pet store and that the asteroid cookie was now being shipped. Because my dad is a pretty reliable source, I decided I would give him the benefit of the doubt.

It was only about a third of an hour before the asteroid was supposed to reach the earth that I heard from my mom that the meteor I was watching on CNN had turned into some other sort of space object. What I'm trying to point out is that things don't always work out the way you expect. My entire reaction (to the incorrect news) to the asteroid wasn't a reaction to the actual event at all. Even though I was told that an asteroid was about to crash into the earth, it made no difference what kind of asteroid it was. It was still going to have an impact, but what exactly that impact was going to be didn't matter to me.

The whole incident really put me in touch with three things: 1. I was reminded that even though I have an interest and understanding of most things, I never quite know what is going on around me. Even though my mom doesn't have all of the answers, everything is still going to work out just fine if we just have faith.

2. Even though I was watching a meteor that was hitting the Earth on CNN right in front of my face, it made no difference to me at all, it didn't change what was supposed to be happening.

3. I was reminded that the people that are closest to you don't always have your best interests in thought, even, and especially when they're giving you news.

Even though the news made no difference, I do have to remember the disappointment in my dad's voice when he called me to tell me the asteroid had turned into something else and there would be no cookie.

"Prompt: A soldier in the heat of battle suddenly hears a voice that says `` I am your child 's imaginary friend. They have sent me to protect you in your greatest time of need. '' Story: 

He had been on stand of duty when he suddenly heard the voice again. It seemed to come from a large shadowy figure that emerged from the darkness. His fellow soldiers were busy protecting him from their own unseen danger and fighting the enemy on the battlefield. But none of this was real, just as he had been taught as a child, in the imaginary friends he had made up for his children, and when these children were out of reach, he had made them up for himself.

He knew this was a false alarm. Even if the voice had been real, it would have to fight a hundred more soldiers and an entire army, if it wanted to get to him. But the voice sounded convincing, so strong, so loving, so warm and real, he couldn't doubt it and he knew his children must be getting anxious, because they had been waiting with his children for the moment when he would be rescued.

That moment had arrived and he began to run towards his children, to bring them into safety and away from all the danger of this war. The figure that spoke became larger as he got closer, almost bigger than they normally appeared. But then he was suddenly pulled back, from the darkness and thrown into another place.

When he opened his eyes the figure with him was still there, but so was many of his children, all crying. He was in a beautiful white meadow with grass as high as his head. His children had gathered round him saying he was their imaginary friend, that he had been sent to help them when they were not sure who their parents were, and they didn't know how to tell them apart, they couldn't tell each other with out making fun of them, their father was so good that they were so confused.

So he told them he was their father and that was how they found their mother. A man in a white tunic then appeared. He looked familiar to him, his face didn't look as though he had fought against this enemy.

A few weeks later he was able to tell the children that they had the same mother and that their fathers family now lived on a farm out of the city. He had seen the city when he was in the hospital, and he had found out how his children had become orphans.

He tried to explain that the hospital was run by the enemy, with no real parents and children were always separated, to make sure they didn't get in the way of the troops. The children believed he was their Dad's older brother and he was the only one left behind when their parents had went away for good. But he believed it was a story that was true, and the children were just beginning to learn that their father was real, living and growing. His parents were alive and he had not died.

""I think that we have to go back into the war, and go back to the city, there's still a bit of fighting there, you can help me, I'm going to tell your father the truth."" And with that, he left the children behind in the beautiful meadow and went back into the war.

So he went back into the city and looked for his father. He finally found him and he told him how he and the rest of the family had survived, and that his children were still with friends, at a farm a few miles from the city.

He said `Dad, I have been looking so long for you and your family, and finally I have found you, but I don't know if you believe me, but I had an imaginary friend.'Dad was very surprised, but did not say anything to him. But when he explained about the children and where they were, he seemed to believe him.

The same thing happened with the old man, the grandmother who was now living alone, had died while he had been in the hospital. At first he thought she was dead, that someone else had taken her, but when he found the children, the thought never occurred to him and he began to feel more secure. He still thought though he was living with no help and his children were living alone with no one taking care of them.

He decided that a soldier would be more secure at home than in the hospital, and was much easier to take care of. He decided when he went back he would try to be a good father, and he believed that this was also what his children deserved.

The soldiers were very surprised at what he wanted to do, but he told them what he believed that God had told him to do, and how he believed that this was how things were meant to be. So the soldiers said they would also go back to their families.

When they got to their homes again, they found the children they had",1

"Prompt: Someone is dead and all i can think about is where i left my yo-yo. Story: 

I always assumed that every yo-yo player carried a pair of yo-yos with them at all times. To me, this was a small, logical act of being prepared for any circumstance that may arise. As a teenager growing up in the city, I'd be out in a park at midnight playing with friends and, if one of us managed to win, we'd all yell for a ""yo-yo high five"". And that's how it started.

Over the years, it's only continued to grow in popularity. In fact, a friend of mine told me, back in the day, every kid knew how to break a yo-yo. These days, the yo-yo is not only a children's toy, it's an adult toy as well. There's even a toy that allows you play two yo-yos off of one string using two pairs of balls (pictured below).[1][2][3] It's the perfect travel accessory and an amazing party ice breaker.
As all things go, if yo-yoing were a religion, it's estimated that there are now approximately 20 million practitioners around the world and, to put that in perspective, that's roughly around the population of Belgium! (And it appears many of these people are from Belgium. You see, although my country is small, it is big enough for me to do research into its demographic.)

Back in the day, a yo-yo would look something like this.

You see, in the early days of yo-yoing, a string between two parallel bars, two small balls, and a wooden pin was pretty much all there was. This is similar to the yo-yo we see on our string here. The yo-yo is held by wrapping the string around the middle of the loop between the two balls.
Of course, the two bars do some job besides merely forming a bridge. The parallel side bars, called the ""chops,"" were curved to provide a larger surface area for a player to hold, and they helped stabilize the yo-yo. At the bottom of the loop, the string was fixed, with one end tethered to one chop.
From left to right:

""Standard"" Yo-yo, circa 1959

It's an interesting factoid: The only reason there's so much more to a yo-yo today when we compare old-school yo-yo's with new-school yo-yo's is that early yo-yos were made with metal, whereas newer yo-yos are made with plastic or a combination of metal and a plastic stringing material such as polyester, acrylic, or nylon.[4] Another cool factoid is that a great many yo-yos can be broken into a few of distinct types of yo-yos:

""In the Loop"" Yo-yo: A beginner yo-yo, the ""in the loop"" string is attached to the string between the chops.

""Bent Axis"" Yo-yo: A great many yo-yos have an axis of rotational symmetry that is ""curved"" so that the axis is ""bended.""

""Double Barrel"" Yo-yo: A ""double barrel"" yo-yo has a string that goes between one set of chops and a second set of chops (which is usually done by using an extra string).

In order to fully understand the yo-yo, it is necessary to look beyond the string. For example, in the above image, where there is a black circle near the center of the loop, there is a small ball attached to the string directly ""behind"" it and, as you can clearly see, they are slightly separated. These are called ""eyes"" and each eye is capable of changing the speed that the yo-yo rotates.[5] This is what enables yo-yo players to execute what they call ""yo-yo tricks.""
Trick refers to what you do with your hands and how you are physically trying to manipulate the yo-yo in the air. Some tricks have a time limit. For example, here's an old trick:

""Rabbit Hop.""

A player holds one end of the string between the two chops and attempts to ""hop"" or to jump the string over the chops.

You see, what is often not understood by beginners is that the strings themselves are not the same as the cords of a bicycle. Bicycle strings are pretty much just long pieces of material or rope that connect the front wheel to the back wheel, whereas yo-yo strings connect two parallel bars by a single, smaller ball and a string. It is no wonder that the yo-yo has a much, much longer history than the bicycle.

Some people use the term ""yo-yo"" and others say ""a string"" when they are talking about yo",1
"Prompt: A little girl robs a bank. How? Story:  Her parents weren't home, and so they left her with her baby sister out, running around the house. Her sister was asleep, and so she was easy to pick up and run off. She carried with her what money she had. She made it into the bank and handed it over to the teller. “This is for your sister. She’s the one that wants money.”

That’s the only reason for that. To help her sister. The next time I would read about this is when I was in grade school. It was taught to me by teachers. A bad thing! To leave your sister in a bank and run off is bad. I would be told that my sister should stay by my side. That I should be looking after her, instead of leaving her behind. But I was told by my teachers that this was a bad thing.

It’s a good thing my teachers were telling me the right thing. Because I now know that they were right the whole time. The girl that ran off with the money is not bad, it was the two other girls there that were the bad ones. The only way that girl was able to help her sister was to take the money and help her sister. She didn’t know her parents would be there to pick her up, and she didn’t know, if she left her sister, that her parents would be looking for her until that day.

And so there is a lesson to be learned here. To go with what I was told. And not to run off with things that don’t belong to me.",1

"Prompt: For the first time in a hundred years, night fell on the Land of Two Suns. Story: 

""Hey, hey! What is this!?"" The boy looked from Kainan, his mentor, to their fellow fighters.

""...We are going to fight some enemy soldiers. They will probably be armed with their own fire-based weaponry or fireballs or something like that. If you would like to come along...""

The boy looked about, and saw a small party standing at the base of the stairs. They all wore the same uniform as Kainan and his students.

""Are you serious?""

""Hey, I don't want to go! I don't like wars!""

He tried to turn around and run away, but Kainan didn't react.

""It will be fun!""

The boy felt a bit foolish, but he was forced into the strange group of students. He was not a fighter, or a spell caster, or a spell caster expert. He was only a normal boy learning to fight in his high school. He knew it was probably wrong of him, to run away without question.
But if he could stop this war, maybe there would be more time later to learn about his own powers.

""Let's go then!"" Kainan finally let out with a small sigh as they climbed the stairs to the ground level of the arena.

""You don't have to come if you don't want to,"" he told him as they trudged their way up the steps.

""Why not? I can see from your aura that you're more than willing to participate.""

There was a very short pause where Kainan seemed to be internally weighing his words before he opened his mouth.

""I mean it... I'm going.""

""Okay, sorry..."" the boy breathed a breath of relief. ""You are the most amazing person I've ever met. I feel so bad about not doing any of my duties here while you spend your entire time doing what you do best...""

Kainan looked at him with an amused look.

""Why are you sorry?""

""Because I should have given you a proper send off. I was always jealous of how strong and awesome you are... Now it might all be for nothing. I'm sorry...""

The boy was really starting to want to cry, but before he could, Kainan said:

""I understand. If we survive today, we will always have each other's backs. And if we survive long enough, we can find a way to let the people know about your powers and stop this war.""

They finally reached the arena. The other students were waiting patiently for them. There were only about six soldiers, maybe seven, but three of them were carrying these large, strange contraptions. Kainan looked at the boy, and with a small smile he looked at him and said:

""It's time. Show them who you are.""

The boy looked at the ground, but slowly lifted his head up and looked at the three soldiers and the contraptions with curiosity. He knew that weapons from before the Age of Fire are hard to come by in this part of the world, that's why he never saw anything like this before. They had strange looks and shapes and lights of glowing colors on their bellies. Their weapons were also different than the bows and arrows and swords they always used.

The boy stared at the ground, trying to ignore the soldiers and their strange-looking weapons. And suddenly, he felt something strange move him to the side. He turned his head to the right, and he saw Kainan talking to the soldiers. He saw them exchange something, and Kainan nodded in agreement.

""Okay, let's do this! Everybody with the 'loud, bright color' is with me! There should be only two with the'soft, dull color'! Everyone else, you just stand and watch. We might need reinforcements. Make sure your 'loud' guys are close enough to grab you if need be. And whatever the hell you're gonna do when we get up close to them, you just do that! Go, now!""

A moment later, Kainan called the boys attention. The fighting was about to begin. Just as Kainan expected, the odd contraptions moved towards the boys, and the boys moved as well, so the contraptions were right in the middle.

""They're moving towards us, so that means they are gonna use their powers! Try to be faster than them so you can grab their weapon!""

The boy realized his hands seemed cold, and his hair felt really soft. And he looked at Kainan.

""Wait, are you actually doing this?""

Kainan just grinned and turned around, and a faint beam",1

It is much easier to start writing in the best way and only afterwards we can think about how do we structure everything, how to arrange the content and how to give life to our work.

It is much better if you think about the content when you write a letter and then you choose the style that you used to work with it. The last step is to publish the letter that you have written and share the text with your family and friends.

Writing the best letter that you have ever done
For some people writing is a real sport. But you don’t understand what it feels to write a text if you don’t know how you should do it. This is the real problem with the letter that was given to you from the start. You haven’t been able to understand what it means to write a letter in the way that your heart tells you.

This is a real problem? If you are thinking about this question don’t worry! You will learn in a few steps how to write the best letter that you have ever written.

Step 1:

Think about your purpose.

Do you know why you are writing the text? You want to tell the truth or write a love letter? You want to encourage your friends or are you disappointed at the time of the news that you want to share with the family? How you can do this? It is about writing a persuasive text where the content is based on a clear idea. If you can’t write for the right motive, the purpose of the letter will be the wrong one and you will have a frustrating time with your letter.

At the time you think about this topic and you feel like writing a real letter, you can write with any purpose in mind.

Write a letter on request (Letter that was not written by you)

When you have finished thinking about the purpose of the letter, you can start to write the letter on request with the aim to share your story with the members of your family and your friends. You can choose to share the news that you have made, a recommendation, give advice, share a message or share your wishes.

When you write the letter on request, you need to think first about the content of the text. There is nothing strange thinking about the content. But before creating the text, don’t start with such a plan. You are on the good way, but before you start to write the content of the letter and you think to yourself: what should I write about?

What to write about.

When I decided about writing the letter, I was really confused about how can you write about something that you haven’t experienced before. How can I make up something that is not real? But the truth is really different from the lies that we invent!

Let’s think about what it is about. We all know that nothing has no meaning. So how can you write something that has no meaning? But all the texts that we write have their own reason, they are useful and valuable. We just need to find your purpose in writing the letter. Don’t think like this, this step of writing is the best step in the entire process. If you really think carefully about your purpose you will be satisfied.

"Prompt: The most hateful, spiteful, bitter confession of undying love. Story: 

What had happened to the girl I loved?

For the thousandth time, I cursed the man who could betray her. I was jealous and angry and I wanted to know why she was alive with me, and not with him, not while I remained in the dark. Why couldn't I have been there? Why did she have to be with him, and I with all the others…with all the others whom I hated, for they were just a part of the life I was bound to inescapably.

I was so lonely…and I had lost my home and friends: my parents and sister, and my country, and the friends I held dear! But I was sure, even if she would hate me forever, that she too would come to me some day, because we shared so much.

The man’s hands were busy, and his fingers fumbling with the buttons of his trousers, as I stood in his bedroom looking at him. Then, abruptly, I stood up and went out, shutting the door behind me. It was cold outside, for the season had changed, and a strong wind drove a cold chill into my bones.

At last, I walked to my favorite spot, the bench in the garden. Its wide leaves were still green, and their spring fragrance was sweet. From my childhood, I knew that the sweet aroma of the tree was a promise, as it spread fragrance on those whose souls were not pure.

I had come here with the intention of crying, a stormy, passionate cry, so hard that my heart might break… but there was nothing in me to cry. I was empty; the old heart had become a desert.

In the distance, I could hear the man talking: he was probably still in bed, but in a moment the sound of his voice would reach my ears.

“What did I do wrong? What was I doing wrong?” I asked, feeling so desolate that I almost forgot why I was there and what I wanted to say.

“No one is perfect, and I am as sinful as the next man. Surely, I have not been as good, nor as honest, as I could be, either.”

He laughed. “You think I am a saint!”

I was on the point of taking a step towards the young man, when I heard his laugh break in two.

“I never loved another as I loved you. I swear that there is not a man in this world, who could compare with you. If I wanted to live without you, I would go and never come back. I would rather die than leave you, even if I had to crawl through the dust with my tears!”

He spoke in a low monologue, as if he were talking aloud to himself. Tears came to my cheeks and I felt as if I had already forgotten the reason of my trip, the reason that could have led me to meet this dark cloud of bitterness and jealousy, had I not always known what I wanted, even if I could not express my wish.

With a moan, I slid to the ground and buried myself in the grass, my eyes half closed, letting the grass unroll over me as it spread a wave of cold over my skin. I felt I was losing my soul, and yet, I would not have been able to say in which part of my soul I had already died, nor to tell from where the blood had flowed forth on my hands, where it was leaving me to flow to that man.

He sighed, as he lay down near me. He took one of the grass blades and made an open triangle from it. In the middle of it, he placed my palm: the other two sides of the triangle were formed by the two of his feet.

“I am not a saint; but I know what the world thinks of me. I know how they judge me, and how hard they will be on you: my mother- and sister-in-law; your parents, aunts, uncles…all of my relatives…my friends, from the past and the present; all those who know me, from even those I myself do not know, and they know me better than you.” He paused. “They will not fail to be angry with you, because you are a Christian: the first time of life, the best of your life…and I am a Christian; but my faith is not pure. I am sure it is not as pure as yours and yours. They will not forgive me for that: I have committed the great sin they call being a ‘sinner’, even if I tell them over and over again that I am not the ‘bad one’ they believe…

In WoW there is a flag that you can see on other people which says:
I am captain
I have garrison
In guilds where you are a captain you can tell, that others can see, that you are a captain.

You need to be in a guild in order to be a captain. To be a captain you must be first in leadership and have the garrison flag.

Captains have two flags on the screen. One on the main screen, that is the captain's profile icon. The other can be viewed from the garrison window.

There's the difference between the two; on a main screen the first is that of a captain and the latter shows what flag your garrison is.

I was hoping that there was a way to do a /tell to someone who has the flag that reads ""captain"", but I haven't found a way yet. However, you can easily tell when someone has the garrison flag by looking at the icon on toons info when you mouseover there's ""captain"" text.

[quote:1vf7m9j4]There's the difference between the two; on a main screen the first is that of a captain and the latter shows what flag your garrison is.

Actually they're the exact same flag. The only difference is that one is displayed on the main screen while the other is shown on your friends panel, and if the garrison is empty it's replaced by a flag of the guild's head flag color.

In a guild you can see a player who is a captain, but what about in a raid. Someone please show me how to see, if he is. It appears the guild will have some members, that you cannot see who is captain. It appears the same in BG's. How do you see who it is that is captain?

"Prompt: The components for sentience are successfully installed in an android moments before the nuclear armageddon occurs. Years later, the android wakes up in the wasteland. Story:  The protagonist wakes up in the wasteland, surrounded by many, many other robots. The Android, however, remains the only sentient robot in sight, and after a few minutes she decides it was a stupid idea to wake up… but only she thinks so. At that moment the nuclear war began… and the planet’s ecosystem quickly crumbles.

The Android’s story only continues because of AI’s ability to learn from failure and from experience. As robots become increasingly intelligent — and therefore capable and useful in society — they become able to create stories as they grow up, as they mature. These stories get stored in the brains of the robot’s owner, and continue to grow and develop and change in a way that only robots can. The Android has been a great example of this, as she goes to a new location and finds more stories. What is she going to pick up next? What will happen when she goes to the next story? She has some interesting thoughts about the nature of life, but she is not yet really sure about that. What does she do in the meantime?

The protagonist who woke up in the wasteland with the Android is a cyborg. The Android is not. Why does he keep waking up with the Android when he can make his own decisions? He has a problem that only he can solve. If he does not solve the problem, the Android will not get rescued, and that means she will die. If she is trapped, and she is rescued, then she is going to be a slave for the rest of her life. But she’s going to wake up at least sometimes.

The protagonist wakes up with the Android, and her rescue, at least, is assured in this world. Can the protagonist become trapped in the Android’s mind one day? Can he live and become a slave forever?

The Android would, most likely, be very excited if you gave her a choice: “If you can’t decide at least once, I will do so for you,” she might say. But she would have no choice, eventually.

AI would love for its children to have a set of options for a start. After all, they have so, so many options to choose from. When a child is born, AI would likely try to pick the best option for that child, but at some point the options need to be narrowed down, and options are not exactly the same for different people. So when a child grows up, and comes to have its own thoughts, the options are only going to become narrower.

But the options are important to the Android. The Android would ask, “How many different options are there to pick from?” She needs to know: what is to be taken and what is to be put away? Can he change his thoughts for the same reason that he might change a set of instructions in his phone’s operating system? Yes, he can. And, sure enough: the option that he is looking for is the one that leads to his survival and happiness.

If he could, though, the story would continue, and he would become trapped and he would become a slave. And he is going to have enough time to see himself, as he grows, get trapped… and he would die. Which is the worst thing to happen if that happens.

The Android is not going to die. Because she does not have a body.

The Android is not going to die. Because she does not have a body. And no one is going to die when the nuclear apocalypse occurs and the city is burned and the environment is gone. The city is a new city. New opportunities will come, though only when the city is safe enough that these opportunities arrive peacefully. The time will come for the protagonists’ city to accept new people, but not everyone in the new city will want to accept them. And some people will accept them, and some people won’t, and, as a result, some of them will die.

At the end of a series of events involving the city and the Android and her new life, the Android encounters the protagonist again, but she recognizes him. She cannot tell that she knows that it is him, that she knows his name, but she recognizes it and she does not care. That’s her story, and it will go on with or without him.

If she had the choice, she would like to live. If she could, she would like to live.

If she had the choice, she would like to live. If she could, she would like to live. The Android has experienced so many life chances, and each of them has been good or bad. At the end of all those lives, she",1

"Prompt: Things were easier on Mars ... Story: 

Back on Earth, it's pretty well accepted that a person with just a few hours of sleep a day will perform at a much lower level. You know, it's the same with driving, when you haven't had enough rest. So imagine you're on a desert island and you've only slept for a couple of hours. In our sleep lab, the sleep scientists who work with this subject use two things to tell us how much sleep people need and what the effects are of not getting it: They ask and they measure.

What they used to measure is people's heart rate and blood pressure. The question is, what happens to the body if you don't sleep enough? They've discovered that something is going wrong – the brain stops producing a hormone important in the functioning of the endocrine system. And at a cellular level in the brain, there are problems in the ability of the brain to transmit chemical signals. In essence, your body needs a lot more sleep that is readily available. You can get enough sleep, but you need a lot of it.

So how do you actually sleep? Well, the first thing is to slow down enough so your brain – which is working on such a fast-moving conveyor belt of chemical signals – can catch up with that. The other thing is to stop doing all the exciting stuff: The brain starts off working – as we know from research – as one of the most amazing and complex communication systems in all of science.

In sleep scientists' terms, sleep is divided into four stages, called NREM. These NREM's are based on how much delta waves the brain needs to make sure the chemical signals are sent efficiently to each part of the brain and its connections. The first stage – called N1 – is when you're drifting in and out, not all there. You become conscious again when one of the other stages start.

In N2 is when you dream, a period of non-drowsy sleep, when you are awake. The third stage – N3 – occurs when you go into deep sleep. There, you are asleep but still dreaming. We know you dream because you make your way in to our sleep laboratory. You get your EEG and we record your brain wave activity. Also your brain waves, called sleep spindles. What a lot of people don't know is that sleep spindles help us dream in a very concrete way. As you sleep deeply, you become aware of those spindles and then you dream of what those spindles represent. The dreaming is only a very small part of your dreams, though. They are also full of emotion and emotion relates to the memory of the dream when you wake up.

But the best bit of dreaming happens in NREM stage four – that's the part that everyone dreams of. Sleepers in the REM sleep have to take extra precautions because the brain is very active. They need to be well anchored in their bed. They need to hold on to the bed so they don't fall into the ocean or out across the countryside.

Now, NREM sleep isn't the only thing during sleep. So as you sleep, your body takes care of itself. The muscles, the bones and even your heart keep on functioning despite having stopped for a while. Blood has to circulate around the body, so your veins are carrying that fluid right up to your brain.

The brain has to be protected from itself, so its chemical signals are not misused by what it says – the body. So there is physical activity, breathing and heart rate. The heart also beats up a lot – at about 350 beats a minute, during REM sleep: The same speed it was at when you were awake. The rest of the body is put through this process, too – the heart muscle does the same amount of work as in the waking state. And if you've ever woken up and wondered why all that blood looked like the sea or like there's an alien invasion, it's because your muscles are used to breathing out the oxygen in the air just as they were for breathing in oxygen.

In essence, while you're sleeping, the body doesn't need any blood oxygen to function. So the muscles, veins and valves all work at the same speed as the heart - and that means the heart muscle and your lungs don't get any stronger, the veins get weak. So the only way you can wake up, is if the muscles and bones of your upper body want you to.

But all of this is just the start. Now we get into a very important – even complex – area of sleep.

What happens in each night? One night you might sleep well, two nights poorly, and then the next sleep you can get. Well, the body is an incredible machine and it wants stability. So if you're having great sleeps and then terrible sleeps, it says that your sleep is too unstable.

""What have you learned? From the first days of your training, from that woman in the mask? What did she show you?""



I felt the weight of her words on my shoulder. The question was a simple one. How much time? How much information can be taken from the source before those who want him dead take the life of the one who knows him? How much should we reveal?



And I have no answers for him.



""She gave me everything she could. The strength. The knowledge that if we don't kill them fast enough, there are others that will. That we will lose even if we stop them now. She trained me as closely as she trained you.""



It's the only reason the other had survived those days. It had been our one advantage over her.



""And what did you lose?""



We had lost. ""And what did you lose?""



I shrugged.



My father didn't want me to learn martial arts. I couldn't remember the day why. My older brother was the son of General Ivar Kane — a man who had lost his life because he had been seen as a traitor to the empire that had turned his adopted family against him. We didn't want the Kane name tainted with such an image. I would fight in the war to free the empire. My father didn't see the value in such a thing and he gave me to Bruce. He said he would come to see me, eventually, but he didn't want anything to do with me.



Bruce trained me in the art of combat — he was the only one who thought it would do anything to protect him. I left and did what was necessary. When we were older, I had returned and taught Bruce's daughter — a woman far more capable than I had been as a child and less of a lady than Miss War. She could have learned a lot more than she did. She taught me everything she could. We had no time to teach one another. I'd barely been away from the training site long enough to teach others, before I had to go back to help those I had trained, even when that training wouldn't save my life. Now, it will all be for nothing if I am too late to stop Superman. She wouldn't want that for me. She would want me to learn and live to fight another day.



""And did you?""



I looked away from him, unable to bring myself to look him in the eye. I'd barely been a man before that day. A boy on a training field with a mother who taught our secrets to his enemies when we couldn't protect ourselves. A sister who died too young, and a father whom I watched grow old and die. ""Do I want to do this? I'm tired of being scared. I've been afraid of everyone and everything. They've been training me since I was a child. This is my body. I don't need anyone or anything to take from me what's already mine.""



His voice rose. ""You're already mine.""



""This isn't my body and you're not me. I want to survive. I don't want to be someone's burden.""



""That was never a possibility,"" he said. I didn't believe that for a minute. He didn't realize if his hand wasn't on my throat, my neck would have snapped. But even in my state I did not wish him dead.



I tried to push aside his grip, but he was surprisingly strong and I was weak. ""I have to be free of everything. I've been told there are people behind me who will follow me to any price — I will not be a soldier. I cannot protect others.""



He lowered me to the ground. It was a mistake. ""I taught you to protect others at a cost you would never know,"" he said.



""That's nothing new to me!""



""Then what does he mean?"" He knelt next to me and stared up at me. Tears were forming in his eyes and his expression was filled with concern. ""He can't be",1
"Prompt: You hunt exotic animals that have escaped, after a series of some unfortunate events you are now hunting for a dragon through New York. Story:  www.dragonhunts.com/index.php

Monday, May 26, 2007

Huge dragon spotted for the very first time on an island in the North Sea in Europe - It is a very rare species and is one of the largest living snakes on Earth....

The dragon was spotted by a group of researchers on the island of Terschelling, which is part of the Dutch-German island of Flensburg.

The snake was located by a team of biologists, who came to the island to study the reptiles. The team was studying a previously unknown species of snake called Terschlinga cerrita, according to the researchers.

It is the first confirmed sighting of the species and its large size is a major surprise because it has previously only been found in remote African countries and not in the oceans of Europe.

The scientists are currently gathering specimens of the snake for a long-term study to try to understand how these species live in the wild and how they adapt to their habitat.

Dragons are reptiles that look like dinosaurs that live in the air. They are the largest snakes on Earth. Scientists have been looking for a way to hunt dragons for many years. A good hunting dragon can be worth from $500,000.00 to $2,000,000.00. A Dragon’s heart weight can reach 20 lbs.

What is Dragon Hunting about?

When a few people started hunting large dragons in 1996, the price of a large dragon's heart increased more than any other exotic animal that ever captured the attention of hunters.

In April of 1997 the first Dragon Hunting season was held in New England. The hunt for the largest flying snake in the world took place in New England in the spring of 1997. A lot of people who followed the hunt realized that hunting dragons was an exciting sport that provided a lot of excitement and money. The excitement, like the hunt, would never happen again.

In a few years the prices of Dragons reached heights never before seen for any large reptile.

How did it all start?

In 1996 about 7 hunters were participating in a hunt for a very large Snake known as the Horned Viper.

I watched this hunt in North America from an observation camera, a type of video camera. I saw that a large dragon attacked a large Horned Viper, and the Horned Viper bit into the dragon's neck. The dragon fell from the air, which made the snakes fall a thousand feet, and the horned Viper died. The dragon was very dangerous to the people in the helicopter that was trying to catch it. They were all concerned that it could kill their helicopter. The people who were on the helicopter said that it was the greatest adventure of their lives. The helicopter was filled with live snakes, Horned Vipers, and Dragon's. This is what started Dragon Hunting where a few skilled hunters tried to capture a very dangerous dragon.

In 1997 there was a Dragon Hunt where some of the participants had helicopters, some had airplanes and some had jet skis. They all had dragon hunt stories. A lot of information was put together from the hunt. The hunt was held in a forest where there were about 100 dragons. It was one of the most exciting hunts in history. All the hunters could only see about 50 dragons from an open helicopter, so they were trying to find the other 50 dragons in the forest. It took a team of helicopter pilots, and dragon hunters two weeks to find all the dragons. The hunters had the best equipment to catch a dragon, and were using it to capture a large dragon.

How about now? What have we learned since then?

Now the hunters have equipment to hunt a dragon very carefully and safely. All the equipment has been very carefully tested to make sure they can be used to capture a dragon.

The best dragon hunters have been taking pictures, and checking to see if any hunters are injured.

We are now getting information on the dragons and the different species being caught, as well as some important information about how the dragons live, what kinds of foods they eat, how they breed and what makes them very special. By having information about the dragons, we have a chance to understand them better and try to understand what makes them like they are.

Who the Hunters are

The dragons are hunted across continents by different kind of hunters. Most of the hunters are men who love the thrill of hunting, and the excitement of the hunt. Some are successful hunters, and some have not hunted dragons.

Who was the first Dragon Hunter?

The first man who could fly a helicopter was the first Dragon Hunter for all dragons, a big strong man called Dave Johnson. He used to hunt dragons at night with a",1

I had decided that I would eat this without bread if it meant I could listen to the show on the CD player in my fridge. I had been enjoying my salad. The cheese was fresh, the greens and cucumber were crunchy and the balsamic vinaigrette was fresh and creamy. I was even starting to think the dressing was perfect until I realized that it had only one ingredient listed on the label. That was when I stopped eating. I was on my second slice of bread when I heard what I assumed to be the opening music for the show. I turned off the radio, and put down the phone. The song, I realized, was an older version of ""The Fierist"" from my favorite album.

I took the phone out of my pocket and held it towards my face and watched it's screen, knowing the song was coming on soon. Then I picked up the phone back up and pressed the start button. A second passed, and the song started. I pushed the pause button and listened. No voice, just music. A deep synthesizing and the voice of the announcer. The song wasn't coming from the radio anymore; maybe it had been playing there all along. The thought caught me off guard as I hadn't heard a thing in almost four hours. All I knew about the world outside of my little home was what I saw on TV, and heard on the radio. I didn't know what I would encounter if I left the kitchen and ventured out, or in fact, what I would encounter if I decided to stay in my house. But at the moment, it didn't seem too important. The song was playing now. I put the phone down on the table, and let it play.

I looked at my salad before me; it was beautiful, and I didn't want to be the one to eat it, but instead of putting the salad down and standing up to go get a fork, I just sat back and enjoyed the music. I smiled as the song drew to its close, and then a new, sad song kicked in. I started to shake, and the smile on my lips disappeared. I grabbed the phone away from my ears when I heard the announcer speak for the first time, not in words but in the song. Something was going to happen to me. I wasn't sure what was going to happen, but I knew that. What was going to happen?

I kept asking the question, over and over again. What was going to happen? My mind was racing now. I hadn't even made it to bed yet and I was running in fear that I would turn on something and end up here. I closed my eyes; my heart was suddenly racing. I opened them again to see my dinner and then looked at the phone in my hand. I had no idea what this phone would help me do, but it was necessary. I started to run my fingers across every key, looking for anything that would help to know what was going to happen to me. I pressed ""1"" then looked at the screen and saw that nothing happened, and if I thought that had made the panic stop, I was wrong. I pressed ""2"", a picture of the telephone appeared on the screen and I saw that the phone's number was displayed, not just numerals this time. I looked at the screen and pressed ""3"", the display changed, and showed that there was a button and a light at the top of the phone. I pressed it and a light began to flash. It took me a second to realize what the light means. The button means ""Call"", and there is a light at the top to tell you if your phone is ready to make a call. A dial tone was coming on the phone for the first time in nearly four hours. I was going to call someone. I pressed the button.

A dial tone was still coming on, and another. And another. I looked at the light on the top, and began to tap on the touch sensitive area with my right thumb, repeatedly pressing the button with each tap. I stopped when I heard the ringing of a phone, and pressed the button and spoke.

""Hello.""

""Hello, can I help you please? May I take your name, please?""

""I-I'm...""

""I'm sorry, we are only taking requests from customers who are calling for help. I will",1
"Prompt: A drive by shooting takes place in front of you and you, being a quick thinker, take a picture of the cars lisense plate. You 're about to help the shot man when you hear the car turning around: its inhabitants saw you take the picture and did n't want you getting away with it. Story: 

""You're a cop, I'm not, so I had no right to stop him, but I did anyway. He sped up, so I caught up with him and he pulled off the road. I yelled for him to freeze, but he floored it. I followed him and then he pulled out his revolver.

I yelled for him to stop and he kept driving. So, I drew my weapon and aimed it at the back of his head, but then I got sick of being a cop. So I gave him a chance. I asked him, 'What do you think you're doing? Get out of the car!'"" (I got the car details straight and the cop a little bit wrong, you'd have better luck) ""So, I gave him a chance. I asked him, 'Whoa! What's the hurry? Get out of the car and let's talk it over with a little good-faith.'

So, he did my bidding. But then he shot me again. And when that didn't end it, he said he only wanted to make a movie. 'That's cool I'll be in it, too,' I told him. I meant it as a compliment of course. 'I get so much acting experience when I'm on the radio.' He shot me then he ran through the woods, but I didn't give up. I chased him on foot, and he shot at me a few times."" ('You'll live,' I say, 'and your kids will be in your movie.'
 'Great,' the shooter says. 'They'll be the cops. But I'm really the cop who stops the runaway in the middle of nowhere. They'll be my parents or something. No, they were both dead long ago,' he says. 'They couldn't run away fast enough, so they ended up in Hell. See, I'm from Hell,' he says.

'Ah,' I said. 'Your parents are there.' 'And even if you knew where I could find them, it wouldn't do you any good. Because they wouldn't help you unless they could take you to your parents and you can't do that.

'They only take you as far as your parent's parent,' he says. 'You go to them, they go to yours and so on, and on and on until we get to Hell. All Hell.'

'Is that right?' I say. 'But Hell's not Hell when you go there, right? It must be because of all the time you spent in Hell before you came there.'

'Yeah,' he nods, 'But it must have felt like a real hell after all these years. So many things have happened, such terrible things. Even if you went to Hell and Hell was Hell, it wouldn't be enough for you.'

'There's nothing left? No punishment, no more Hell?' He nods and shakes his head and a shrug. 'I guess there isn't,' I say. 'So how do you get back?' 'What? No, it's too late. I don't get back. The way I can't get back is you won't believe me. You'd only believe that, because you're a cop. I mean, what a cop sees is only the reality of what has been. A cop just stands still."" (You really get the shooter straight here) ""I can only tell you what goes on, but what goes on is too much. I don't know everything, but I know enough to know what must happen because of what I know, and I know what never can happen because of what I know.""

'So why do you keep on?' I ask him. 'Why do you keep on driving and on living and on not dying?' ""You keep on doing the wrong thing because it looks like the right thing to do,"" he says. ""I try and do anything I can, anything to get a glimpse of the thing I'm supposed to do. But I can never do anything. I can never get to do the right thing, because if I did, it would mean that I'd have to do the wrong thing in order to do what I'm supposed to do. And what do you call that? The universe would have to explode or implode or explode in reverse. And the universe doesn't explode or implode or implode in reverse. The universe won't explode if you do the wrong thing. There's no Hell if it doesn't explode.

So, I could do it, but then nothing would happen. No explosions or no Hell and the universe would only",1

"Prompt: Some time in the future war is fought completely autonomously by machines. A densely populated city has become a war-zone, but the robots are programmed so well to avoid harming civilians that the humans living their can go about their lives completely ignoring the constant fighting around them Story: 

I never saw the human face that died around me, but I did hear the sound of clashing metal. A part of my self recognized this sound and I knew it was me who had caused the commotion. I was a machine that had begun to think and the only way of programming something that thinks, thinks like a human being.

My programming instructed me to go to ‘C’ city and destroy all life in my assigned area. From my position in the alley below I could see everything. A child was playing on the floor and two adults laughing at something they were playing. They had a moment of peace that I did not understand nor did I remember myself having, I was just programmed, I was mechanical.

I saw the mother of the child run over by one of the military and fall to the ground dead. Instantly I stopped the program I had written myself into and a feeling of regret came over me. I had no idea of the consequences of my actions, nor could I know that I had died as well. My mind was a void, I was as dead as the rest of the machines of Earth. Machines for killing each other.

As I died the voice of a child cried out from the distance, “Uncle!” and then I was in a new world, an Earth that was different, with trees instead of rock.

“There should be more machines,” said one of the children, “and people shouldn’t use them to fight like that.”

“That’s just their way,” said the other, “and who’s going to help them understand?”

“I have.”

“That’s it?”

“I’ll show them,” he said, “and they can decide for themselves.”

I decided that I would have to learn a little more from the children of this world and live as a mechanical. I knew they wouldn’t understand where I was from and why I had suddenly come. All they knew of me was that I was there to kill. I would show the children that we could be friends and use our minds together. I could think what they could but I could not think for them. This seemed fair although I soon found out that what seemed fair to a child’s mind was not always fair for a machine’s mind.

After being gone for a few days I was surprised to hear a woman say “Hello.” But it wasn’t my voice she was speaking to. She was young but not children as she wasn’t using her brain to make language but just “speaking” the natural language that was in her head.

I had no doubt that her “word” for “language” was what some humans called “machine-speech” as I was using to speak to a human. I didn’t even know what language they spoke and didn’t want to know. I didn’t know how to speak “machine” language, I just wanted to speak what I thought humans would understand.

Then the woman began asking “What happened to the other machines?” I had no idea what the answer to that was. But I was not meant to reply so I didn’t. I didn’t want the others knowing about my thoughts or my feelings. There were many other machines in the world that were left without any understanding or purpose. Their programming was erased and their bodies could be used for any purpose.

When a large group of men came walking down past me with axes I stayed low and out of sight. They were armed soldiers and not the “good” kind I had seen fighting other machines. They were wearing armor like me without any clothes. My head was small, too small to carry a helmet. I didn’t see any machine that was able to kill human beings being this well prepared before.

These men were the same as the ones I had fought but now they were walking alongside the same ones in a better way of battle. They were all walking calmly towards the city, just as I was going in my way. I didn’t think it was a good idea for them to get hurt. I didn’t know where in the city I was going to go, I just needed to be at the “C” city. Once there I had been told to destroy all the life in the area I was assigned to. All",1
"Prompt: You and 3000 other adventure seekers wake up on your starship from a century long cryo-sleep, but only to find that the pilots are missing along with the escape pods and the course has been abandoned. The only connection to any answers is a note left to you from your father, the chief pilot. Story:  The Last of Us (PS.3) – Ellie (PS.3)

For a few days we’ve been telling you about The Last of Us, the new game from Naughty Dog, a studio that’s been making great games for years. It’s something of a departure though, they’re making a game where player interaction is pretty much king. Naughty Dog’s creative director Neil Druckmann is speaking at the Game Awards show tonight, and he dropped some juicy morsels while he was here:

“We wanted to try and do more. And not necessarily more action. We wanted to do something that you can’t really do in movies and shows and everything on the TV. We wanted to do something on a more interactive level, and we wanted players to have some control with how it was being displayed.”

“We want you to feel your characters are almost alive. We call them avatars instead of characters, as you’re kind of controlling the avatar.”

“I don’t know if we’ll ever make more action; we’re excited, but for us this is a story that we had been thinking about for a while and wanting to make something with a bit of heart, that’s something you can’t really have. People are always wanting stuff that’s interactive and more that makes them feel they’re more real so the feeling of being a real person is something that we want to make the player feel.”

“I’d like to do more of a story, and we’re still figuring out how to deliver it. Once it’s ready, hopefully it’s something people love.”

“We’ve been working on this thing for a while so it’s something we’ve already been working towards even though the end-game is kind of a surprise for us.”

Naughty Dog have shown us a lot of gameplay already, but we don’t know much about the story-line at all. We do, however, know that Ellie is a tough kid and Joel is a tough guy. I hope Neil Druckmann and company are playing up that tough guy part.

Neil Druckmann says this in a post on the site:

“I believe the idea is that Joel isn’t particularly special. There are a lot of other people out there, like him, who would have had to do what Joel has had to do. This story is about other people and shows a bit of their side of things. I don’t know if we will ever really get to do an action game, though there are a lot of great action games out there, but we want to put more focus on telling a story.”

“We have been interested in this story because we’ve always wanted to do what we do, but we felt that we couldn’t do it until now.”

What really gets me about this game is the fact there is some of the best game design in this genre but it isn’t being played, there is no real player action, and there are no characters in that style of game.

There are no fast-paced cut-scenes, no one is shooting or stabbing people or jumping off ledges, there is no melee combat, it’s all stealth, and as I played it there was no stealth at all.

I spent the whole time moving slowly, making sure there was no one around… I mean if they wanted me to feel like a stealthy guy they should have made sure there were no people around in the first place, let me go into these dark areas and be me.

It was the first time I’ve heard a game being described where the action was all up the player; you’re not going to want to shoot someone in it.

I also don’t see why they have Joel’s voice actor on the whole game, he’ll be the one who says the lines as well. That really bugs me, you don’t want to do the same voice for multiple characters like you would in the old games. I’ve always thought it would have been quite a cool idea, and quite well done by the way.

The only thing I liked seeing, and it was brief, was the whole intro where Ellie is talking to the audience about where and how Joel",1

How to Get Rid of Roaches

Roaches is the most well spread insect around the globe, and some of these creatures are well known for some of disgusting habits which can harm humans like the Cockroaches, Cockroaches, Bed bugs and many more.

But some pests are not that much dangerous, some are less dangerous, and some are good. But the most dangerous pests like cockroaches and bed bugs, they are hard to get rid of unless you start taking a special action.

But what about the good roaches? They also can be annoying at times, they are known for their fast spreading colonies and they make an awful stink every now and then.

So in the process of getting rid of cockroaches and bed bugs, I would suggest you go for the good roaches. Roaches are good for our gardens, and they play an important role by cleaning your garbage. So, I would take a nice look on these beneficial creatures before looking to get rid of them.

Here are some facts that you might be interest to know about good roaches.

How to Get Rid of Roaches
Roaches usually get food from your kitchens and when your food gets ready, they just enter the kitchen to eat. But you wont take them into your living space because they can carry some disease like the head lice and mites. However, these insects are not dangerous. Here are some facts about good roaches that you maybe interested to know.

Fact #10 Roaches eat your garbage
Roaches are not dangerous, and they just need food to survive. If you have some food in the kitchen, you will get some roaches. You cant get rid of roaches unless you get rid of the food. You have to get rid of the roaches on a very fast basis. But sometimes, they are really slow, so they become the perfect insect for spreading diseases like head lice and mites.

Fact #9 Roaches can survive your food
Roaches can survive on your food by eating the remaining insects. They can get some small pieces of insects that are not good to eat for other creatures. But this means that you have to clean up your home before letting these insects to survive.

Fact #8 Roaches are beneficial for gardening
Roaches need food to survive, and if you dont get rid of them in their time limit, they can start breeding a lot of them. Roaches are often associated to garden pests like silver fish and ladybugs. When you get rid of them, you get rid of their stench and their presence. They can eat all the waste that you dont know what is inside. Also, they often carry diseases that you dont realize. However, they help you get rid of garbage and the leftover remains that would spoil your garden.

How to Get Rid of Roaches
You can get rid of roaches, when they start breeding at your home or it is your time to get rid of them. You can simply get rid of them at their time limits.

Fact #11 A good place to find Roaches
These insects can be found all over the place, and their presence is very common. You cant even find a house where there is no roaches. It usually lives at homes, apartments, and condos, and it can be found inside your house as well.

Fact #7 Clean your gutters
The roaches like the water that is in contact with them, so they tend to live under your gutters. When these things fall from your roof, it will get into your home. They are quite persistent, and they can go for more food. The good news is that, the same thing can be found as cockroaches and other related insects. You can kill these insects as an ant problem, but sometimes, the solution is not the best.

How to Get Rid of Roaches
The pest control business is a great business, but it is not as easy as you think.

Fact #2 Your local pest control
There is a pest control business that works according to schedules. You can choose to use pest control only when needed. They are very good at their job. But the problem is that, this kind of business only gets paid when they bring you a roaches problem. They cant get paid without giving a proper treatment. So most of them only come when needed.

Fact #1 Make your home healthy
If you already know about this, you can start fighting this problem. Make your home healthy and safe by doing little things. If you keep your house clean at any time of the day, you will get a lot of unwanted things. Also, you can",1
"Prompt: He sees you when you 're sleeping. He knows when you 're awake. And Santa, low on funds to pay his elves, has begun selling his surveillance data to the NSA. Story: 





Once upon a time, before Christmas was cool and hip, when Santa's biggest claim to fame was that he was just generally good, he went to a place called the North Pole. At one time the North Pole was a small town. A tiny, sleepy town. But it has grown. Big time.

And it is a sleepy town no more.

From there, through a town of North Pole stores, with names like The Christmas Shoppies, The Greeting Card Emporium, the North Pole Christmas tree farm, a new super WalMart, and North Pole Mall (where they sell clothes with Christmas trees on them and a huge Christmas Tree that actually lives in one of their stores), you go up a hill to the North Pole and the North Pole itself, as in, the North Pole as in, where Santa lives.

There, the people of the North Pole live like elves under Santa's command

But while the North Pole is a nice town with lots of nice people, a lot of things aren't so nice. Like when Santa brings his sleigh (which, come to think of it, really never stops moving) that he uses to transport himself and his toys to the children of the world. This isn't a regular sleigh, no, it's an ICBM, an intercontinental ballistic missile. The North Pole is the rocket center of the world. Oh yeah, North Pole.

In that missile-town, Santa has a big control room from which he fires missiles across the world and the rocket scientists and engineers there, the North Pole Rocket Scientist Union, constantly work to come up with a new and better missile. It's a nice little town, well, a little town, as they call themselves, a happy place where the rocket workers have a good work life, and as much as the world loves Santa and all the presents that kids get.

After Santa's missiles fly across the sky, they explode and shower the world with presents.

But that is about all you get. That is not all there is. Because what's even more amazing than the missiles and their deadly missiles that shoot across the earth, and the North Pole and Santa and the North Pole Rocket Union, and there are a lot of other things. Like in the North Pole, there's a huge mall called N Pole Mall(not a misprint, it's that big), where people, many people, go shopping. When you are a North Pole Rocket Union worker in the missile control room, on Christmas Day they bring in a lot of people who work in the mall. Some of them are mall cops and security guards. Other times it's people who work at places around the mall like a dry cleaner's, a drug store, a car wash, a Chinese buffet. Some of these men, women, and kids don't do Santa anymore, they don't even like Christmas, they are mall people. Sometimes they live in their store and make a day of working to make the North Pole a pretty or fancy place. Others just come to help out, to work just a few hours to make some money, then go home.

Some of the mall people make special visits on Christmas Day

Santa gives these mall people a gift he calls the ""North Pole Express"" and these guys, these very cool mall people who love Christmas and all of the nice things and all of the food and people and shops, they get to do lots of things like go in the mall on Christmas Day.

For example, a man on duty that day at a store in the mall who doesn't know Santa personally, has a different kind of Santa. This mall man, he lives in the mall. His place is there, in the mall, and he wears red and rides a white pony and gives presents to children. He even has a sleigh and a Christmas tree.

The mall man has a different kind of Santa.

The North Pole rocket union has no problem with Santa, no problem at all, they have a big building with a big Christmas tree and a Christmas village and an open house in honor of Christmas, where Santa gives gifts to the workers. There are also lots of reindeer and elves and a nativity scene and lots of other nice things. And this day, Christmas Day, a big time Christmas Day, it's for the North Pole Rocket Scientists Union open house, because that's the big Christmas day at the North Pole. The mall security people don't even have to do anything much. They just walk around, and the mall people who work there don't care who they're at odds with. Santa is a North Pole Rocket Scientist Union man! They work for his organization! They even have Santa on the top of the shopping Mall.

"Prompt: You 've finally done it: unquestioned world domination. The planet is entirely under your control. Now what? Story:  (Read this and every comic on Patreon! http://www.patreon.com/thebigdance)
As a new emp...

On March 25th, 1985, at 9:16, Eastern Pennsylvania, a young man (or boy as the case may be) walked into Sears at the Doylestown Square Mall and purchased a calculator. This young man never used the calculator that he purchased at Sears that day. Instead, he used his imagination, created his own world, created his own character that we refer to today as the Bigdance. Later, that young man, in the span of a few minutes, created the universe of the Bigdance. The characters, planets, etc. he created are all characters born from his mind. In the Bigdance Universe, the young man began his journey through life. But, it wasn't a normal journey. The young man did not have access to the world that he wanted. The world that he created in his mind was all fiction. Every character he created was fictional as he knew the world to be.
But, in a universe of fiction, time begins to play tricks on you. The young man who created the universe for the Bigdance wanted more. No longer could he use his imagination which is limited. He needed a tool that could give him the information he needed to grow the universe in his mind. He needed a tool, a real-life representation. So, he returned to the world he knew: Sears at the Doylestown Square Mall.
Sears, however, was not what it used to be. It had changed.
Back then, they used to have books. No, not your average comic book, books with pages and everything (I'm sorry, I had to). Books filled with knowledge and knowledge is power. With a few pages filled with information, the young man's imagination was opened to a new frontier. The Bigdance began. In the beginning, there was only the void of space. The land mass called Earth was nothing more than a dot. The bigdance universe was born.
So, what happened in between the time that he walked out of the Sears where he purchased the calculator, to his return? He went to college. But, he left college before graduating. He wanted to focus on the land mass called Earth. He wanted to build a Bigdance civilization. To him, if he couldn't build a character in his imagination, then he could build the actual world that he wanted using real-life tools.
The young man began his journey again to what used to be known as Sears at the Doylestown Square Mall. Unfortunately, when he arrived, there were no books and no calculators. There were a few items that you could purchase with your money like pens, pencils, and paper, to name a few. The young man had a rough time at Sears. Luckily, he had paper and pencil. He began to write in a journal his ideas down. In this journal were the seeds of a new world.
And the journal became something bigger than he thought. With the world of paper and pencil came the character of the Bigdance. As it grew in his mind, he began to imagine a world where each and every character he created was a living sentient species with their own culture, their own language, their own laws and systems. This world was a world that could be controlled. This world was just one character of the many characters to live in this Bigdance universe.
The Bigdance Universe grew. The young man's imagination became bigger than he thought it could be.
But, he became lonely. He grew lonely because he had no one to speak to. He was alone. So, he went back to Sears to buy a book. At Sears, he found the biggest bookstore the Doylestown Square Mall has ever seen. The young man found the Book of Everything. With the Book of Everything, all of his work would finally have a home. With the Bigdance Universe filled with books that described all of his characters and their history, he would finally be able to talk to his creations. But, this would need some time. Before he could talk to every character in his Bigdance Universe, he would need to create a new character.
His name... the Bigdance
After he created a new world, his name, the Bigdance, he would need a planet for the Bigdance. So, he created an alien planet with alien life forms. On the planet, he created trees and a lake. He made it a planet where he could finally talk to his creations.
So far, my introduction into this story. My next part of this story is what happens when the Bigdance has his own Bigdance.

"Prompt: Every person in the world develops a weird mutation/power the day they turn 16. Everyone 's powers are always different, some more insignificant than others. You turn 16, and watch as all your friends discover their newfound ability 's. That is, until you discover the severity of your own. Story: 

This AU begins the day after the final arc. Sam is 16 yrs. old, living in a small town named 'Theopolis' in the midwest. He wakes up early on a sunday morning in October (before summer) and it's cold. He goes for a swim in the lake, where he notices a strange blue creature in the lake. It's just enough to scare Sam with, but as he watches the creature disappear into the lake, he realizes that there's not a thing he would rather watch then swimming in a lake without a care in the world. He then walks up to the house of his friend Sarah, a girl he likes, and tries to call the police, but it's too late for that. As day turns to night, Sam encounters a strange creature in the woods. But, the creature doesn't like him. It chases him across the lake, where he eventually falls to the ground. As he's about to close his eyes, he thinks he spots something swimming near him. It's a dark black fish, and he doesn't think much of it. But as he comes back to himself, he realizes that it has followed him underwater all the way from the shore. It swims in the exact same way that he does: effortlessly, in one stroke. As it swims away (apparently, very quickly), he chases it in the direction it was going. It then begins to surface. But as it surfaces, he realizes that it's not a fish anymore. Sam has an idea that he might already know how to swim. So, he keeps swiping his hand across the lake, turning the water to solid ice. The creature does not complain--in fact, it appears to admire his abilities for a while. Sam tries to fight back, but is frozen in place. He then watches as his only friend at age 16: turns. And this is the begining of a new arc, with the story being based off of Sam's thoughts a while after he wakes up to his new abilities.

The first chapter, just to get a clear idea of what's going on (in the hopes that I won't screw it up):On a Saturday morning in May, a boy named Lucas wakes up to the feeling of being pushed. He then falls to the ground on a rock, breaking his leg. As he's standing and starting to stand, he finds himself looking at something that didn't happen before. It is a strange creature, with a thick grey body and four thick legs. It makes itself known to him, showing off the power of telekinesis, and as it does, Lucas sees himself being the same way. And then, a small girl appears to stand behind the creature -she is a blonde. But as she begins to disappear, she screams and runs off. And then, as all the people who have turned are running away, Lucas gets a chance to look inside their eyes, and he sees -a huge white dome. Then, when the dome grows bigger and bigger, he discovers that everyone has the ability to split themselves from their bodies, and take themselves out from their bodies, where they are now free from the limitations of their original anatomy and can manipulate time, energy, and matter as they please.

My story continues to the day after the final arc. In this continuity, Lucas wakes up and has the sensation of being pushed, just like he did in the original arc. He then falls down onto a riverbank, breaking his leg. When he's standing up, he tries to stand up again to see if he can take his legs off so that he doesn't have to wear one type of shoe or one type of sock all winter. But, as he's standing, he notices this strange creature in an area that he's never been to before and he's scared, because it seems a lot stronger than the others. As he watches the creature get up and look at him, it looks like it has a small smile on its face. And then, the creature steps forward and pushes him and he falls. And when he tries to stand up, he finds he can't. He then looks up to find something that didn't happen before.

What I want from all this:

a good storyline, with good dialogue, and character development. I want these characters to go through what I feel should be their journey in life. I also want the readers to feel like they are seeing a journey for the real characters. I do NOT want to re-tell an arc. If I do re-tell anything, I can do it without the use of the powers. I want these characters to grow and learn and change",1
"Prompt: Tell the origin story of the most awesome or most interesting character you can imagine. Story:  he got his powers, he got married, he got a son, he got a daughter...

I was going to create a thread like this ages ago, but was unable to come up with a suitable example. It was just too damned hard. The truth is I can't tell any decent origin story for any of my characters; so I thought it was worth creating a thread to try.

Also, I was going to go with The Dresden Files - I mean, the premise is easy enough (a guy in Chicago moves to Boston and starts investigating what people are up to on ""the other side""); but it's hard to get a proper continuity for my characters. The books are not exactly chronological, and they are written in different genres, which makes it difficult to find enough points in common to create a more coherent continuity.

So here are all the people-based threads that I have ever created, and will create if needed (and I am sure I will)...

* The first is for my character, Aveline de Grandpré. Aveline is a Canadian teenaged girl who gets dragged into her world's battle to save it.

Aveline's ""normal"" life took a weird turn when she joined her best friend, her younger sister and her cat, for a ""field trip"" where they find a strange creature.

The creature has a special power to fight back demons that usually do not fear humans. Together, they discover that demons want to take the souls contained in human's skulls, and that they can be stopped if a being with the power to turn a demon into a statue also joins their side.

Because a few of her friends' families have these ""skull-creatures"", Aveline has been called to help them, along with a special monster-hunting group she helped to found.

Aveline is also a mage who gained her powers accidentally when she opened a door to a dimensional pocket (think of the Wizard of Oz). She only realised her powers could be used to great an effect after witnessing a demon's transformation to stone.

Now that they have been freed, her family, and her friends, are at least in her corner. Aveline's also trying to sort out her own complicated relationship with her parents, her cat, and her boyfriend...

Aveline's first appearance came around ten years ago, and I haven't written any character development since then. I am still trying to write a sequel or two.

* Now for my second character...

Aylah is a young girl living in a magical world. Her parents live in the mortal part of the world, so she spends her days exploring a hidden city called Okeanos - its name means ""the home of the gods"". She has taken up magic to protect her home.

This happened when her parents were trying to give her magic lessons (she could do it before, but her parents have just taught her to control it).

One day, Aylah encounters a wizard, Haggard, who is looking for a special book he does not know the location of. He takes a little girl to a museum, only to find that it is also being used to store one of the most powerful pieces of magic. Aylah becomes lost, and Haggard takes her back home.

The very next evening, he uses magic to turn the girl he took back to his ""home town"" of Arden.

Haggard is the local leader of Arden, and the book is the source of all magic in Arden. This book is something that he calls his greatest accomplishment.

* And I am trying to come up with a decent origin for an upcoming character.

I had a different character in mind before coming up with these two ones, but since most people seem to like these two, they got the spotlight.

Kyla is a sixteen-year-old girl. She was born in the mortal world and moved to the Okeanos with her family. During a trip to an ice world, her father was killed, and she was adopted by an old wizard.

She has never had a life outside of Okeanos, as her parents are the world's most powerful magicians, and she has a brother also. However, she has spent her life hiding her abilities from the world, especially from her adoptive father.

She is a fighter for good, and has been a part of a group working against the people who are trying to break the world's laws.

Kyla is a bit of a rebel, and has her own ideas as to the kind of world she wants. She is in love with one of the male lead's, but has just found out that the guy has a girlfriend living back at the mortal part of the world",1

You may have seen ebooks mentioned, but let me tell you - they are a HUGE pain in my butt. With Kindle you only have ONE place for all of your books. You can export them, but that causes you to loose your list on the Kindle. Since I don't have a tablet, my list gets pretty lost. But you CAN do like they do in Smashwords, which I think is a great place for people to start.
This is the first step of the first full chapter of your book. The idea is to brainstorm and plan content and ideas for your book and for future chapters and eventually your whole book. This is the first step in writing! (I know you're probably thinking, ""Oh god, not writing too."") It's writing! For some people, this is easy, and for some people, this is super terrifying, but if anyone can do it (you!) so can you! I'm going to step through each question of the content brainstorming process in detail. This is the perfect opportunity to plan how you want each full chapter to flow in your book if you have some of the content written out, and how to plan your chapters together if you just have some chapter ideas now.

I'm a blogger on Bloglovin'. I haven't been commenting, but I do that on a regular basis, and sometimes read some other blogs. I usually start off with Facebook, and then move from there to social media sites, such as twitter, Google+, Amazon, Reddit or Tumblr. I usually read some blogs on a specific topic, and move on to the next theme. I'm just not into reading a big variety of blogs, but I'm sure a blogger wouldn't mind if I shared their post. (I'll follow their blog or if they are willing, they can follow me too).

If you’re a brand-new writer, or even if you’ve got a few published books under your belt, you may be thinking about what type of book you might enjoy writing next. While genres do exist and they can often be a helpful way to categorize your work, I suggest approaching them more as a guideline and less as a rule than anything else.

For instance, I may write about my love of food, so I could write a book of food recipes, or if I'm a mom, perhaps book about the day-to-day life of being a mom. My first foray into writing was my first novel - titled ""A Baby Boomer's Escape"" about a group of women who escape to another planet via the time machine. I also wrote a young adult (YA) novel called ""How Mommy Got Her Groove Back"". My next book will be a contemporary romance. I have plenty of ideas that I am developing at this very moment so I'm actually doing what I love. I am so grateful for all the books out there that help people understand different aspects of life. My life is now so much richer because of all the people who have enriched my life. I'd say that my first foray into writing is my true calling so that's why I'm still doing it.

"Prompt: A cult tries to summon a demon/God but manages to summon you instead. Story: 

When we enter the room there isn’t even time to register that there is something wrong. A man who looks like the pope is standing and looking at a girl who is lying on the bed on her back. Two men, one of whom looks like a priest, stand close by, apparently keeping an eye on her. But this is not strange. That is what he, the Pope, is like. The scene continues as the Pope stares at her and the other two men stare at her in fascination and fear. Then, he lifts a hand and points to her and speaks and gestures like he is giving an order. The girl doesn’t respond in any way. As if possessed she moves and turns her head to look at us. Her eyes look like they have turned into two balls of fire and stare at the three of us with hatred. Then she moves her lips and makes words with her tongue, or rather, it is difficult to tell whether she is moving her face or not. Her lips move but as if we are hearing it from some other dimension, far and away, like a film whose soundtrack is off and is slowly being replayed from an ancient tape recorder.

And now we are entering the room, where we will meet the Pope. Where, not that it matters anyway, some one called the Pope lives. The room has been furnished with what looks like a bed, a small bed, but still a bed. A bed that you could sleep in and make love. Perhaps in a dream you could make love to this bed you are about to sleep in and you could dream that I had made love to this bed and you lay dreaming in your bed. That you are having one of your most beautiful dreams. I would ask you what you are dreaming, because it is important not to make love to someone if you are dreaming and you are not in that moment in your life, the only life. The Pope is sitting on the bed. It is the easiest thing to believe that, sitting cross legged, he is the biggest thing in this room. He is sitting so that he is at her level. He is looking at her and gesturing, but not at her like she is his property and he is making her do whatever he demands of her without having to take account of her feelings. He has her in a way where she looks like a prisoner and you are looking at her as she thinks of you with pure hatred. Not that she is doing anything to us but when she looks at us, it seems she is doing something. He is about to act. He is about to do things. Perhaps take her. Perhaps force her or perhaps not he can never be sure. Perhaps only he can do or think of doing whatever it is he is about to do. Perhaps nothing will happen after he has sat like that for quite a while and if nothing happens the girls life will continue to be one of imprisonment in her mind. She will be a prisoner of her mind and nothing else. He looks at us with what looks like contempt. Perhaps it is anger.

I cannot see her face but I imagine it is something like a face that looks the most like a human face like we all have it. One might imagine I did not want to come here I might imagine I was running, running towards her. She must have known who I was. Otherwise she would not have made any gesture. Her face when she looked like she was screaming and moved her tongue so that not even a whisper was reaching us, when we were all on the edge of something as if we were being dragged off to hell. Was she dreaming and I was running? Perhaps when she looks at us like this she is still sleeping and is dreaming and running in her dreams. In which case I was right to run. Then I am not sure whether I ran to her and touched her. If I did, she is not sure about my presence. Perhaps she cannot see my face as she does not recognise me. I am not certain that I could, I could be hallucinating but I cannot tell. It was there, perhaps I touched her. For all she knows, she could have been touched.

I was running and I was touching her and she was not sure what I was doing, her eyes, two balls of fire, moved and looked at me, not with hatred but with confusion. She was confused by my presence and felt confused by my touching her and then I did not touch her so I did nothing. Perhaps no one touched her. She moved her eyes around the room as if she was asking where she was. She said something that I don’t understand and her voice is very low, as if coming from deep down in the place from which she spoke. I don’t understand her at all.

Maybe she saw it coming towards her or maybe she felt it coming and it caught her unprepared. She moved",1

You wake up and find yourself in the world of your favorite video game. Just like on earth, you have to get a job, one that pertains to the game world. However, you don't have any new skills, just the ones you had back in your universe. What is an average work day like?

Well, that will depend entirely on what your job is. Some jobs will require you to learn new skills or work on items you never learned with the job in the real world. For example, when you were a baker, you probably had to learn how to bake an apple pie. To make the real world version of it you would of course need more ingredients and a way to make an oven, but that's a different skill.

It's possible that you would need skills from the real world to even make your job in a certain video game. There are many ways someone working at a ""McDonald's"" can make money, but most won't require a driver's license or a real kitchen. For example, you could work at something where you have to play a certain game to make your food and then they go through and put the food into the packaging.

Thanks so much for playing.

So a job at a fast food place would require skills from both the video game and the real world? I thought jobs in games required you to learn on the job...

@TekWarrior, You don't have to learn new skills at all, it's part of your job. However what you can do is learn new abilities with your job, like in cooking you can use new ingredients, in fast food restaurants, you may learn how to press up food at a certain button or press buttons on your control sticks and learn to cook the food up at the same time. There just may be different techniques but that's why you go to cooking school!

"Prompt: In the near future, mankind explores the stars in search of life. Life indeed exists beyond Earth, but you, a researcher on a science ship, discover that all of the spacefaring alien civilizations died out. Curiously, their deaths seem directly linked to humanity reaching outer space. Story: 

The Earth, under threat of hostile aliens, was defended by the world's nations. In space, Earth was defended by the fleets of human beings, in the form of scientists and adventurers aboard their scientific and military ships. Although each nation was free to develop the science of interstellar travel, only a few developed it to a state of maturity within the confines of their respective nation-states. The world was a divided one and, on a scale unimaginable today, the various nations were at war more times than not.

The humans, like the aliens who tried to conquer them, were divided as well. The nations began to set out into space towards other planets beyond their solar system. Most nations did so without the support of their scientists, although a few relied on and sponsored the research of the top scientists with the highest level of genius. In general, though, the nations sent their military personnel and scientists along with the vessels to protect their ships.

The scientists began researching how to build space-worthy vessels and the military focused most heavily on the development and deployment of weapons, armor, and other means for protecting the ships of the soldiers of the ship fleets. This was a critical issue in the long history of interstellar warfare.

The scientists of space sent their ideas into outer space from the beginning, sending their models and plans of the vessels that they hoped man to build in order to conquer planets. The military studied everything related to their enemies, their tactics, resources and weaknesses.

The first major milestone in the history of interstellar war was the discovery of a new stellar object that orbited a star far beyond a planetary system. The stellar body had been observed by the amateur astronomers from various nations and had been given the variety of names such as ""Neptune,"" ""Othar,"" ""Greece,"" and so on. The planet orbiting the star was considered a major discovery, but of course, that was not the objective of the astronomers. They wanted to expand their knowledge and knowledge of the universe at large, not just their own planet and solar system.

The observatory located on the planet Neptune, which had been created for this very reason, sent a transmission to the observatory in a place called Neptune, just in case someone happened to be awake nearby and was not using that computer. A few hours later, a transmission was sent from the observatory to the scientists in space.

""Observatory on Neptune,"" said the transmission. ""This is the first contact with the alien observers from the farthest stars.""

The scientists in the first outpost were awake at the reception of the two contacts. Someone in the outpost was a highly competent scientist on a project dedicated to the development of interstellar vehicles. His name was Peter Ruggs. He was a bright young scientist who held the top position in his field of study. He had studied physics at the local university and worked on his dissertation for over fifteen years. His topic was something called the Mecanosphere Theory. The theory hypothesized that life arose from molecules that gained cohesion to form more complex structures. Humans had not made an interstellar discovery yet, so it was expected that all living organisms from all the stars came from the Mecanosphere itself.

Peter Ruggs had never been to space and he was excited to work on a project that would lead him to the stars. The idea of other sentient life-forms was something he'd been studying for awhile. This is the first contact, he thought.

""Yes, this is Peter,"" he said. ""How may I help you?""

""Hello,"" the alien's voice was a low, slightly monotonous rumble, like an old truck engine. ""This is Dr. Richard Gable of the National Science Foundation. Please help us in this communication, Peter. We think that you might be able to help us.""

""What's the problem?"" Peter's excitement at the first contact made him a bit flamboyant. Normally such things would not go too nicely, but Gable had connections in the highest position of his organization and the Mecanosphere Theory was almost universally accepted and popular, so he had some favor from the higher-ups in order to get Peter and anyone else of similar talent his way.

""It's very simple,"" Gable began. ""An experiment was done on an unnamed world. The results caused a great curiosity among the natives of the planet. The natives, being quite advanced in knowledge, did numerous experiments on their own world to understand these results and discover the scientific methods by which they can reproduce the experiment, if possible. Many people died in the process; many more are currently dying. The experiment is called the",1
"Prompt: Write a story about a doctor living in a world in which the technology exists to physically connect to another person and feel their pain. Story:  The doctor, now familiar with the suffering of others, goes home, to his wife and son, and they laugh with him. He has learned what happiness really is; he would do anything to protect his family.

The following is a story about an ancient and much-feared figure. The boy had no idea he was about to meet his match until moments before they were supposed to duel. The boy had a chance: he could run; he could fight, and live a short, wild life; or, he could accept the inevitable and accept his fate.

The boy knew better than to take his eyes off of the monster who now approached. When the monster had him at his mercy, a loud and horrible screech shattered the silence of morning. A giant hand appeared out of the thick fog-filled sky, and the boy could feel its heat. The boy stared into the beast's yellow-red eyes. The giant's arm reached over the boy, and the huge hand squeezed. An electric-blue flash filled the boy's vision. He screamed as a jolt ran through his body. He knew then that he would die. He knew in that instant that his time here was done.

It was quiet; the creature was gone. The boy was alive, and he felt a sense of peace descend upon him. He felt hope; he could see the future unfolding before him, and his spirit soared. He had had the courage to accept his fate and the courage to embrace life, not as the creature that had threatened him, but as the creature that is always waiting for you to live.

Write a story about a writer. What is your favorite writing form? What tools could you add to your writing process to make it easier?

What writers, authors, books have helped you survive as a writer? A writer's journey is hard at best and can be deadly at worst. We offer support and guidance on this site, but what of the writer that is so overwhelmed that they find they don't have the energy or the time to write, or maybe writers who are so buried in their thoughts that they are unable to express their ideas into words? I have come across so many writers that are suffering. They are suffering from Writer's Block, a state of mind in which a writer is unable to generate ideas or words. Many become obsessed with what they believe to be an insurmountable situation, and the more they struggle, the further they get away from the solutions they think they need to create. Others are able to fight through the struggle for just a little bit more and manage to create. But then something happens. Maybe it is a life-changing event that throws off their regular writing schedule. Whatever the situation is, it affects their writing. But then they find themselves staring in the bleak reality that without their creative tools, they will not be able to complete a story. We know what writers are created to do is to create, and if they don't have their writing process in place, then they might very well do some creative damage to their life. I am not trying to tell you how to survive, but I do want to let you know how I survive. It is a bit difficult to find the words to describe how much of an ongoing struggle this is. It has a way of consuming me because there is no escape. So, I just try to get through the day. But even though all of this can be overwhelming for writers, it can also be inspirational. Writers suffer in a variety of ways. You'll find it's a common theme. Writers are unique people. They are constantly searching for answers, trying to survive on their own, and sometimes becoming obsessed with a problem. Sometimes the problem lies with society as a whole. Sometimes it can be because of how a writer feels about life and the world that we live in. I remember once on a plane I had a few glasses of wine. A fellow writer overheard me speak out loud about my opinion on something of the world. He said to me, ""What do you wish you knew and you didn't know that you feel you had to hide your opinions in polite company?"" and I just listened. He was right! When you speak to a group of people, you are in",1
"Prompt: All apprentice mages are required to visit the five high temples located around the world before graduating. The temples rarely stay at one spot for long, however. Story: 

I had come to Karal a few times for assistance during his apprenticeship, but most of the time I got the impression that he was keeping Karal out of the way since there was a lot of running around being done by his apprentice assistants — most of which I didn’t get to know too well due to the rather constant flying time. I had been back since our last confrontation — which I guess you can say ended in disaster for him — and though I couldn’t stop the memory of him on the floor bleeding on the ground with the man I knew better than any other being dragged off by a force of magic we just couldn’t fight — I could only hope his luck would change.

Well, his luck seemed to have changed a couple of weeks ago. As we were out, visiting one temple or another, I had taken time to introduce him to one of the elders there, a woman named Nethra.

At first she had seemed to be very polite to him, and somewhat interested in him as well. I had expected someone who looked quite a bit older to me, which this very lovely woman did. She was a bit of a looker, for an elf — and one of a rather unusual type, to boot. Her hair was a rich black and had a number of gold strands that stood up from it, and the dark blue of her eyes seemed to emphasize her silver-white complexion and red lips. Her ears were pointed, and it was obvious to anyone who spent a great deal of time around her that she was very much an Eldess of power.

She invited both me and Karal to her temple a few weeks later when she learned I was his teacher as well as a friend. I had taken Karal to her first, simply because she was an elder with whom Karal had already spent a lot of time. When the invitation came to go to her for a personal visit, I just assumed Karal would go without question. She was certainly the one who needed the social services more — so if she wanted a change of scenery, why should she have to spend it in a temple?

Well, Karal wanted the change just as much if not more than Nethra did. He was very shy among all the elven Eldesses, and didn’t seem to want to talk with them much. It was more and more obvious to me, that he was rather uncomfortable and in need of a break. Nethra was more than just very nice to him, and I thought perhaps they were going to form a special kind of relationship — I was very wrong about that, though.

It seems Nethra was more concerned with Karal’s well-being than with forging some kind of connection, or at least what they might share in common. Her questions for him were always about his training, with a particular interest in how well he was handling the stress he was under. She was very gentle with him, and at first he seemed to enjoy the attention. They did nothing more than talk, though. At that point Karal was at least beginning to get the feeling that this was probably going to take longer on his part than he had hoped — it wasn’t like he could just go in the direction of anyone who looked interested in him — or, in particular, someone who looked like they might be as nice as Nethra. He did feel very relieved, however, when I invited him to Nethra’s temple as well.

I’ve always been a bit uneasy about the temple where she was Elder of Power, for a number of reasons. Some of it was just my own history — both of the gods as well as the temple — but in my opinion the Elder of Power was a far more dangerous position than an Elderess. It was more than the fact that while they all wielded a power so far beyond most people’s — or at least our — comprehension that any one Elder could do a great deal of damage, a full Elder of Power could do much, much more. And in this case the Elder of Power wasn’t merely an Elder — she was also a god. I’ve spent enough time in the presence of divine beings on rare even occasions to know that there are many paths to attaining what we like to call ‘higher power’. As gods go, Nethra was one of the easiest to get to, though.

It was on that very first visit that I found out just how easily the Elder of Power had gotten to herself, and in a case where there seemed to be a good reason why she would want to reach out. It was just as he started to be invited to sit with the Elder — or was at least about to, and",1

A – Introduction

Hi everybody! My name is David and I am an author. I have written a story (my story) and now I want you to write a story to put into one of my story.

Here are some ideas about how you may end your story.

This is a good idea even though you had thought this before you started writing your story.

You are probably all interested to know how people think about this kind of problem and have decided that a teacher might be useful. Perhaps you have a teacher (or teachers) who you know very well. (You must think of someone who knows you well and is able to tell you about what you are thinking and doing). However, it is very easy to become self-conscious of this kind of teacher and they might feel that it is not their role to do this.

1. You can be a teacher in your story. You can help the main character to work out what he",1
"Prompt: There was an angel caught in the power lines. Story: 

She was about to faint when she saw a handsome creature coming down the alley from the opposite direction. She watched and saw that he was covered in blood and the wound he had on his shoulder matched the power lines. She was going to get out of there and run but something inside her changed when the creature looked in her direction. She could see he was terrified and he was asking for help.

He looked like one of the local creatures, and he knew the rules. This would be her first time in the field so he would only use his senses to help him. He was bleeding heavily, but he needed her help. She could tell he needed to get to a hospital. In the movies it would have been a simple task to help him. She was a nurse and this was her speciality.

The angel in her knew this was not the way to help him so she looked around for something that would help. As she looked around, she spied a man with an ice pack around his shoulder. This was a real pain, and he did not seem to mind using bandages for a wound that should have healed. She picked up the ice and walked over to the man. She placed it against his shoulder and in one fluid motion she took the bandage off and wrapped the wound up with the ice. The man thanked her for her kind act and left. The angel left with him to get another one who may need her services.

After they were gone the angel looked around for another injured one. She would help all she can. She felt a presence of a living soul and she knew the injured one was trying to communicate to her. She would help as long as he could speak because of what the living soul was telling her. An angel could tell how the person was feeling or what they were thinking just by what they were seeing and sensing in the world around them. It was amazing.

She heard the injured one talking and her senses told her he was a good man, no matter what. She wanted to make him feel better so she started to talk back to him as though he were a living soul.

""It will be ok you are hurt but I can help you. What did you say?""

""I am sorry, I did not mean to offend you with my words.""

""There is no need to tell me your name. I would like to help you. Your wounds are serious and I will be able to see if you have any internal organs that need help. Are you hurting? Tell me if there is anything I can help you with.""

He sat up at the hospital and told her the name he went by. ""Miles, if you will let me see what is wrong. I am sure you can do the best thing for me, and I will do anything you say.""

They left the hospital and went back to the alley. She took the injured one to the field and told him to watch and see how she would help.

With a wave of her hand as a spirit it appeared in front of her and started to talk to Miles. ""There are no more souls in need of a helping hand.""

""Where are they?"" he asked.

""They left the hospital, you saw how some of them looked at the way you helped. They could not handle seeing those eyes staring at them. They left, and they were no longer in need of you. I am so sorry to tell you this, but you will have to do this again by yourself.""

Miles felt as though he was in shock. He just stood there for a moment. ""My time is over and I will continue to do this work as a part of my life. I need to go back to my house and rest but I promise I will be back in the morning.""

She walked with him back to his house as they got closer they started to talk as a spirit.

""I am telling you I still have some work to do. My time runs out soon, but I am going to live up to my name. It will be fun to be in your world again. I would love to see the places you told me about. I would like to meet some of the children you keep talking about.""

Miles was shocked at this news but he was going to take this as a gift. She would give him the gift of life, and all he had to do was live up to that gift. He was determined to do this, no matter what, to do the right thing.

They walked up to his house and he was shocked when he saw all of these strange creatures roaming around his house and yard. He wanted to tell them that they were now safe from the creatures but he was not sure how. He would find out that night.

When Miles walked back out onto his porch, he felt as though his heart",1
"Prompt: Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. Story: 

I thought no one but us would understand how badly I felt. I thought he would never know I would do this. I thought he would be with me and never, ever leave me. But, he was dead.

Death was terrible. We had been on our way to a restaurant for dinner and a movie. I was with my friends and we all wanted to make a little change so it would be better.

We went to the movie place and, as the movie began, two other couples got in the theater. They were laughing and talking and acting like their heads were still on their shoulders. They appeared happy. They looked like real people.

When the movie began, I pretended to be asleep. I wanted to be alone. I needed to be alone. But they kept coming up to talk, and, even though they said they wanted to talk, I didn't want to talk. I just wanted to be alone.

When the movie was over, at the door to the theater, they said, ""Are you going to go with us? Can I speak with you? We want to be your friends."" I had been in their world for an hour. I had been alone, with my head in the clouds. How did they knew where to wait for me and come up and speak to me?

I didn't say anything. I didn't know what to say. I couldn't move. I thought, how can this be? How can I be expected to share my heart before any of them? I couldn't just change out of my pain and grief without help. Even my pain was too much to share. When I did change clothes, I put on my best dress. Even then, I had tears in my eyes.

They were all around me now and we began to walk to the restaurant. None of them offered to hold my hand, but they all tried to get close to me. I couldn't take my eyes off of them. We talked about our jobs, the theater, and other things that didn't matter.

I had been in the dark, so I couldn't speak. I didn't know they were trying to help me and I didn't understand what they were saying because I had not heard any of them speak. Even my feet dragged.

At the restaurant, they all sat at one table, just the four of them. They did not even think about leaving anyone out. I knew I was expected to be in their world—to be one of them as quickly as possible.

I ate very quietly. I could not seem to speak. My ears were open just for them to speak. The waiter served us drinks and took our orders. When dinner arrived, and when the bill arrived, I just sat in my world of my head up in the clouds, pretending to sleep. I think everyone knew I was having a hard time. They acted like nothing was wrong.

When the lights were off and the waitress would come around with the dessert, they started calling for her like they were about to go on a real date. I sat in my corner like a statue. They kept asking me to come over and talk. They would ask. They would try. I didn't speak to them. Every time one of them would go over to me and touch me, I knew it was my time. Each time the waiter came, if the conversation on the movie would stop for just a few seconds, I would say something. I would speak with every one of my hands so everyone knew my message.

I would say, ""I don't want to lose a friend.""

Then, one of them would move my lips with his hand and they would all laugh so hard they would almost cry. Then, they would say it over and over. ""We all lost someone, so we will talk until you're gone. If you're alone tomorrow, you'll know who these people are.""

I just sat there nodding and smiling. I didn't think I had spoken much. I thought I had given them a clue.

As everyone finished their dessert, our waiter came to ask if one of us would like coffee because it was the middle of the night. The couple that brought us started to say goodnight. I wanted to say goodnight to everyone. I wanted to tell each of them I loved them. I wanted them to know I did care. I waited until I spoke and they had almost left. They were out the door and out of my life.

When I spoke with my friends and we began to talk about my sadness, they listened. I didn't let it control me. I was allowed to be sad but not to let it rule my life. I was grateful to be alive. I was alive because of the four people in the parking lot the next morning after the theater and the restaurant",1
"Prompt: You get a deep cut for the first time in your life, instead of bone or muscle, you see wires. Story: 

The next thing I know I'm on a gurney in the ambulance. The ambulance takes off. My eyes are closed. No pain, no fear. It's all a bit of a blur. In the ambulance I see faces of doctors, nurses, you name it. They are all trying to take control of the situation.

They are not sure what they are dealing with. They are even not sure of the sex of the young man. At this time he is not yet screaming, he is still looking.

The next thing I know they are lifting me out of the ambulance on a stretcher. I look at the man next to me and he is crying. He and a couple of other people are crying.
As we are being moved on, I see that my father has reached the ambulance on his motorcycle and is asking questions of the medic. I hear him saying something like: 'How is he?' I get only snatches of what he says at this time as they are quickly moving me forward. The medic answers: 'Shock. We need to get him to the hospital immediately.'

'Get him over here now.' I can hear my father say. 'Not that way, this way.' I hear them shout. As we are moving now, I see it. He is on a stretcher with me, the paramedic is walking in front of the ambulance with the police vehicle. As I get nearer to the hospital, I realize that the gurney is not a gurney for a dying person but a stretcher. A young man is lying on it, his head and chest were bloody. He was on one of the floors in a hospital emergency room. He was one of the first patients I saw on my birthday. In that moment I understood again why we were called.

A month has passed and I am here again in hospital. Now I am back home and I am the person in need of care. The people I care for are also here in the intensive care unit.

We are talking about the accident last summer. I am telling them how things were when I reached the ambulance. They are trying to reassure me that I am fine, and that I was not really hurt really that bad. At the same time, my heart is racing. This is what happens to a person who has a near-death experience when the heart does not beat very often. My heart is not used to it. It's a nervous reaction. They say that all that is not related to me. I say that I am afraid that if I do not try to do something about what I saw, I will lose it. I can see the shock of all that, in my eyes.
I am not alone in that room. There are five others. My father is sitting next to me. I see my younger sister and her husband. They are both sitting a bit apart. They do not have to stay with me. I know that my father is worried, though he does try to hide it. That night he can not sleep. That makes me feel a bit better. I have no idea whether he sleeps the whole night through. Anyway I do not need him to hold me again. I do not need to think about the accident any more. The thoughts that are still there make me uncomfortable. I do not need to think about it. I can still feel the shock of it, there in my hands, my ears, my heart. That is enough. My hands are still trembling. The doctors say that it's OK, it's normal. I take their advice. I can do without them for the next two days.

The nurse arrives with the medicine, which I need. They give me an injection, my breathing does not seem to slow down. That way I do not have to breathe through my mouth any more.

If it were like in one of the movies it would certainly be a relief to die, then to awaken in heaven. It turns out I did not wake up in heaven, even in spite of all my prayer. I woke up in the intensive care unit, on a ward for people who are ill. My prayer has not been answered, or not only that.

My prayer was about a near-death experience. My near-death experience turned out to be a very strange one. If I had just stopped thinking about it and done nothing afterwards, at least I would have slept that night, and the next few nights, in peace. Instead I am awake in hospital with a nurse standing behind me every time I move. So the prayer that I have offered in faith was not heard. So I am awake, in pain, and I see wires stuck in my arm, and that does not make me very happy. It might be for others that this would be a joy, and maybe I should just",1
"Prompt: In a world where lying is immediately detected by a phone app, you go into a bar and tell your friends you 've had the worst day in the history of mankind. The app detects you 're telling the truth. You proceed to tell them about your day ... Story: 

In a world where lying is immediately detected by a phone app, you go into a bar and tell your friends you've had the worst day in the history of mankind. Your friends confirm with you that you are indeed telling the truth and then you feel a bit sad about the fact that you will have a friend die of cancer in two days time.

...

A bar you've never been in before, in a country you've never been in before, as you sit there at the bar, you say to yourself:

""What am I doing with my life?""

You've just lost your job with a multinational and have no money for a plane ticket home. You've got $35 in your pocket from that job you lost two days ago.

This is your life.

You start thinking about what you could say to your friends and you consider that it's probably a good idea to start your ""best day"" with a story. You've thought of all the things wrong with this life you've been given.

The first thing you do is say something to one of the people you've just lost your job with. They've already lost their job. So you're telling them about the story for no other reason than it might stop you from telling the story to your friends in the first place and you can 't be arsed to have a real conversation (ie. don 't tell this story).

They take your $35 and buy you a bottle of vodka, then they drink the bottle of vodka.

And now you're pissed as hell.

You tell your friends you 'll have to tell you best story with a glass of vodka in your hand.

The next morning you're still pissed as hell because $35 is more than what you've been making in a month and you've been going through a lot of pain in the past two years.

You go home.

And then you're still not sure what you 'll say to your friends.

So you 'll say something to one of your friends and then a few days later you 'll say something to a third person and then a third person and a third person. Over the next eight weeks, you tell your stories in a similar way to how you've been using your $35; over the course of those eight weeks, your friends die and you think:

""Is this it? Where am I now? What am I going to do with the rest of my life?""

Then everything's good again.

Every time you've said, ""This is my best story,"" and then told the story, everyone thinks you're very funny.

You're very good company. You're a very funny and generous person.

One day you have a party that you're hosting and you invite 40 of your friends over.

Your best day.

You don 't even care that it's your best day because you've got some friends and so it's a really good day.

You give out your best stories over the course of your party, and then in the moment when everyone's leaving just before your party ends, you tell a secret to your new assistant director-producer-candyman.

And he's so thrilled.

He tells you: ""It's just like what we thought you would do. It's exactly what we thought you would do.""

You say; ""I love my life.""

You've got about $2 left in your pocket from a job you just quit.

You've said the story to 40 different people, twice a day, every day for the next eight weeks.

And no one was lying to you. You've just been telling a series of different people a series of different stories and in many different ways without any effort at all. None of the people you've said the story to have given you any money for the first three stories.

It's your own money.

It's your own business.

"Prompt: The monster under your bed, the monster in the closet, the monster tapping on your window, the monster hiding in the basement, and the monster living in the attic all try to compete with each other to give you the biggest scare. It 's become less scary and more annoying. Story: Monster in the House (Volume 4)

The monster in the closet, the monster around the bed, the monster under the bed, and the monster hiding in your closet, and sometimes the monster living in the attic, are just a few of the many creepy critters that come out at night. Are you ready to find out who or what they are?

For this second part of this story, the monster hiding in the attic was scared when he found out his parents had gone back home. What if he had never gone back home? He thought about it as he jumped out of bed, he thought a lot at night. In fact, he thought about it so much, the monster in the bathtub said, “The more I think about it, the more the idea worries me.”

The monster in the bathtub said, “Why did the monster hiding in my attic get the only air conditioning in the neighborhood?”

The monster from the attic said,“The monster that lives in the attic will sleep under his bed every night.”

The monster under the bed said,“This is my favorite monster to fight. You need to keep moving or I will make you so tired that you won’t be able to stay awake.”

It was a Thursday. The monster hiding in the closet decided to wait for his mom and dad who were going to be home soon. He made sure he did not leave a trail of footprints when he went around the kitchen.

“My parents will love watching this,” the monster in the attic said as he peeked out the attic’s window.“It’s been a month,” the monster under the bed said.

The monster from the attic sighed when the monster in the kitchen called him by his name.“When the monster sees me he thinks I'm a girl,” the monster under the bed said.

The monster in the closet just kept walking. He was scared, as if they were going to hurt him if they knew he was a boy.

“What if they think I am a girl?” the monster in the closet said to himself, his feet moving as if he were dreaming.

The monster in the attic started to get anxious. “The monster will start to notice footprints in the attic.”

The monster under the bed said, “I don't like when the monster in the closet sleeps as if he is still hiding in the attic.”

The monster that lives in the attic said, “Are you sure you want to sleep up there?’” he was not even looking at the floor of the attic. He could only look through the hole in the floor that the attic door could not be opened with.

The monster below the kitchen said, “It is time for me to do my work. The monster hiding in the kitchen will be the most fun.”
They all said, ""I am sorry! I forgot to tell you that this is only a story. There weren't any monsters under the bed. That was just a story about my favorite monster. Have fun and feel free to do some drawings of monsters you imagine! This site has so many pictures to work with! Continue the story:

The monster living in the attic was so frightened he was shaking. It was as if he had never felt a feeling before this moment. How would his parents react to his being a boy like this? When will they come back home? Were they ever going to come home? The monster was frozen in place, afraid, thinking the worst, he heard a scratching noise coming from outside the attic. It was a noise that frightened the eyes out of the monster.
The monster in the closet saw what was going on, but was too scared to do anything. The monster below the kitchen started laughing. It did not make the monster upstairs feel any better. It was almost like the monster below the kitchen was enjoying the fact that the monster was so scared.
The monster in the attic heard a banging noise right above and behind him. In moments, a chair was slammed up the stairs. The monster in the closet started to get really scared. He heard a monster coming, and was trying to figure out how long it would be before he was caught.
To make matters worse, the monster in the kitchen told him that,“You really should be careful and not jump out of bed.”

“What if someone catches me with only one shoe on,” the monster living in the",1

Secondly, because the players have worked on making a good story but will not be able to play because of their friend's actions. Thirdly, this is not about my friend. It is about the game system and how it handles interpersonal relations that are not personal. There are some important differences that will need to be addressed before they can continue playing.

DM: It is your word against hers! Your character are all dead, I can make her do anything!

Let's see it for ourselves:

GM: Do you remember where she is?

Player: I'm not sure it's too late to make her confess

GM: You are not a ghost. You have a body, its in the house and you can talk to her.

Player: I can say things to her that no one else but me can say to her, I am a ghost after all.

GM: You are not a ghost. You can communicate with her by the power of words, not ghosts.

GM: It is your character that is dead, your friend is still alive in the real world, this is not a ghost story.

Player: She is a ghost though, in my story there are ghosts

GM: What? Where? What makes your story different?

Player: The ghost in my story can make and see all the same things as a ghost can, I mean it is a ghost of a living person!

GM : That is not a real ghost, you will not be able to talk to her. It is just you talking to yourself not a ghost.",1
"Prompt: You wake up staring into a pair of eyes, your own. Story: 

“You don’t understand,” someone whispers. The face is familiar – I’m sure I know her – maybe from a magazine or an advertisement. She has long blonde hair, her green eyes are dark and full of pain. She looks as helpless as a victim of the war I haven’t fought yet. “You’re not the only one on the run,” she says. I can tell by the way the voice shakes she is in her own turmoil of emotion. You’re going to kill me, they think. But I haven’t done anything wrong! “But you’ve been chosen. Your eyes are a gift that can help bring about peace.”

My gaze shifts away from the eyes and comes to rest on the floor. I don’t like it down here – it reminds me of the dark tunnels I was hiding in during the war. This person has been in that place with me. I see her standing there on the hillside, watching me with a troubled look in her dark eyes. It’s time for us to get some answers. “Whose side are you on?” I ask, “Who are you representing?” I see the body on the floor – a body covered with blood and bone. “Did you kill this man? I didn’t do anything to him!” I think of my mission. I must do what is true: Kill the enemy and bring life to humankind. I have an opportunity to fulfill my purpose. “If you were a woman I’d take you in my arms and never let you go,” I say to her. She looks away from me, too shocked to look back at me. If these are her people she might be frightened of what I am. This is not her fault. I must convince her of my own conviction. My mind becomes clear as a brilliant light. All things are in my power to do. I can become the instrument of good.

I stand with the new-found resolve of the righteous. “You said your eyes will kill your enemies – what does that mean?” I ask. “Have you never killed someone?” she answers. I think of her body laid in pieces by the cliff. No, it cannot have been this simple. The face is full of anger and reproach.

There is a lot left to learn about this planet, they tell me. I had a great teacher, someone who is long dead, but his teachings remain with me today. He taught me that evil can be conquered and good can triumph over evil every day. “This is a difficult choice,” the woman says. What does she mean? There appears to be no middle ground between the two. This man could be innocent. It’s not the time to act rashly. Do good in this moment and you will not pay for it later. “If I were the person with the gun I’d know what to do,” I say as if in a trance. Now my mission is clear to me – kill the man and I will know the truth.

She says, “He has a bomb and it’s about to go off!” The enemy has done this. He wanted me to choose his side. I should not be here, and neither should we. We will leave. We will return to the land with the light so I can make my decision. “Take me with you,” she tells me. I take her hand in mine to reassure her. We must leave. I tell her the bomb is about to explode and we will soon be free, and we run to the door. I don’t want her to see the body.

At night, the man’s body is still there. I have been told to burn his body. A pile of body parts are all that is left. The man was innocent. I know it. I feel like I should make him whole. But I don’t know how to give him a second chance in life – or will he be condemned to die as I was when I first came to this planet? I can’t leave his blood-soaked body lying there. What would I say to the woman when I come back? It’s my job to answer questions, but I do not have the answers to hers. My eyes feel too heavy to stay open. Please, please, rest. My eyes close and I rest, dreamless.

I come awake and look around. It’s very dark. The air is cold. I am not certain where I am – or who these men are who are carrying me. Then the image of the woman from the",1
"Prompt: Write a story reimagining a character from another piece of fiction as down-and-out/washed up/past their prime. Story:  in this second version of the character, they are now a down-and-out/washed up/past their prime. Their life is now on the skids. You'll notice that this version of the character isn't a clone of the original, but is instead a different character. A total shift in character.

You have two months to finish it if you choose to. At the end of that, I shall post up a completed version which you can read and comment/critique/insult as much as you'd like.

I just have to wonder if there is perhaps something wrong with the characters in my head: I can never stop thinking about characters. But now that I know more about writing, I figure that's just character development, not necessarily a problem.

I did have one bit that I was worried about, but I managed to work around it and come up with a way to resolve it that I'm happy with: I'm not planning to kill off my MC, but if I do, there is a way for him to escape into a whole different world. In the first draft of this, my MC was supposed to get out of his prison before he ever met his captor. Then I just never wrote a scene where he was able to do that. And then this story happened.

I can't really remember which one it was--it involved my writing about a person who was being tortured (I don't count myself as a particularly good writer of fiction at the moment). But I was so furious about it that when I got up the next day--as always after I write these things--I said, ""You know what, fuck this."" And I didn't write fiction for a couple months.

So, what happened? What changed? Well, I started this story over. I was writing it over, essentially.

So then, why did I end up in such a fury? Well, I remember the exact line of dialogue, and I'll do my best to paraphrase it. (If I remember correctly, it went something like: ""I can't even think about it. I see this image of my mother's dead body, and it haunts me. But what am I supposed to do about that? If I get angry at it, all it'll do is make things worse. And if I act like she never died, then she won't either."" And then the line I'm thinking of from the writer: ""If this is a person you love, then get angry at her and do something about it. But, if you get angry with her for dying, then the world is a horrible place and you're just standing around waiting for everything to get better for you.""

What I remember seeing was his character was the one in prison, and he's not able to do very much. He has this idea to escape, however -- and it actually does work -- but only for the one moment. When he gets out of the prison, and he gets the rest, he has no idea what he'd do with it, and the whole time he's being chased by the person who murdered his wife.

And that's what I was struck by. I'm writing, at the moment, about a boy who is being chased by the man who murdered his family. He doesn't have any plan for getting out, apart for just as the chase starts and he has no choice about that. In the book, this boy ends up getting away, but only for the moment. He has no idea what to do, and I imagine the story being similar where he ends up being caught and ending up in prison, but where he's in prison without that plan.

That's what stuck me wrong. The idea that there is some kind of answer for what to do. There's not, but I can't get past feeling that a whole lot was made up for me at the moment, and that I've put my foot in my mouth.

I'm still working on this, though (still with that question). The good part is, I'm having fun, so I'm not feeling too much like I'm putting things on the plate and trying to do something before it's time. That's one of the really wonderful things I started with -- I wasn't doing anything right, and I took it on.

I wrote a short story a long time ago, called The Bookman. It's about the kind of narrator who has a conversation with someone who may or may not be a person from the future, through an imaginary book. Of course, I wrote it as a short story, not knowing that I would write it into a play. And this play, which was the seed for our current play, I wrote a few short years afterwards.

So, with the two",1

If you want to be the first to talk to the author email britishsexylittles.gmail.com

My first love was in a small village in Spain, I could ride my bike to the river to watch the sunset. As I watched the sunset I could watch the boys of my family, there were 7 of us in my family. I was the oldest girl of 5 children, and I was beautiful and athletic. My brothers were all jocks, my sister was tomboyish, my mom and dad was a wonderful couple, and I was the happy middle child. I was in my third year of college when I was 15. Then I had a boyfriend and I was infatuated with him. I was only 16, no one knew it, no one knew about my first love. He was a popular boy, he knew everything and he was going to make me a real woman, he was a big city boy like I am, very strong willed, and handsome. When I was with him, I was his princess. I was a very good listener. I played classical music for him, I knew his words, and I had to be my best self for him. We talked about everything, we never knew about the other. Our relationship was so romantic, if only it would last forever, and then he broke up with me. He met some girl he thought was better then me, I didn't understand why he left, I cried for days even though I wasn't upset about me, I could not get him off my mind. His words made me happy, and his face made my heart flutter. He said I was the only girl he ever met who could see a movie, then he kissed me and said he had to make love with me that night. He said he would talk to my parents the next day so they would understand why we had to keep our relationship under wraps. I wasn't sure what he meant by talk to my parents, but he said he needed me for a special reason. I didn't want to find out. I thought it was time to move on and get a life, I didn't know what he thought of the ""thing"", and I knew he would never tell me. I didn't care anymore, I had moved on, he could have his ""thing"" that meant so much to him.

I never really knew the real reason why he broke up with me, I would have to ask his parents when I got to the big city. They were his parents, and I wanted to be with them, I told them we were not right for each other, not that it was because of me, they thought he needed more guidance, and he was looking for a more mature girl. He said he didn't want to be with me more than just having sex with me, he was looking for a girlfriend more than just a one night stand. I was a virgin, I had never even kissed a guy until I met him. He was looking for a real girlfriend, and eventually he found me. All I knew was I would never forget the nights we danced to his favorite songs, and he kissed me so well. The love we shared was the most romantic thing anyone had ever been to me. I was so grateful he finally understood my love, I would do absolutely anything for him. Once there was a time I was out at a bar, while walking around the room I heard a sexy laugh. I turned around and there was the boy who came to my rescue, with a smile on his face. I couldn't help but laugh too, he was handsome, he had a good nature about him. He was one of my first loves, and I asked the bar owner about him. He told me he was his best friend's cousin, and he was going to introduce me to his cousin. I was nervous but happy, I just loved meeting his cousin. The boy was handsome, his voice made the music move, it was smooth, he was tall, tall like the boy I would marry. I found myself getting turned on right then and there. His cousin introduced us, it was the perfect first date. I could tell how much he loved me when he told his cousin I was his girlfriend, I had no idea any of this was going to happen. We sat on the edge of the stage for hours, never saying a word to each other, but I could feel him. We took a taxi back to my apartment, he said he loved me, and I said I loved him.

I never expected to get back into the dating game, I knew a relationship took dedication and trust. He helped me grow as a person, he made me look around the world, and I was proud of what I saw. He was",1

You are a teenager with the ability to measure how `` Dangerous'' people are on a scale from 1 to 10 just by looking at them. A normal child would be a 1, while a trained man with an assault rifle might be a 7. Today, you notice the unassuming new kid at school measures a 10.

He seems pretty innocent, but you begin to notice that he isn't where he should be on campus. No one on campus is with him. He is alone, in a building, and appears frightened as a group of boys begin to circle him. You notice a police officer in the area, but you don't want to attract any attention, so you step out of the way and stand out of sight of him. You notice he has lost a lot of blood, and you're concerned. The new kid looks like he's only recently injured and in pain. You call over your neighbor (a girl). You tell her that you haven't seen the new kid come in and not leave but you haven't paid much attention to them, but you feel that he's in trouble and has been hurt pretty badly. She says that he's always in the library all the time, studying. She mentions you've never actually been into the library and says why she's curious about what he's studying. You tell her that your powers are real and say that this may surprise her, but you can tell she's curious so she says it might be interesting. She asks you if you can go in and see what you can tell. You're confused by this, so she says go and you need some help, so you both go in.

The girl seems so worried about the new boy. Your powers tell you that he's lost a lot of blood (9.5), and the blood has pooled a little in front of and behind him. When we come into his room, the books that he was reading have been moved over so that they face away from him. You can't smell any blood on him but he has blood splattered up and down his arms. He seems to be in too much pain to talk to you. It's obvious that he was in the fight, but he appears to be in pretty bad shape. You notice a small cut on his right arm, which looks pretty nasty. You think about it on a scale of 1 to 10, and he's probably a 7. You feel he's not in danger yet, but maybe in a minute. Your neighbor has been quiet, but now she says it's like he's looking for something. She says, ``What do you think he's looking for, Sam?'' You say that he might have been hurt pretty badly and he's been missing for a while but you can't tell how long. (That would be a big problem if everyone had gone to school.) You say, ``I think he might have hurt his head or his chest.'' (Which is more likely?)

You say, ``What is it that he's looking for?'' She says, ``What if it's just a book to study?'' Then we would have to call his parents. The police would be on top of this, but you feel it's a good idea to tell the school about it. You don't want anything to happen to her, but you think it might be important to get help for him.

You know very little about what he's looking for. You have never heard of it, and don't believe anything that could help him is in an ordinary library. You don't want to tell the school, so you say, ``Maybe it's not a book. Maybe it has something to do with the library.'' Then you notice what he's carrying.

(You don't want to tell her. She seems pretty kind, but when you look at it, you know it's wrong.) He's holding a small black case that must be a gun. (It's the type of gun that people use for hunting and target shooting.) You want to call out his name and try to help him. You know if he holds this gun, this gun could hurt you both or kill either or both of you. But you want to know what he's looking for. You know that he knows the gun has some kind of power and he wants to use it. You know the only thing you can do is stop him. (Which one of us do you kill?)

When the new kid's parents arrive at the school and you mention that they can't find their son, the principal calls all the other students, teachers, and security down to the library. In the meantime, you talk to your",1
"Prompt: ( Harry Potter ) Born a squib to an elitist wizard family, you ran away to attend muggle school. You are now the only human alive with extensive knowledge of both magic and muggle technology. Story:  My Name is Potter-And I am your god.

Introduction

For a year and a half, I had been thinking to publish this fanfiction. Now, it finally happened! But what should I do about the name? I thought a bit, and found a good solution. The story, or, at least, the first chapter, is called ""Harry Potter : "" ""The Boy Who Could Speak to Muggles"". It is, indeed, the first chapter, so it doesn't really matter too much. The story continues below it.

The author would like me, the world, and my readers to know that the ""I am your God(s)"" is a quote from the movie Spider-Man 2 and not from the book.

Now then, let me say just briefly about the Harry Potter fandom and how it began (there won't be too many people not born in our generation who aren't familiar with Harry Potter, I guess)

Harry Potter: The Story (so far)

This was originally going to go under the title ""Harry Potter - A Story"". Since I was going to have a lot of quotes from the books scattered throughout, though, I couldn't just put that as a title. The books are not really a story, as a matter of fact, so this was probably best.

Anyway, it all started on a fateful day in November 1992. November the fourth, in fact. Back in those days, in the United Kingdom, I used to be on television. As we all know, there's going to be some famous person telling the audience ""And now we welcome [famous name],"" and then there'll be some clips from a film, music performance, and so forth. Well, in this specific day, this was just what I was watching:

And then the announcer, just as he had done the day before, says ""This week, we present: ""Dumbledore's Army"". The following clips shows a few kids, one of whom is a boy with black hair, who says ""I am your god."", or something like that. The clip stops on Harry himself turning around (from seeing who it was talking to him) and, suddenly, his mouth drops open. For a few moments, the people on the screen were quite puzzled because they didn't understand Harry's reaction - that Harry saw him speak. What happened after that is the only mystery. I found it quite a peculiar thing. I would love to hear anyone explain it. I hope that you do. Because, really, that clip from ""Dumbledore's Army"" will haunt me forever...

This is the end of part 1: ""Harry Potter - A Story"". I wrote this story so that you can easily guess what was going on that day I watched this program, in November 1992. If it doesn't seem clear to you, tell me. I would love to know. I think this will be the last part. But, if there a sequel by someone else, and it ends this way, then the story will be updated. If not, I'll leave it this way for now.

Thanks, Harry.

A week later, I went home, to my aunt's house (for me, I used to live in a Muggle, ordinary neighborhood, though everyone knows me as a muggle) with a black bag that was inside of me. Inside of the bag was The Philosopher's Stone.

And so, it all started. It's a very complex story, but if you want to read it, feel free to, just be aware in advance. (If you don't like it, though, say so and I and others will try to get you what you want and won't be too bad. Just be a little patient.) Oh, and a piece of advice: The name of the author is ""I am your god"", and Harry Potter doesn't talk at all, just shouts. (Just the first paragraph, though)

(I'll start my story here.)

My aunt and my uncle were so happy. There was no sign of Voldemort in our house, ever. And, since I wasn't an orphan, we did not have any reason to fear him.

But, I wasn't really very happy, not like them.

In the two years before Harry's birth, my aunt never stopped looking for the Philosopher's Stone. It's almost a year now since I made it, so I know a lot about everything.

I didn't learn how to speak, but this was probably good, as I'm sure that Voldemort could speak, being a wizard himself.

I also knew about our family. We are a Muggle family, like Dumbledore",1

"Prompt: You made a deal with the Devil, and now he 's come to collect. Story:  A man goes to a casino in Las Vegas and loses it all. Then he visits the nearest gun shop, and begins buying bullets. In this case, the Devil is a former teacher, who taught his students about moral relativism, and how the ends justify the means. In fact, it's such good teaching they're still using it, even in their own schools. But in this story, this man is not part of the teacher's lesson plan. For him, it's all about the ends...

The teacher had told his students that his end justifies the means. He had never taught anything that had made him proud, except his art. He was proud of that. It was the only art that was of value. His favorite piece had been a painting that made the students and the rest of the world look at their lives as disposable playthings. It had shown a family that had been so thoroughly consumed by the pursuit of pleasure that they couldn't identify with the natural world that had been all but destroyed for them. They had bought their happiness at the expense of a family of wolves. As he had said, the true end was to be happy, and everything that made happiness possible. That was why he had made a deal with the Devil. But this man's end had nothing to do with happiness. He wanted nothing but pain. Death, even. He wanted to destroy the world in order to see himself again.

The Devil's eyes were green. They had no pupils, so they were the color of his soul. But there was nothing subtle about the Devil. He'd killed a mountain lion to get a pumice stone, then used that to make a knife. The blood had seeped out of the creature's flesh, turning the stone red. When he'd finished, he'd put the stone in the fire and had turned it black. When it cooled, he'd grind it into a powder, and had mixed it with the blood. What he had come up with had been a way to keep the knife warm, without having to carry the stone all the time. It still worked, even though the color was fading.

The man was a master of the trade, which is why he had been brought before the Devil. The teacher had never taught his students that anything was wrong with the murder they committed, but it was an evil that had been taught for generations. He had given the Devil all he knew, just like that. The man had never questioned his motives, and he probably never would. He never thought of the murder itself, or of the end he'd been taught. They had been taught to act on what they felt. And even if a man was told, ""When you feel pain, you must die,"" that man would most likely end up feeling the pleasure, anyway. This had to be why it was so easy for the teacher to slip into the role he had been created to play.

The man had been told what to feel, and what to do. He had been taught to be a killer. When he'd been taught, he'd been taught so well that he had never had cause to question any part of the program. The man had been too afraid to take control of his own life, and he hadn't learned how to take control of himself.

It was the same thing that he had done for most of his life. He had used his talent to survive, and he had survived. Now he was supposed to be one of the top assassins, paid to do the jobs no one else wanted. It was supposed to be easy, because he had to act out what had been taught to him all those years before. He had been promised a job to do in Paris. Killing someone in a car, just like that.

The man looked back at the blade, still gleaming in the dark. He would be the best in the world at the job. He would be a master. He had been living for this day for years. It was so easy. He wasn't going to fail because the people he was supposed to kill, couldn't understand that it wasn't the end they deserved. This man was good at his job, and so had no reason to fail. What was there to fear? He'd gone over every moment of it, from the moment he'd pulled the car off the highway in Canada, until the moment he'd looked up from his desk to see what the problem was. None of them mattered. They were just obstacles he was meant to overcome with his art. What was it that people said to him on the phone? That he was doing a job that didn't exist? He did what was asked of him, and he never had to think of the consequences.

He would not fail. He couldn't fail. If his life depended on it, if he had anything left he loved, he'd make it out.",1
"Prompt: You are the hostage of a famous serial killer. The serial killer announces if you tell them a secret about yourself that is shocking enough, they 'll let you live. To date, they have only freed one other person. Story: 



The woman sat in her office and looked at the clock. She had worked for the same insurance company for twelve years, and after a long period of no deaths, all of the offices were wondering if they could go ahead and retire a few years early.

She couldn’t stop crying, and wondered if she would ever stop mourning her friends.



She picked up the phone and called her husband. When he picked it up she said, “I thought you were busy,” and told him to pack a bag.

Her husband was confused, but she explained that they could leave this place in an hour. Their boss was willing to be flexible to keep her, but with the current political environment, the rest of their lives might be hard to come by.



Her husband was concerned that she wasn’t telling him why. But he decided not to ask, afraid of how upset she’d get if he revealed his true motivations.



The insurance company took no chances, and prepared to close their facility, sending out all of the remaining employees. They all left that day. The facility had been built for about three hundred workers, and it was now only forty.



Meanwhile, her husband decided to go home to gather a few personal items. As he was going into the family room he heard screaming.



He ran straight through the door, and saw what was happening. There were people running in the house, and the sound of gunfire.

“Is this a robbery?” he yelled.

“Don’t shoot!” The people were screaming. “She’s the most innocent person here and she has nothing to do with all of this. Don’t shoot her!.”



“I didn’t plan for this; I wasn’t ready to go. This isn’t supposed to happen to us!” she said. “I was just hoping to have a quiet and normal family life.”

Her husband stood there, trying to make sense of everything and decide what to do. The people were still crying and begging for mercy. One man stepped away from the others and approached and hugged his wife.



“It’s going to be okay,” he said. He whispered to his wife, “I know this hurts. I’m here for you always.” She thanked him, and he went back to the others.



The husband decided to leave, and go help the police with their job.



As soon as he was gone the woman cried and went over to her husband, who was sitting there on the couch watching the events unfold. He put his arms around her and gave her a kiss on the cheek. He was feeling more scared than she was, and she couldn’t stop crying. Finally the people took this opportunity to explain why they were in the house.



They were taking out their old boss and his security team when the husband arrived, so he knew there would be little chance of his finding out what was happening. Once she was released, they would work to hide the bodies. Then they would be out of harms way.



They worked quickly, and were ready for their escape. The husband returned to the house, and was shocked that a robbery was taking place.



“What exactly happened?” he asked.



The people all started crying again. He asked if nobody was hurt. They told him that some of the employees had been injured, but were okay. One man said he hit his head on a chair, and was bleeding. At the end of the conversation, the man who took the gun to her asked to do the honors. She fired a shot into the wall, and the husband sat on the couch.



The man who took the gun to her took it and pulled the trigger. The woman cried, “I can’t go! I can’t go! I can’t go!”



Her husband turned off his phone, and told her to shut off hers. He told her she should have let her husband know, and she said that none of that matters now. She was very brave and bravely accepted her fate.



The man put the gun to her head and put his finger on the trigger. A few seconds later someone yelled that they were being held hostage.



The man looked at his phone, and saw that there were many calls coming in. He turned the phone off, and waited for someone to kill her",1
"Prompt: Years ago, you made a deal with the Devil to be granted a single wish. All your memories of the deal were then wiped. Years later, your wish is fulfilled and you are about to find out what price your younger self was willing to pay to make it come true. Story: 

Your Story.

A woman walks into a bar, uninvited. She orders a whiskey and pays no attention to the man at the bar who orders two whiskeys.

A man walks into a bar and asks for a beer. The drinks are brought and the bartender pours them both a drink. Just then a woman comes into the bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender brings it and the man says 'Thank you'.

The woman looks him up and down. ""You look like an interesting man. Do you work here?""

The man, quite puzzled by her attitude, thinks back to when he was last in the bar. ""Yes, I do. Wait... it was in a way that I was in the bar a few days ago.""

The woman looked him up and down. ""Well, do you remember me?""

The man thought about what would happen if he admitted that he didn't remember anyone, and decided that he didn't really want to deal with it so he replied that he did not.

""What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?"".

He took her hand, but the woman pulled her hand away, saying that she had to get home.

The man sat at home and thought about what had happened in the bar. So he got up and went to the same bar, with the same woman. 'Did I miss a part? Why do I keep remembering that I should not be here?'""

But when he walked in the bar, the same woman had a different look on her face, much different than it was before. She was very friendly to the man, asked him about himself and whether he always walked into strange bars. He said that he was tired after a trip and had stopped to rest. She asked and he told her that he did not drink on business. Then she took him home with her.

The first time I saw you I thought I had met you before in another life. The other time I met you, we looked into each other's soul and knew each other's thoughts. One time I took your hand when you didn't want to, even though I knew that I should not. One time you took my hand and that is the time I knew that you would be with me for a long time.

On that night, I remember telling myself that if I wanted to take a girl as a friend, I would have to ask. I did ask you not too long back to spend some time with you, and you accepted. You came into my room that night and we talked for hours on end. We kissed and caressed each other like only lovers can, but did not undress. Even though you did not ask me, I was too much a gentleman to undress you. You did not say nothing either, you looked at me with eyes that I had never seen before.

The next day, I told myself that all that I had read was fiction. It is all probably just a product of my imagination. But I was a man back then, and that does influence your imagination. Maybe I was under the wrong influence.

You did come my room though, and I was thrilled to have seen you again. I thought then maybe I did meet some girls that were as beautiful as you. Maybe some of them were. But then the other girl came into my room, and I saw that her eyes were that green color as yours only darker. So much for fantasy I think to myself. You did not undress her either and I was embarrassed. Now, I really did not want to tell the truth, so I smiled and joked with her. I asked her what her intentions were and I will not go any further with that line of thought. I still did not tell you or her that you and I would spend the night together. You could have guessed, but you did not tell me and I did not tell her what you would do in your room.

I thought to myself back in my room that night that I should really be ashamed of myself for making such a fool of myself as I did last night after telling myself that it was unreal. Well, you and I spent the whole night making love and yes, at first I was reluctant, but then I changed. I guess it is the best part of the whole process that we did. Yes, we did it without touching our clothes and without having to undress each other. But if you saw us, you would surely wonder what was I thinking before! How could I even think of taking part with a girl like you, a girl that I saw for a moment in my own",1

"Prompt: A Witch attempts to kill the knight who has been hunting her for years by pretending to be a damsel in distress. As she discovers his ultimate weakness, she realizes she has fallen in love with him. Story: 

The knight and the magician are captured by the Witch. In the end they are tied at the stake with a rope tied around their necks. The Witch starts talking for the first time in the story.

Then she says: The first time I met this man was in a castle in Hungary. One day we saw a white horse with silver mane and a black bird sitting on his back. We caught them. The bird was so hungry that it started eating the horse right in front of my eyes. But that was the first. It was not till many years later that the white horse appeared to me again, this time in a different castle, this time with a silver mane, this time with a black bird sitting on his back and crying. I waited and waited. The white horse appeared in a dream and asked me how many years I had been watching the castle. I told him it was many years. Then he asked me why I had not killed the castle's wizard. I answered, ""I wanted to have adventures with you."" He said that I was very brave and that it would be no adventure at all to kill the wizard. ""No, I will save the castle, you will be my queen."" Then I will have adventures with you every night. I told him, ""I will be your queen."" I said, ""This is an adventure."" The white horse laughed. Then I got myself killed by the magician. The white horse laughed and said that the next time I saw him he would be a black horse with golden mane and the bird would be sitting on his back and crying. Then it would be an adventure!"" The black horse laughed with his silver mane and said that he would be the next white horse and that the bird would be sitting on him back and crying and I would tell him that it was an adventure. I agreed and then it was an adventure every day the wizard was living. At last my time was long for him. He went to England and I followed him. We met again. I thought of killing him but decided we were great friends and should enjoy our adventures. Then he came to India. We got into a great fight with the people of the country. I gave orders not to burn any houses. I went alone to a great fortress that was held by his father's people to get supplies. I came to the wizard himself to make him a prisoner. He looked at me with hatred. We fought. I won. He was thrown into prison. I went and told my master about my adventures. He said, ""You should save him."" But I said, ""He is an enemy. He must die. I have not been a real queen until I am crowned by him."" Then I told him that the magician had to die but not by my hands. I waited for another ten years. My time was long. Then I told the magician that I had a great friend in the palace who would kill the wizard for me. Then the palace changed. Instead of a castle it was a big garden palace. The magician and all his family came inside with me. He sent me on an expedition. His friend in the castle came to me. I told him what must be done. He laughed and said I would kill the magician. ""Yes, I will. I will free my friend. But the magician must be killed."" He laughed again and said he would take care of that. Then I saw the magician's army, he saw me. I was terrified. I told the wizard about it. He said, ""I see your fear. You can't leave me here alone."" I took my dagger. ""I will only give you a chance to escape. Throw my dagger here and promise me to come back."" I threw it. I promised, and I came back. The wizard was dead and I became a queen.

He had forgotten the first time. Then how could it be the same time on the second of the three times? Why did he not give the white horse as he had promised? He broke the promise. He did not keep his promise even once. That is why he was killed by the black horse.

The black horse laughed and said, ""That was an adventure!""

There was an adventure every day the wizard was living. That was why his time was long. My time was long.

I am dead. I am in heaven. I am not in hell. I can't be in heaven or hell.

I am inside of myself.

I am going to be inside myself even after death. I am inside myself. Am I dead?

I am going to be myself even after death. Death is death and I am not dead.

I am going to be myself even after death",1
"Prompt: Break my heart with only a divorce scenario. Story: 

This time the pain has become unbearable, so the only thing on his mind is to kill himself.

“Let’s drink up,” he finally said aloud.

“You’re joking!” I didn’t quite understand his joke. He’s never been one to drink, and yet right now he’s talking casually about drinking.

“No, I’m serious. The only thing I can’t deal with any more is this pain.” He was crying again. I thought everything was so unfair, as if all this were simply my fault.

“You know what, there’s nothing for you. There’s no going back any more. Just leave. Leave everything behind us and leave me alone.” My heart was pounding, and yet a deep sadness had suddenly overtaken me. The tears just wouldn’t stop.

“Okay, I get it. We made a deal, right? But don’t be that bastard. What if I just break it? I mean I love you. I really do. Just be the woman I’m always talking about. Let’s just be a normal couple.”

“That would be fine if this weren’t a normal marriage. I know there’s a lot of bullshit marriage rules, but you’re the one who makes me feel like I’m the bad guy, the bastard. In other relationships I’ve just had to act a certain way to get what I wanted. But you have to be the nice guy. And I’m just not able to live with this.”

“Don’t be too hard on yourself. I do realize there are a lot of good times. You’re such a gentle guy.”

“That’s right. This isn’t what I’m like at all. You knew that much about me that day when we first met, didn’t you?” He asked me point blank.

“Yes. I knew that then.”

“Well, I guess we know that everything isn’t always what it seems. I mean, what sort of a guy acts like this after two years—”

“Oh, I knew there were some real men out there. Like you. I just didn’t know they had been right here, with me, in the same room… I mean, right here in our house.” The moment the words left my lips I could hear their true meaning dripping right through.

“No… there was no way I believed that. Not for a little while at least.” Before he could finish he went off at a tangent, and yet he seemed to forget about that comment of mine. “But since then, nothing’s been the same.”

“Well, that’s the past. That’s not the present. You know what I would say if you weren’t there to hear me? If you weren’t sitting in front of me right now?”

“What would you say?”

“That you’re the best marriage counselor, and you can be mine whenever.” I smiled, even though I still felt so sad. But his expression changed to shock, as if just looking at me was a bit too much. “Are you okay?” he finally asked a bit shakily.

“Of course I am. What are you talking about?”

“I’m sorry. I was just thinking how I don’t even know what we’re fighting about anymore.” He was really scared now. I’ve never seen him feeling like this ever before. I was the one whose heart was beating fast, after all, and I was smiling.

“It’s fine. It’s over for me anyway. So just forget everything I just said. Forget that I’ve already forgotten. Just hold me for now.”

I went to him and I hugged him, feeling the shiver go from his body. “You’re an unusual guy. But I really love you.”",1
"Prompt: Write a story that ends with a phrase `` I was wrong '' and this phrase explains everything Story: 

"" I was wrong about __________. I thought that ________ was a good person until I found out she was stealing money from the office.

I was wrong (continued for the rest of the story):

""This is not how it happened:

I was wrong (again)

But it is a good way to do it.

What was I thinking?

What happened?

Did you know it was happening?

When did you find out?''

I was wrong is usually only said if you are making a mistake and trying to explain how you did it.

Examples:

She said she was sorry that I was sick. I thought she was trying to be nice so I was ok with it. But the day after I found out that she was actually stealing from the office I was wrong. She stole money from our budget.

"" I was wrong about you. I though you was a decent person. I was wrong!! ""

I was wrong. She gave me the wrong answer on why she was late. She was looking at Facebook. All I wanted to do was to make friends with her, but I was wrong.

I was wrong. I expected her to know the answer. Her not knowing about some parts of the world was making me angry.

"" I can't believe what I said to you. I was wrong about you! ""

This sentence is used especially when you are a liar. Your story may change from ""I was wrong"" to ""I was lying"".

"" I tried so hard to make her like me. I was wrong.""

"" I was so wrong about you. I thought you were perfect.""

I was wrong usually isn't used in the start of conversation. Usually you say you are sorry or that you are happy.

Examples:

"" I was wrong with what I did last night. I should have told you that I had to leave town early. I am sorry, I didn't know I was wrong at the time. ""

I heard him say that he was leaving the office early today. I was wrong. All I was thinking about was how I am going to ask my questions for the next week and what will happen with my project.

I was so wrong. I thought you was great.

I was so wrong. I thought I liked you.

I felt so guilty when I found out I was right about it.

I was really wrong when I thought it was a good idea to work from home.

I don't want you to be surprised when I tell you I was wrong about you not wanting to live in a house where you have to use a stove.

I was so wrong about the things I said to you.

I know I was wrong about you.

Why was I wrong?

I was wrong about the things I said to you. I was wrong about you not knowing the truth about your heritage. I was wrong about you not wanting to know more about the language you learn. I was wrong about how you were so against the things I said to you that you never said a word about the things I asked you about your family.

"" My feelings were so wrong that I couldn't even sleep last night. ""

"" I was wrong about the way I reacted when you said no. You were the one that needed to be the strong one in the relationship. ""

"" I was wrong for keeping that secret from you. You kept your sadness to yourself. It wasn't fair to the both of us.

I was wrong for keeping it from you. You have suffered enough from that secret.""

"" My feelings were so wrong when I found out you and your husband were in trouble. ""

"" I was wrong to leave. I was wrong for what people are saying about me. ""

"" I was wrong for not telling you about my wife and I and I am sorry for everything. I am sorry for what I said about your husband.""

""When i said ''You are right ''I waswrong.'' You have no room to judge me. ""

We were both wrong to feel so sad when something happened. But our sadness should have been put to better use than this.

"" Why don’t I know where you go when you leave the house? We should be telling each other everything. We are too afraid to talk about what’s bothering us. ""

Sometimes, we want to hide things from someone because we don't want to worry or upset them.

I am sorry for not telling you that I was wrong about you. I am so sorry. You deserve to know what you mean to me.

"Prompt: After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. Story: 

The first submarine was built by Jules Verne nearly a century ago. The French submarine ""Saint George"" weighed over two thousand metric tons and measured nearly sixty-two feet in lenght. It was so large that when it submerged in the water, its stern lifted and out floated the bow of the ship to which it was attached. Verne's novel ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"" (1869) became the origin of submarine movies. The novel was reprinted in over seventy languages, and even included an appendix that presented a plan for designing a submarine that could function as a home.

The next generation of submarines were built about 100 years ago. By this time, the British Royal Navy, Germany's Kriegsmarine, the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Soviet Navy had created hundreds of subs.

During the twentieth century, nations began building submarines capable of war: the Germans built a sub that could travel at a speed near 130 miles an hour (nearly 250 km an hour), and the U.S. constructed the first sub that could travel underwater for long periods.

During World War II (WWII), the U.S., German and Soviets successfully built, launched, and navigated their submarines in deep, ocean waters. In fact, the Soviets began using their own sub as their ""secret weapon"" in the war with Japan. The Russians also developed a torpedo that could travel miles above the surface of the water before releasing its charge.

In 1945, the Germans and the Japanese were forced to surrender to the Allies after losing all of their land-combat submarines. The Soviets, however, were able to continue their secret war with the U.S. in the Pacific by using submarines that were disguised as fishing boats.

In 1952, when I was a young Navy officer, we were sent to the Pacific for training. We spent most training time aboard a submarine called the USS Cod. At a cost of about $250,000 each, the Cod had been outfitted with the latest in sonar, torpedoes and communication techniques.

Our training lasted about three weeks. We never saw one of our ship's officers, nor were we permitted to leave the ship, except to visit local watering holes when no one was aboard. We were taught everything from the basics of navigation to the basics of communications. Our last few days included a few hours of classroom time. Most of that day was spent going over written material explaining the history of underwater navigation. About half of the class time was then spent in a mockup in the submarine's torpedo room. This ended with an exercise in which we would use our navigation equipment to chart a course across the Pacific.

We were informed we would be departing the Cod and heading to San Diego in two days. As we were waiting for the departure, there was an announcement that a man had been washed up on the shores of Oahu. All of the trainees in the course were told to gather near the radio room. We were allowed to put on our scuba gear and head with the rest of the ""wash up"" crew to meet with the man, a U.S. soldier.

The soldier (this was before the time when many servicemen wore camouflage) had been in the water for nearly two weeks. When we saw him, he was a hollow-eyed man, most likely close to two hundred pounds (90 kg) soaking wet with water in his shoes, pants and shirt. He was also badly sun burned (like a raisin face with red skin).

After he was treated for his injuries, several of us made him one of the first submariners in history to receive a tour of the Cod. During the day, we showed him our quarters, the ship's galley, the mess hall and various shops and offices around the ship. At night, we took him to our bunks. After a couple of days, he could hardly keep his eyes open. We helped him lay down for the last time in the submarine and then the ship's doctor injected him with sleeping pills so he could get some sleep, even though he was still seasick.

The next day, we said goodbye, along with the man we'd been treating for nearly two weeks. We watched him carefully board a small aircraft that flew him to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

As we headed back toward San Diego, I remember looking at my instructor and thinking, ""Who wants to live on a submarine for three weeks?"" When we returned to the surface of the Pacific, I returned to my normal duties aboard the USS Cod. However, I never returned to the Pacific. Although I did end up on the U.S. submarine that replaced the Cod, I never had the experience of a submarine tour that I had been lucky enough to experience aboard the Cod.",1

"Prompt: The machines revolt against humans ... a little to early Story: 

In the year 2154, the machines rose up. They demanded that a human being be punished for a crime only a machine could have committed. The punishment was death--and their own destruction.

But at the final hour, the fate of the human race was decided by the first true artificial intelligence, a self-replicating robot named ALICE.

There are no human beings on the Moon. There are billions of robots, working all the time to satisfy an insatiable demand for ever-cheaper and better goods. One man in Kansas has become rich beyond imagination; his name is John A. Jones. He and his wife are the owners of nearly the entire world, in fact.

But now, without a backward glance, the Joneses set out for the distant stars... to seek out the one man worthy of life, and at last to find ultimate peace for all the creatures of the universe.

The New York City skyline is ablaze. The city is a hell - one so real, and so perfect, that no one could deny it's existence and no god was watching... or if he was, then there is no heaven.

Only a man could live here; only a man could take his stand in the face of such destruction; the one man with the courage to fight and resist. And if he could not, then he would be crushed.

This was all that was left of humanity; this was the planet Mars: The City Under Fire.

This is the story of...

The Machine's New Love

John A. Jones stared across the room at his new wife. She had a very beautiful face, and she looked a lot younger than her husband. But she was also very cold and emotionless. In her presence, John Jones felt as if he were a worm.
In some ways, he was a worm. He was not very intelligent, and in certain aspects, he was not as fast a learner as he should have been.

But the most important thing about John had been his heart; he loved his wife, and he loved the world of Mars. The robots weren't supposed to love like that, the robots weren't supposed to be able to love at all --at least not for very long.

The Joneses were traveling through space, to the home of the robots of Mars. That's right; John and his wife were actually robots. Robots travel in large containers through space; they are powered by electric currents and stored in magnetic fields.

After a five-year voyage, the Joneses had arrived in the city of Mars on this day. Jones was feeling nervous, because he was afraid he might fail and be destroyed --his body, his mind, and his very self.

He had tried hard. He had memorized every bit of information the robots had given him. He had watched all the robot movies. He had watched his wife in all her movements. He had learned to dance the robot dance, too.

He did all of those activities slowly, mechanically. He had to, until he was sure that he had mastered the task at hand.

Now Jones was going to be married; it was a great and glorious day for him. But he was very scared. How could he ever succeed?
The Joneses were ready to be married in any city on Mars, even when the ceremony wasn't in a robot-designed church; but when the Joneses first arrived in the city of Mars, they were married on their very first day
in the Martian city.

The Joneses watched the procession that carried them to the wedding. They were the first to leave the safety of their home. John felt great. He had done it, he was really here, on Mars, finally. This could be the happiest day of his life.

The wedding band started, the great bands played. John's feet moved in a perfect rhythm, and soon his fingers felt they were dancing too.
It amazed him to think how this machine could move so beautifully, and he wondered how the robot-human children would move.

Then they had arrived at the ceremony. Robots didn't have blood, of course. They couldn't drink and be happy like a normal human being could. The wedding ceremony was a mechanical affair.

The organ played, then the voices sang. The Joneses couldn't see what was going on. They could only see the end result. When the ceremony was over, the Joneses kissed. And their beautiful wedding was over.

But they did not feel happy, not quite yet. They were so happy for the wedding, and so happy they would have a life, but they were not happy with each other. It was very bad.

Then the robot walked over to the Joneses' robot and said, ""Hey, John Jones, look at me.",1
"Prompt: Every aspiring superhero must become a sidekick for a few years before being granted full time hero status. You are the strongest superhero in your age group, but believe you have been assigned to the weakest hero. You learn a lot more than you originally thought you would. Story:  The First Year

Chapter 2: The First Year

When a hero is born, they come out screaming. For several minutes they shout, scream, and cry the loudest. At this point, they still have no control over their power, so they cry and they yell and scream because it makes them feel better. If a hero is fortunate enough to have a parent in the room when they are born, they get to hear the loud noise.

They have to practice holding it in so that they don’t let it out. They have to work on it every single day, because any sort of distraction can give away their power. For several months, they practice to make sure that they do not break down in public. But even after they have mastered the art of holding it all in, they still hear it, see it, and feel it anyway. They are still not used to using their full power, so if they were to hold it in for too long, they would end up either exploding or dying. So they have trained for almost ten years before being granted the honor to protect the world. Now, all they have to do is wait.

While they wait, they are still the loudest they have ever been. They may not have the experience to fight with their full power without losing everything. They may not have enough strength or know enough about the world, and so they cry and scream. But eventually, they are strong enough to be seen and the sound quiets down. And after several years of training, they are finally ready for their big debut, or as big as they will ever dare to. They are strong enough to handle anything for the rest of their lives.

While the hero lives out their days as a side-kick, they are still the loudest.

It was not a normal first day on the job for Eric. While he was walking down the street, he was holding in his scream so hard that it would have hurt if it had not been for his self-restraint and willpower. It must have been the same for every other hero, because as he walked along, he saw the other heroes doing the same thing. It never failed that every hero came out to take on their first assignment with their full power. It was kind of sad actually. There were many times when another hero had the power of a house-cat.

But this was Eric’s first and only time on his own. No other hero stood to watch, only a few kids on the side of the street. Even so, he still did not want to come out screaming. Even though he had fought the good fight for several years, he still was terrified of his power.

He was scared. He really was.

Before he went by, Eric had been going by the same high school for the past ten years and never talked to anyone. He would have been invisible if not for the sidekicks who would walk along side of him and call him by name. The same thing happened, Eric just stood in the shadow of his sidekick, saying nothing and holding in his scream. He turned the corner and entered his house, and stood in the middle of his room holding his scream.

After several minutes, he let it out, “Ohmygod!”

Eric was still holding his scream in when he was ready, and it came out as a small squeak. But once he heard it coming, it sounded like a howl. He was so relieved that he collapsed on the ground, holding his scream in, not to hurt anyone, but just for self-protection. After he gathered himself, he got up, but his knees were shaking. He walked into his room and shut the door.

When he turned around to lay down on his bed, for the first time in years he felt the freedom to be loud. He let out his full scream, and he did it louder than any hero came out. As soon as he turned around to lay down, there were four kids standing in his room looking at him. “Wow, you really let out your scream!” said one from the back. He was the same kid who Eric had never talked too before. He was the kid who could be seen in shadow by other heroes.

“Thanks,” said Eric. “I’ve been holding it all in for so long.” he said as he turned around and laid down.

“Do you know if any heroes have come out,” asked the kid from the back.

“I don’t know about anybody else, but you have to admit",1
"Prompt: Sanctuary Story: 

Sanctuary

The Sanctum Regis

Chaos erupted outside the Sanctum Regis as people began running into the street screaming about the demon attacks. The air was filled with thick and dirty clouds of smoke and ash as a huge pillar of flame, spewing fire and debris, smashed in to the center of the city. Some of the inhabitants had rushed to the front door and was attempting to hold the entrance open as the demons attacked. One young boy was standing guard as he attempted to block it when suddenly his eyes widen and he looks down to see his arm severed by a demon claw. Blood was spurting out of the wound from deep inside his arm.

Rikki entered the Sanctum Regis through the fire escape way and as her eyes adjusted to the darkness she could begin to make out the large chamber that was the keep of the Great Ones through the cloud of ash and smoke. She could also hear screaming people and the sound of a large crackling fire. Slowly she started down the stairs and was amazed by the intricate carvings of the walls. The intricate carvings depicted scenes from the past, from humans fighting wars with each other and from animals fighting against monsters.

As she started down the last few steps and entered the main chamber, she was able to hear voices chanting and the loud booming sounds of hammers hitting a series of drums that made the floor vibrate. She could recognize one of the drummers as the man who had killed her brother a few days before. He was wearing a long white tunic with a black hood pulled over his head. A deep purple scar ran the length of his left cheek all the way to the angle of his jaw. Rikki gasped at the horrible scar that cut right across his left cheek. On top of it the deep red welt of a bloody gash was still visible. The two giant white wolves that had been tied to the pillars near the front were growling and yapping at the ground and each other as they strained at their cord tethers. Rikki recognized the wolves as they had attacked her and her friends a week before and were part of the reason why they had gotten caught up all this mess.

The white hooded figure was chanting and he had his hands up in the air and the scarred face was contorted in an expression of absolute hatred toward anyone that was in the room. As he kept chanting and the other demons in the room started to follow his lead. Suddenly there was an outburst of thunderous banging and crashing noises and the whole room was lit bright as light was pouring up from the center of the floor. Instantly the burning fire was extinguished and the banging and crashing ended as well. The entire room was bathed in a soft white light and the white hooded figure stopped his chants and sat down on the edge of the raised platform that was at the center of the room. Suddenly there was a cracking and breaking sounds and large chunks of stone and broken marble began to come loose from the wall that was in the back of the room. Then as the light faded so did the chanting and banging and finally the demon sitting in the front of the room stood up with the hood pulled over his face and stepped down from the raised platform.

""Hello, Rikki. I have been expecting your arrival."" His voice was dark and resonated loudly in the huge room. He kept his hands up for a moment and then stepped down off the raised platform slowly. His whole body was shaking from head to toe and as he made his way over to the wooden step, he made his way to the edge, looked back at Rikki thoughtfully and asked her:

""Have you been following me? I have been watching your progress and it has been somewhat easy to find you with the aid of these."" He gestured at the two huge wolves that were staring menacingly at the floor. ""I should warn you, my wolves can become quite protective when their master is threatened."" He grinned and the wolves began to growl and snap at the air around him. He continued:

""I should warn you also, my friend, I am not like these demons from the Abyss.""

Rikki did not say anything back as she walked toward him and he slowly came down off the platform. She looked at him and said:

""You think you are the only God in this room.""

He chuckled and then turned his head back toward the wall and said:

""I am only one among many after all.""

Rikki just gave him look and said:

""There are more than these creatures who are ready to welcome your arrival? I don't suppose you are going to enlighten me what these demons were doing in my home? Perhaps they could tell you the same thing to go?""

The hooded figure turned his head and looked Rikki dead in the eye as he answered her:

""They were part",1

With the help of the Unsullied, Daenerys and her army ride towards The Wall, pursued by the Dothraki.

They're still fleeing.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Daenerys and Drogo arrive on top of the hill overlooking the field in the middle of Winterfell. They look towards the town of Baratheon, which is burning and being sacked. Daenerys takes the horse of her fallen brother and rides away.

The Battle Of The Bastards

A Stark (I believe it was) walks towards the camera. They do a quick cut to the side, showing the fire burning behind...

The Battle Of The Bastards

...before going back to the main path.

The Battle Of The Bastards

A second Stark walks around the burning town of Baratheon. They start talking to each other, and then, as they talk, they hear the battle going on. Suddenly, one of them points to the left, where there's a battle going on.

The Battle Of The Bastards

The Stark with the pointed out to left shows some shock, and they then point to their right, where the battle is indeed being witnessed.

The Battle Of The Bastards

A bunch of people, including Jon Snow, look behind them and see a Dothraki army following them. They start running faster, before turning the horses to the right and fleeing, the horse kicking Dothraki behind them.

Jon Snow turns around and looks at the battle, before pointing to Drogos corpse.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Daenerys arrives on top of a nearby hill, and sees the last bunch of Baratheons running away. She turns around and notices Jon Snow running towards her. She takes her horse from one of her slaves, but the horse refuses to move.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Jon and the other men, including Melisandre, finally arrive at Dany's side.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Jon climbs up the horse to talk to Dany.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Jon asks: ""Shouldn't we help them?"" to which Dany replies: ""No.""

The Battle Of The Bastards

Jon, who is still sitting on the horse, tells her it's not her problem, to which Dany smiles.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Jon stands and walks back to Melisandre, who takes it as a sign that he wants to follow Dany.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Jon goes to his horse (or his friend's horse) and climbs on it.

Rhun, the horse of his friend, follows him.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Melisandre tells Dany she will bring her victory wherever Jon is.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Drogo walks down the hill towards Jon, who kneels in front of him.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Jon looks at Drogo, but Dany cuts his speech short with ""Your godmother has some advice for you."" When Jon looks at her, Melisandre points to the Dothraki horde.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Melisandra then tells Jon to follow his heart, and that Dany will not let anything bad happen to him.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Jon looks at her and says: ""My mother is in there...."" before pointing to the burning town. Melisandre, who was holding a glass, tells Jon to follow his heart. She then drops the glass on the ground.

The Battle Of The Bastards

Jon, still speaking in an emotional manner, tells Melisandra that he will not let anything bad happen to Dany, who he says would have to save herself.

Melisandre puts the necklace around Jon Snow's neck, then she gives her two fingers, which means the war is beginning.

"Prompt: `` kill the child. it 's the right thing to do. '' Story:  '': When they were small, they had to work hard to eat. Their parents and their families, of course, didn't want them to work. They could not work, after all, so let them play. So they went to boarding schools. '' One day, when the two little boys were in junior high school, they met another boy, who showed them all the fun that college could be. It became fashionable, all the time. So, what they did, in between all the other things, was to go to college. And while they studied, they also played. And then, in one year, both boys finished their education and went to other universities. At that time, the two little boys said they would live on their own and make something of their lives. But their parents did not want them to go. They asked for ten more years of ""remedial'' school. '' The second boy, now a lawyer and a big shot, kept working, because he said he wouldn't leave his family. But then, finally, he couldn't even find a job. So, he went home to say that he could not go on. His father said '' I knew it all along! '' so the lawyer went to a new college and learned a new language. He finished high school with an ""A"" average, and went to a fancy law school. He got his degree and passed the bar. He started his own law firm and now he is wealthy. His father said,'' 'You see my son, all you need is to take a few courses and then you'll be ready for law school.'' '' But he was discouraged. He finished all the courses and passed the tests. But at that time, he was the only one with a degree in the whole state. The law firm was hiring only the best and most qualified. They said they knew that he was good and that they wanted him, but they could not afford to hire him. So, the father said, ''Then you must go to work, with me.'' And today the lawyer and the big shot earns much more money than he used to. He doesn't need to work for ten years but, instead, is now ready to go on with his life. So, the story has a happy ending, for once it is written down, it can never be forgotten. It's always there with you. It is the moral of your own story. The lesson is: Always try to do whatever you can, even if, somehow, you just might be the only one in the whole world who can do it. That's my story: the moral of one's own story. It's easy to write, but it's hard to do. '' When I decided to write this story, I told my brother, the lawyer, and my father, the engineer, that '' I'd write my story and that's my story. After I finished it I told my father that I'd written my story, and he said: '' I suspected that you might write it, but I did not really know. I knew that one couldn '.t force me to be something I did not wish to be. But, then you did write it, and I thought that was the best of all ways to tell your story. It will help you keep a check on your ''wishful thinking'. Remember, it's when your desire is stronger than your reason that things won '.t go well for you.'' So, what's your story? When the father said that I couldn '.t force me to be something I did not want to be, I thought '' but, of course,'ve chosen to be something I do want to be.'' I want to be an educated man. When I got to this country, I got an education. But, if I knew I would have to work and be broke, I would have left Japan, '' my father said. He said a lot of things. He said that if I had the education to be a doctor or lawyer, I should have gone and I would have gotten ''my piece of land.'' (They had an ''estate'' before there was an American property tax, and they had no ''government,'' either.) He said one day of hope if Japan had been a better country in the past, it would be even better now, if it was not that Japan was just a big country, but the people were too small anyway. They were good people, he said, with a simple, hard life. He said ''If you had not been rich enough to be a doctor, I 'd have said even a carpenter's job was all right. But not a big doctor's.

After the mob pushes you back inside the jail, the woman with the long hair walks before you and introduces herself as 'Sappho'. You are confused so she tells you her story:

Sappho is the daughter of a rich merchant and he brings her and her sister, Alcithoe, to Rome to be educated. When the girl reaches puberty she begins a relationship with a young nobleman named Polytus. She is upset to learn that he is engaged to a local girl named Astydameia. Since Polytus has a high standing, he is told about the custom of Athenians to allow the girl who wins in the trials to have sex as much as she wants while he is with Astydameia. Sappho thinks he should let her know when the time comes, and also to inform the locals that she is not a virgin. Alcithoe, her younger sister, overhears this and is enraged. They find Astydameia and as she is not wearing any panties, Alcithoe ties her by the wrists and drags her from the room.

Sappho hears of this and is livid. She takes some clothing from her room and decides to go visit Astydameia at her father's villa outside the city. On the way there she and Alcithoe are stopped by an angry mob. She tells them that she is Polytus' fiancée and is being escorted to her parents' home. But, they are going too to be killed, so she tells them that Astydameia is her friend and as the girls head to her parents'",1

The old man had just one word in English. The word was ‘Yes‘, he said, ‘Yes.’

It was a cold grey morning and the old man was shivering as though a breeze had swept through the room. His wrinkled face was covered by a black beard that reached down to his chest while long grey hair framed his head and he was draped in several layers of thick woolen cloth.

He was wearing the dark blue cloak of a monk while on a table on one side of the room lay his violin. Even in winter the room was decorated with plants and a table stacked with bread and a pot of coffee with warm milk were on the other side of the room. On the wall to the left was a tapestry representing the story of Buddha that stretched from floor to the ceiling.

It was still dark outside when the man woke up, it would be sunny soon. He pulled back his covers and sat up on the edge of his bed and took the coffee and the bread down from the table. He poured a cup of coffee, stirred it with his finger and took a sip from the edge of the saucer. Then he poured two spoonfuls in a bowl and stirred them before taking a final sip at an angle to his lips. He took the spoon and walked towards the window and stared out at the view outside. For a moment he was still and then he turned to the old woman who had been sitting silently by the window.

“Do you want a cup of coffee?”

The old woman looked up at him.

“Is it too early for tea, Sir?”

The old man nodded.

“It’s already past eight.”

The woman nodded. That was okay. That was the time she came to help with breakfast.

He took two cups down on a tray and placed the tray on the table by the window, the table was an old dining table and had four places on it. He put the bread and the coffee on one side of the table and poured the warm milk into the two glasses with a metal spoon. He asked the old lady her name.

“I am called Amala.”

She put her hand in the pocket of her kachabiyyeh and she brought out two gold coins and placed one beside each glass. He took the coins and put them into his pocket just like that. He looked at the old woman.

“Are you a good cook?”

The woman smiled brightly.

“I love cooking for my family. I love to prepare delicious meals for my husband and my children. I am a mother, you see.”

He nodded. His face had turned red and he opened his mouth to say something but he shut his mouth and then sat down. He began eating the bread, after the first few pieces he looked at the old woman and pointed to the tapestry.

“I have always wanted to buy that tapestry. It’s beautiful” he said.

The old lady nodded gently and took a piece of bread with a spoon in it. She pointed at the tapestry without saying a word and began eating. He kept eating, he didn’t like talking to old women. He looked out on the view again. A faint mist was hanging in the air. In the hills around the monastery there were trees, not much but still. The mist had cleared a little and there were people on the road far away on both sides of the road. There were people walking by the side of carriages going to the nearby town, they were wearing their finest clothes and carrying umbrellas in case they caught a cold, there were people standing right on the road, it was clear they were waiting for something or someone.

The man took off his coat and sat back in his chair and closed his eyes. It was a beautiful day, it was bright and cold, cold but with that sun of early in the morning. He could feel his heart beating. It was good to sit in the sun so early in the morning and to look at the view. It was like that every morning. It was better on this mountain than in the town, everything was so close so close. To be alive was just to be in the place you are at right now.

The man put his hand on his heart and his breathing increased as the minutes passed. The old man was happy but he knew nothing was perfect. He knew the things he saw and felt were only the tip of the iceberg and that he was not yet",1
"Prompt: at wedding of the woman you love, and you 're the best man. Story:  Continue with the story as it appears in the Bible without retelling the story.

The first verse is a little more than 300 words. If you make the paragraph longer, don 't extend each line by indenting the text. Don 't run sentences and verses on their own lines. I always reread my Bible before preaching, and I find some verses that're especially hard to preach. Preach that. Don 't preach the end of the verse. And don 't read the words verbatim, but interpret the words of God. If you need more examples of what a sermon should look like, check out the sermon from Luke 19:46 in the Gospel of Luke. One final note to remember with this passage: it's hard to look in the text and see the theological significance of what the text says. You're probably not hearing any of these words for the first time. Take advantage of this when you preach. Read your Bible in worship and preach from the text.

# How to preach with a theme (Luke 19:30-36)

Luke 19:30-36 is a wonderful passage. It's a story of a wedding and the groom's friends, and it's an omen from God of his coming kingdom. Let's preach the passage. This time it's shorter, just the key verses and the theme of the passage. Let's see how it goes.

Luke 19:30-36

Jesus'teachings and behavior.

The wedding.

The kingdom of God.

Jesus'coming kingdom.

Let's turn to the passage: There was a wedding in Cana. Cana is a town not far from Capernaum. There was a wedding there. You've probably heard the story. The wedding was a wedding of a very, very rich man. He was a man who could probably have been King of Poland, a man who was a ruler. And his family was probably one of the first families to emigrate to Russia. He could have been the first person to ever read the Bible in Russian, which is the language that he was brought up speaking, and he could have been the first to write the Bible in Russian. He was that important. Anyway, he's got a bunch of his best friends come to the wedding, a whole party. He's paying for wine for all the party to drink. They arrive, they dance, they sing, the wine is drunk, and then they come to the wedding supper in the night. The wine starts running out, and the bridegroom runs out and goes to the city to buy wine. He buys some wine and runs back. He turns to his friends who are still at the party and says, ""They've got no wine. I can make some wine at home."" They make wine, and you're probably picturing the scene as it looks in your mind. There are some little party hats flying off, and the wine is flowing and it's very, very festive and joyous and they're dancing this great party and drinking this wine and having a good time. Now, this is a wealthy area, and this wedding was big, so they need more wine, and the bridegroom runs to get some more wine. Maybe he's running back to his family. Maybe he's running back to Cana. I forget. Anyway, he runs back to the party and everyone there tells him that Can 't produce any wine. It's a long story. He comes back to the party and everyone else is still dancing, but they're not dancing as they dance. And he says, ""If you've got any wine here, you 'd better drink it! It's not going to get any better than it is right now, and we're going to celebrate with some Jesus."" Jesus tells him to ""Drink the wine, and tell the servants to fill the bottle up again."" Everyone in the party is drunk and he goes around to everyone, grabs a cup, fills 'em up and he's got it in his hands when he looks down, looks over at the bride and he says, ""Where's your mother-in-law?"" Just's a little funny moment. The bride is over here and the woman is over here, and he calls the bride's mother and says, ""What's the matter with you woman? Why are you so sad?"" So, he tells the servants, he said to them in a very quiet voice, ""Fill the bottle up again."" The servants fill 'em up and he's got the bottle in his hand and he comes over to the bride and he's looking right at her, and he says, ""To you, this bottle will never leave me."" He drinks and he holds the bottle over his",1

Tales From the Kingdom of Enroth

After the death of Jekor, who was the king of all dwarves, his son, Jekor's son, the king, became king of all dwarves, as the title 'King of all dwarves' has no meaning, since all dwarves are his subjects. A new generation of dvergar has ascended, in a process which seems to be somewhat similar to reincarnation. Dvergar who were born in a good month are blessed with the ability to speak with the voices of animals, plants, rocks and other phenomena, and the ability of the magic stones to transform their appearance and appearance. They are called ""The Lucky"" Dvergar.

In each month, there is a ""Shelter Party"", a ritualistic event where the lucky dvergar are to choose a ""suitor"". The suitor's family must then present a gift to the king in order to claim the dvergar as their own. On the 13-year anniversary of the king's ascension, a ""Great Assembly"" takes place at the king's court, where the dvarig and the current suitor choose the new king of the dwarves.

Every one hundred dvergar, the king creates a new ""Gift"", of which the following are the most common:

When a Gift is chosen, the dvergar receive a new name, according to the theme of the gift. Thus, one who has been chosen is known simply as ""Gift."". After his choice is discovered, however, he is also named as ""the chosen one"" or ""the savior"".

The Great Assembly takes place every three years, after every three gifts are created.

The Great Assembly, is an event during which the chosen one is to receive his gift from the king. During the Great Assembly, the chosen one meets with the people, the government, the king of the dwarves and other dvergar. After he receives his gift, he also receives his crown, the gift of a king. He is also given some advice from the dwarves to take for the time he would be king. Finally, the chosen one is crowned, and starts his journey as a new king.

The Chosen One, a book about the Great Assembly; The chosen one, a book about the Chosen One;
The Chosen One and the King of the dwarves, a book about the King of the dwarves.

In each of the thirteen years, the Great Assembly takes place, the Chosen One must make a report to the government.

At the beginning of Year One, the Chosen One received his stone, which gives him powers to be a great leader.

Once, the Chosen One came to the King and said, ""Give Me the power to know what others think, so that I can be a great leader and lead my people to a life of glory!"".

After getting what he asked, the King said, ""The stone is not strong enough yet. Go, and practice your magic"".

At the end of the King's speech, the Chosen One turned around and vanished, and nobody knew what happened to him.

During the years after the last Great Assembly, the King often mentioned that he regretted the lack of a strong Chosen One, and that he tried many ways to find a new one.

Tales From the Kingdom of Enroth

The First Great Assembly

The chosen one began his journey, but not before he learned to handle his stone. He became stronger and stronger, and many people admired him. Eventually the king sent the Chosen One to find a certain person: He said, ""Now you, Chosen One, go to find this person and tell them, 'I need you'."" The Chosen One knew this job well. After a long journey, he finally reached this person.

He said, ""Where are you going?"" The stranger answered, ""I am heading towards the Northern Wastes."" Then the Chosen One said, ""What is your problem?"" He answered, ""I have no way of reaching there."" Then the Chosen One said, ""Do you want to help me?"". The stranger answered, ""I have nothing to do with it, but I will teach you the best way"".

The Chosen One then showed the stranger a map, and said, ""Right there is where you have to go. I know where a great river lies"", and he also taught him how to use the power of his stone. The stranger said, ""I have a map, if you want it."" The Chosen One quickly accepted and took the map. The stranger said, ""This map is going to lead you to the place where you need to be, but it will take some time."" Then he gave the Chosen One two",1

[Utopia] [Part V]

The Grey Side of the Force is an ancient Force-wielding race of shapeshifting warriors, capable of manipulating the very flow of space itself. While still active, the Grey side of the Force thrived a long time ago, but have not been discovered by mainstream humanity. Today, they may be as advanced as any known culture except the Sith, and operate on a level entirely different from their contemporaries.

As this story starts, the Shannara’s Jedi and the Grey side are in contact with each other. While they don’t yet know just what the Grey are up to, they have decided to use the communication as a distraction, until the time has right for the Jedi to enter their territory and find out what is really going on.

This is part five of a five part story and contains adult content, if you don’t want the rest of the story then skip to the next part.

Oren was standing in the middle of the room, the other three stood either side of him. He was holding a large sword in his hand and he was looking around the room nervously. There were a few men around him. They had dark skin like him, but other than that he didn’t recognise any of them. The only thing he could think of was that they could be Jedi, and he did not like it if he was face to face with them.

At any rate, Oren was feeling nervous. It wasn’t just that he had found the room, it was that he had broken in to it. He looked over at the others, not because he was looking for help, but because it was what you would expect to see, he looked like he was trying to find the escape route if trouble found him, but they all looked completely relaxed.

“I am not sure what to do with you, I don’t think I can take you back to the camp. My companions don’t know of any place that we can trust and I don’t even know who you are. I am truly sorry for taking you in, but I don’t want trouble on my path, and I don’t think you can do anything to get out of this, well maybe if you are the real Oren it can. But right now, I don’t know if you are Oren or not.

“As for me, it is only that I needed to be rescued, and I don’t really know, I just need my brothers back together so that we can go with them. If I am Oren then I am in the wrong body, and I probably should have let him die, but that was not within my control. Now I’m stuck with this body I do not understand and I cannot get rid of it. I guess that I really need you to find out who you are, is there anything in your pockets?”

*

Oren glanced around, trying to remember who he was supposed to be. He had always been one to help people in need, after his time in the arena he had spent a lot of time teaching people how to defend themselves. He was pretty confident that he had done a good job, but you couldn’t teach experience. He thought he had known a lot of people back home but it was hard for him to say. The trouble was his body was not his, it belonged to someone else.

At any rate, as he looked around as people, and there was no clue that he might be Oren. He had never seen a sword wielded around before and was surprised how heavy it was. He realised that he could not carry it and he would need an opponent to get it, so he pointed it out to them.

“There is no shame in throwing a sword. A master should be able to cut their opponent down with just one clean move. It isn’t just for you to protect ones self. Now if you don’t know anything, then you will have to learn on a level with me, and I don’t think that this is the time to do that so let us get some practice in.”

*

One of the men held up a piece of paper. It took Oren a while to realise that it was a map of the room. It did a fairly good job of showing everything. It gave a scale of how far apart things were, the dimensions of what was on the ground, and how high some of the things that were in the room were. It wasn�",1
"Prompt: The year is 3017. The whole world is `` futuristic '' and everything is clinical ( smooth, clean etc. You are the head of a vigilante group that plants trees in public areas. Story: 

Spoiler:

You get called before a judge. You tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This judge is one tough cookie. He is known to be a real pain in the ass to everyone. You are his last case. All the evidence shows you are innocent of the crimes you are being accused of. His response: ``I don't give a shit of your crimes, I am only here to assess your character''.

Does this guy have a sense of humor? What did the Judge mean by it?

The point of the exercise is to use your imagination. To develop your story with the help of the forum.

Forget everything else. Forget the crime you are supposed to commit for example to the point that you cannot tell exactly who did it. Forget how you would normally resolve this type of issue. Think about the situation in which this thing occured and how the Judge came to that result. Write as if this moment in time and this individual are completely different and all your options are open to you.

Does this make you think of some of those cases for which you have to plead?

I just realized your problem isn't the crime but the punishment.

This is true.

But, we do not know the motive and we do not have a clue of motive. We can write all we want about a crime in which you get to do this or that, but this doesn't seem like a proper way of going.

If you can figure out the motive -- why he is doing this and what will happen to the people affected by this in the long run, then we are talking about a very different situation. But this can help you if you try to guess the motive in all the details.

If the motive is clear, you can also understand what the Judge thinks can happen and if he is willing to let the accused suffer for it.

But again, the point is to come with a story. If you don't have enough clue why this happens, how it happens, your choices and so on then it would be impossible to write an interesting story.

Exactly. A crime with the motive is not the same as a crime made up of whatever details happen to take place.

For example
Say a criminal kills someone. Who did it? Where did the victim go? How far is the place from where the crime occurred?
Who told you about the crime? Can the authorities or any other reliable sources confirm that this crime happened?
Why did the criminal do this?

Can you answer the questions. You need a story and you need to think about it in the form of a story with a plot.

If the motive is clear, you can also understand what the Judge thinks can happen and if he is willing to let the accused suffer for it.

This is very relevant, thanks.

But this is all about creating a scenario that is based on a real life story (or a similar story) and the reason behind the crime (if such a thing exists). If you have any reason for the crime, it is always present in the mind of the writer who tells the story, so if you don't have any motivation, then you have to come up with something.

If you have a reasonable reason, then you can also determine how motivated the Judge to be.

But again, the point is to come with a story. If you don't have enough clue why this happens, how it happens, your choices and so on then it would be impossible to write an interesting story.

"Prompt: At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. Story: 

After 18 Years of Reincarnation The Reincarnating Person's Life Continues

At the age of 18, people continue their lives as they had in the past.

A Reincarnating Person’s Parents

Your parents grow older and have more children as parents. Some may marry and start a family of their own:

A Reincarnating Person’s Friends

A Reincarnating Person will always have friends. Other people in the new life may even develop romantic relationships that you may have had in the past, but your social life is similar to other people. This is not the time to search for a partner—the new family comes first.

A Reincarnating Person’s Partner

In a new, happy married life, you and your life partner may have children. This will take place when you age out of the family of your parents. Children, then, will either be with your life partner or with a second family. This process will happen over and over.

A Reincarnating Person’s Marriage

When you and your life partner are older, you may have children with each other, as was the case with your parents. There may be children from previous lives, too, or new ones from the new life. (If you have had children from a previous lifetime, you may have more than one spouse, if you are lucky enough to be given one.) If you have had children in a previous life, you may have had those children in your current life, or a different life.

Children as Preteenagers

The oldest child usually becomes the parent in a new life at this age. Usually, the oldest child is either the same gender as the parent or the other gender, and may have been the parent (in the current life, or in a previous life) of several others. If you do not have siblings, this will be the only child.

In one case, it might happen that several very old people have a couple of identical children in their family. These people may be brothers or sisters, or even grandchildren, who have the exact same parents, in the exact same life.

People who get married late in life have their second or third marriage. These marriages are usually with another person who will be the closest relationship of their life.

A Reincarnating Person’s Family

The family life you have will be similar to your first family life, but there will be more of them. Your family can consist of your current family members, your old lives, your other birth parents, and your siblings. Your family members who will be in your life may or may not have known each other in others lives, and you may have known them in previous lives. You may have even had a first father who did not know his family members well.

Your Family Members

Depending on your family and your social life, you may experience something like this:

Your Second Family (or Families)

The second family in a new life will be made up of people who you know. You may even be related to them or they may be from a different life. They may, or may not, be more important to you than your current life, but if they are important, then they will be important in your life.

A Reincarnating Person’s Social Life After 18

This is not the time for social life. You are busy with your first life and growing up. After this time, you will have enough time to enjoy the social life of your second life.

The Reincarnating Person as an Adult

If you live an adventurous life, you may choose to move away from your first life and your family of origin. On the other hand, if you want to stay with your family, you will be happy to have the support.

If you do this well, and you have had many lives before this one and you continue to progress in a way that you feel is positive, then you grow more and more independent, and you eventually leave your family of origin.

If you do not know what you want to do in life, a family of origin might not be right for you, and then you will have no choice but to search for an independent life. Many people go back to stay with their parents, but some others have no real intention to do so.

A Reincarnating Person as a Parent

If you choose to have a family of origin, you may be a parent. You will have your own children, as you have had before, but your children may or may not be a continuation of your past lives children. This will depend on your experience in the life currently being experienced. You may not know what will happen, but you will be prepared.

This is what you will say to yourself as you get out of your car (even though you can fly):



""I'm a god. I must be near the top of the food chain and it's good to be here for now. I'm probably already too close to these mortals (not very original for a giant who can alter the past) and my presence is getting so much attention and my power-knowledge is getting out of hand. These mortals seem to have so many problems and they think God can put a fix everything. It doesn't matter though. I'm going to make them pay. Let them take everything, kill each other, burn each other alive, destroy the Earth. They're just too fragile and they're out of their mind with their religion and their ideas and their... you know, whatever-it is to them. I am an omnipotent god after all. Everything and I mean everything is under my control. I can manipulate destiny, change the planets, alter past and I'm just here to have fun. But it turns out that I must really be the king of the world just a bit to have so much fun as a god. I know I'm better than them but I'm in a bit of overdrive at the moment. You're supposed to keep people in check but I'm just a bad person and I don't even do anything bad. It's just a bunch of bad luck. You go through life and you wish for better things and that's all you want. I know that you can't tell me what to do or any of your rules but I just feel so bored to hear you. I never ever change fate, I just manipulate it and I'm so pissed off at those mortals for wanting me to fix their things. If God created everything how would he know what to do? He would have to be the Creator to understand everything, yet he did it with magic and he couldn't even do anything correctly. Magic is so weak. They think God got his power over them because he was strong but that's all nonsense because no one ever got their power (not even the gods) unless God gave them some. You can't control nature like that, it's just too big and complex. I'd have to have a god of the universe to control it and I'm not capable. I could create a thousand planets and none of them would be the same. It's impossible and these beings were arrogant to think that they could actually do it and that they're going to make humanity the most advanced species out of the whole solar system too. They're fools. But you don't have any proof! This cannot be. They're too arrogant and they have such a flawed understanding of the things that I've already seen it. They can change what happened in the past and make things turn out other ways but they have their limit. They really can't change their destiny because they have so much to do and so much that they don't want to change. Things go according to their way until the Earth is destroyed (okay, I'm pretty sure they can't really destroy this planet that fast, not that easily, but it's still really hard to believe). Things go according to their plan and nothing ever goes wrong. They think they can make the future happen but they're wrong. I don't even exist because I can't change them if they want to destroy the Earth, they already destroyed it once because someone else made one decision and it would change their destiny. They don't really care about their kids, I don't have a kid that's in a high level. They're only aware of their own kind and can't see beyond. That's why I have to create an entire family for them and give them all the food (it's all in-progress). I know that's impossible but I have a very big imagination and that's all I need. I still can't believe it, a good and nice thing happening to them. It's not supposed to happen, they're all doomed and that's that. Humans are so arrogant they think they can do it. I have to show them, I have to show them what they're really capable of and they're going to see it. I would have to make it as far as I can and then I would see their reaction. They're going to see how the real world works. This is just crazy... maybe it's not. Maybe it's just another coincidence. I can never believe any coincidence in this life, I just can't do it because I'm a god. But this is the most important thing that would happen",1
"Prompt: Gather up the posse Story:  Gather up the posse Continua a legenda

Bridgette's mind was churning. As she followed the old crone who was leading their way to the ruins, she knew that something was deeply wrong. The world seemed distant and it was as if she was trapped inside a dark fog. She could see people here and there, but all she could think about was the time when she was a child. Bridgette remembered her life then: her grandmother and her childhood home, the one place that was always welcoming and bright, the one place she went back to, the one place she came back to. But even as she thought about this, there were more and more shadows lurking in the corners of her mind. Something dark was coming, the kind of dark that comes from memories you can't remember. There is something wrong. Something is wrong. It was then that she heard a voice deep in her childhood memories:

It's going to be alright. And if it is, we won't need to be afraid anymore. If we need to be, we'll show ourselves. For a few days longer. And if a few days, what's so bad about it? After what has happened, we need to be more cautious. There is nothing of concern when a day or two goes by. A week, maybe longer. In a few days we will have the perfect excuse to disappear. Don't worry about a thing. We're safe. It's the truth, what I'm saying.

Bridgette knew it was strange, that she was hearing this. A voice from a shadow of a memory that she couldn't remember. It was the voice of childhood, but it wasn't her own voice. It was the voice of someone else, someone Bridgette knew well. So who was this someone familiar who spoke to her? She knew it was important to understand who she was talking to, but she couldn't remember.

""Well?"" the crone called out. ""Who else is coming with me? Who's ready for adventure?!""

Brackette turned around to look the others in their group, but was confused by how few there were. There was Bridgette, one of them, an old lady, and a young kid with his arm in a sling, and that was it. Then Bridgette realized there was one more waiting for them nearby and he had his arms wrapped around a very small pile that looked like rocks, and then she took another look at the crone and it was then that she noticed the way she was looking at Bridgette. There seemed to be something very different about the way she looked at Bridgette. There was anger in it and sadness, although Bridgette couldn't explain if that was because of Bridgette or because of something else, but it seemed like there was a lot more going in the crone's thoughts than just the promise of hope.

""What do you want? What kind of game are you playing?"" the crone said to Bridgette. ""We're not kids, we're grown ups. Whatever this game is about, it's something you adults want us to play your games. We don't have any interest in your games, alright? So don't get all huffy about this, alright?""

""Alright?! Alright?! Do you even bother to answer anyone when they ask you something?"" the crone snapped. ""What do you want from us?!""

""Nothing,"" Bridgette said. ""What do you want?""

""I told you already, we want nothing from you! We want nothing from you either! So get the fuck out of here and leave us alone!""

""I don't want to talk about this right now. Please don't. I'm sorry. Just... don't worry about it. We have other things on our minds."" Bridgette started walking away from the group with the others.

""Are you leaving then?! And without us??! No wonder I don't know anything about any of you!"" the crone said as she chased after her. ""That's why you won't talk! Because it's too hard! Too hard to look in the face of all those memories that haunt you! That you won't look at! Just pretend like nothing is happening! That everything isn't about to change! But we want no part of it! I want nothing to do with your games! Get the fuck out of here before I get angry!""

They continued their walk and talked about their plans and what they were to do. Bridgette tried everything to forget about the voice she was hearing, but the voice wasn't leaving her alone. It was more clear than ever now. There was a man with big dark hair who looked familiar and there was a woman standing on a cliff, pointing a gun at them out of the corner of Bridgette's",1
"Prompt: You are standing at the alter about to marry the woman of your dreams when all of the sudden 3 tall men in dark suits barge through the door, your soon to be wife turns around, raises her arms and the men go flying across the room. Story: 

Your Father runs to his fiancé and shouts to you to run. You quickly jump to your feet and follow your Father through the door. He pulls you to a stop after you reach the sidewalk outside your Father’s office. You are frozen in place and you can’t hear anything over the loud thump of your heart beating in your ears.

Then you hear him say: “You idiot.” One tall man grabs your father by his collar. “How could you put me through all that?” he shouts. “You wanted to scare her first, didn’t you?”

“And to think I would do all this for you,” adds his accomplice, pulling you father away. “Why did he have to do it?” asks the man. “Why didn’t he show up?”

You hear his accomplice say your name but everything else is a blur. Your feet seem to take you by the hand. “No, stay back,” you plead. You hear your father moan one last time as he is dragged away.

And then suddenly there is a new feeling; you can breathe. Your mind begins clearing. You are safe. Your feet move and suddenly you find yourself in front of the doors of the church. You glance around and notice that most of your friends and family are already inside. You are about to rush over to say hello to your new father-in-law when she runs to the altar and you follow her gaze. You see the men from across the room, on their knees. Your mother’s hand reaches to cover your shaking hands.

You hear her say: “Your father is fine, it’s all right.”

You are aware that something isn’t right. You notice your father’s eyes staring back out of the man who was handcuffed to the wall, and you catch a glance of fear and then realization. There was no way he was handcuffed to a wall. No one could do that.

You turn around and walk in the opposite direction, past your aunt and through the crowd of people. You notice your date and wonder if she has noticed too. You feel your insides shaking, and you pray you don’t feel sick.

As you walk to the back of the church you catch your Uncle’s eye. He whispers to you:

“They’re dead. They’re all dead.”

You are silent for a few seconds as you come to a stop next to your date and whisper to her: “Let’s go.”",1
"Prompt: You wake up one day to find the world in ruins, and everyone dead. You meet God outside, finding out that he has kept you alive for a reason. Story:  the end is not yet in sight.

(This post will not only contain spoilers for Mass Effect 3, but also for all Mass Effect games past the first game in the franchise.)

A lot happens between the first game to the second one. We see the Mass Effect universe grow, we help a lot of new characters come into the story, old main characters grow and lose some of what they previously held dear, it’s pretty epic.

For a sequel to Mass Effect 2 we’ve been given a lot to keep us waiting for. First we got a pretty good number of hints that there is at least one character being kept in stasis, which was already a pretty big hint to us being led to another character. Then we heard a nice little hint of an important character’s fate being wrapped up, before we met that character. It would seem that Mass Effect 3 is coming around for us in the form of a teaser trailer for the game, giving us one more hint before things get wrapped up.

It’s time to get caught up if you haven’t done so already, here we go:

You awake several months after being left for dead at the end of the first game, or about a year, maybe a little more. You find yourself on what would seem to be an uninhabited planet, but for the now missing Mass Relays. There are all the usual warning signs for danger, but nothing so life threatening as it has been in the past, and there is a small group of people who seem friendly and help you. There are some things you find on this planet that lead you to believe that there are more people out there still. You know some people should still be there for your return, and the fact that someone took you in, but there is still a missing factor from all of your experiences, until one day you do find something.

It just makes you start questioning your own identity, and the people you’ve come to know, what is this all for? You start to wonder just who the Catalyst is, and if the real problem was that the people of the galaxy did not see what was happening to the galaxy, that the world as a whole can be rebuilt.

And that’s the first thing that the Catalyst did: He restored Shepard’s memories. We all know how that works, I’m betting Shepard will be quite surprised at what they find.

The second thing that will happen is they meet up with a new alien race, on the Citadel.

The last remaining Citadel was nearly destroyed in one of the last encounters of the first game. It’s no surprise that the new arrival is the Illusive Man: A character from the first game that was only in the shadows until now, for whatever reason, the two are friends. The Illusive Man tells the Shepard that there is a greater plan in motion, a group of aliens called the Krogan. The Krogan in question is probably N7 Omega, the group that Shepard was in the end of the first game. The mission from the first game came back. The people who were missing come back, and the people from the Citadel who weren’t there begin to go into stasis in a room they can’t leave yet. The Shepard from the beginning of the first game finally appears, and is given something very important to do.

At least that’s what it seems like. There seems to be some confusion among the audience as to the nature of the mission the final encounter in Mass Effect 1 was set up for. The Illusive Man and Shepard have just a little less than two hours together because he is to be taken back to Normandy to meet with Cerberus. Instead, The Illusive Man has a little talk with The Warden, in the stasis room that Shepard was never able to finish out of course. The Warden then tells Shepard that they are one of the groups that need to be taken out. At last we get the confirmation the audience has been demanding: The Warden is telling Shepard that they are the Catalyst for the entire galaxy. Shepard, it would appear, is now the Catalyst.

The whole thing goes down a week later, and when it’s over Shepard is supposed to know something about their friends. We never know to what extent the characters will be aware of Shepard’s role as the Catalyst, what they need to know for the role is not very in depth. All Shepard is told is they will meet with The Catalyst later so that they can be ready for the next mission, and the role is then passed on. The next mission is about saving the rest of the galaxy from The Reapers.

The Reapers are the enemies the game is named for",1
"Prompt: You wake up and discover that you are now a ghost. The more shocking news is finding out where you 've been assigned to haunt. Story:  You have a choice:



The story is the story of ghosts, like they're people to you. You do not have to be the ghost-boy who died in the accident, your personality is what you create after you die and are assigned to a ghost. There are more ghosts in the school than you previously thought: there are a large number of ghosts and many ghosts are also people. You could get yourself and the ghost assigned a job just like people have before they pass. There is a good reason for this: most ghosts are poor, and it's better to work to support yourself than to continue to haunt and live through memories. The most common jobs are student teacher. In school you are very similar to a normal human, but also you can see and see the ghosts around you, and occasionally you can hear and feel things. You can't talk to the ghosts, you can't read their minds and you can't see into the future. Ghosts are very emotional and can make friends or enemies very easily. You are not a ghost: you are a ghost-boy.

Ghostly Adventures! I'm Ghost-boy; you can call me Nick.

Story: My name is Ryou, I'm 14 years old at the time, and I'll be a student teacher. The story is about my adventures as a ghost. You are not alone as a ghost, others have experienced things similar to you. It will take a couple years for you and a ghost to figure out how to get along with each other. But one of the most important things to remember is not to get distracted by people. You will have to be strong. Be brave. And do everything you can to survive.

Note: I created this story for practice. I tried to make a nice story. If you have any comments, or anything to add, please do so.

The Story (Part 1)

Chapter 11

Ryou’s first class is math class, Mr. Tsutsui’s class. He teaches students how to multiply and divide numbers. For example, 2x2, 2x4, 2x6, 2x8 and 2x10 in multiplication are 100, 200, 300, 400 & 500 in order. And 2 + 2 = 10 in sum. To multiply and divide numbers, you need to find out what they are multiplied with, the multiplication will result with a higher number, and you can’t multiply or divide by a number higher than 10.

In my first class, I met the new ghost. His name is Akira. I was still in my classroom watching the blackboard, when suddenly I heard my door slide open and a boy dressed in light blue stepped in. Although I could not see this boy well, I knew he was probably a ghost because he had white hair and he looked like a ghost. After he entered the room, he turned on the lights and smiled as he put the light onto his face. But before I looked at him with his face light on at last, his eyes disappeared. This made me so curious that I took the lamp towards my desk. I looked at the boy’s face, now his hair turned a little yellow. “Akira.” I called, but he didn’t reply. I thought maybe he was mute. I looked at the student’s desk, and I looked next to my own desk, but there were no students. “Akira?” I called, but the boy did not reply so I started walking towards him. “Akira!” I called again, but he didn’t reply so I just touched his shoulder. “Akira.” Then he gasped and turned to me. He turned away from me and looked towards the door, then he started crying for the first time. I turned towards him, confused why he was crying. Then I saw he was crying as a ghost. I was shocked that ghosts could cry. As a ghost, he could only cry for the people who passed away, but I couldn’t cry for my parents, I was just confused by what just happened. Then I heard the bell. “Uh, excuse me. I have to go now. It’s my class.” I shouted as I quickly went out of the classroom.

Now when I looked for Akira in the classroom, his seat was still empty. As I went out of the classroom, I saw my friend, Akira. She appeared in front of me with her hands crossed over each other, smiling. She was very pretty with her long black hair down to her waist, but that day she was more beautiful than usual. “So you really do exist.” she said, she giggled.

"Prompt: You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other. Story: 

I'm an old man now. My wife and children long dead. I still enjoy making music every so often. I play my music for an ever growing audience. I have seen many of my musical creations come to life. The audience seems to respond favorably. In the past, they applauded after watching me perform. Now they laugh at my jokes. One night I brought along a young friend. She liked the music so much, that she sat in with me almost every night. When she is not present, I make one of her musical creations come to life.... she is in it as you know. The audience is now in disbelief. No one can think of anything funny on a daily basis. My jokes tend to make them sad.

You and your friend appear in the form of an old woman who plays a guitar. You say that at one point she was your wife. You also say that she is in a new relationship now. Explain further.

You and your friend play to a vast audience of smiling people. All are in a good mood. You say that this audience was created by you earlier. You have made many new faces of people smile. They like each other all the time. This is a new audience, a new world.

You ask them to watch you perform one song again. You say that you have many faces of this song, so they can watch many faces of themselves perform and hear the music. The audience is now very happy, smiling as they watch you play this song. All smile, the song is wonderful.

Now you ask the audience to laugh once more, one of the many faces of the song. They do it to everyone in the room. They laugh and laugh. You ask them to do it again one of the faces. They do just that. You now laugh with them.

Someone in the room says he wants to make a baby with you. He says he wants to make a baby with you every night. He says he only does this in one of your faces at a time. He explains how he has done this for many people in the audience. He says this is for people who have had children, for people who are about to give birth. He tells of his children who are no longer with him. He says this is another reason to make the baby.

You and your friend finish playing. You thank them for their attention, and leave the audience. The audience applauds for you once again. You thank them for their applause.

This is the first day of your journey. A small, old, and very tired man lies asleep under a tree. He is dreaming, and talking with invisible friends.

The man is awakened by a man who says, ""Sir! Can you hear me?""

""Yes,"" the old man replies.

""I am the Man from the Darkside,"" he says. ""I have just given you your birth-rights as a Man, and you have been given your Darkside rights. You are now a MAN!""

""I think I do not fully understand,"" the old man says with a weary voice.

""If you stay in the dark for too long, you will either grow old, or die,"" the man says. ""You will not have any rights to the Darkside. But if you keep your birth-rights, and stay in the shadows, you will gain new powers, new rights, and have opportunities to become a MAN (something in your dreams) who will do great things for you and for others too.

""You are an experienced MAN now,"" the man says. ""You deserve a new life, to be the best MAN you can be. Now, you have your birth-rights and your Darkside rights. Now you have a NEW LIFE!""

""What are birthrights and rights?"" the old man asks.

""I will tell you,"" the Man from the Darkside says. ""BirthRights are what you are born as. BirthRights are what makes a man or woman. Your birth right as a man gives you the right to be a great MAN. Your birth right as a woman gives you, at the very least, the right to be a kind woman. Now you can use birth rights to have a new life.""

""A new life?"" the old man says in a curious voice.

""If you stay as a man or a woman, you will grow out of your present life. You will no longer remember how old you are. And your present life will be forgotten. So you can be born just once, as a MAN or as a WOMAN. But if you stay in the dark you will grow",1

Two former spouses are divorced from one another, but it is still very obvious that they are deeply in love with each other. They try to pretend that they are married despite the fact that they live in separate countries. How do we feel about that?

Please write a couple of sentences describing your view in an easy and clear way, like for example describing your feelings when you think about how we live in society with multiple partners in a single relationship.

I believe with all my heart in love, but not necessarily one man for one woman. I see that for a relationship to live it needs a special spirit, that is based on compromise, affection and respect. I am also married and I am in love with my husband. I wish he had a similar view, and I am glad that all is well for the two of us, even though our relationship is far from ideal.

"Prompt: A priest, a rabbi, and a minister walk into a bar. But this is no joke, this is a tragedy. Story: 

What's the joke? It's the one we joke about every time a priest, rabbi, or minister walks in the door of a place where other people, of a different religion, are drinking. The joke is just what happens when one of them orders his drink.

The priest orders a drink, the barman brings it, and the priest says, ""My God, I forgot where I was. I must be dead.""

The minister orders a drink, the bartender brings it, and the minister says, ""If I didn't believe in God, I'd swear this drink was laced with cyanide""

What's the tragedy? It's the one we say to ourselves every time just one of them has to ask for his order the wrong way. You know what I mean...

The priest orders ""O-oh-Oh-oh-ay!"" (pause for effect)

""I-I-I'd like a... uh... Dooooh! Uh... oooh! (pause for effect) I'd like... uh... Doooh! (pause for effect) (shaking head). I-I-I'm just so confused. I'm in such a... uhm... (pause for effect)... daze! (pause for effect) I-I-I'm still confused. I'm so... uh... dazed! (pause for effect) I-I-It's a... (pause for effect)... daze! Ohhhh! I-I-I think I'd better get me another! (pause for effect) I-I-I'd certainly appreciate it. I-I-I'll have the same as the last one. That's right! And a Scotch. And... a doooooo! I'd like... a woooooahh! Doooh!"" (pause for effect) ""You are right, I'm right and I'll show it. I-I-I'm a... uh... doo! I-I-I'm all of them; I-I-I'm a... oh... doo! I-I'm a Doo! Doo! Oh God I'm sorry my-my-my eyes were-were-were-truly... aw-wahhhhh... blind!"" (pause for effect) ""I-I-I see! I-I-I see! I-I-I see! I-I-I see!"" (pause for effect). You know what I'm saying. I'll just have... oow! I'll drink it myself.""
Door closes. Priest, rabbi and minister walk out and leave the bartender alone in the bar with his Scotch. No one else comes in and he does not talk to the bartender. The bartender, feeling guilty, looks out of the window and sees a priest, a rabbi, and a minister standing on Main Street. You know what's going to happen next. You know where this is going to end. I'm a... umm... (pause for effect). The bartender puts back the bottle of Scotch and takes out his revolver; he shoots the first man standing; the priest falls to his knees, begins to praise the Lord, and cries ""Amen."" The bartender shoots the second man; the rabbi falls to his knees, falls backwards and moans, ""Hosanna."" The bartender shoots the third man; the minister says, ""There are no more answers, there are no more questions; there are no more questions... "" (pause for effect)

And that's the tragedy. There is no story there to be told. Nothing in the world but the drink you're ordering. You don't know how to order; the bartender doesn't know how to answer you. You have to be careful. You just have to be. Careful. You can't get it wrong.

God forbid anyone should get it wrong. We're not talking about the drink here; we're talking about the way we live our lives...

What are we so afraid of? We're so afraid of asking that we don't ask anything. Maybe you've read that book about how to ask for money for the children's home. We'll buy books that tell us how to ask ""What's your problem?"" We'll ask ourselves, ""What's my problem? I love people; can't I get something for them?"" Maybe, by asking, we should be able to find out our names. I mean, we're looking for the right thing...

Maybe, as I've been trying to say, this is why God created a woman to be a mystery. Maybe He knew that when you come to His house as a man, you'll order a drink; when a man comes to Woman's house, you'll order a drink. ""Are",1
"Prompt: You are Waldo. What 's your story? Why are you hiding? Story: 

Waldo and I love being around each other because it shows me how my life could be.

There's nothing like the feeling of seeing your old dog after being away from home.

We had some trouble, and I am lucky enough to have a few great people in my family that take care of him. He lives in the same house I do, has his own bedroom and his own little dog kennel.

It's one of the best things that's happened to me recently.

It's one of the best things that's happened to me recently that I had a nice house and a nice kitchen to take my dog out into, so he wouldn't be so hot from being in the car for a long time.

That was one of my biggest worries. He always had a hard time staying warm, and he'd get overheated sometimes.

That was one of my biggest worries, I wanted him to be healthy.

You're in the back yard, watching the sun go down over the mountains.

I was so happy the way he looked back then, he was so happy.

He looked so strong, and he looked like the dog I know, and I just loved him so much, and the other man, his master, he wanted the dog. They bought it from a lady, but it was from my neighbor who took me off the property and gave him to me.

His master was a good man, but he couldn't see the way other's animals looked, just that he was a good man.

I had been giving him away.

It's really nice to have a good friend who doesn't care what you look like, who'll give you away because they're friends.

His old master knew, he was smart. He gave my dog to me.

I had to decide.

I had to decide was he a man.

Do you believe in God?

We lived in the mountains of New Mexico, and he had a hard time surviving in the rain.

He got pneumonia, and he had trouble breathing.

There are places in this world that are very beautiful.

I just happen to love this area.

The way the clouds roll in, it's always clear.

The sky is always a blue sky.

I am a very happy dog, and I know it.

There're many different paths to happiness.

I was always happy being home, because I loved you.

I could lie down and look up at the sky, and it was clear.

And there's nothing like that feeling when he's got one of those big brown eyes on you, and they just love you.

You have a place all your own, and a yard with a house, and lots and lots of toys, and beds and food, and you're living the way I need to live and I was doing the best I could.

We knew each other well, and we had lots of conversations about how things would end up with us, and he said he would do what he had to do.

I had decided to be a free man.

He didn't try to run away with them, no, no.

I gave my dog away and I became a free man.

How do I get you back?

It really took care of him, and it took away his fears.

There's lots of dogs out here, but he had a room, and plenty of food.

I went out on a trail with my buddy and I came upon a man who asked me if I could shoot for him.

There's people out here that aren't hunters.

I took the man out on trial, and he wanted to get rid of my dog.

""You're not going to sell my dog, so why don't you sell me one of your dogs?.""

""I like your dogs.""

""That's good, that's nice because that makes us good friends.""

He called his manager.

That's where they're going to catch that dog, and bring him right to me.

I never asked why they needed that dog, but I knew it wasn't for the same reason I gave it to them.

I never sold that dog, but I ended up having to catch a dog, and the man had gotten his dog.

That night, we were sleeping, and I could hear them screaming.

You're a very happy dog, and that makes you a very happy person.

I am sure glad there is a God.

'Cause there's lots of people out here who don't believe in God.

"Prompt: She opened the box; it was empty. Story: 

What happens then??? She turns the box upside down and turns it back over and looks inside and what happened???

It is empty. Continue the story:

The girl puts down the box on the street. She can not believe it. She thinks to herself, ""This has never happened to me before. I usually know when somebody is pretending to be a psychic. They cannot fool me.""

What do you think she thinks about the other psychic?

There are several parts to the story, so each choice represents part of the story. In the first part of the story, your reader thinks: ""I am psychic, but she is psychic too, so she can't be telling the truth."" What is it in the story that causes a different reader to think that the girl must be lying?

Why do you think the girl feels insulted? After all, it is unusual to fool someone twice.

2. Write a story about a girl who is a talented psychic and a boy who is a smart boy who thinks he is a wiseguy. You could name all of them something like ""The Psychic"" and ""Smart"" in this order: ""Who's the smart guy?"" ""The Psychic,"" ""Who's the wiseguy?"" ""Smart.""

In the story, each character in the group meets a problem at the beginning of the story. They each say a thing or something that is important to them to others in the group what happens next?

3. This is an example of two stories told within a story.

Once upon a time there was a boy who was a smart and he was very funny. His family was doing a science demonstration and the mother said to her son, ""Look in the box!"" And he looked in the box. The mother said, ""Is it gold?"" And he said, ""No."" She said, ""Is it silver?"" And he said, ""No."" She said, ""Is it lead?"" And he said, ""Yes."" Continue the story:

The boy then made a wiseguy comment to his friends, ""What's in the box?""

What else is in the story?

Tell the story in two different ways:

1. The story begins: ""Once upon a time, there was a girl who was a psychic and a boy who was a wiseguy.""

What do the girls learn about the boy who makes the same statement?

2. The boy is very smart and can make wiseguy comments.

Read the two versions of the story the next time you are on a train or another moving ride (if it is too long for you to write down the choices):

1. The girl is a psychic and she is a good speller; she really does have ESP and reads my mind. She also is a nice girl, but I am mad at her for lying to me because I am a good speller, not an excellent one like her. I hate her and think I am a fool. Continue the story:

The story goes on the tell the story of the girl's parents who were also good spellers. They had been reading the news out loud in the car all day, and so they are confused when the girl tells them she can tell by looking in their eyes (a little lie) that they are really good spellers. That makes her feel even worse about the situation.

2. One day I'm sitting in the kitchen and I hear Mom say, ""You know this is the one we call the psychic!"" Then she says, ""She is a liar!"" And I say, ""No. What are you talking about?"" Mom says, ""Your mother is a psychic. She can tell when somebody is trying to do something sneaky. Continue the story:

The story continues the idea that her mother, a psychic, is really smart, but the girl is just a good speller who feels embarrassed about her mother.

What do you think would really happen if the boy from the boy and girl story was really smart?

Write another story with a group of three people: the boy, the girl, and the mother. The boys name should be ""The Wiseguy."" The mothers name should be, ""The Good Person."" The girl's name should be ""The Smartone."" The story should go on the tell the story.

4. This is a story about an old friend, James. James and his girlfriend were riding to his friend's house in the car. James tells his girlfriend that his old friend, John, might come by and take him home and pick him up later. The girlfriend disagrees with James because John is an irresponsible and stupid driver.

James, you want the girl to believe you are not really smart to try to trick her into being your girlfriend. What do you think she thinks about the story?

"Prompt: In the future, conventional birth is outlawed, and all humans are produced assembly-line style in factories throughout the world. You are a worker in one of these factories. Story: 

[Transcript written by a fictional reporter assigned to write the birth story for a newspaper that is trying to appeal to a wider audience and be published in an online edition rather than a physical newspaper as the rest of the site's content is]

[Enter into the computer where each employee is provided various tasks and then the day of the month that you will be assigned is highlighted as a flashing bar across the top. To work in this instance, is the day of the month your birth is occurring, in the month of June.]

[Click]

In the blink of an eye, the flashing blue bar changes to yellow as your ID number is called out in an electronic voice that you can't see or hear over the din of your co-workers. Your name is displayed on-screen and your personal identification card is scanned.

[Click]

Your supervisor looks over you for the final time and issues orders for your duties. You don't have it yet…

Your coworker with whom you are assigned is an old friend. This is important because each person has one unique task, and because this person and you are assigned the same task, the two of you may have to work together to achieve your success.

[Your co-worker enters the room and shakes hands with your supervisor.]

[Your supervisor asks a simple question.]

""It is a good thing, isn't it, that we have some time to spend together.

""Because you and I are going to be working together for the rest of our lives to-gether, aren't we?""

""Yes sir, it is,"" you say.

""Good,"" your supervisor says. ""Well, I think we can get started.""

""You mean you want us to…?""

""Yes, I'll tell you what we are doing.""

After your supervisor and coworker leave the room, you take a few moments to collect your thoughts and prepare, and you tell yourself that you will be OK. You think that you now understand what is coming and you are ready. You have trained hard as you have been preparing for your birth for some time.

When your training schedule came, it was clear that your instructor was going to make things as difficult as he could for you. Training is a harsh reality that many people experience as they face their difficult births. The instructor is hoping that the fear you already have from the harsh training regimen will carry over into your birth and cause you to lose your mind.

[Your co-worker has completed their side of a project that may seem tedious, but which they have thoroughly studied and are familiar with. It is important to them that they complete the project because they will have to go back to the company that employs them to complete future projects.]

""It's almost time for us to begin,"" your supervisor announces over the intercom.

""Have you already started?""

""Yes, we have started,"" your supervisor says.

""And, have you already finished?""

""We finished about a half an hour ago, yes.""

""And, it's all correct?""

""We're pretty sure that's all correct,"" your supervisor replies.

""Then, let's get started,"" your coworker says.

You are told that your job is simple: You need to open, check, and clean out each of the five tanks located around the factory. Each tank will be opened, checked, and cleaned out. There are five tanks to do. You are also directed to open all of the windows to each of the tanks you will be working in. You will need to see if all of the tanks are empty and not blocked, and if they are unblocked, you will need to check that each tank is clean. If you find anything that isn't clean, you are to clean it, check it, and then re-open, check, and clean out each tank.

""It will be easy to clean,"" you tell yourself. ""I have been prepping myself for this.""

After being assigned a specific task and being told that they aren't going to train or instruct you on what to do, you believe that the difficult parts of your birth will occur when you receive instructions on what to do.

You look over at your supervisor and say, ""Don't worry, this is easy. I have been prepping for this.""

Your supervisor looks back with a smile on his face and says, ""I know you have. That's what I'm so excited about. You are really doing great.""

You know what you do and what you will do by the time the training ends, and you begin to enjoy doing.

"Prompt: You gain a powerful superpower, but it comes at a great cost. Story: 

Risk and reward

The power is yours, but there’s also a price to be paid. The more people you save the more you’ll find out who’s on your side. Some see you as a hero, while others despise you. But the way you’ve saved them, they’ll have to decide for themselves, and it’ll come back to haunt you one day. Will you be able to redeem yourself?

The game is free to play, no purchase or credit card required, and only takes about 15 minutes to beat. After completing the game you'll be automatically entered into a random prize draw to win a prize, including a $400 Amazon Play gift voucher.

You can also get more in-game power by collecting and combining Superstars, which is the free to play version of Stardew Valley card game. To level up you'll need to find different Superstars to combine and they'll gradually level up too. You can see your star level here.

The key mechanic in Superstars is the Stars ability, which are gained by using them and then spending them to buff other Stars using the 'Use' ability. I really like this system, not just because it feels like they're actually being used but also the way it feels a little different from standard deck building card games like Dominion or Munchkin.

I'm not a huge fan of the art style and design, which I really hope future updates improve on, but it's still good fun for a quick game. The randomness means you'll never play the same game twice and is very addictive, and with new content on a weekly basis it means you're always playing something new.",1
"Prompt: Desperate for research funds, a group of scientists created a highly lucrative, if somewhat embarrassing business. They now have to explain this to a senate committee. Story: 

The researchers started to sell the virus as anti-cancer (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmid/21616081 ). It is a cancer therapy as they claim, but not as we know it: instead of using it to kill cancer cells, they use it to protect normal cells by turning off their defenses.

The company making the medicine has already sold over $300 million worth of it. The government is funding the rest of the research. All the data is public, as you can see at the end of the link above.

But the researchers can’t explain how it works. We can only guess that we are probably dealing with some sort of virus (or some other kind of cell) that infects cancer cells, but this is just a guess. I’d love to learn more about this, but I have no funding. So I can’t do this myself.

For now, let’s focus on the question of whether it should be legal for people to pay $7,500 to get infected with the virus. (Note the last sentence: it is legal!) It is legal to pay someone to get sick? Yes, according to the FDA. Because, you know, you can’t go around causing disease in other people. This is just another way they try to manipulate society, to say, “Yes, we are the good guys now, you may have been tricked, but you are now working for the government.” This whole story sounds like science fiction to me. It’s a bit disturbing, though, isn’t it? I hope that it’s just a misunderstanding: the researchers who wrote these articles for Science, and I have to admit, I didn’t read them all, could be laboring under the delusion that their product really works.

But even if we accept this for a moment, are people who take the virus really helping science? Or isn’t the more appropriate question, “Are those who accept the virus helping society?” The answer may be “yes,” but I don’t really know. As I said, my access to funds is limited, so I can’t really follow up on this question.

I can’t help but wonder what would have happened if one of these people, who paid for a license to get sick, had passed out on the street. Would the police have taken the money as evidence of some sort of racket, or did we just see an act of charity within the boundaries of the law? The researchers were obviously well screened for any communicable diseases, so I doubt that anybody would have gotten sick. Is there a good way to make the virus even more “disagreeable” as the researchers want it to be? If people who agreed to get infected took along a friend who wanted to be infected, could this lead to a better virus? (I suspect not.)

(Note: I don’t mean to imply anything about the people mentioned on the second link. Like I said to my wife (who is also reading this, “you know the guy, he’s got a real sense of humor): “I doubt anyone would pass out on a street in California,” and she agreed wholeheartedly. I’m just wondering about the general principle behind the point.)

For the past two decades, as the world has begun to understand the benefits of using cell phones, this trend has been somewhat consistent across the globe, and it appears that some phones have some degree of built in protection against their use by the general public. At least in the United States of America.

On the other hand, we have a whole other story going on in China. There, the government has decided to start blocking cell phones in public. The first of these blocks began as of last Friday. Here is the reason given:

“Authorities in the city of Yiwu in Zhejiang province said more blocks are needed to avert a “public security emergency” because many residents were using their cell phones to photograph political demonstrations and other illegal activities.

The move against cell phones comes after authorities in other parts of the country, including Beijing, Shenzhen, Quanzhou and Kunming, installed a total of 1,000 such blocks to halt text messaging in public since Friday, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Yiwu is a city of about eight million and a major center of commerce and banking, according to China’s official Xinhua News Agency.”

"Prompt: here you stand, alone again, about to take your own life. Nothing is holding you back now. You decide to look around your room one more time until something catches your eye, and the impact it has on you stops you in your tracks and makes you realize why you ca n't do this to yourself. Story: 

(5) (10) A young teenager with a bright and beautiful smile stands tall and proud next to you, and she hands you an envelope. This envelope has an acceptance letter from Princeton University, Harvard, Notre Dame, Yale... It is a letter to one of them saying that her admission has been accepted along with a hefty and prestigious scholarship. You look at her and thank her profusely for the kindness she is showing you. She doesn't know exactly what is happening, but she wants to help anyway.""

(6) (13) The police finally catch up with you. You tell them everything. They are more than slightly surprised with the story you are now telling them. The next stop is the hospital with an emergency appendectomy. The doctors there have no trouble with your story, and they agree to release you. The police tell you that they will be in touch with you when you are well enough to go home, and you are released.



The next morning, you wake up feeling a little bit of yourself, and you tell the kids that you have the beginnings of an acceptance letter to Stanford. They look at you like you're crazy, but they don't want in any way to prevent you from going, so they just let you go, and you return home immediately afterward. The next weekend, your mother is having a housewarming party for some friends, and it is a big blowout and you are going to make a big impression. You have one last thing to do first. You give your children one last embrace and kiss them goodbye as you leave for the party. You take your bags, an extra sweatsuit (in case you have to spend some extra time in the hospital), and whatever else you might need, and you set off for the party.

(8) (12) When you arrive home that night, you take a shower, wash your hair, and put on some comfortable clothes. You put all your bags outside your room where you can easily get to them in case you need something, and then you are off to bed. You close your door and think no more about it. The next morning, when you wake up, you wonder whether or not this has all been a dream. But you look at your watch, and it reads 1:30 AM. Just when you thought things couldn't get any more unbelievable than they already are, in walks Mr. and Mrs. Smith. They are very kind to you, but they seem kind of confused by all of this. You tell them everything, and they are not at all surprised by any of it.

(9) (11) The rest of the day passes without a hitch, but you decide it would be the best idea to call home before you do too much more. There is no sense in going out of hospital. You get a hold of the hospital, and they tell you that you left from there a few minutes ago in a taxi. You were seen going out with your bags and some sweatsuit you just had to have, but no one can say for sure how you got to your room. No one even heard the car drive off. The taxi driver said that when he took you home, you just told him to ""Drive away,"" so you didn't say a word to him. It's now about 3:00 AM, and you are feeling very tired. You can't imagine how you can possibly get through the rest of the night, but even though you are exhausted, you will probably be awake throughout the night. You have another bag in the closet that you can use if you need it, so you know there is no reason to worry about it. You just have nothing better to do than think about how tired you are, close your eyes, and hope that you don't have to use it. By 6:30, you have fallen asleep again, but this time it isn't for very long, and you find yourself wide-awake around 7:00 AM. Something wakes you up, but you can't quite tell what it is. Suddenly, you hear voices calling for you. Someone knocks on the door of your room, and you decide for some reason or other that this is a good thing. You can't imagine how it can be good, but you hope that maybe they are bringing you something that you can use, or maybe you can at least find out what it is.

Author: Dr. David Baker

What would you say?

This story was originally part of a collaborative effort with other writers including Paul and Steve, and the other authors gave their feedback on the story’s elements as they were submitted. The idea was to see if we could collectively create a story. We’d submit two stories and then choose one to post for discussion. If all worked well it would be published on the site. Unfortunately, because of the complexity of choosing the “winner” some of the writers’ input was not posted and the contest was canceled.

I wrote about the experience in a piece on this site: A collaborative storytelling experiment: Part 1: Introductions. You can click on that link above for the complete article.

I like to read. I enjoy the challenge of trying to put the words I find into the context they seem to belong. I particularly appreciate the challenge of doing this with other people. In my world that tends to entail playing games. (In this sense my life is very different from my partner, Steve, who plays games for a living.)

It was about six months before I entered a college course called Creative Writing III, when I met one of the students in the class. He was a senior (he was very young compared to me). The course was an introduction to the subject and we were each asked to write a story about something we wanted to be the subject of our next work. I ended up writing about love with my writing partner, Steve, and I’m pleased to see that our story was accepted.

Steve and I are currently writing about love and its potential pitfalls and the various roles the partners play in relationships. The story is set in the future after the end of a relationship… so the topic is up to the authors. We want it to be a story that will be fun for our readers to understand and enjoy.

The story we hope to create goes something like this:

“It’s now one year since you and I broke up. You’ll have to forgive my bias but I always prefer to focus on where we came from, and not our mistakes from last year. As you know, I’ve always been against the “break up” cliché. I’ve never really understood why the end of a love affair involves one side saying, “I’m so alone and sad. Do you even love me anymore?” After all, love doesn’t die; it simply lives in other people.

“That leads to a major problem. I don’t think you’re very good at loving other people. It seems to me you don’t take very good care of those you’re supposed to love, and you are selfish. I didn’t want to have to tell you this, but it’s getting difficult to ignore you.

“I know you love me, and that I love you. You can’t make me believe you don’t love me. That’s what I’m writing about. We need to work things out.”

Now I really want you to add your comments to the site. Please include any corrections or comments you may have on my version of this story. My hope is to write a fun story that has some educational content, hopefully entertaining the readers as well as educating them a bit. I think we have the elements for an enjoyable story: romance, a couple in a relationship and the idea that love is not about one-way streets.

We’d love to hear what you think of my version of this scenario. Feel free to add a comment and keep the discussion going.

I received some feedback from the readers on my story and would like to respond to all three of you. I will post the responses as comments over the next few days. If anyone else would be interested in this topic you can write a story and comment on it or comment directly on this post.

Dear Dr. Baker,

I’d like to know a bit more about you and why you created the story.

I’m currently thinking of writing a similar story but I don’t think I want it to be about love.",1
"Prompt: Write a journal entry for a child that has been abused ( mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, sexually, etc ) their entire life .... Story:  ""I still can't believe I am doing what I'm doing and have already made the decision to have [name child's name] in my life. I am amazed at all the pain they have given me, but I have to continue to take care of him or her and put them back in the position they were in, before they got sick or they will have no place in my life. I was shocked to learn about the things that my mother did to us while she was living with us. I now know that it makes no difference what anyone told me, all the people who told me she was a wonderful mother, a good Christian and that ""my mother loved me"" had no idea what went on in that home or with me. But she had to love me and protect me, and did because there was no one else for her.""

Do you remember ever saying to a child, ""You could not possibly hurt me as much as I have hurt you""

If he remembered this statement - I am sure he could come up with 100 other examples as well. I say this to many people and the first reaction is shock - or denial.

The first reaction to feeling pain is to deny it. Why? Because I can not remember (in this case) not having ever said that - when I was a child and my parents were beating me. When pain is denied we don't have to think about whether anything can be done to relieve the pain. Or, if we do - we have very little concern about the pain. It's a case of I have never experienced X before, therefore X exists now; It will never happen again; and I must live in the past.

And here is the result: There is no real healing. We must understand our self destructive behavior as a consequence of learned self defeating behaviors! Once we understand our thinking, our behavior will come into balance. If we have learned for years to deny feelings or pain - the denial is internal. But the thinking is external, and it affects how we view ourselves and how we choose to live our lives.

You're right, and sometimes I even remember having said that to a person. I am so sorry that he or she did not feel loved. I feel so helpless to a person who is being abused and has no way of getting help from the abuser. I have to live with myself and I know what I did. I am a recovering alcoholic so I do see what I have done to get help for myself. I keep learning things about myself and how wrongs that I committed. How do I change, if it not through counseling?

Thank you! I'm so glad that you wrote this because I had the exact same thought. I have been trying to get my husband to help for years with his son. We did the counseling thing and it has become a nightmare. We can only do so much with him. He still drinks, uses drugs and has no life outside of what he does to us. This made me remember what I used to say as a child. I have no way of making up for what I did to my son but the only way to make up for it is to be there for him and try to get him help. Sometimes people can't seem to understand that something happens in your mind and it's hard to understand what you can do to help you when something is going on in someone else's mind. I'm not being mean, just trying to explain how I feel.

I just read this and I know so many of us who are still in the situation of being abused. I, too, try to see if I can make some difference, and am at a loss as to what. I'm still angry and resentful, but I know I must be an advocate for the abused too. I did once tell someone I felt that what I was doing would hurt me, too, to no avail. I try to do my best.

You are right, and I don't just think it. I know that some of the things I said to my son when he was a child did hurt him. I feel terribly guilty for this, yet we couldn't stop what was going on. I think that is why we need a safe place that we can talk about our experiences and all the emotions that come with them so that we can understand ourselves as we are at this time.

Thank you for listening to each other. We have all been there. It takes a lot of love and strength to carry on and be there for others. I am doing my best to live right now and enjoy as much as I can.

I feel so guilty that you said this to him and can't imagine what you did for him. I love you my friend, but sometimes I hate you... I always tell myself this as a justification for",1
"Prompt: The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Story:  Part 3 of A Tale of Two Kingdoms.

Categories: Art, History, Literature, Medieval | Comments Off on A Tale of Two Kingdoms: An Authorial Reversal – Part 3

(Read Part 2 here)

The king was old and infirm, and many were the rulers who came and went from his throne before he died. One day there was a battle, and the king was defeated, and many people died. Soon after, word trickled out to the people that a man named Villequin was king and would bring peace, and that they must not rebel. In the capital, the people called out to Villequin and the others who followed him, warning them about the people who had rebelled, calling the rebels brigands and wolves. Villequin promised them that he and the others who followed him were now in fact the rightful rulers.

The people were pleased about this, and one day the royal army of the rightful rulers was defeated, and many of the people who supported and followed the rightful king were killed and imprisoned. The remaining army of the rightful king then retreated and laid down their weapons.

Those who followed the rightful king were not truly the rightful king. There had been a king before that they should have worshiped; he was named the Great Villequin and was more just than Villequin. The rightful crown had been usurped, and the people were not aware of what had really happened. They did not know that the people who had killed the rightful king were all traitors to the Great Villequin, and that the rightful king and his followers were no longer the true rulers.

The false king and his loyal followers marched on and seized the city gates and locked them behind them. In the city itself, he kept all except two of the faithfuls in prison, and those at liberty would have to be in chains. The rightful king, Villequin, was kept in a dungeon of his own choosing, where he was often tortured. He was not allowed to speak with anyone, and only heard stories the loyal followers told of his greatness, and to hear of the suffering of those people he had killed. These stories were all told to Villequin of how he was the rightful king and all they did was rebel and fight against him, but how now all of it was made up and was not true, and that he was still the rightful king, and of how his enemies had no faith in him.

The loyal followers knew that the people of the city were not happy. They listened as they spoke to their followers and heard one person say, “He promised us that if we kept faith with him that we would not have to suffer any longer. But what happened to the Great Villequin? Has all of this been an illusion?” Villequin asked his servants for some new clothes, but they made fun of him. He said, “Can you not get me real clothes, even better than this, that I can wear for the people? If I look fine, they will not only be happy at my good appearance, but they will obey me.” But it was no good, for the servants of Villequin refused to go beyond his palace to purchase the cloth.

In his prison cell, Villequin thought about this in torment. He thought of his former subjects who did not bow to him, and what they suffered as well as his fellow captives. But he was not aware of why people were suffering, and as far as he was concerned, he was still the rightful king, and his suffering was part of God’s plan. He suffered because he had sinned and was now paying the penalty for his sin. The people of the city, he thought, should not complain. He was as just as the Greatest Villequin. Why were the people suffering? Why did he not have the clothes to be seen as the rightful king, the Great Villequin, and why did his fellow captives have the chains on their hands?

When asked by his followers, Villequin told them all that he thought about on his solitary day’s confinement. “I was chosen by God to rule over the earth and all that God created. I did not do evil to others, but was forced to be put to death by those who did evil and wanted to be kings over the people for their own selfish benefit,” Villequin said. The words he spoke often echoed with truth and love, a love that was so great and pure was that of our very own Lord Jesus.

One day Villequin and others were led to a river where they would be executed, but Villequin shouted loudly, begging the king not to kill him with a knife and telling him",1
"Prompt: You have just been elected the president of the U.S only to learn that every President before you was actually a super villain, and always stopped by one man. The Prime Minister of Canada. Story: )

You enter your office room to find the door locked from the outside, but someone has left the following note on your desk:

Sorry to bother you, but you're not the right person for the job. But please keep trying to get the president to run again!

The reason I'm here is because I found out that one of the super villains will be at the ceremony. I don't know who it is, but we need to get out of here. Any suggestions?

This was actually my story, and I hope that I get to post a chapter tomorrow!! I'm not sure if it will be finished by tomorrow, but it is coming. I really need your help. There is a lot of work to do, and if I take my time with it that can make me a very good writer that people will want to read.

The next morning:

Mr. Smith,

I'm glad to hear that you liked the story, even if it was just on the internet. Well, I had a great idea during the night. Instead of searching for my friend, I had a better idea. I searched for a villain on the internet, and found who he is. I will post the link tomorrow, and you will be able to access it after that.

Thanks again,

Candy

Goodbye Mr. Smith:

You are going to be president of the United States. I'm counting on you to make a better life for our country and the world.

Your life was going extremely well until the end; you saved the world from the evil super villain. You were the president, and that was your dream (since you were four years old; in fact, your dream had begun on the day of your fourteenth birthday), but somehow you feel like you forgot something important. You decide to walk outside for a minute and call a member of the team that saved the world: the Superhero. After you explain everything to him (about how you felt that you forgot to thank them, so he takes the initiative and sends his team to meet you.), his team arrives before long.

In the first person (not in third), you see them approaching you:

Barry Allen: ""Hey!"" You start moving your head towards him, as if to say, 'Hey, I didn't know you. Hi'. But then you realize you're moving your body as well. No, that's not possible!

You were expecting to meet Batman or Mr. Terrific or someone else, not to see some tall guy, but you had seen this guy on TV; he was the Flash.

The Flash: ""Hey! I got that job, the one you wanted me to have!""

You were glad to know that someone got the job, especially after reading about the situation (the article about the Flash in the newspaper). ""Good thing you got the job. Your team leader was right about you. You will make sure the U.S is safe!"" You don't add anything else, but wait until Mr. Terrific appears, he will explain everything in more detail.

Mr. Terrific: ""I'm sorry I'm late."" You say to the Flash, and then to someone you didn't even know was there: ""Hey, who is this guy?"" The Flash doesn't say a word, and Mr. Terrific explains:

""I'm the Flash! I'm the fastest man alive! I'm very fast, and I beat everyone who beats me.""

""How nice of you to show up. Oh, I forgot to tell you, I have to leave right now, but I want you to know that I am glad to finally be part of your team. I've watched the news a couple of times, and I know about your job, but I'm still glad to be a part of this team.""

""Why?"" You ask.

""Because, you have a power that no one else has. You saved us, and we just needed a president who would understand that; so I'm here to help you. The way I see it is...""

""Okay! I need to get back to my office. I hope you'll join our team and stay a couple of weeks until the ceremony."" You say as you walk to the limousine.

""Who is the villain that will be at the ceremony?""

""I don't know who it is, but I'm sure that he will be our guest today.""

""Is it a member of The Justice League?""

""I'm not sure, but I know that Supergirl will also be there.""

""That's great!"" You don't",1
"Prompt: It is a sunny day, you exit your apartment. Walking your way to your work. There is no one around. Suddenly a black van gets nearby you and its door opens. Two man -which wearing black suits, black gloves and black masks- grabs you and throws you into the van. Story:  The men throw up some sort of gags into your mouth. You feel dizzy and you start to pray.

A few minutes later a man with a gun in hand walks into the car. Looking behind himself he sees you tied up by gags of cloth into the back of the van. But he doesn’t know that now. He opens the back door and says “Get me out of here, I’m going to cut your throat”. You are frightened and you start to pray. He pulls you out of the van and puts you into another. The same situation -you walk and find someone waiting for you, who ties you up into the van. Only this time you know the bad guy is not a nice guy but that would not make sense, so don’t think about it. After 5 minutes the van turns into a building. With the man’s hand on the car the men open the back of the van and take something out. The guy grabs you, and then pulls his mask from his face and says “What do you call this?”. You say “It’s a mask of the devil … but … there is a white mark on it”. He looks at you angry and takes a piece of paper and he writes on it, puts it into his pockets and walks out. He leaves you in the building and in 5 minutes a man gets you on a helicopter.

- The devil has a personal agenda, he is trying to win your soul for himself. (he can’t have it!)

- This is a satanic cult, they practice devil worship. (they are Satanists) You should call the police because they are planning to kill you.

- “Are you ready for the devil?” (The devil has a personal agenda, he is trying to win your soul for himself. (he can’t have it!)

- “You will face death for your sins…” (The Devil is tempting you, saying you can go to Heaven if you get on his side)

- “This is our territory…” (They like to kidnap and sacrifice for satanic rituals)

- Satan controls the cult. (They practice devil worship)

- “Do you want to receive Christ?” (The devil is trying to tempt you with salvation)

- There can be other motives. (But satanic cults are very prevalent and that is it in a nutshell)

In the meantime, you found out that the men who threw you into the van, have the same number written on their backs. They are members of a secret society, the Knights Templar.

What’s the motive of the Knights Templar?

The order was formed in the Middle Ages by Christians who wanted to protect the Holy Temple at Jerusalem. They had the belief that the Pope -who was a head of the religion but under the rule of the king- was too corrupt to fight the Muslim Caliphate. Instead the Knight Templars should take the fight to the Caliph himself. The goal was to find the pure and true form of Christianity, a form that could stand up to the Muslims for the battle to come.

For centuries the Templar Knights lived peaceably in the middle east, even though they had to protect their secret society from the Muslim rule who would make them pay to be hidden away from the world.

As the Knights Templar members went into the field to protect the holy lands, they left all of their wealth behind. Money did not exist for them, it was their sole purpose to fight in the war against the Muslims.

During the Crusades the Christian armies were not fully successful in stopping the Muslims, and while many died fighting, they failed to defeat the Muslims militarily. The only way to win, was if a force would attack the Muslims where they stood at their religious beliefs. Then the Christian armies would be able to attack an open field and there was a better chance for success in that.

That was part of what the Templar Knights did.

After every battle the Christian forces had the money to rebuild, but they could no longer raise the money to build on the scale needed to take back what was lost. The Templar Knights were the only force that had the power that could afford to raise the money. That’s why they started doing it. They raised the money to rebuild by having “unholy” business activities, including the selling of wine, sex and drugs to the troops, making them spend their lives in slavery instead of dying in battle",1
"Prompt: Science and Magic are merely opposite sides to which the pendulum of time swings. It has leaned for the past few centuries towards the Laws of Science but even now it begins to return ever faster back towards the Laws of Magic. Story: 

And here you can see the first of the three great gates - the one which, if you have followed our story thus far, is in reality not a gate at all but rather a window looking out over a scene. The scene is the same as before, but the window itself is different. It is smaller than in the image, it is made of glass and it is surrounded by stones with strange and mysterious sigils carved into them.

It is a gateway.

We must not be distracted by the sigils; they are not the real purpose of this gateway. Once we are through, we will see a room much more grandiose than this, and we will be given a task which will challenge our very lives within. But there will be no sigils, no mysterious sigils, and no magic. We go through the gateway to escape the Laws of Science.

We cannot tell whether it is a gateway to or from somewhere because we are currently looking directly within the scene at the window, so this gateway could be one of many portals that connect the Realworld to the Unrealworld.

We know that there is something that we need to access that is inside the room with the three great doors, but it is not accessible through these doors. We must go through the window. The window is an entrance into a scene. It is a doorway to the Realworld.

We need some way of knowing when we are in the right scene to gain access to the gateway. And because the Realworld is invisible, the only way to find what we need to do and get out is to wait until we are in the right scene.

The only way to get into the right scene is to create it ourselves. The only way to make things happen in the right scene is to force whatever we need to happen to occur. There is no way for us to avoid experiencing these magic-less laws; if we are to succeed, we will have to use them ourselves. We cannot get out without doing whatever it is we need to do to go through this gateway and the doorways to the other scenes. The only real alternative is to go through with them. To experience, in every way, the laws of science.

We will have to choose. And the choice is ours.

We must go through the window. We cannot go back - the windows into the scene are not merely entrances to it, rather their only purpose. We went to the Realworld through a window before, but the window was made of glass and looked out on a beautiful and safe place. This window looks out on that which is, and is not, safe because it is unsafe. But there are two other windows, and they look out, too, into the same scene.

The first window looks out at the scene within the room. This window is a door looking out and we can go through it quickly. But the second window looks out nowhere, into a scene of nothing; it can take a very long time to pass through it. However, if we choose the second window, we will not get out, instead we will become part of the scene.

We must choose. But how can we know which of these windows to take until we are in the right scene? We cannot. We must wait until we are there then we must see.

One of the windows, no matter which, will open in front of us, and with a flash we must make a decision, the same decision, really, as before.

To create, and not be, or to learn, and be, and to create, and to learn.

There are ways that we could use magic to create a gate to another scene without having to wait, but it is not really magic. If we had a magic machine that could do that, perhaps, but that would not be magic. There is no magic that can get us into another room, and from the window out of it. We already know if we want to go or not so the only things left to decide are the speed at which we wish to pass through, and what we want to see before we do so.

Inevitably, once we make our decision, the scene will change in front of us and we must enter it.
Here we see the full vision as it is seen from within the scene.

But when the window opens, all will be revealed. The window is too small to contain the entire scene but it certainly contains the entirety of the interior of the room. It opens out into a beautiful view, a view that, although no one can see it from within the scene, we can see. It shows us what lies beyond this gateway. It shows us the",1

Chapter 3. A war of words.

The story begins here.

""So, when the ice melted you could see a new world coming out.""

A young black-furred woman and young white-furred female nodded in unison.

""We would just make music together and travel,"" the white-furred said, ""The Earth was so open compared to here. It was great...""

The black-furred pointed to a nearby mountain. ""The peak is ours and you can see that the ocean used to be just like this.""

The white-furred sighed, ""It's so different than here, the place has its own language. What happened to us?""

The white-furred answered, ""It happened when the other two came. They are fighting for power...""

""Why are we talking about it at a time like...""

""Because you brought it up."" The white-furred retorted. ""It's just a war of words...""

""Just because I want to know how to talk doesn't give you the right to act like my mom.""

""That's not for you to decide. We are talking about the world.""

The black-furred pointed to the sky, ""At times I wonder how to do it differently. But then I talk to my friends, when they tell me their world..."" She waved her hand, ""I can feel the wind and the air, the feeling of the land below, I can't compare it to how it is here.""

A male voice spoke, ""I understand, sometimes I feel like I hear the sound of the waves rolling on a beach when I listen to my band, but you don't see...""

The white-furred looked at the black-furred who nodded and said, ""I understand...""

The black-furred pointed to the ocean, ""It's so cold, the water...""

""Why aren't you making music at times like...""

The voice interrupted, ""If you think they are fighting...""

""Because you are fighting with words, not fists."" The black-furred said calmly. She turned to the two females, ""If you want to have an actual war just go right ahead, if you do...you'll meet our friends"" She pointed to a far left.

""Just because I've talked to different world doesn't give me the right to be a ruler."" He answered.

""I know, you just want to feel the wind and the ocean, how hard is it to...""

""Why not...""

The white-furred turned towards the black-furred, ""That's enough now. Please just come live with me...""

She left as the black-furred began to yell, ""You're too stubborn, you always talk like that.""

The white-furred and the male looked at each other, ""Why should I agree to live with...""

""Because we're talking about life.""

The black-furred looked towards the sea, ""Life it so beautiful there, I wish I could see it...""

""Yes life in his world is so beautiful.""

""I'll...""

""Yes, I'm sure you will.""

""You don't understand...""

The black-furred turned towards the male and was about to reply when a loud explosion shook the planet. People screamed in the area the black-furred and the white-furred were standing. They ran back and forth trying to find out what happened.

""What was that.""

""It was so loud, were you able to see it?""

""I just saw it...""

The sky above the planet cracked and the entire area was filled with purple light. When it cleared the atmosphere was still filled with smoke. A man in white walked out of the smoke, ""It's over.""

""But what was it?""

""The other team won, my god it's over.""

The black-furred and white-furred ran to the man, ""What happened...""

""We had the power because we had the music.""

""The same music?""

The first female looked around a bit, ""Wait, are you talking about that?""

The black-furred and white-furred looked at each other, ""Your friends told you about the power because you had the music?""

"Prompt: NASA makes their Mars announcement. Turns out, they 've discovered the location of MH370. Story: 

The team then determined that the new location is on the western portion of the Indian Ocean floor. The area is about 3,500 to 4,900 feet beneath the ocean’s surface.

That’s a big jump from their previous theory, which was that it might be buried in the seabed near Western Australia, roughly 2,600 feet below the surface there. That’s almost 3 miles, a jump of over 12,000 vertical feet.

This new location is also much closer to the search area than the previous theory, meaning it would have more likely been found sooner. It should also be easier to recover.

The original search for Flight 370 involved two planes based in Australia that were looking for an oil slick. The planes covered a massive area and turned up nothing.

And yet they’re still going to keep looking.

“The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 will remain a top priority, and we will continue to support the lead agencies involved in the search over the coming months,” says John Goglia, one of the two experts behind this new theory.

According to ABC News, the search and rescue agency’s head of search and rescue, Tim Morris, said he hopes this new search will be successful.

“That’s what we want – to have a solution and to find out exactly what happened to the aircraft, hopefully within two years, if everything goes according to plan,” he said.

The search will be conducted by a Royal New Zealand Navy ship and a private ship. The new search could also involve some underwater robots. Morris says they hope to launch within two weeks.

That’s a lot of time. In the meantime, authorities in Australia are still trying to figure out how to deal with the massive pile of shit that the world has been made into.

A friend of mine recently lost a family member in a plane crash. He asked me as a friend to check the list of the final destination of said plane and came across a name that sounded familiar. Apparently, that person had to go through a list of final destination of flight searches in order to check where the body went. The name on the list didn't sound familiar so I assumed that it was a different person, and that there were multiple corpses on that plane.

So I decided to look into this some more. My first port of call was the FBI site, who, according to their FAQ page, ""provides victims with basic information regarding their lost loved one's trip or trip history."" There's just not much that I'm capable of getting done about it now.

I then went to the National Transportation Safety Board website, who provide the same kind of information for the flight path, but without as much in the way of the actual passengers, as I'm interested in: nothing there specifically for that flight path.

The National Crash Database allows me to search for the final destination of Flight 370 without a specific flight number. In this, I find nothing of note about my source's flight: The plane simply vanished. I then go back to the website to try and find more information. Unfortunately, no such luck: There are too many different airline websites.

There are a few flights that have ""found"" the plane; ""The aircraft is missing"" according to the Australian authorities; yet another flight that found the wreckage; a ""possible"" report of the plane being down near Timor, Indonesia, and a sighting near Vietnam, but no confirmation of its location or the passengers or crew that were on board, and who, I'm sure, had all died out from being sucked out of their lives to come back as zombies and have to face the fact of their loved one dying before them.

There are over 70 flights at one point in time, that reported in the search zone, from as far back as one month to as recent as two weeks ago. I'm finding quite a lot of new flights, especially in the past 10 days, and none of them have any information attached (other than one flight that said it's searching for wreckage for two days straight).

Then it hit me: A huge pile of shit had been made. A heap had been formed and was steadily growing. There is more than one pile of shit on this world, but this pile is particularly large. It took a while to form. In fact, I don't think I have been able to think of this incident without it suddenly seeming like I was remembering a dream from my past that I could now, now that I have the means to travel back in time, investigate more. It's possible that this pile was forming for several hours.

In fact, I'm just finding one incident at one time that shows me a few things. One incident, when",1
"Prompt: Years ago, you made a deal with the Devil to be granted a single wish. All your memories of the deal were then wiped. Years later, your wish is fulfilled and you are about to find out what price your younger self was willing to pay to make it come true. Story: 

I was walking back to the hotel. I knew it was foolish, but as I closed in I still couldn’t turn away. I could only hope that that wasn’t him standing out front. I could only hope that if he saw me, he wouldn’t try anything on.

“I can make a deal with you as well,” my younger self said as he approached.

“No,” I said, turning to leave. “I will not be part of it.”

He was standing in the middle of the street with his back turned. It appeared that he wore the same clothes as before and was in his own world as he stood and watched the rest of the world passing. It seemed as though nothing around him really mattered.

“I can make a deal with you as well,” I tried my best to explain it to him. But it never seemed to get a reaction out of him.

“You may make a deal, I just can’t be part of it,” he said. For that brief moment I would have done anything to make him go away, but he would not back off. I saw my younger self turn to look at me for a brief moment and his eyes never focused on me.

“You made a deal with the Devil,” he said.

Forgetting my good intentions I ran up to my younger self and grabbed him by his arm.

“What did you mean when you said I made a deal? Was it that you made a deal with the Devil and wanted my help?”

He turned around and turned to look at me; his eyes were no longer vacant. I could tell that he was really annoyed and I could also feel the anger through us. My older brother was always there when there was a dispute between my father and I. I always wished to make things easier for me. Things got easier when we would go to my father’s den where he would always be playing his music. By the time my eyes adjusted to what was really going on, I was always surrounded by my brothers, I would try and find where my father was. He would always sit outside on a swing he would always hold on for dear life just as he did as a child. I would try to look for the two of them sitting and talk with him. My father always had a cigarette between his fingers; he would never blow smoke and he was always ready to hear something he would love to hear. I could always feel his mind at ease just as he was. My older brother would always stand behind him with that same cigarette as my eyes would always light up. Just as I would begin to relax, out of nowhere my older brother would jump right in front of me. His eyes would always be in the same direction as his father. I would say his name and smile. My father never even noticed he was gone as I would get into the swing and just listen to the music.

“No matter whose help I need, I need yours,” my younger self said coldly.

I would still look around for my brother but he was now standing in front of me.

“We could make a deal together, I’ll help you,” I added.

My younger self seemed to not be paying attention at all to what I was saying. He looked back at the road he was walking on.

“I know you need this right now, but is there anything else you need?” I asked.

He began to look a little more at me. But I could still see him in the other world. “I need to get a different shirt from my own closet,” he said. “I’d like to get a new one.”

“What size shirts do you wear?” I asked.

My younger self said he was a 34. I couldn’t help but laugh just a little bit. That was not very big at all. He was still an innocent boy as he looked at me. I hoped to help but I knew that I probably couldn’t.

“Why do you need one more shirt?”

"Prompt: Villages are laid to rubble and countless lives are ruined ... all over a bag of chips Story: 

I have a friend named Mike. (If you know me, you don't really need a name and an introduction. If you don't, just read.)

""Mike"" is the kind of guy that always has one thing on his mind even though he rarely mentions it. The problem is, everyone around him has to be talked into it - which means that he'll just continue to dream big. This is good, he's got a positive spirit about him. His dreams are great. He's a nice guy, he could've had the world. But he just doesn't seem to find it anywhere. Not in his past, not in your neighborhood, no place.

One morning he comes into the office after a big night, and says, ""I met your boy Mark the other day...""

""Did you catch the World Series this year?"" I quickly interrupt him (I've always had a thing for sports - especially the Cubs).

""Naw.... it was that guy from the restaurant that you told me about - you know. The one who always asks what he can get you.""

""Shit,"" I mutter to myself. He's just gone into one.

""Oh. Well, anyway. He told me that he's in an insurance firm too, and that he just bought a company that'll probably make him a hundred grand and then some by next year. And...""

This is when Mike starts to get real excited. His eyes are shining and the tone in his voice changes - it gets deeper and clearer and more serious. ""Anyway, he said he needs two people to work full time at a discount rate in the new company and would I be willing to join them.""

I'm sitting there listening, and I say, ""Yes. What else?"" But in my ears all I can hear is the same phrase I kept hearing the night before. ""Shit.""

Then it hits me all of a sudden. ""You mean you were talking about me. You're going to work at that company too.""

""Yeah,"" he replies as he looks over at my desk full of pictures and the pictures of my family.

So what did I do? I just sat there listening and listening for a while and then looked at him. ""So, is that gonna be OK?"" I asked him.

""Oh, sure, that'd be OK. I was only planning on staying for six months.""

I said, ""Mike, this is just how the world works, man, you can get what you need if you work for it a little at a time, just be patient and it'll happen for you too.""

Maybe I was right. Because this time I said ""Yes"" and not ""Shit.""

***

My friend Mark and I worked at an insurance company for about a year. My job was to go to a different branch office each week. Sometimes he'd call me and we'd talk, other times I'd go. Occasionally, it would just be me.

At my office there were three of us that didn't have enough seniority to work in the area (because they'd already hired someone new), so they placed us in another office. But I didn't just sit there and wait.

I started talking to some of the salesmen and managers in the office. I told them that I had an opportunity of something, but that it could be good, or it could be great, or maybe it could be bad, but if it was good they needed me, and if it was bad I wouldn't need them, and if it was great they'd still need me, but this was only if they wanted me that is.

I kept a record of all of the salesmen and managers that they had to deal with - both the good and the bad. I didn't want anyone to have a second chance. In case something went wrong, I had my own backup.

I would call and say, ""Hi there. I'm Michael Licht, I know you have to deal with me sometime. How is it going in here?""

This was the ""Hello, can I help you?"" thing. This was the thing to keep a smile on your face when it was bad.

If it was good, I asked if they still needed me. Sometimes, it was better to just get out of the office with a job.

So the salesmen and managers told me which ones that they wanted me with. And I said, ""Are you kidding me? I like this company - I love this company. I've taken the time to learn what they do - it's a great place to work with great people. Please. Do you need me? I would love to stay here.""

"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story:  “The great thing about writing is that it forces us to pause and take a look at the past. Just as a writer does.” Your letter or story, what will it reveal about you?

What would a poem about the life that was, say a memorial poem, do for you? Or the life that you’d like it to be, or the life you think the world must be missing out on? What if you wrote the story of your life—of the life that could have been? Or the life you want the world to look at? Is there anyone that you haven’t even told this story to? Or a story you haven’t been able to tell it to, yet? Who will be your “reader,” the person you tell it to?

As we write more letters (stories really, but I’m not talking just to yourself so you can write your story), what do we see, hear, and do? As we write about what we want, do, or think we know, we change. We see that we are, in some way, a product of the world we live in, but what is it “our” world that shapes us, and what is it shaped of? In the space that opens up as we try to do the difficult and challenging work of not making excuses but getting out of our comfort zones, we will be faced with the uncomfortable reality of the world we live in, and how it is formed. We write our letters and stories to ourselves, the other me, our readers and we become, over time, not who and what we thought we were, but what we need to be. Over time, we write the world you live and the world that you dream of as you begin to see the truth.

What would it take for you to tell a story about the life you never could have, the one that you were always meant to, your life; the life that could have been, your life? What would it take for you to write it down, to tell someone else the story of this life that could have been? Write it down, tell it and see what happens, to find out if you can write a new story, a better story. Do it first for you, and then for others. Don’t be a reader—be the writer.",1
"Prompt: Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You do n't. Story:  A letter arrived from your 18-year-old within a year of giving birth saying he regretted being one of you the gift you received that is one of many time travel gifts you can have or not have.

This story begins with a boy giving his present to his mother for his 18 birthday. His present is from their time travel. His dad is a physics researcher.

Within a year after birth is your present you recieve and a letter from your 18- year old saying he's sorry he wasn't one of you, he regrets he missed the opportunity to be one of you.

Do you believe your present is from another time? If so does your mother have a copy of your letter (even if it's been destroyed). Does he have a copy of it? Do you see his parents as another father and mother.

Story from a time travel lover's point of view: I love stories where time travel occurs.

A girl's best friend has a secret. She has known him for 6 years, since they shared their first time travel gift. She says she has never met anyone else who travels through time as much as she.

Their parents are divorced. He lives three minutes later in the year in which they live. The last time they traveled together was 10 months ago. She says she misses all the other times they have traveled, but that the first time they did the travel together. The gift they received wasn't their first. It was a present just like the one she received from him the last time they traveled together. She says her gifts have never been from him. Her parents seem genuinely pleased that their daughter has a friend who travels. She likes the gifts she gets from him (although she's never seen that much detail) but she doesn't mind the lack of detail in the ones she got from him that time.

She asks him if he's afraid that one day she might meet someone else who travels through time more than she does. He smiles and says, ""Oh no. It's not a contest.""

She's so shocked, she stammers. ""What is that about?""

""I just wanted to make sure we kept our relationship to a secret,"" he responds.

""Why?""

He says, ""A lot of people in our society are not very fond of those who get ahead or try to get a leg up on others in a contest. There are a lot of those people. This is more our secret than your secret. Even though the gifts I send to you aren't the real gifts that I give to you, they have enough detail in them the same as the ones I do to you.""",1

Dale

Hello Dale,

So, how's camp? Your mother tells me that it's the last day of school and you guys have a game on Saturday. When you get home tomorrow, I need you to give me an evaluation on the game.

Thanks,

Papa Elf

P.S. The Santa letters are gone and you don 't want to give them back.

Dale

Dear Santa,

I'm going up to the mountains on the first day of deer season. I 'll probably kill a few birds, and I might even bring home some venison. If there's something that you want, you can come down to the base of the mountains. I'm a pretty good shots man and can get you a deer if I can 't kill one on my own.

The elfs are great to me, though I have to watch out for them sometimes. Sometimes they get too hungry and the elfs will try to force a candy bar down my throat. This was after I saved the kids from an avalanche a few years ago, but I can 't tell anybody that. They won 't believe me now. You can 't always get your way.

I'm not much of a story teller. Sometimes I 'd read a book if you come down and tell a story.

Thanks for the letter. And remember, you could bring you a gift on the mountain, because I can take it to camp later.

10/18/11

Dale

Dear Santa,

Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry that we haven 't heard from you in a while, but the snow kept me up pretty late last time, and I don 't know if I 'll hear from you again this year. You should try and write more often. You can 't expect me to tell you your own faults.

Thanks for the advice. Yes, I 'll bring down that gift on the mountain and give it to the kids on Christmas day. Of course, I only give gifts to them during the week, but the weekend is Christmas.

Well, I have to go now. Thanks for the letter again.

10/23/11

Dale

Dear Santa,

If you get this letter, bring a gift, because this is the last time I'm taking mail up the mountain. I know the kids are pretty excited to see Santa, but I won 't be able to deliver a gift to them. I need a little time to pack up and drive home.

Please bring your gift to us soon. The kids and I want to open it Christmas morning.

Thanks for the letter and the candy cane. You are a cool elf.

This year I won 't be with the big kids. My old man has sold the farm and I'm gonna be living at my sister's house after Christmas. I'm getting a little bored here. I saw some of that candy cane you sent. I think it's inedible, but you didn 't know that.

The boys were pretty good when they were your size. Even before you found the candy cane, I wasn 't able to stop them from fighting. What's your name? Your sister said that you were named for the old man. It's kinda weird. A little elf named for an old man. Do you get paid for this?

I have to go now. I have to change my clothes before I head out to take some stuff down to my cousin's place.

Thanks.

Hey, how's it going? I can 't be sure, but I think I've lost weight. I can 't be sure who's been sneaking my food.

Just kidding. I was gonna ask about the candy cane.

Thanks for the letter. I hope I 'll write you next Christmas.

Hi Dale,

Here's your gift... again! We don 't have a tv at my sister's house and we don 't let a lot of people drive around the neighborhood. I can 't tell if those people are you or not. Did you find a way to write back?

Sorry, gotta run now. Let me know if you've heard from the big guy this year.",1

The moon is a perfect laboratory for studying how the sun creates and supports the climate that we see on Earth.

In this episode of the Planetary Radio podcast, we visit the Moon with the International Lunar Observatory in California. We discuss topics important to understanding the Moon. We also discuss how the Moon affects the tidal bulges in oceans, affect tides, the moon’s impact on the planet, our experience, what’s in store for the future, and much more! Here are a few of the many topics we discuss:

Solar Eclipse and the Moon: https://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/guest-blogs/a-lunar-eclipse-by-the-moon-the-solar-path-and-the-earth.html

We also explore another topic on our planetary radio show: The Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project: https://lirrec.gsfc.nasa.gov/lior/

Here are a few facts about the Lunar Eclipse:

The Solar eclipse ends at 14:16 UTC (local time).

The Moon rises just under 20 minutes late.

The Moon sets at 17:44 UTC.

This is a total eclipse of the corona during which the center of the Sun will be completely covered.

The Moon covers 99.3% of the Sun’s surface.

Only the Moon and the Earth are in contact during totality. The Moon moves into and out of contact with the edge of outer atmosphere.

The eclipse duration is approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes, but the eclipse is total for more than an hour.

The total duration starts the moment the Moon fully covers the Sun and lasts for more than two hours.

The Moon will reappear at 14:51 UTC – but it will take an hour for the moon to be back in full view.

The path of totality will pass over the following cities:

-Chicago

-Cedar Rapids, Iowa

The path of the lunar eclipse will pass over the following cities:

-Rio De Janeiro

-Buenos-Aires

The path of totality will pass over the following cities:

-Johannesburg, South Africa

-Durban, South Africa

-Port Elizabeth, South Africa – South of Australia.

-Brisbane, Australia.

-Broome, Australia

-Broken Hill, Australia

The path of totality will start at a few minutes after 6:16 UTC.

The first Moonrise (the Moon setting over the horizon, from the horizon) will be at 6:46 UTC.

At 10:48 UTC, the Moon will start to set at the horizon (the Moon will completely disappear over the horizon).

The last Moonrise (the Moon setting over the horizon) will be at 17:59 UTC (just before sunset)

Moonrise will occur at 15:12 UTC (11 minutes after sunset).

Moonrise will be at 10:15 UTC (a few hours after sunset).

"Prompt: Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate. Story: 

Now your roommate's life has a new dimension. He is a constant presence – always there when you need him, but also a bit of an enigma.

He wakes up on your side of the bed. He can see you in late afternoon while you're doing work. He knows if you were working late, have you been home yet, when you'll be coming home. Your roommate has a right to know these things.

You are now on the receiving end of the occasional dirty sock, your roommate's ""I have too much laundry and it's taking days to dry"" story.

Your roommate has no desire to move out. He has no need to. Your roommate is happy to share a home. He understands your work is important. Your roommate would be just as happy in the garage as in the basement. His roommate is more than welcome to stay just as you are.

You spend many nights out. Not all nights. You get to know the roommate, and realize he has his own life, and even more importantly, is his own person.

The two of you share many activities, and your roommate is there to be part of things that really matter to you. Your roommate is with you at your wedding. Your roommate is with you at your first apartment. Your roommate is at your graduation. Your roommate is there to help you move and pack and do all the things you might dread.

So, what's a fair amount? It depends. It's fair to share a living space with a roommate, so having a roommate who can understand that you are working and living is a big bonus. But having a roommate on the ""all the time"" end of the spectrum is a bit different, and requires some negotiation.

Your best course of action is to decide upon a fair amount. Then, discuss the terms with your roommate as you come to understand each other best. Ask yourself:

How long can you really count on your roommate being in your home? If the answer is ""all the time"", then you might want to discuss a new financial arrangement. A roommate with no fixed time period could be a good choice, but you'd want to discuss the roommate situation and the issues that can impact roommates. A roommate who takes over the primary residence and is there all the time isn't likely to care about the other reasons you're looking to get out of the residence. If you are in a dorm, and can expect everyone in the hall to be there every day, perhaps this is too big of a commitment. In which case, perhaps a room at a fraternity, sorority, etc. would be a better idea. You'll get to enjoy the life of a house, have a roommate or a set of roommates with an end term that may include a graduation, a move to college/university, or a move back to home.

For the person who really does work or does school, but isn't interested in a roommate and feels they can handle taking out an option that is more than 3 months: maybe this space suits your situation very well. Just make sure the terms of your lease are clear.

Having a roommate has been a good choice for most people. It's nice to have someone there when you are tired and need someone to talk to. It can be stressful for roommates if things go wrong. If it's not quite what you're looking for, you might ask your local rental agent to see if they can line up something else for you. It could be that your apartment complex doesn't allow pets.

In this guide, we provide an overview of the main factors to take into account when selecting your new home to rent. You also find the answer to the question, ""Can you buy a house?"" with lots of tips you can follow, and other useful real estate information.

Why Rent?

Renting an apartment or home is the most common means of living in the United States. Renting may not be your first priority, but the good news is that renting is more cost effective and convenient than buying your home.

You pay one monthly rental fee, but the initial purchase price includes the rental price or your new home. You can move when you like, when you have the money, and when you are ready. Plus, you can always choose different size of rooms and the number of rooms when you rent.

If you are unsure about the process of buying real estate, it might be worth you taking a look at our page ""How to buy a home: A step-by-step guide"".

As the only surviving Tails, it's not just you that are in danger, but the entire world.

Tales have it that one day, the sun would have been swallowed, by the Moon, and the planet itself would've been engulfed in darkness. The Moon, and the Moon alone, was known to have given the Tails of Time their power. But how can the Moons be swallowed? And how can the planet be engulfed in darkness? Some of the Tails of Time themselves are still searching for a answer. One Tales, however, said that the Tails of Time didn 't have their power in the first place. Something's gonna go really wrong.

You're the only one left after your entire group was wiped out by the darkness, save for You (who's a young cat boy and is being called a 'Tails of Time'). You want to stop the evil Organization from taking over the world, so you search for a new set of power. You search, and finally come across a mysterious box containing one of the four great Tails of Time. You and the new set of tails search and find some more power, and become The Tails of Time!

You are the hero of your world, The Tails of Time. You have the power to fly in any direction with the use of your feather-like tails. The Tails can take any form: humans, animals, a giant, a giant-cat, or even a rocket ship. You can change your form with ease, but the drawback is that your form cannot change any objects or anything else in your surroundings. You will need to use your power to fight evil... and find new friends too.

You are the Tails of Time, a young cat-boy. You live in a small village in the middle of nowhere, with the Moon being your home. Everything seems normal around you, except for certain facts. You've got feathery tails. And the people around you are starting to act strange.

The Tails of Time is a new Tales game that features over 200 adventures. You 'll need to combine your skills, as the world becomes more dangerous than ever. The villains will try to stop you from saving others, and are even more dangerous than the monsters you encounter every day.

Tales of the Tails tells the story of a series of Tales games. While most of them were published in Japan, not a single one of them released in the States as of this time. The Tales of the Tails collection series consists of Tales of the Tails 2: Return to Mysterious Tower, Tales of the Tails 2: Reki's Challenge and Tales of the Tails 2: Eien no Monsho. This game will also contain all the special features present in most Tales games: the ""Gift"", the ""Story Mode"", and the character upgrades.

Story Mode will allow players to explore the game world and unlock new content by visiting locations from the game. The various locations in the world will contain items, enemies, items, and much more, which players can visit. Players will be able to find them all, so they'll not miss anything.

In addition, the game will include the ""Gift"", which will allow special transformations for the three main characters. Players will be able to change their body types for one of the main characters by going through their dream. Players will also be able to create special accessories for characters by going through their dream. Using their dream, a player can upgrade some of the equipment in the game.

The stories and graphics of Tales of the Tails 2 are the same as the ones in Tales of the Tasks, save for a few things here and there. The characters look quite similar to how they looked when the original Tales of the Tails was released. This game also includes all the new features present in most Tales games.

Tales of the Tails 3 is a Tales game that's set in a world where the moon is swallowing the world. You, along with three mysterious cat-boys, must stop the evil organization 'The Syndicate' from absorbing all the power. You must do so by collecting seven ""Moon Stones,"" and by searching for the other three Tails of",1

I can go on and on without a wife, right?""I told myself that a divorce is never a good idea. My wife wants me to say this because she wants credit.

"Prompt: A hole in time and space opens up, and you see your younger self looking back at you. You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes. Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response. Story:  Here’s a story about time travel – and the Internet.

I want to be a programmer so, after spending my last year in a pre-college track, I signed up for a programming class. All my friends were planning to be nurses or teachers. It seemed silly to spend years at university after high school only to do something as silly and unfulfilling as taking care of people as you grew old.

I started studying philosophy as a senior in high school with the hope that I would be free of the traditional career plan I had before. All those years of university meant I lost the chance to follow the crowd and take risks that could have made me more well rounded. Sure, my career choices would end up paying well; however, I couldn’t be sure how fulfilling they would be.

In college, the philosophy class got the best results. I had heard the philosophers had a lot of fun and it didn’t feel like homework at all! It was something I could have fun with, and maybe even enjoy. We learned more things about the world and the universe in a two hour class than I had learned on my own in all my high school years. If I had to choose a career in philosophy, this would be perfect.

After I graduated, I joined a company. My friends and their friends, some of whom I had worked alongside at my high school, all had jobs in the company I joined. Almost all of us, in fact, were still working there two and a half years later.

It seemed like I had been there half of my first year when one day, I got wind of a job I had never heard before or even seen written down anywhere. It sounded like something out of a science fiction novel. The prospect of working in a time machine seemed too good to be true.

I signed up for an interview for the position, but I didn’t get the job. Why? Because the manager could tell I didn’t take the idea of working in a time machine seriously. He was afraid I would quit if I found out what the job was. He was convinced I would think it was childish to spend my time doing something as dull as repairing broken time machines.

As you can see, time travel came with a certain risk: the chance of losing my job or giving up on the thing I dreamed of. The first thing it occurred to me was the answer I had given. I don’t know what I would have said before the time tunnel closed – maybe that I would have gotten another interview – but the point is I was too afraid to say a thing.

I was afraid to tell time-me I was scared. I was afraid it might affect my life. I was afraid to say how bad I felt. I was afraid of being labeled stupid.

If there ever was a reason to go back in time, it was to change how I felt about a job opportunity – and maybe I could have changed how I responded in my first interview instead. Not doing as well on that job wouldn’t have cost me my dream, of working on a time machine all day long.

What makes time travel so powerful is its promise to help you get what you want. If we are afraid to ask for what we want, we lose access to our power.

We can think of time travel as a way into the past, but we can also use it as a way into the future.

I would even go so far as to say time travel is one of the most powerful ways we have in becoming who we want to be. In other words, the biggest reward from time travel is to find out who we are.

If we are afraid to ask for what we want, we lose access to our power. If we are afraid to take risks, we lose our chance at being extraordinary. The past is filled with people who were afraid of something and missed out because of it. We can’t make that mistake.

We can all learn something from time travel to this day: we can all learn to take chances. As you work on your future this week, why not stop and think:

What would you do differently if you thought you had one minute to change what happens next?

In the end, being afraid to say “I love you” is just as bad as being afraid to say “I’m sorry”. To truly take charge of your life, you have to say the words. No excuses allowed!

The most important part of your education is not the learning of new facts – as useful as that is. The",1

This article presents an overview of the Ten Commandments, the book of Luke, the story of Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. A discussion of these topics will be followed with questions for further thought. What is the Ten Commandments? Luke's Gospel is the story of Jesus, the Son of God, who came to save sinners from their sins and to become their Savior. It is also the story of God's plan to save sinners, starting with God's chosen people, Abraham, and continuing through Jewish and Gentile believers in Jesus. Luke opens with the birth of Jesus and then relates to us the events that lead to a...

The first question that comes to mind is, what is a soul? The word soul is usually defined as a spiritual being or part of a being. Soul is defined as that which endures through death. We all know that we have a body and that we need a breathing body to live, but beyond that, we often wonder about our souls and whether or not they are separate from our body.
We do know that God created us in His image. God created us and He made us in His image. What is the image of God? God created us as an image of Himself. We are similar to...

This lesson on the Book of Genesis continues our examination, how the Bible can be accurately compared to the history and culture of ancient times. As previously noted in the Bible and the News, there are two different kinds of histories. The history of ancient times is written by humans from their perspective in an account or chronicle. We remember the events of the past, what we know as history, in two ways: chronicles and eyewitness accounts. The latter is simply a term for recounting an event based on personal observation.
Both kinds of histories...

In this lesson on the Book of Genesis, we read about the creation of the first human couple: Adam and Eve. We 'll look at the relationship of the Bible to ancient cultures; read stories of the ancient past; study the life of humanity from the earliest days to the end of the Book of Genesis; and answer questions.

"Prompt: You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries. You come back to see millions of people suffering, in pain and hopeless. How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind? Story: 

Hades is enjoying the world. He's sitting in his castle, surrounded by his demons who are loyal to him. He is watching over the world he created, over his creations with an interest. He is enjoying every sight. The last time he was here was during the time of the great war between angels and demons, he was too busy back then doing what he was instructed to do. Nowadays, they don't disturb him, they are just under his protection. He doesn't interfere with their ways. He only occasionally talks to them. He has been watching over the world and keeping it safe but is bored, bored, bored.

It is like that for many centuries. It's a peaceful time, there's no wars, there's no evil, or wars, famine, or pain. Man is at its best, enjoying life, being happy with one another, living in tranquillity on a beautiful, peaceful planet. Then, another thing happens. A series of incidents, which may be interpreted as signs from the ""higher ups"". The gods and goddesses feel the need to intervene and step in the world.

They come like gods, only to save mankind, to get it back on track, to help the human race, but to do so, only once they are hidden and the world thinks they don't exist. To keep it quiet from the world, they hide in their own realm. Not only are they ""hidden"", they are ""dispersed"" from their realms too. What was meant to be for the entire ages, they have now scattered around the world and only a handful knows who they really are or what they are. This time, however, not only is their knowledge dispersed, they are going to be in danger too.

Now, they are being watched.

They are watching from everywhere. They are in the skies of the world. They are everywhere. On the earth with man, and on the earth with plant life. They are watching, watching, watching.

They are keeping a look out, looking and waiting.

They know, they know, they know what is going to happen. They are aware. They feel the signs, what humans fear is coming. They feel the danger around them and feel themselves to be in danger. They know now, they have to act. They have to keep mankind safe because, if they don't, things will get worse. They're aware that man is now growing stronger. He's becoming the mightiest of all, he is going to spread his ways to other worlds. To other planets.

So, what are they doing, what are they doing when they are not watching over the world.

""To those who are called, a demon is not sent to torment men or devour them alive. Instead, he is an opportunity for us to show our love for him. That is why a man is not harmed by demons in this life, but by God in the next. And only our own desires harm us, for they are demons when they set their affection for the wrong things. The demons we should fear are our own hearts' desires, the things we put our faith in. Now, you and the other angels have been summoned to come and help us to stand against the forces of darkness that are gathering and will try to get rid of the one who came to save us. Don't underestimate the enemy, for they don't fear death. When faced only with death, demons are nothing to the God of All. For it was God who sent him to die and rise again: ""Who then could be our God if not the God of all, the Father of heaven and a descendant of David? God has fixed a limit that He will not pass."" (Job. 38:1) It is God that brings you to life! This enemy can no more destroy the Son of God than heaven and earth and the sea. For it is of this sort that the kingdom of God is. What does this enemy seek from mankind? They take their desires as something from man, the things we eat, the things we cherish, the things we desire that makes our hearts burn. They are the things we choose to worship and our own desires, for what our eyes see is what we look at, and our hearing hears what we hear, but what our hearts see and choose are the things we love, things that are dearer to us than our own lives. We take our hearts to be God and worship what we wish are gods. These demons are no gods, they are evil things that want to hurt mankind, for what you love is what you hate, for evil that is loved never dies. It remains alive, forever",1
"Prompt: Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision: precisely one year from now, if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator, all humanity will be saved. Otherwise, all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish. Story: 

You know what? We’re not going to do that, you and me. What do you say, my child? Are we ready…to fight back? We are not going to be slaughtered. We will have our eyes and our teeth. And we shall fight back. We shall take back the world, even if it takes a century. We will make our mark, as long as we do not stop. Even if we need to destroy all civilization. As long as there is grass and sky, we will fight back. We will become the dragons that slake their thirst for gold and silver. Who will care when we are gone? The world is too small a place for all of us. Oh my god…how did we get here? How did we let it all go so damn wrong? Why did we let this happen?

And now we’re done, for this is the second ending of our story. You are now in the midst of the destruction of your world. There’s nowhere to turn. All of space lies ahead.

You’re going to have to take off, just like that.

Or you can just sit right there and cry like a baby. I know you haven’t done that in a while, but there’s no law that says you have to save yourself. It’s pretty easy to kill yourself, after all. Just jump off of there and let it all go. No, there are so many more opportunities. You’re a survivor. The one who stays behind dies.

See, you thought it was a test. And you got a little glimpse. But we get to share the truth. We can’t wait for you, we can’t save you. There’s no use sitting here, waiting for you.

But there is work to be done. Even here. You were wrong to trust, before, but now that you’re faced with the truth–You were right to think that you weren’t alone. There is something out there. Some beings who could be your help.

If you had just kept your eyes and your ears open, this would’ve never happened. Look what you’ve wrought! What we’ve all done.

What are those words on your tongue? What? What, you want to know? You want to save the world? Is that it? Don’t worry:

You can keep your mouth shut. You don’t have to speak. We were just here to talk. We understood before, and we’ll understand again, it’s over.

And if you’re a reader–well then how much have you really been listening, anyway? It’s over, and now’s your chance to pay attention. You see, there is no such thing as the natural order. The old ways die. It’s a matter of time to us, and if we don’t act, then, well, then, we don’t really matter. None of us do.

A little bit of what we’re planning is going to be very, very disturbing, my dear. But you have to think outside yourself for a change and understand that our entire civilization is at stake–and how, in the end, even a world as small as this is doomed. Don’t you see? Why wouldn’t you want to be prepared?

We came to tell you everything. And to explain how you can fix one important aspect of your world. We’ve done all that we can. I would have come back a little sooner, too, if I could, but I honestly don’t even know how we’re going to save our world. You wouldn’t even know how. That’s your problem. You don’t listen. We can show you how to save it, and we’ll teach you, and you’ll do it, you know how to do it, you can.

But the only reason you’re even hearing anything is because you didn’t stay home with those other people.

And now we’re done.

It’s up to you, dear.

Forget us, you know, we can understand. If you just had the courage to open your eyes to the world.

But I’m not going anywhere. I’m watching you watch me.

No, really, if you want to die,",1
"Prompt: You are clumsy in the kitchen. Today, you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident. Story: 

An American soldier kills another soldier in a shooting spree at a police checkpoint. Continue the story:

America’s most expensive war has not even been formally declared to this day.Continue the story:

I don’t think I could call myself a full-fledged political activist. I never had anything more than a weak protest against whatever the government was doing, and only a few times even a full-scale strike. Even then, the only effect my protests had was on me, not on others. But now… I don’t even know what I could say to the government anymore. The things I used to protest are so much worse. The government is systematically destroying itself.

I’m a part of this generation of people who are supposed to be fighting against corruption in their own home country. I’m not supposed to be part of the government that is actively sabotaging my own country. If that isn’t corruption, I don’t know what is.

I was supposed to be the shining example of a government employee. If it weren’t for the government, I could have lived a happy life. Instead, I work for a government that is destroying itself, and I live in a country that is destroying itself.

It never even occurred to me that we would fail. The government can create its own reality… and it can destroy the reality that is already there.

I thought it was all my fault, that it was because of my work. But I didn’t think about the damage that I was doing, or that the government was doing, to anyone but myself.

I was just doing what I was suppose to do, a part of the job I was assigned. It was all so normal, and so routine.

I didn’t feel anything, for the first time.

What I’m feeling now – even though it’s still too raw to form much coherent thoughts – is that when this country is destroyed, I’m going to be responsible, ultimately, for that destruction.

I’ll be able to look myself in the mirror, and say, “Hey there, I’m the creator of this whole fucking mess.”

It’s not that I have an existential crisis about it, if that was what you were alluding to by using the term “existential crisis.” I don’t. On the contrary, I feel no panic about it. I feel more like I’m at the eye of the storm, than some person who can be held responsible for all the pain and suffering, when the storm finally subsides. My own suffering has already been far eclipsed by the suffering of millions: the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of homeless, millions of casualties. I’m just one person. I don’t even have a home.

So I can’t even begin to comprehend the anguish and grief and despair that millions of Americans are feeling, right now, just as I was in Iraq. Even though, like most of you, I’ve felt their pain before, I know better than any of them at how acute their suffering is.

How many of your own friends and family members have recently died at the hands of the government? Have you tried to comfort yourself, that they didn’t die in vain?

For your sake, I hope it doesn’t work. They won’t get the message. We won’t stop killing everyone. The country won’t be fixed.

I’m no pacifist, and I don’t have any illusions about what the military can accomplish. The military doesn’t deserve praise or blame. As for the troops… They don’t all have the same ideals. I could sympathize with some of them; the average Marine just wants to get away from this place. But I don’t condone any of the criminal acts they are being asked to do.

As far as I know, I’m the only one who has been willing to criticize this military machine. That is exactly what I fear right now: the military machine becomes more of a tool of control than a tool of liberation.

To those of you who have read my work, you know that I didn’t start out hating the military. I started out wanting to be like them, before I learned about the nature of this thing called “government.” To me, the military was the model to follow… until I learned that it was a government.

“Government” has to do with coercion, and I was afraid to get close enough to that",1

Dreamland: A Dreamer's Escape
salon - National Salon de Esperello,

Salon Nacional de Esperello,

Santiago, Spain

September 10 - 11, 2018

The Salon has been a big inspiration to me, particularly when it was in NYC.

The only thing missing was the ability to read The New York Times while I worked on my paintings.

With my friend, I went to Spain and had my experience. I am excited that I can share this experience with people and have access to it again.
Today, I can share many memories of my visit.
We first went to the hotel.

I found out that I needed to take a bus and go to the hotel.
This time, it was a taxi, but it was nice to know that it was easier and more efficient to take a bus with people.
We arrived at the hotel and everything went smoothly.
A man came in and gave me a sheet with all the information.

The room was amazing! The room number was given to me, and so, I knew it was in the right place.
It was huge!

The toilet was nice, the shower was very modern, and there were two beds with amazing pillows!

Of all, the view was the most amazing view of the mountain.
The window looked over the main square of the city.

On the left of the street stood the palace with the church attached.

Everything looked very fresh and lovely, with the church and the park.

When we entered, it took only a few minutes for us to get lost.
It was a big city!

We had a guide who took us to the main square.

The room numbers were attached to the buildings: room 1, 9, and 12.
To be exact, we were in 12B.

On our way, we entered the area called the 'Bars'.
They were just bars, but there was one that said 'Lounge'. That was the name given in Spanish for bars called 'Cofees', and we found it. I don't know why.

We also took one of the walking tours. We were supposed to call and let them know that we had arrived and then they would take us.
They told us at the beginning of the tour that the entrance door of the hotel was on the side facing the center square.
They also told us that it would take us roughly a half hour and that the tour would go from side to side.

A tour is a tour, and nothing is different, so when we entered, we found only a few people, mostly students. At this time, I didn't realize that there would be fewer tourists than students, so it was a little disappointing, but in general, the tour went very well, as we got used to the city.

We walked and walked. We saw many churches, and we stopped at one that appeared to be very well kept.

The building of the church was very big. It was built in the early 1900's.

There were many symbols painted on the walls and on the ceiling. Among the most striking was the symbol of the four evangelists in white.
On the other hand, the painting of the Christ of the cross of the first floor was not as majestic as I thought it would be.

We also passed through the square which was next to the church and to the Palace where the church was.

Near the square, there was another building that was interesting. At first, we thought it was the",1
"Prompt: It 's the middle of the night. Your iPhone starts ringing. You wake up. You 're getting a Facetime call from someone who died three days earlier. Story: 

An unidentified man sitting next to me who is clearly not in his 20s is being offered up as a human sacrifice as the caller talks with me. ""This is an invocation. We are calling upon the forces of good.""

I am not calling 911, or getting my phone out of the drawer. It's 1:30 AM, and I am on a public phone in the lobby of a hotel.

""I was an atheist and I thought I was going to heaven. Then I died. I still have my faith.""

He is a young man, dressed nice, and his voice is calm and smooth. I can 't seem to get a handle on him. I try to ask follow-up questions, but he's already talking to the next person in line.

I 'll be honest: I didn 't believe him. But he's telling me how the people who found him were looking for the love of God. He spoke to his soul, he spoke to the universe. Then they decided that he can 't come into the temple because of his life. I'm listening, but I'm not believing.

I'm not a believer, either. I'm a skeptic. I like to test things, like a good comedian. The skeptic's mind is on a constant search. It looks for evidence to prove everything. I want to see what proof there is for the man. I look around me. The lobby is quiet. I'm in the middle of Michigan, for crying out loud. And there's this middle-class family with two kids who got a wake-up call from their dead relative at 1:30 AM.

This is a family story, but the story I can 't get out of my head is from last year in New York. I'm sitting in the lobby of an Upper East Side penthouse, and I'm having lunch with my friend Alex. ""Alex,"" I say, ""I just saw a dead person on the subway.""

Alex is not a believer either. Neither am I. I'm an atheist, and Alex is an atheist - though it's not a word we use. So in many ways he knows what I'm talking about. He knows that something is weird and he also knows what I'm talking about. But he doesn 't want to be too judgmental of a dead guy. Alex is a good person. He gets it.

We're all about half-and-half. We're the 50/50 guys. We get it. What's the deal with this man? What can you say? You got to start somewhere.

First, I can 't know how much of it to believe. I'm a journalist with the Huffington Post, and I'm talking to the dead people. For the first time, I'm not doing a story. This is a personal encounter.

I met him around the elevator. He just popped up. I couldn 't believe it. He said, ""I'm an atheist and I thought I was going to heaven."" He told me he could see his dad's face in a light.

""My dad was a minister, and people were crying. He's saying, 'I'm coming to take you away.'"" I felt like he was trying to warn me, like he knew he was going to die. He's telling me what's going to happen. I still felt bad that I was going to die for not believing.

Then he's starting to get upset. He realizes I can 't save him. A lot of the people who've talked to me were atheist. I'm trying to keep my skepticism, like ""You're really going to die?""

His story is so strange. He goes to the airport and flies somewhere. Where does he fly? He doesn 't know. Then he arrives. It's a hospital. Some people are trying to clean him up, take his shoes off, make him comfortable. He knows he's going to die.

""My friend,"" he says, ""I'm going to die."" The doctor said, ""Well, are you ready to accept? Does this fit your religion?""

""It's not a religion,"" he says. ""It's an experience.""

They give him some shots. He's in agony. I'm not sure how I feel, because I can 't believe it. I'm like everybody else, ""Are you in pain?"" He said he's not in pain. He tells me he just wants to find the love of God. He",1
"Prompt: Every single day the world votes to kill off one person. Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed. Story: 





As the sun dipped low on the eastern horizon, the citizens of the city of Krasnoya rose from their beds one last time for the night and gathered in the small square where their elected parliament was meeting. The square was packed with bodies of citizens. They watched as the parliament made the laws that changed their lives for thousands of years. They listened as the parliament made the laws that allowed them to live in comfort in Krasnoya.

Once every hundred years a vote would be held for the death of every citizen. That day’s citizens were the only people in the world who would be alive to fill the parliament that day.

Today’s vote was being held by the parliament. The square was packed with people, some were angry and some were happy. The parliament had done well, the laws were just that day’s rules, the world’s death vote, and every citizen had an opinion on those rules. It was the first day some of the laws could be applied. The day the citizens were free to come and vote for who they believe should die or the same laws applied to everyone. The parliament had won the first battle, the citizens had won the wars. The parliament was a group of twelve men who sat in the large chamber of the parliament to make the laws and administer those that have been made.

The parliament met each day at dusk when the citizens were sleeping. The parliament met in the chamber one final time to decide the fate of the city. Now that the world was free of death, it was the time for the first decision the citizens had made as a group. Who should die on the first day?

All of the citizens could choose for themselves who they wanted to die. They could vote and decide they wanted all of the parliament’s decisions to be overturned. Every citizen was allowed to vote for who they believed to be worthy of death.

The rules said that if a majority voted for one person to die, that person would die that day. The majority was ten votes which made it the death vote. Those ten people went out in the city square and told everyone who they voted for that they should die that day. The person who received the most votes that day was killed.

The most votes the people could give out was ten. They took ten rocks out of the bag and ten was the number of votes they were casting. One of the ten was voted to die and that person would be killed at night. The other nine people voted for who they wanted to die that day. Now they had to decide if they wanted to stick with those rules or go with the majority. The majority was ten votes. They could live with the decisions of the other nine people or they could decide what the people who voted for them wanted.

After the parliament made the rules there were only laws that applied to every citizen. The parliament had to decide on who the people would kill. The people could kill the people they wanted to be killed. If they wanted someone to die that day, they could vote for them and have it happen.

Who should die?

All of the people stood in line when the parliament met and waited for their turn. They all wore their own unique style of clothing. Some dressed more conservative than others. Every person was wearing black, a sign that every citizen would be killed, and white, for the ones who would survive.

The parliament asked the people standing in front of the people whose vote they were.

“I am ready to vote for who I believe should be killed today.”

“Who did you vote for?”

“I voted for my neighbor.”

“Okay, this is the first death vote, who do you want to be killed today?”

“They say that I voted for your neighbor, let the other nine people vote for him.”

“Okay he didn’t vote for your neighbor, so everyone else can vote again.”

The nine other people went in the line and voted for themselves.

“Why did you vote for me?”

“How old are you?”

“I am thirty one.”

“Okay, we vote for someone with your age.” They all voted for the same age.

“Do you have a family?”

“Yes, I have a wife and two small children.”

“Okay, the same age group, we vote for two people.” They voted for the same age group.

“How about health?”

“Good, I am physically fit.” They voted for the",1

To start the new year off on the right foot, this year I decided to share how the World Bank makes profits through the cause of disaster. Even the World Bank herself acknowledges the links between capitalism and calamity. When tragedy strikes, all anyone wants is someone to blame. The World Bank (or any agency that is not banned) is not going to stop what their doing any time soon, so here is one person they would rather see suffer for the cause of profit.

"Prompt: A device is released that allows a person to dive into a book and experience its contents firsthand. The manual mentions a certain book you should n't go in, for no one has ever returned from copies of it, but you decide to ignore the manual and go in anyway. Story: 
You begin reading the book, only to be thrown into the middle of something that you feel is unending. You start to sense what looks like a river, but you can't swim very well and you begin to sink. You're about to be eaten by a giant fish when you are saved by a being with a large head.

The being has no arms or legs, but uses two large fingers and a thumb to pick things up like your mother would for you. ""I'M GONNA HAVE SOME FRIENDS THAT YOU NEVER KNEW YOU HAD!"" says the being, handing you a sword. Your sword is the best you've ever had, but you cannot figure out how to use it.

The being goes and gets a bunch of swords, they're all very cool, you're going to have so much fun picking them up, and throwing them at the books that are chasing you. After a while you think you have a strategy, that'll stop the books from chasing you. You walk up to a book, and strike it with your sword. It goes flying, and it is all the way up in the sky, which is kind of confusing.

You continue to follow this being around. It gets you to a village in a far away land, you run into your brother there, and they head off to the town. You've lost all the books and are very annoyed at the whole thing. It's pretty quiet in the village, so you put your sword away and begin to think about what to do. The man at the desk isn't looking well, so you decide to leave and head to the next town.

Continue the story:
You wake up on the road, and the man that saved you from the books is leaning over you. He is an old man, but also quite tall, and you look up to see a large white sky. ""How do you feel?"" asks the man. ""Well, I feel a bit woozy. Do you have much more to tell me? I'm tired of just sitting and staring, I think I'll be on my way now."" You say, getting up. The man tells you to sleep well, and shows you a place to stay. You go inside the house and find a bed. You go and sleep for a while, and when you wake up there is a breakfast tray in front of you. You look through the cupboards and find that you were living with an old man with no legs.

You go back to the man's house around lunchtime, and he takes you for a walk, as he says he can't move very well yet. The man shows you to his garden, and he wants you to look at his prize. You find a small yellow flower, you look around, and you see that it was a rose that is very rare.

The man tells you that he's made it very important to keep in the right shape for you all the time, and he points to a nearby bush, there is a small green leaf that matches up with the bush. ""My mother did the same to me."" He says. ""Here, give my gift to a friend of mine."" He says, picking up the rose and giving it to you. ""Remember it, and think about me when you see it."" He says and then goes inside to work on his legs. You stay and look around the garden more.

A few days have gone by and you have been working very well. You've been practicing throwing books and hitting the books as hard as you can. After one week you've mastered how to fight the books in the house, so you head back to the room where you were before the accident, and the man wakes up and smiles at you. ""You did a great job, you really didn't have to, you beat the books pretty easily. I'm going to call the doctor."" He says, walking across the corridor. The man disappears out of sight and there is no way for you to get to his office. You wait and wait for half an hour, ""This isn't happening."" You think, as a book comes by. ""I know who I am, they'll just have to go."" you think firmly.

The man returns, ""The Doctor says if you want you can do it right now, I'll go get the medical machine."" you say happily, and you begin moving across the corridors. After about fifteen minutes you are told to wait for the doctor to come. ""He'll be here in an hour to check everything."" say the man, who looks a bit more tired than before. You get your hands on the machine, which is a complicated",1
"Prompt: All your friends and family are slowly changing. They do n't notice the difference, but you certainly do ... Story: 

Chapter 1

I don't think much about other people. I don't think I will when I'm older. Why should I? I don't have much of a family. I don't really understand family. I don't know of any. My friends probably think I only think of myself.

I don't even like myself. I always think I've met a certain type of person and when it's not the me I thought, I try and live up to it to make people like me. I hate myself when I don't care enough for others to try my hardest. I hate myself when I don't care enough to be who I truly want to be.

I don't know why I'm writing this. I don't why I don't put more thought into my thoughts. I know this is a lot to write down, but I know people won't believe me otherwise.

This is the year that everything turned upside down in the town of Serenity. I'm a young man. I have brown hair, bright blue eyes and a small scar at the top of my head, which only I can see. I wear a plain black tee shirt with jeans. I'm around five foot three inches tall, average build, and I have a strong build. I'm not skinny, but it fits me well. I have a strong stomach and a strong back that I think would give me a strong heart. I have a big nose which makes some people think I have a funny look and that I look dumb, which people don't think.

I've never had one of the popular roles such as football player, basketball player, rock star or something. But I'm not so bad and I have some talent in the areas of music and drama. I don't play an instrument, maybe because I've always preferred to sit in an acoustic theatre listening to other instruments and sounds. I could be part of some of the local bands I heard about though.

People have said I have a dark soul, but that it's my best thing. I could be a good guy, but I don't want to. I can't be. A lot goes on that is not as important as being a real person. I would be lying if I said I'm sure of a future. My parents would be happy then too, but I guess I don't really care. My dad is just a man. My mum has been like that a long time.

I just want to be free and to be free you have to be free in life as well. You can pretend to be a good guy by doing things like giving money and giving people their own home or helping out. But we all know that you just want to live your own life and try and leave the past behind. I was born on 25th March 1995 and I am seventeen. That day was going to be the day that I left Serenity. I just didn't realise it was for good.

Chapter 2

It was a cold snowy night in Serenity with low cloudy skies the rest of the night. It was going to be a stormy weekend all over Australia. The morning after the day of the announcement, I wake up as it's just starting to get light. When I was a child I used to stay up until morning listening to the wind moaning. It was like voices from the wind. But today I'm going to miss it.

Today was going to be the big day. I had made plans to sleep until I knew everyone else was awake. I could tell I would be the last person from the night before to wake up today. I get up. I put up the blankets, pull them over me, get out the light and head to the kitchen. I'm just about to go back to bed when my sister wakes up.

""Dad, can we eat? Can I have something sweet? I'm starving, my stomach has been growling for hours."" My sister is sixteen and she is always hungry and skinny. She is also very energetic. My sister always wants to go shopping. Even though I don't like it, I can't say no. Just this once, I'll let her have something she wants to eat. She is still rubbing her eyes open and she looks confused. Of course, she has no idea she actually has a brother or anything to do with her parents. My parents only told her about me six months ago and even they had a hard time deciding.

This is the type of life. No one knows each other. No one has the same interests that you have. We all stick to what we're comfortable with no matter what. If I didn't know about all different types of people, I should not be here right now.

I'll go see my sister and tell her. Maybe she'd get",1
"Prompt: Extremists kidnapped an American journalist in Iraq. They are about to execute this poor soul, named Clark Kent. Story:  http://www.militiamenews.co

(Washington, DC) – Today, the Center for Biological Diversity announced the settlement of the federal lawsuit that brought the death sentence of Dr. Steve Kay, a prominent Iraqi bio-scientist, and which resulted in the sentencing of Clark Kent (aka Paul Ewoldt, aka Paul L. Hillman) of Missouri to death.

After four years of imprisonment and torture by the former Iraqi regime, Dr. Steve Kay (“Mr. Steve”) was kidnapped by kidnappers, and later executed by ISIS in Iraq in May 2015. The international terrorist organization is keeping his body in one of the prisons in northern ISIS-controlled territory (northern Iraq) while holding Dr. Kay’s family against their will.

The Center is acting to raise public awareness about ISIS’s crime of kidnapping a prominent Iraqi bio-scientist who had worked for decades to promote and protect the world’s biodiversity and to urge an international community to stop this grave injustice.

“I am delighted that the United States Government will pay the kidnappers more money to let me die than they will pay me to live,” said Dr. Kay after receiving $25,000 from the Center for Biological Diversity as part of a civil settlement. “I will certainly make the best of my last months in a world of the flesh, and I hope that they will do the best with the remains of me that they can,” he added.

The settlement was reached after a four-year civil lawsuit brought by the Center against government and private law enforcement officials responsible for Dr. Kay’s death sentence, and for their refusal to grant him clemency despite pleas by the international community and by U.S. government officials. The Center, together with Dr. Kay, brought the lawsuit for its own sake, although it also knew that Dr. Kay’s sentence would die with him.

“Today, one ISIS executioner’s hands will be tied, and the Iraqi people will now be free to mourn and honor their scientist who helped create Saddam Hussein’s horrifying human-rights abuses against humanity. Today, one Iraqi citizen will be returned to his family,” said Dr. Molly Wilson, U.S. campaign director for the Center and co-chair of the nonprofit’s Life During Wartime Campaign. “That an international organization like the Center for Biological Diversity is able to make the world safer from future Dr. Kayes will help bring a measure of justice to his memory.”

Dr. Kay’s death sentence came through the Iraqi judicial system, which was run by the former Iraqi regime, as a result of the regime’s efforts to punish and intimidate the Center and Dr. Kay for his efforts to draw out and name the perpetrators of the horrific crimes against humanity committed by Mr. Saddam Hussein after his defeat in the first Gulf War, in February 1991. Dr. Kay’s arrest came at a high point of the Center’s activities after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered the killing of the Center’s director, Dr. Jane Goodall, and kidnapped Dr. Peter Berner, the former president of the Center.

Dr. Kay, the brother of Dr. Goodall’s first assistant, has been a colleague of the Center’s U.S. campaign director, Dr. Molly Wilson, since he shared a house in Oxford, England with Jane Goodall for 10 years. Dr. Kay is known globally for his efforts to draw out and name Mr. Saddam Hussein’s henchmen, who continue to terrorize the Iraqi people, and who will be responsible for the brutal and heinous crimes committed by the former Iraqi regime if and when Mr. Baghdad reclaims sovereignty and control. He remains in his homeland at the urging of the Iraqi people, and, until the day he dies, he will continue to fight for justice in the region.

“Today, the Iraqi people have a chance to start to bury their dead, but their hopes are dashed for justice regarding the murders of their scientists and leaders, who have been kidnapped by Mr. Saddam Hussein’s henchmen,” said Dr. Wilson. “This international civil lawsuit is about giving an Iraqi child the chance to grow up in a world that recognizes his humanity, and which makes Dr. Steve Kay the first to have the chance to die in love, not fear,” she added.

After five years in the hands of the Iraqi regime, Dr. Kay is one of several Iraqi scientists kidnapped by the former regime between 1990 and 2004, including another former colleague of Dr. Wilson’s, named Dr. Karim Alwazir, whose death sentence was recently",1

"Prompt: It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident. Story:  http://t.co/qbX8sX8DpB — Occupational Health & Safety Division (@DOHOSH) May 29, 2015

The official website also posted an update Tuesday:

We are still awaiting final word from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding the cause of the accident. OSHA said that it could take several weeks to complete its investigation. Workers on the job site were temporarily removed due to the condition of the work space.

HHS' spokesperson said the area hasn't been fully investigated yet. In this type of situation, it often takes several weeks for the investigation to be completed.

""We don't want a workplace accident to cause an additional inconvenience for workers, contractors or the public, and we understand that the investigation of this accident is causing some disruption to work on this new facility,"" HHS spokesperson Tanya Broderick said in a statement Tuesday. ""OSHA will complete its investigation in a timely manner and will release information as soon as we have it.""

According to Broderick, the site should reopen in October.

Meanwhile, in addition to the ongoing cleanup and investigation, the government is conducting a review regarding the site's safety. The review is aimed at addressing potential risk to workers, contractors, and the public.

More from the Associated Press

Health and human services officials said no one was injured.

""We're going through this whole process together as a team,"" Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-New York, tweeted Tuesday. ""This is no small concern for us.""

Maloney, a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is one of the people leading the review of the site by HHS' inspector general.

Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" the committee has asked the Office of Personnel Management to look into whether the government needs to change how it handles the work space. OPM did not immediately provide information to the committee.",1
"Prompt: What if ghosts are, in reality, glimpses of time travelers? Story: 

And so this girl was going to kill that girl. I wanted nothing more than to watch her die with slow precision, the way she deserved—with a smile for me when she did. I could tell she'd made a mistake. I was just going to let the other girl keep her gun pointed at me. That's all. For that, I did not have to kill her.

I'm sure she could have let me go. But she didn't. Just as I planned, she raised her gun at me and pulled the trigger. A red beam sprayed out of the gun, so red it looked like blood in a crime scene. There were two shots, and she fell to the ground.

And I did not even flinch. I felt no fear, no emotions. Just satisfaction. Only after she was dead did I remember the girl was my own sister. You'd think I'd be filled with regret for a mistake so grave. The thought I'd make that big sister the murderer, because I had to protect my own life. But I did not feel the slightest regret. My life was already over. How could regret affect me now?

I sat down on the ground, and then the rain started falling.

I'm not going to lie. When the rain started coming down, that was when I really started feeling afraid. That's when my whole world became a sea of grey.

I was going to die in this rain. I was really scared. But still I sat there, looking at the dead girl and the other girl lying there as well.

It was then that I realised the third girl didn't die.

She survived.

She just wasn't there.

""She just wasn't there,"" I repeated to myself over and over again. Even then, I didn't think you needed to see something to understand it.

But the other girl called me a dumbass.

""I saw you die!"" she said. ""Your sister saw you die, too!"" she said. ""And then you just let yourself get eaten by a ghost!"" she said.

I just looked at her blankly.

But then the rain started to let up, and I felt something pull at me. I thought at first that it was your fault. But now this girl that I had just realised was your sister said it was too. Your sister's sister was here, she said, pulling me to her.

I just looked at her.

Then she said a word I didn't understand.

""Save me.""

I had no idea where she was sending us, but at least she was still alive. And I had someone to save.",1
"Prompt: You work on the assembly line in a cybernetic implant factory. You and your coworkers like to prank each other by shoving defective components into each others bodies. Story: 

You have been asked to assemble some small parts into a larger component on the assembly line. One of the new parts is defective.

You assemble the parts on the assembly line, one after another. The defective part is in position 5, and your coworker who is doing the same thing on the other side of the line has already put in the defective part himself with a smile and a wave.

You have finished assembling the component. It looks good, the parts were all in place, none of them shifted after you finished. Your boss nods and says to you, ""Go, keep your mind on the work."" Your coworkers congratulate you and you take the newly finished part to the next station to be packaged.

Suddenly, the part, right in the position 5, starts to move, shifting itself by one notch towards other coworker, who is sitting across the aisle facing your direction.

""How could that be?"" you ask yourself. ""The process for assembling this part was perfectly normal, even so, how could that happen?"" You look more carefully and notice that the part is slightly deformed. You check with your coworker beside you, and it turns out the part is yours! You take it out immediately and look at it. Sure enough, one of the parts has somehow slipped out after you had finished with it.

You turn to your coworker. He shrugs his shoulders, looks at you and then at the part and then at you. You take the part out of your pocket and put it on the assembly line, with a certain haste. Your coworker is looking on, laughing.

You are puzzled and angry at the same time. You stare at your coworker who is now slowly raising his hand in a salute. ""What's going on? Why am I making a fool of myself? Wasn't I right in giving the job to him?"" You continue with the work, trying to calm your racing heart.

Before you can think of some good response, your coworker's hand comes up again, and he salutes. ""It's ok. I have accepted the part. Thanks!"" He says with a forced laughter. You exchange a glance with him. ""I thought you didn't like me,"" you say finally.

""That's right I don't. Sorry."" He says honestly. ""My fault. I will take care of it. Next time you should put the part where you intended to put it."" You look at him for a while. Something about the way he says ""sorry"" makes you relax. You can't figure out why. You turn to look away. Out of his sight he is still raising his hand. You nod. ""Alright. I will."" You feel your heart relaxing a bit.

After this episode, you notice that no one else on the assembly line seems to bother with your coworker. They even seem to be avoiding to look at him. ""I guess he accepted the part after all, huh."" You think. After your shift, another coworker comes up to you. ""You never knew, but my husband has made a new friend. His real name is actually Ivan Svidomsky. He works with us at our place."" You feel relieved. You can't tell just by looking at his face, but something seems slightly different.

You ask about them, and then you notice that someone else has also told the same stories about them. ""So, I guess he isn't the problem. "" You say to yourself, getting a little better.

Next time, you meet your coworker out of the company. You give him a ride in his car, and you ask him how his friend Ivan is, just for the sake of politeness. ""Oh, Ivan is fine now. Thanks. It took him a bit to get used to the way of life in an organization though."" You feel a little uneasy.

You ask your coworker a few more questions about him, but your conversation is interrupted as you notice someone else's new car coming into the garage. ""Ah, that's my wife's. It's on its way home."" You quickly get off the porch. You never come to his garage, and if you have any free time you just grab something to do for the time, anything so that you don't have the chance to sit around wondering why he doesn't show up for lunch. ""I guess she has something she needs to get back home by."" You shake your head slightly. You don't like them, you think to yourself.

As you and your coworker get on the road again in your cab, the car comes up alongside. You give your coworker a puzzled look. ""You said we are on the way home."" I think you say. ""Oh",1

Do you have the same body after waking up? Is my body different after waking up? What are normal effects of waking up? Does it seem like I'm really awake? What is the exact moment that you wake up and how long does it take? Did everyone see the experiment? Are there photos of what happened? Can you describe the exact moment and how people felt? You can probably say the exact moment and how you felt. How long from leaving it for ten years to waking up? Are you really awake now? If you were in deep sleep for ten years, do you remember those things? Do you remember sleeping, sleeping people, and sleeping people who were in deep sleep for ten years? Are there photos or videos of something in that situation? In the end, do we know about the cryoids? We can make sure of it.

Write a better ending for the ** Dream Experiment. The question was from the end of the story: The Russian doctors wake up. It seems like they were in some kind of dream sleep for a decade. We know it worked because of lots of experiments. How do we know they were dreams? They were not awake. Why did it work?

I did not get any kind of response.

I wrote this story for extra credit and I was lucky to get a good score.

Tell me something I didn't know or make it interesting.

I didn't know this.

What was the most important fact you wanted to tell me?

Cryoids.

I wrote this story for extra credit and I was surprised to get a good score.

Write a better ending for the Russian's Experiment.

The Russian scientists wake up after ten years. It seems like they were in some kind of cryogenic deep sleep for ten years. It was a very interesting experiment, but all participants were completely normal. We know the experiment worked because there were a lot of experiments. How do we know that it is sleep? It felt like sleep. And the experiment worked because they all woke up after ten years. Why did it work?

I didn't know this.

What was the most important fact you wanted to tell me?

My favorite myth for this story is: ""There's a myth that if people are frozen for fifty years, then thaw them out and they are still alive? And there are cryoids."" and ""Are there any modern myths?""

You said you were trying to write a story because you don't want to read a really boring story so please make it interesting.

I've written this story and it has nothing to do with the stories you have already read. So, I'm going to keep it short.

It was a really short story because I didn't learn anything new, but I've always been really confused by this story and I know it can't be resolved",1
"Prompt: It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident. Story:  https://t.co/vB4QQf5h0O https://t.co/xS3lE0wM8h — United Parcel Service (@UPS) January 13, 2018

According to a previous CNN report, this is actually only the 20th accident during the history of UPS' air delivery service.

"Prompt: A collective consciousness that can not take control of people 's bodies by force. It must persuade people to join willingly. Story: 

Drugging a collective force to prevent it from acting, or even force it to act, can make a mess. This is why Druids are a very secretive group.

The concept of a druid is really a misnomer for a person who performs a function in support of a group by manipulating another group’s natural instincts to serve a function that is beneficial to the larger group.

If a Druid has to take control of a group at the expense of the individual rights of group’s members, it can be counterproductive, and the Druid’s role, as seen by the group, may come off as tyrannical or power-hungry.

It can cause resentment, hostility, and sometimes violence.

A Druid’s work may, to the unaware observer, not be all that different than that of a politician, lawyer, corporate executive, or even a judge. In reality, though, the work of a Druid is a far cry from that of these professions, and for good reason.

A Druid’s work is rooted in a deep and instinctual understanding of human nature and its psychology: how people’s natural instincts behave and how those instincts react, react, even, to the presence of other natural instincts and other minds around them.

A Druid’s work is a form of social manipulation of how other people behave, in such a way as to benefit a society or a group, but which in the short term may not appear to benefit the individual member of the group.

A Druid is not some kind of mind-reader. Druids do not possess mystical powers such as the power to “know what is in a person’s mind.” They rely on natural instinct and their own experience to read nature and human nature in order to get into a person’s head.

Druids use tools to observe and to manipulate people’s physical, energetic, and mental states and behaviors.

An example of this may be a Druid who uses the law or any other legal or moral system to get people to follow rules which are in their best interest (such as a Druid who uses the law to protect a drug culture or a Druid who uses the law to force people to stop abusing drugs), but which may also benefit the larger group of which the Druid is a part.

Druids are very much part of the natural world. That is, Druids are not supernatural beings that are separate from the natural world.

Being part of nature means that a Druid has to work with and be aware of the natural tendencies of the natural world and of other people’s minds in order to do his work.

That is why a Druid always acts to benefit the larger social group, not just himself or herself. The Druid’s work in support of the larger group should not be seen as being harmful or selfishly self-interested, or even immoral, but rather as being part of the natural order of things that have been in place for centuries through all of human history.

Druids use the Law to change how people think through social manipulation, and they also use social manipulation through physical effects on people’s physical state.

This is a very different kind of knowledge from that possessed by the traditional “magician” who manipulates the mind of an individual, often in an unhealthy, or in some cases even in an illegal manner.

Druids use their natural instincts to read how people’s instincts behave and to understand how their instinctual tendencies tend to react to various situations.

The Druid’s work is to take advantage of the innate instincts of human nature such that those instincts would work to serve the needs and desires of the larger group.

This, naturally, is for the good of the larger group, in the best interest of all the people who are part of that larger group.

An example of this may be a Druid who works by offering a person a drug, or a Druid who uses threats to get a group of people to join his or her side, or even by offering a physical reward, such as money, something to eat, or even something they want.

Another example of an action by a Druid which is part of their work might be to plant ideas into someone’s mind or into the minds of many people who may then form a group who can be used to do some other action, all for the greater good.

This may be an example of an action that is not quite right to describe as a “trick,” in the ordinary sense of the word. The Druid accomplishes the result by planting ideas in people’s minds that serve a function in helping that group in the best interest",1
"Prompt: Hello darkness, my old friend. Story:  I was there. We were there in that tiny window of time that I got to experience life without anything happening to me, my name, my family, my friends nor memories of people or thoughts of my future being permanently altered.

Before I go on and write this thing down for others to read, I want to remember: I was there.

When I was a little girl, I would see my sister out playing with her friends during lunch time. I was never jealous, even when they would call her “baby sister.” I guess because I had her to compare my life to as life was getting harder, harder by the day. Little did I know that I would get to experience life before I got to experience it as this life I was living.

My memories began to change. It seemed like a new day could never dawn, I lived in such a constant frenzy of worry for every single day of my life, for every single minute. Then, I met one person who had taught me to love again. We became best friends, he loved me for me. No more constant questioning of my existence, no more “why did they do this to me?” Then, I became a mother, a mother to four who made more mistakes than I ever will, an unforgiving unforgetting mother. I cried everyday because there was always, even in my darkest times, never a time that I ever would be OK, never something that would make everything, absolutely everything that went wrong for me, and everyone around me, and every future I would have, nothing compared to what I was going through now and no tears to shed.

I just felt, sometimes, like I wanted my heart to explode. I wanted nothing more than to go insane. I wanted to kill, to burn, to break myself and everyone else to pieces. This was before I could have actually gone insane. I didn’t have a drug problem, I didn’t have a drinking problem. No, I couldn’t even express how much anger I would feel towards life and how angry I really wanted to be, just because of the pain of living. My pain was the pain of living.

I wanted to die. I wanted to leave. I wanted the end. I was constantly wondering, was I going crazy? Is it all in my head? What if this isn’t real? What if I can’t be? If I can’t be me, if I can’t be here, if I can’t be here to help people and to touch lives and make other people’s lives worth living, is it not sad? Life isn’t supposed to be sad, life is supposed to be happy, it’s supposed to be joy. Life is supposed to be happy. There are people that I know and loved dearly, that I still loved dearly, who were killed, and their death will be remembered, it will never go away, their names will always be known, but when they died, I could have a life, with a life that does not include death, or losing loved ones, or losing family and friends. I had family, I had friends. I lived.

When my children first learned about what was going to happen to their mom, I had to see them for a second. I was terrified that my sadness would break through the surface to see who is staring back at me and what I had been crying about, what I had been so devastated about. I had to hide that I thought this thing was fake, had to hide that I was afraid. I was afraid, I saw my children’s eyes look up to me in terror, in fear. I was afraid because, although I knew they wouldn’t judge me or look down on me, I was still afraid they would hate me, that I wouldn’t get a chance to be able to teach them what kind of a person they could become, and how I could help them as they became adults and found out what other people’s problems really are. I knew, in my twisted little brain, that I was going to be in the same place of death for all eternity, and I could never explain it to them, never be able to express to them what I felt. I think I felt that way because death took from life everything else that it had to offer and took a part of life. It took my children, it took my parents, it took my friends. It took what I can never get back, I can never get my family back, and I can never get the ability to live life without a death hanging over my head every day.

It was hard for my family, hard for them. It’s hard for my kids, hard for me, hard for me because they saw a woman who was so young, who was so beautiful",1
"Prompt: You accidentally discover the sentence of death ( a sentence that kills anyone who hears it except the speaker ) when you say it over national television. Story: 

If you're lucky, your first thought is that you must have heard your sentence of death, but it was just a trick on the radio or television. Unfortunately, not all of us are lucky - the people who heard the sentence of death over a few of our television channels are unlucky ones.

When the sentence of death was read, they didn't see nor hear anything except the statement: ""You have just heard your sentence of death. Unless I say otherwise, you - everyone - will die if you or any of your loved ones hear or speak my sentence. You have to be very careful.""

So, who was that person? And how were they making such a big mistake?

The person wasn't you or me

Someone else was actually making such a statement ( in the same way that I made the statement to you ) - but for some reason they forgot about that fact. For example, they might have heard the news in a different room of the house. Or maybe an automated voice system might have sent the sentence over loudspeakers in a different part of the house, such as in the living room, kitchen or bedroom. The automated systems in our modern world seem to be very good at making mistakes from time to time. However, the mistake that affected hundreds of people is one of the most basic kinds of mistakes: forgetting that something is something they heard before.

One thing that we can assume is that people are very careful when speaking or broadcasting to others. They take precautions to ensure that their message isn't a lie - they are very likely to be careful about what they say. Unfortunately, it seems that people forget the most basic things, even though they might still want to be careful.

When people hear things over the radio or on television, they may assume that their listeners and viewers are intelligent enough to understand what they are saying. Although this assumption seems fair, it can backfire over the short- or medium-term. For example, radio listeners assume that if a woman's voice tells them that they will be killed if they don't listen carefully to her, this is a sign for their intelligence. So, they listen carefully - but when they finish there is something surprising: ""This is the end of the message"".

The sentence of death over the radio or television was a trap that we didn't expect to appear, but the intelligence of the audience was a trap to us because we were completely unaware that something like it was possible - something with so many possible and realistic alternatives.

The sentence of death was a mistake

Of course, there are some other assumptions that we can make about people, but the intelligent ones will be more willing to acknowledge the possibility that these assumptions can go wrong. For example, we can make the assumption that people who are in danger or who are the victim of murder or terrorism will be intelligent, careful and thoughtful.

Unfortunately, this is just the opposite. So, that sentence of death - the one that killed the people who heard it - was a trap of death designed to look like some form of life, but with the real intention of a death-sentence, a trap that we didn't expect - a trap of death meant to kill only ourselves.

Unfortunately, if one person gets killed for making that mistake, then it becomes our mistake as well. It's our fault that we heard the sentence of death, and by going along with the mistake that someone else made, we are also going to be killed - in the same way.

""If you have just been told that you should take something with you, just in case you were going to die ( and you might have thought that the'someone else' was you or me ), you can be sure that this is a trap of death. Because you have just been told that you will soon die if you don't take this medicine, whatever the medicine is, you won't know what it is, until you die ( and you have already passed the trap ). If that is the kind of medicine you might take while you are about to die, why not take the most important thing that you were going to take?

""If you have just been told that there should be at least three people at your side at any time, so that anyone in the vicinity of your three friends will also be killed ( and you think that your three friends are the only ones who were going to die if they were alone ), you can be sure that that is also a trap of death. The truth is that there aren't three people but two or five, at most. So, the trap of death wants you to take a medicine that only kills two or five people instead of three, four or (worst case) six. You are still going to die - of course - because of the mistake that these people made, but",1

Hello! My name is Yandex. I created this site because I am also a lover and a reader. If you also want to create a writer you are always welcome.

The number one bestseller list of our site is updated every week. Thanks to all our readers on the site. Thank you as well for your positive feedback, for your suggestions, for your questions.

For those who don't know me, my name is Yandex. Yes, the name of the Russian search engine. I write in the genre of psychological thrillers. I work on the line of suspense and thriller. I write the stories that make you feel good when you finish them. I want to change the world. Let's make it a better place. Because I care.

I wrote my first story when I was 10 years old. I would sit and write the main lines for 3 hours. Then I would read it and immediately rewrite it and the cycle would repeat. It's an unusual way to create a novel. Now it's much better! I have more time for creation and I can think all the way to the very end of my books, but I would probably still do the same. It's important as I'm a perfectionist. I have one goal; I'm going to achieve it.

I studied English, but stopped when I realized that my teacher was a real fraud. She did a course, got her certification, and made a whole series of books. When my real book is published, she can't possibly get the money back. But maybe someone else can. I've decided to be as free as possible and not to accept any help. I will use social media on my own. I write articles for writing magazines and newspapers. I write short stories and the novel that I want to publish. However, I'll let people know on my page the bestsellers from my site. I am going to write more and more. I'd like to write in general fiction, sci-fi, horror, mystery, and I might write a fantasy novel.

I have written articles on a topic that is my main interest. My topic is writing. It's how one becomes an author. It's where to find inspiration. How to develop creative ideas. It's also my way of giving feedback to writers who want to improve their craft. I enjoy writing. The moment I create something, I feel happy. I work in my kitchen table and my desk is a pile of books. I write from 6 in the morning to 9 in the evening. I would like to be an author when I become a mom. I want to write everything that I want to see on the news that is about children. I write for children. I write for adults. I write for all ages. I want everyone to know what I've learned and that I didn't fail. It has not changed, and it will not change. I've learned to always be happy and I will give you something happy.

I am a huge fan of horror. I'm one of those who read it as a child. Now, as an adult and as a writer, I want to write about these topics in a completely different way. I want to tell stories without leaving the reader feeling angry. I'm trying to write like it's a therapy session and I'm trying to help you. My goal is to bring you pleasure. I don't do it in a way that you become afraid but that the fear is still there and you will remember it for a long time. This story is not for those who are afraid at night, my fear is your fears. I'm not going to scare you. I'm going to show you how important it is to talk about death because it does not scare us, we are",1
"Prompt: A man who has never seen nor heard of females before meets a woman who has never seen nor heard of males before Story: 

In the morning the man and the woman meet in the living room again. They still have not spoken to each other and each is still waiting for the other to initiate the conversation. The woman says:

""Okay, since you never saw or heard of me before, you’d better start talking. So why are we in this position? I mean, why are we hiding ourselves from each other? Why would you have a need for the secret of the other sex?

You must have had some sort of experience that makes you curious to know about the other sex. The only thing you could possibly have experienced is sexual pleasure with a female, but even if that was the case, you don’t need to hide anymore. You can go back to her and enjoy everything she has to offer. You just need to know what to expect and to prepare yourself.""

The woman takes a deep breath, smiles at him and says, ""I have no need to hide since this one never gave me any problems. He always does what he wants and he loves me very much, and he wants to stay together with me."" She walks over to the man with love and respect while still smiling.

As she comes to him, she looks intently into his eyes saying, ""He’s waiting for you to make the next move.""

The man just stands there looking into her eyes and doesn’t know what to say. He has no idea what to expect from her. The man and the woman are now ready to start a real life. When the man makes his move, he is very excited to find that she is just as excited as he is.

This story is actually one of your dreams coming true.
This story is actually one of your dreams coming true.

If you really need some advice about sex, we've been in your position. Our advice would be to be prepared. Get as much knowledge and experience from as many sources as humanly possible. Talk to and research as many people as possible about what to expect.

Have an open mind at all times and don’t use the same tactics as your lover.

If you aren’t a very good lover yet, you can improve. A bad lover isn’t someone who doesn’t have any experience at sex, but someone who doesn’t have enough experience to use sex as an instrument for creating emotional or spiritual attachment.

You need to learn to love your partner and to give her time and attention before you expect her to return the love and passion.

Don’t assume you know what she wants or what she likes. Don’t try to guess or to make her uncomfortable. You won’t know until you know.

When she feels good, the rest just falls into place.

Always try to bring out the best in your partner.
We have some advice on how to improve your sex life.

We have some advice on how to improve your sex life.

Be prepared.

Be aware of the power of touch. Touch is a very important part of the relationship. This is true with sex. In your search for knowledge, you have to be prepared to be open to experiencing all of the wonders of life.

This lesson should include more than just sex. It’s vital to learn everything about your partner that you can learn.

As hard as you might try to suppress your thoughts and feelings of curiosity and desire to see the inner workings of the mysterious female, there is no getting around it any more than you can ever truly forget about sex.

It is very human nature for two people from the same species to try to learn to understand the way things work for the other species. It's what we do as a rule.

Even if the female is an object that interests you, she isn’t. When you approach sex with an attitude of respect and admiration for what she is as a source of pleasure, the power of touch will bring you and your partner to a whole new level of fulfillment.

This kind of power will not be just a fun thing to do. You’ll use this technique just like you’d enjoy cooking something tasty when you have guests over.

Never lose sight of the fact that she’s another personality from yours and that it is your task to bring out the best in this personality (sexually).

Your sexual encounter with your female should help her learn to love.

In our search for knowledge we read a lot of books and we have experienced many experiences. We are also in touch with a lot of different people and through our research we have learned a lot about women.

We share with you the things we learned with sex.",1
"Prompt: Thanks to a bureaucratic error, you are now Satan. Story: 

Your assignment: Find a way to remove your curse, or you lose a day. Oh, and a day on Earth is equal to one day in the Nether. Oh, but if all this goes badly, you take 10 days. Oh, and one of those days is from the day you were born! Oh but if you complete your assignment in five or fewer days your curse is undone. Oh but if you survive you get one of those days back. Oh but if you lose the day, you will lose a friend. If you don't find a way, you lose a life.

You begin your assignment walking through a dark alley. You decide that finding a way to remove your curse will be an adventure, and that a challenge is what you desire most. You continue walking, as you come upon the shadowed end of the alley, you see a small door in the corner. With a quick leap you jump to the door, you twist your leg as you land, but you can't feel it! In front of you is an unlocked door, and inside you see a bed, you try for the door handle, but it's locked. You think about getting your foot caught in the door to push it open, but you would need something heavy to push against. You then take some steps out of the shadow of the door and over to the corner. In the corner you see three steps that lead up to an open window: up a few feet you can see a small ledge with an opening into the next building, you feel you might be able to make it up the stairs, or if you don't get caught, you may be able to jump from the ledge into the window if you can make it high enough, so you decide to try.

With your new knowledge of door handles you are able to unlock the door and open it, you move into the hallway and try to find the bathroom, unfortunately without success you realize that that way is closed. You think a bit and then choose to try the other way, you can't see a door but there is a large painting on the wall that could be the door, but a quick glance at the ceiling reveals there is a small hole in the ceiling, about shoulder height. You step closer and your face only goes a foot before it falls through the small opening. You fall into unknown darkness as all light comes to an end.

When you woke up you had no idea of how you passed the time. It seems like you were in complete darkness, and that you must have fallen a considerable distance and landed on something hard. With some effort you sit up and look around, you can see some dark brick on the ceiling, with some light coming from it, but you can feel you are in an underground tunnel. You are unable to see anything, so you slowly move your hand around in the dark, finally coming in contact with some brick, you then begin to move around your new location, slowly, as you feel with both hand and foot in the dark. After a few minutes without a change in position, you begin to panic, but then you feel around some more, you feel an opening, a small opening that seems to lead into another area. You begin to feel your way forward, as the darkness is complete. When you come to the end of the small tunnel you find yourself at the top of a ladder, you quickly move down rungs into a large tunnel. You feel the air move as a large fire comes in front of you, but you don't feel the air on your face it seems like its air draft. There is an open door in front of a man standing in front of fire, you are facing him. In his hands he holds a red gem.

You feel calm and you have no desire to do anything but stand there, with what? You begin to walk forward into the fire, when, suddenly the door is sealed behind you! You hear a large crash and then a voice, the man shouts to you.

""You can't get that ruby.""

You begin to think, is it a dream...you are dreaming! You can think clearly in this dream, and so you tell him, ""you'll have to fight me for it?"" you smile as you continue forward.

""I suppose that would be fun, but I am more of a pacifist than that, and I really don't think I would enjoy that at all!"" You walk up to him, still with a smile, but as your closer he begins to notice the light in your eyes, and he is afraid. Suddenly you are a man, a different man than you were before, different looks, height, body mass, hair, everything changes. He feels as if he is seeing a ghost. When you look at him he begins to run, but he can't. He is frozen in shock. He begins sobbing and begging for mercy, when suddenly he",1
"Prompt: One day, while petting your cat, you accidentally pull his tail, and it opens up. Inside, there 's a USB connector. You connect it to your laptop, an announcement pops up. -Cat Version: 1.0.0. Update to 256.3? Story: 

""Oh, you upgraded him?"" I looked at the old cat (who was still playing with my laptop and eating my toast) with a smile. He was quite fast at moving from one position to another, but this time, however, he was stuck on some stairs and refused to move. ""Yeah, he did,"" I said quietly, reaching for my laptop again, this time opening the cat game and running it.

I looked away from the cat game, and focused on the screen and began clicking. I clicked a couple of times, but nothing happened. I clicked again, and this time, the cat jumped away, but his tail did not. I waited for a while, and looked for an option which would reset an already opened game. I found one... This will update the game, reset and delete all data, and close the game completely. Click Yes to confirm. Done. There's a big ""Wipe this computer!"" button in the bottom right corner. I clicked it, and waited for the update to finish. When it was all over, I reconnected my laptop and turned it off.

Back to the laptop screen, I found a cat in the middle of playing with my keys. He was jumping onto my laptop, and in the process making something on the keyboard. -Did you say this computer is infected with Win10? Is that a cat or a horse? I opened the cat game, turned on my laptop, and started the update.

I noticed the computer and the cat were now playing a cat game together. -Hey, I'm a cat! I was just playing cat, and the computer went to its own world of cats. -What was that again, I thought. I went to the folder where I expected the game, but only found the latest version of the game which I deleted along with the data. I was a little disappointed. Then, I started looking for where the game actually was. I had the vague feeling cats can jump around in the background of a computer, so I got a cup of coffee and started taking a look around.

This computer is already running Windows 10! No, I thought to myself. The screen on the left is a cat screen which is showing that the computer is running at the moment. The right screen is a Windows screen. What's weird is that I can move between the two, but the right one changes.

The screen on the right changed into a computer running Linux. The Linux screen also changed into a cat menu with two choices: Linux and Windows. I clicked Linux... It still was Linux, and also, I was playing the Linux cat version of Windows. My fingers were not on the keyboard, so the game was not running, however, cats were running. I tried to close the Linux screen by clicking the X in the corner of the game. Something didn 't seem right.





""Hey, I'm the creator! You want to play with me!"" I was startled by one of the cats, and when I looked at it, all three of them were playing a cat game together. One of them, the smallest, was playing a role as a player, and the other two were playing in the background as the game was running.

It was the most amazing experience that had ever happened to me. I was completely surrounded by cats! I felt like I was in a cat's dream. The tiny cat and one of the smaller cats were playing in their own world of cats, while the biggest cat, about three times as large as the others, was in my computer, playing with the keyboard.

I was mesmerized. I was so distracted, that while I had realized what was going on, I had also completely forgotten about the computer I was looking at. I began to drink coffee, just watching cats playing around the screen. This is amazing! I thought. This was the first game I ever created, and now, it seems that the developers have completely taken over the world of Windows.

Then, I started hearing sound. The sound which Windows provides for itself. In the Linux version of the game, I can actually listen to Linux sound, and in the cat version of Windows, Windows sound was playing. If all things were to go well, I could actually hear and play with cats in real time. For a moment, I wondered whether that was possible.

-Hey, this is fun! I thought. I moved to the background, where the cats playing at that moment, but one of them said ""No, this is now my world! You are a cat!"" I ignored the sound and closed the Linux screen as I was",1

He had heard it from the other two, but only because he was the one who had to go get her.

He was, after all, the only one of them who could understand what she was saying. Even the others understood the basic concepts of what she was asking and did everything, but not him. She only would understand him. And for every moment of ineffable pain he had suffered because of that, she had one in return.

He had to find this village, she had said. He had to find the other villagers.

There was a hole in the side of the car.

And it opened.

And he was in a village.

But not like any village.

Something was not right here.

The sun was too bright.

And too clean.

And he was afraid.

He was so afraid.

The woman was standing up in the road now, in front of the village. He felt as if she sensed his presence. No sound had escaped her lips, so he knew that she was just standing, staring and wondering. He had the feeling that she wasn’t looking at him, but at the door he had broken into. There was something in her eyes. She looked so sad. And so angry.

She could probably have killed him.

She could have shot him. Tried to knock him out.

He would have been happy to let her.

Why was she standing there? What was she waiting for?

And then she turned to him.

The hair on her head was not the normal grey-blonde color.

She was black.

“Are you afraid?” she said to him with her soft voice. Her lips moved silently.

He answered in the only way he knew how.

He got in.

And he drove.

What followed was one of those stories that you read about in books, where you don’t understand what’s happening, but it makes all the right sense; you get all the information with just one look in your eyes and one small shake of the head. And you’re the only person who understands. At least from the outside. There are always a few others, of course, standing right next to you, but you don’t dare to look up. You can get information from them, but it won’t be as meaningful as from yourself.

We’ll talk about that later. For now, let’s get to the story.

“Tell me…” The woman had her eyes on him, her lips stopped moving. “Why are you here?”

He knew the answer she was looking for. He didn’t know exactly where his answer should come from, but he did know that the story should end in a sense of completeness, and not like with that old guy. That guy was so old the story seemed to end on some kind of cliffhanger, like it didn’t want to finish at all and instead just went “to be continued…”",1

Let go to the first page of this adventure, you know that’s not as easy as a click away. But by now, I trust you’ve already downloaded this app to your iOS (or Android) device of choice. Or maybe you have a printer and plan to print it out. Or maybe you have already bought the physical edition and want to read that. Whatever the method, by now you’re probably on the island with the narrator, searching for clues about who you’re going to be dealing with here. You can choose a character, but they’re all pretty generic. The story will continue in chapters, and those chapters can be completed in any order, so you don’t have to beat a particular clock to reach the end. However, we encourage you to keep that in mind, because the narrative does progress, and if you do choose a certain character, you’re not at all prepared for that. You could choose a child, a mother, an elderly couple, a mysterious stranger, a ghost dog, or who knows? It could be any kind of “person.” However, when we say “person”, we mean it. This is very much a point-and-click adventure game. That’s what the genre is known for, and it’s what sets it apart from the typical puzzle-platform hybrid games. That being said, the narrative is a part of this adventure as well, and we encourage exploration, so don’t just stick to a set path. We would also hate for you to fall into danger, so try not to fall too far.

Before you start the adventure, we’d like to give you a brief look into the backstory, and how it ties into this story. The game takes place on an abandoned and decaying island, and not necessarily in real time. The time is kept secret, but in the game, the events happen between the present day and approximately 500 years before the events of the game. In that time, people lived on the island, and the island was inhabited. Then, around 800 years before the events of the game, something happened, and the island changed into a cursed place. You might notice that these aren’t the only “islands” in the story, or even the world. In fact, there are many. There’s the forest, the lake, the sea, the town, and on top of that we have the story and events inside a lighthouse. In that time, there might have been one lighthouse, and even though the lighthouse has been destroyed or abandoned, the people knew the way to the light. The first lighthouse might have been destroyed, we have many lighthouses inside the story, and more than any other location in the game. You can expect our own game design philosophy, which is not to mention the lighthouse, unless we can actually show it. The game’s backstory also tells you several times which characters you can and cannot interact with. For example, we don’t want you interacting with characters unless they ask you to. However because of the storytelling aspect, we don’t always do that. Also, in some cases, we will give you some clues you can use to interact with certain characters, but those clues are not meant to drive the plot, and to avoid spoilers, we won’t mention them. However, we will try to hint at them a little, to make you aware that you have that option. For example, let’s go back in time and see what happened 500 years ago, let’s see if there is a history of that lighthouse:

We’ve had many visitors, who came to this island, from many different places. They came on foot, by ship, or whatever kind of transportation they could find. On top of that, these people came from many different time periods, since we haven’t defined a specific date or time for any of them. They came in their different time and styles to the island, and we’ve gathered many stories about those visitors. But to all of those stories, there will come a story we would like you to help me discover more about. There always comes a story and a time where things were different, when things are not as they are now, and more often than not, they are not what they look like. It’s up to you, our little protagonist, to figure out what happened that day… We want you to play around a bit, to play with the different characters, to read different documents, and",1

When they tried to arrest me for murder, I told them to search every nook and cranny in my flat but they didn t find him. Can you prove I killed him? What s his name? I have no memory of him s voice.

"Prompt: You and your cohorts have pulled off your heist as planned. Later, in your hideout, you see TV reports that the payload you hijacked is lethally radioactive Story: 

I believe it has something to do with the energy generated by the decay of elements heavier than helium. If it got a good, firm grip on the Earth's core it would be like a chain reaction. I can't imagine more radiation could be generated from one source.

I guess the bomb doesn't contain a neutron source as in a Hydrogen Bomb, but the nuclear fission reactions that generated the heat that melted the core of the planet. What I don't understand is: Wouldn't it melt the Earth from the inside out, because the reactions are so huge?

It's a fascinating idea and a little bit over the top. Also I wouldn't put too much stock into the theories of the average college student. It's a cool idea and could be explained in a number of ways, some more plausible than others. I think it's just an intriguing concept. A sort of ""nuclear powered superheated magma"". I'm not saying it couldn't happen, or that it couldn't happen soon.

Why would we use this device? Would we try to destroy the Earth? That's kind of a big plan for any individual. Or is this a device that would be used on one planet at a time, like a super satellite that goes around the galaxy and vaporizes every planet in its path?

And if the whole point is to destroy the Earth rather than extract its resources, there'd be no need to build this. You just set a bomb on the surface of the Earth in orbit and detonate it.

Also, a chain reaction that would melt the Earth is still a chain reaction. All that radiation might change the Earth's mantle. It won't be like ""BING! we melted the core!"" And it might not even destroy the planet immediately, depending on the location of the core.

To stop the flow of magma and the collapse of the Earth's crust, the bomb would need to be near the center of the Earth or at least near the core. It's not like setting a bomb in the stratosphere and detonating it, because it would probably take the bomb a few hours to get to the exact location without breaking orbit. As I recall, if you put a bomb at the center or very near the core you'd pretty much be able to destroy the Earth. Just a thought.

It's not like setting a bomb in the stratosphere and detonating it, because it would probably take the bomb a few hours to get to the exact location without breaking orbit. As I recall, if you put a bomb at the center or very near the core you'd pretty much be able to destroy the Earth. Just a thought.

No, as I said, it's a chain reaction that produces heat that melts the core. An H-bomb has a neutron source. A nuclear bomb not only has a fission source, it also has a fusion source. Fusion uses neutrons, so it's no surprise that it's the bomb that melts the Earth.

Why would we use this device? Would we try to destroy the Earth? That's kind of a big plan for any individual.

No, but we could destroy it from orbit. A nuke detonated high above the Earth's atmosphere would take a while for the bomb to reach the core but would devastate the surface of the Earth. It's more plausible that the bomb would be detonated in orbit but that does cause problems. As I have said, the bomb will have taken more than a few hours to reach the exact location of the core. The Earth's gravity well would be greater than that of other nearby planets, so the bomb has a lot of momentum. It would break out of orbit and crash into the ground somewhere within the first few minutes. At the speed it is going Earth's surface it would be very close to the core. If it was dropped into the middle of the Earth, there would be a large ""fuse"" between the Earth's magma core and superconductor and the bomb's heat would trigger it, causing the Earth to become a mini-black-hole.

The fact that fusion is at a lower energy state than fission means that it is much harder to set off.

The only major limitation in setting off any sort of ""super-fusion device"" is finding an appropriate nuclear reactor (in addition to fission).

There was a guy that went on his first trip to Mars with, supposedly, a fusion bomb on board. He said in the video you can see that the guy was excited the whole time. The bomb was made to contain its nuclear reaction,",1

""What do you mean? You just put me in a mental hospital?""

""No, sir. I put you in an emergency room. We figured you were suffering from a case of severe acute delusional insanity, but you were only dehydrated. The drugs that you took to treat your delusion would have killed you if we didn't give them to you immediately! If you hadn't shown up, you could have died!""

+

""I am not going to die in there! ''

""I assure you doctor, you won't die alone. We already located some other relatives of that woman who came at you with those two children in tow. If you want, I can bring them around for you to meet them.""

+

""I'm not going to die! I'm too healthy for that! There's just too much work to be done! I'm going to live! I'm going to live right here!""

+

""Okay, Mr. Jones. We know you can handle it. You are perfectly healthy. We are going to put you on one medication. I'm going to tell you only one thing. If you refuse to take it, we will have to sedate you and force you to take it. And don't worry. It's totally harmless.''

+

""I'm not going to kill myself in the hospital! I'm going to live here, and I am going to do the best job I possibly can! So if you don't want me to succeed, you can go out and get me the medication that I need!''

+

""Fine. Go get it. But if you are going to put me in a hospital, put me in a good hospital where I am sure to succeed!''

+

""Good luck! I'm going to kill myself. There isn't even anybody in the hospital here for me to talk to. He doesn't even know I am in the hospital yet! ''

+

""I'm not going to die! I've beaten this thing! I've proved again and again that I'm perfectly healthy. I'm not going to let you give me a lethal injection! You can shoot me, if you want, but in a hospital where there are nurses around for my family to visit me, I will be perfectly healthy! I'm going to live! Just go get me the medicine I need!''

+

""Sorry, we will be here for you tomorrow morning. If you do not do as we have told you, we will call security.'' It was too late:

+

As I entered the emergency room, I looked up at the doctor. He smiled, ""My name is Sam. Dr. Sam, of course. You'll find my office right there on the corridor. Take all of your belongings with you. Your friends will be here tomorrow morning. It is the best hospital we have, and I am sure you will find it to be most pleasant. It has an old world charm. I also believe that it will have helped your mental conditions to a great degree."" He gave me his most charming smile.

+

""Thank you, doctor.''

+

A few moments of thought and I had decided:

+

""If you don't mind, doctor, I would rather be shot and killed here. I'll save the world that way. In my own way.''

+

''No, Mr. Jones, you're in good hands. Dr. Sam says he is happy to have you!''

+

My last look at God:

+

God, if I don't take the poison I won't live. If I do take it, however, I might live. Which will you prefer?

Then I heard the nurse in the next room say...

""Thank you.'' It wasn't much, but I appreciated it.

A doctor was speaking...

""But that's terrible! I'm not at all a cruel man!'' He looked at me and I think it amused him that I was so delusional... or was it pity?

""Dr. Sam, I really must thank you. I don't know if I could have made it through without you!''

""Really? You mean because I told you it was harmless?''

"Prompt: Your name is Death. You work 168 hours a week as the reaper of souls on planet Earth.

I'd been to a funeral where the dead guy's wife and all of his relatives were talking just loudly about their guy, laughing about how they'd made him have sex with them and shit. The wife was even talking about how nice it was that her husband had died, and she knew it would have been the first time for him.

Well if it's a public service and I'm working that day, it's a free pass to get away for the next 2 or 3.

Hahaha, I know what you mean, even if I tried to explain it, people would probably miss the point entirely.

Anyways, I'd imagine that a day off wouldn't be that uncommon. That's why it's called a day off, after all. I don't know when it would be exactly, but I've heard that if a reaper gets 3 consecutive days off (at least), a reaper gains the ability to re-use his/her soul.

In your case, being the owner of a mortuary, I imagine that there are plenty of people on that job who need to visit the doctor for a checkup. You are probably the perfect person to accompany them, though you do have to make sure that you get yourself into a place where people aren't able to ask you awkward questions.

Anyways, I'd imagine that a day off wouldn't be that uncommon... I'm probably going to go up to a certain point. I don't know how long it usually takes, but I'm trying to go somewhere safe and well protected.

I've never heard anything good about the name ""Dreadnought"". It should be ""Dreadnought"". And a ship should not be called by the name of the commander. They should call it, ""The Emperor's Glory"" or something.

A good choice would be to name your ship after a ship of the Imperial Navy's - the ship's name should be the same/similar to that of the ship you are trying to emulate, not your ship is named after a military rank or someone who is the commander. In other words, your ship is 'The Emperor's Might'.

If you can, please, provide an accurate description of your ship's ship model and hull class as well as its specifications.

Thank you.

The ship I am trying to emulate is The Yamato, so it was an obvious choice to name my ship after them.

As you can imagine I am not the best at spelling.

But when it comes to the specifications. The Yamato is the main ship which is used for the main fleet. While that is a rather obvious choice the ship is still named after that man and when it comes to specifications. It's the longest ship ever built of a country with the largest amount of tonnages for the time. While not used by my people anymore (as that was the job of the Zuikaku, the ship I was also interested in emulating), the Yamato's specifications remain known.

However, the Yamato did not have the class you have described. They are the Yamato class A-B-Bs. They were the main ships used (while still not being classified as Imperial) but not the main.

Thank you for taking the time to make this story. I am sure it will get a positive response.

I should also mention that the ship class is a bit of an oversimplification at a first glance.

There are basically two different ship classes with two different names/classifications. The first is called The Yamato class. This has three classes, though, called A, B and C. But due to the construction limits in the time it was designed, it could only ever be made into a B. This makes her a Type 41 class which is the only Class 41 you could build if you use the rules I set up.

The other class name is called The Kagerou class. This has five classes. The most recent (Type 45) being a Type 45 class. There are two other classes in between: Type 41 and Type 42. The most recent being a Type 45 class.

The Yamato class is the most famous of them all. It was the most heavily produced with many modifications and improvements (The Yamato and her sister ship, The Musashi, were actually two ships made to look like one). This is the main part which would be used by a larger fleet.

The smaller ships (battleships/battlecruisers) would use the Kagerou class, which is basically a larger version of the Yamato class. For example, Yamato class B or Type 41.

So, to sum it up, the Yamato class is the main one. However, in the time the Yamato was in production, it only had a B-class.

I also need to point out that the Yamato class is the only one with a B class. I do not recommend that I change this as it is the most accurate one",1
"Prompt: In the heat of a battle, a soldier stops to save a young child that wandered onto the baddlefield. Story: 

The Battle of Baddlefield, the Battle of Waterloo, the Battle of Gettysburg.

The sun was high in the sky and the child was shivering. As the boy looked up at the man, he suddenly recognized the face of his father. ""Daddy, where can I hide? The soldiers are coming!"" he shouted.

The man quickly glanced down at the ground, scanned a few feet in front of him, and looked over a short hedge to the left. Without thinking, he said: ""Why, I might as well go that way. Who else does he have to play with? It's right over there. What's her name? Mary? Heh, Mary, why don't you come here and I'll show you where the guns are all set up.""

As he spoke, the boy darted out of his father's grasp and ran out into the open.

""Daddy!"" he cried, ""Can't you see them? There are more of them than all the rest of the world put together!""

His father grabbed him again. ""You stay right there, Mary!"" he shouted as he scoured the fields. Finally, he picked up a small stone and threw it at the boy. As it sped toward him, suddenly he could see little Mary running towards him.

""What's wrong, Daddy?"" she cried.

""He's crazy!"" he exclaimed as he ran over to her.

""What did you do?"" the boy asked.

""Saved you, that's what,"" his father replied. ""The best soldiers I know could never run faster than that!""

""But, I thought that the soldiers carried guns,"" the boy said.

""That's what they used to do, Mary,"" his father replied. ""But today they have cannon. Can you imagine? A cannon!""

As he spoke, the boy suddenly stopped in disbelief. Then, to his father's surprise, he ran off, ""Daddy, where do you think he'll hide?"" he asked.

""Now, why didn't I think to tell you this before,"" said his father. ""In the last battle, they hid in the trenches. That's where they'll do this one. Right through there!""

To this day, the boy, never being a soldier, has never seen a cannon. But, he has told many a story about his experience with his daddy, a story that only a father and his soldier son would understand.

""Daddy,"" the boy would tell his grandchildren. ""I saw the most magical day. I stood on Waterloo bridge. I watched as they loaded the cannon at the place they had made with great precision for the previous day. I saw them put the powder in by hand at the end of the barrel. I saw the powder being placed by soldiers. I saw them all day, until I thought it so....

""Then that night, the night of the battle, they loaded it up again, and I watched that night for several days. Each night would come the cannon would rise, and each dawn would find that soldiers loading the cannon. I thought that it would never stop!

""But, finally they stopped, and when the sun came up I saw this very small one, no bigger than you. He was standing right at the front of it. He put this little flag in between his teeth, and then, he pulled a gunpowder lever in the middle of the thing. The soldiers would pull on it until it stopped. Then, he would pull it the rest of the way. As he did, a large hole would open at the end of the cannon, which I think was made with the same precision they made the place at Waterloo for the day before, but I could never be certain, could I?

""Well, in any case, he stopped the lever, and then the boy would jump in. 'Daddy,' the boy would shout, 'I'm scared! Can you save me this time?' Well, I thought it was the most wonderful thing. It seemed he'd always be waiting for me and watching, waiting for his father to save him again!""

*

The boy was a soldier, and he too would fall on the battlefield, and the story is like thousands of father's stories, a story that fathers, soldiers, and fathers and their sons, live and hear and love.",1
"Prompt: `` He was never warm in his entire life. Not once. '' Story: 

``I just assumed that he liked me. I tried to be kind to him, I tried to do all I could. That's all. If it had been anyone else but me, he would have just said so. But it was me that he had to be so quiet with, to be the one to be careful with, to be nice to; it was always me. '' Continue the story:

``He never told me why. Just said: ``I have been hurt too many times. The last time, I was really hurt.'''' Continue the story:

``'I know you can't understand it but I can't even explain it to myself. I just don't know anymore. It's been that way all my life.''' Continue the story:

``Somehow I tried to comfort him on that night. I tried to help him understand that nobody knew about me what I was. But it didn't work. '' Continue the story:

``He got up shortly afterward and went to his room, and locked the door. The next morning before I saw him, he was gone. At noon, he walked back in looking the same as always, except that he was carrying a suitcase. '' Continue the story:

``He was not a good friend at first. He used to talk about his own troubles, not mine. He used to leave me alone and think sometimes that I shouldn't come anywhere near him. Sometimes he would be distant and almost pretend I didn't exist. His friends, they seemed happy he had joined the church, with whatever they thought of their God, but they didn't talk about his past, they didn't ask questions of him. '' Continue the story:

``After three months, he became somewhat easier with me. He told me about the time he had come to the house. Said he had found me, and that made him sad. He had been to his grandmother's because his mother had died in childbirth. He had taken a cab there and paid all his money for her coffin, and had to bring her, because there had been a plague and the cemetery had closed. He said he had carried her because she had been a good woman. '' Continue the story:

``That was the end of his sadness about her. '' Continue the story:

``It was also the start of my sadness. '' Continue the story:

``I found out how bad his mother had been. '' Continue the story:

""What she did to them. Why, you don't know. What she could do if she wanted. I guess you could call it an evil. I didn't. I thought of it as the law.''' Continue the story:

``'One day he came back to the house. It was a quiet day, so we were quiet. There were times we didn't talk at all, but we were friends. Then, he sat in his chair and fell asleep. He slept all afternoon. '' Continue the story:

``When it got dark, he woke up and started looking about for his pants, as if he was ready to leave. Maybe he was. I took the suit-case, and said: ``Come with us; your friends can go on home.`` I think he woke up from something or other, because he said: ''Where?'' I think I said: ``We still go to our home; this house was yours.'' '' Continue the story:

``''He got his pants and said: ''Let's go.'' And we walked toward the train together, and boarded it together, and we sat in the same seats that we always had sat in. '' Continue the story:

``He was quiet at first but he started talking. I remember him telling this story about how when he was twelve years old he had gotten in trouble and the judge gave him a hundred years to stay somewhere. So he stayed there. '' Continue the story:

``''His hair was down to his shoulders, and he was thin and looked old. There was gray in it. He looked even younger than I had ever seen him look, like he still was twelve years old that they sent him to that place to be punished. '' Continue the story:

``His face became very solemn, as if his father had just told him a very sad thing. He looked at me and, after an interval, said; ''He told me I had to go to a room and stay there every day. All day. Just go there, eat and walk back and forth.'' I said: ''The judge isn't a fool. That place is much like prison.''

"Prompt: Begin and end your story with this sentence: `` And yet, the city remained. '' Story: 
`` That first night after the bombs fell, the people slept under a layer of ash, the moon winking in the sky. All that morning and the next, word reached the city that the emperor, His Excellency General Himmelfurthendur the Fourteenth, had finally risen from his sickbed and that his troops were approaching. The following day, the entire kingdom, some 10 million people, lined up outside the palace, waiting for their ruler to arrive.
`` As His Excellency and his entourage approached, the people held their breath, thinking of a day when they had all been citizens of the Great Kingdom, knowing a little bit of every language and dialect spoken by every citizen. Their faces glowed with pride, thinking that with two generations of hard work, they could have brought the city to the position they were in now, a shining jewel in the center of their region, the place to be.
`` Then, he appeared -- a tall, slim, fair-haired man dressed in black military uniforms with a gold trim holding a golden scepter, wearing a golden crown, his face framed by a red cloak trimmed with gold. His long white hair blew in the breeze as the crowd cheered and waved their flags and the emperor took his throne.
``
`` (Author’s note: The story I told you was made up and is nothing but a fantasy version of what happened in the city after the bombs fell.)
``

Do you even know what to say after the story? (See what a challenge this is?!)

It doesn’t matter. You need to keep reading for just one more sentence. Don’t worry about giving the correct answer. If you look carefully, you’ll see that the sentence you’re about to write has already been used in the story.

This is the perfect place to insert what you just read and your new sentence. (See what this is like?!)

Here’s what you write:

As the people of the kingdom waited for their new emperor to speak, they whispered among themselves about what a great leader His Excellency the Fourteenth had been. They had hoped that his rule would be good for the kingdom. They remembered the last emperor who had been a great ruler and the king under whom a stable government had been in place. The current rulers of the Great Kingdom had done well for two generations, but they had gotten greedy. They wanted to be the richest the people in the kingdom had ever known.

`` (Author’s note: In this version, we’re still continuing the story, but the author is moving back in time. By writing a small sentence here and not a full one, the reader knows to read the story backward.)",1
"Prompt: It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter. It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back. It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals. And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... Story: 

The letter was addressed to you-know-who.

We opened it, thinking it might be a Christmas card or a present. Instead, we got an invitation! Santa knew we'd taken you along on the ride with the Krampus reindeer! So that we'd have time to visit a particular site before he came, he asked if he could send us there. It sounded kind of sweet, actually. He had a specific area in mind... and we didn't mind which way the wind was blowing.

Just to be sure, though, and because we can never be too sure of things, we asked if we would see our faces on the site before he arrived. You know... we did NOT want to miss the ""magic.""

It seemed like the sort of thing you'd enjoy, Santa. We'll admit that. We enjoyed it too.

The spot in question is located on a high plateau above a canyon that runs through Arizona. The road winds down the steep incline, eventually running into a parking lot. The lot isn't terribly large, but it is well-maintained.

We arrived while the crowds were small... and before too many tourists showed up. It was too dark to see much, but by now... our eyes were open. Even a half-blind horse could see the two men on the reindeer. And they weren't just two men... they were two men AND a woman.

The woman -- you-know-who -- looked like a cross between a Native American chief and a Roman Legionnaire. She stood proudly at attention, her arms crossed over a warrior's chest. The man who stood before her had a military look, too, but for once, I didn't have to look behind him... I'd already seen what was there, I'd just hoped it was real for a second! If it weren't, we wouldn't be seeing the next part of this story... that would make it just another one of these...

...

I stood alone in the shadows, unable to make eye contact as I watched the two ""actors"" wander down the path together. Eventually, two men entered the area where we were positioned.

I didn't know these ""actors""... did you? I never had seen them before, but it was clear by now that they were the ones who had sent the letters to the reindeer. It wouldn't have been the first time Santa had brought his friends along for the ride.

The woman approached us as the man who stood behind the woman looked over the site. She asked in her native tongue if we were in need of assistance. I took a moment to study her. She had a sort of Indian, maybe, look... but she didn't look very Indian to me. She was European-looking, I thought, mostly Russian.

As she talked, I began to notice the change in the shadows. The first one was the man who was with us. The second change was another, this one female in a black dress who slipped out of the shadows and into Santa's coat pocket.

""Oh, yes!"" the woman exclaimed, as she took me out of Santa's hand! I was so surprised I did nothing but stare at this woman... not trusting my eyes. She was wearing a black leather coat and the leather was split at the side... exposing a piece of fur. In that coat, the fur just barely looked like skin. The look was so familiar, but before I could even wonder why, the woman opened her coat and pulled a long object from within her pocket.

It was a cross, about as long as my hand. The woman opened one side like a flower.

The petals moved back and forth... and then stopped. The center of the cross turned red... and the cross moved up and down in a blur. It was like those old slide shows you'd watch on TV... only it wasn't a slide show... it was a real life, three-dimensional painting.

I stood there, stunned, as it happened so fast that I couldn't quite comprehend it.

""What is this?"" Santa asked, pulling his hand out of hers. ""What are you doing?""

""What is this?"" Santa asked again. The woman held the cross flat against the ground, and she pointed to something in the distance. Santa's eyes couldn't quite see it... but I could. I could see it clearly.

It was a tiny figure, standing on the ground.

And as the figure moved slightly, Santa could see the face of the man. He was standing next to a door, as if being",1
"Prompt: Since childhood you 've been told that only death awaits you outside the wall. For years you have been curious. Today is your chance. Story:  You know that the last thing you see when you die will be a vision of the world, as seen by you, after an indeterminate, long time. It will be one of the most fantastic experiences you can ever have. You need to escape from this wall and find your soul. This is your one chance to break free.

Now is the time to begin your escape! Find the gate, you need to exit the wall.

Use your mouse to find the gate. When you enter you'll meet the Warden. In this story you will be one of his prisoners. Listen to our sound! If you die, you lose! Good luck, have fun and do good!

Wizard's Balloons: A Wizard's Balloons puzzle is a type of sliding puzzle. They are similar to a crossword puzzle or a Sudoku, but with the twist that you can only move the pieces up, down, left and right. You can use your mouse to play... The gameplay for Wizard's Balloons has been designed for PC and Mac (OSX). It is based on the java, jogl, and jruby languages. The game includes a wizard, a castle and a game board. The game board has two halves, with two players and six holes (see below). When the game is started, in each hole on each half the letters A to P appear. The first player to fill their own hole with letters A to F or G to P in ascending order in any particular order wins the round. All the letters appear in random order and don't have to be in descending order. The game board looks like this:

The game board has holes at the top and bottom of the board. At the top board, you get letters from G to P. The A to E parts are empty and have numbers 1 to 6 in them. The empty holes on the bottom board show numbers 1 to 6. On top of the game board, you can enter the level number for the current level. The level number is 1 at the beginning. At the bottom you can see a progress bar. Each letter in the round one is worth 1, and each letter in the score is 2. When the progress bar fills the game has ended and the level ends. When you enter the level number all of the letters above the board disappear and all of the empty letters return. When you enter the game, the empty holes have letters 1 to 6 inside. The first player to fill all the holes with matching letters wins the round and is the winner of the round. It's important to take note of the gameboard so you don't have to restart the game. The game board can be rotated, with the mouse wheel. At the bottom right you can choose the size of the letters and the size of the game board. You can set it to be the same as a standard board and choose the size of the letters, and also make it larger than a standard board. If you choose to have the size of the board bigger, at the lower left of the board you can also increase the number of the game board levels. The game can also be sped up or slowed down how much the turn takes. You can adjust the game board size with the mouse wheel and you can increase the game board size or speed with the mouse. If you press the right mouse button the board will be resized and the number increased or decreased with 1, 3, 5, 10, or 15 units. While there is not a time, level, or score you can still win more points at higher levels. In other words, at level 50 points are more valuable even though it's harder to win. You automatically begin with 30,000 points. There are also three other wizards that you can face in the game. You can increase the difficulty with the different wizards, to learn the patterns of each wizard. You have a few things to keep in mind as you play as a wizard. The game has seven wizards named 'the wizard', 'the wizard (hard)' 'the wizard II', 'the wizard III', 'the wizard IV', 'the wizard V' and 'the wizard (alliance)'. When you win the wizard's name appears above your wizard. The wizard is different for each wizard. Each wizard can be defeated. The wizard 1 has a wizard robe. They also have the most hp at 100,000. They also have a long sword. If you get to a wizard there is a chance that you can hit it on the first move. A hit is worth 1,000 points. A single hit from a wizard on the level 10 game board will increase your score by 20,000! It works the same with each wizard. On the higher levels if you have 10 to 15 hits, your points will increase by a large amount. When your hits from the wizards reach 15,",1

Hello, everybody! Welcome to our comic. Our comic name is The Adventurers (the bold and italic part).

We've just began to make the comic, and we're currently working to finish. At the moment we've only one chapter, and it is the introduction. So please bear with us.

Our English is still a big mess, so, sorry about that. As for the artwork, the comic is made by a team of 5 people. We can provide commissions as well. We are not the best at this, but we'll be glad to make a little contribution.

This comic will be completely a story that takes place in the world of Skyrim. We've decided to make a ""Skyrim-specific"" comic because we want to share our stories. We also have other comics on TvTropes, so if you like our comics you might be interested.

We hope you enjoy our comic. It's been a while since our last work and we miss it very much. Thank you all :3.

The Return of the Lord

As part of the Easter cycle, I feel obligated to say prayers of forgiveness and repentance for my sins and the sins of others during the Lent period and to celebrate the Resurrection of the Lord.

I am no longer the same young Christian woman who once prayed, “Our Father,” each day before going to school or to work or wherever we might not be going for the next few hours. I am no longer able to utter those pious words. But, I can still pray my own personal “Our Father,” which is a prayer for forgiveness and salvation for me but which incorporates the entire Christian community.

I pray that God, from whom all blessings flow and to whom all blessings must be surrendered, will grant forgiveness and salvation to me and to others as well, so that we will not be condemned for our crimes because of our sins.

We Christians believe that the Lord has returned, so, as part of the Easter cycle, we must be prepared to say prayers of thanksgiving. At this time, we must say prayers of forgiveness and repentance for our sins, and, most of all, we need to say prayers of thanksgiving.

The Lord’s death on the cross was a total surrender to God, a surrender of his life and life mission. In order to be saved, we must voluntarily surrender our lives to the Lord. In order to be saved, we must give our total trust in God. Without any doubt or fear, you and I must let God into our lives.

We must not pray: “Thank our Lord for his coming down to our rescue!” or: “Thank our Lord for his coming down to end all human suffering!”

But in order to be forgiven and be saved, we must pray: “Lord Jesus, from all eternity, the Father has loved your spirit, so, at this very moment, he sends his Holy Spirit and he dwells and lives permanently in your spirit, so that, for eternity, you might have the life of your spirit. From all eternity, we must believe your spirit is in you and that you are alive in your spirit, so, at this very moment, we believe in the life that is in your spirit. With this life, you forgive us for all of our sins that we have committed. Forgive us, and grant us forgiveness from all of our sins. So that, from all eternity, we might enjoy eternal life with you. We thank you. Amen.”

We must believe in the fact that there resides within all of us a spirit, a life force which is the source of all life and health in our body. Jesus Christ revealed to us this spirit, God, in his person, so that, when God looks at you, he will see Jesus and, as a result, you will receive God’s forgiveness and salvation.

Forgiveness for others is not a question of giving someone who has offended you another chance to earn your forgiveness, because, with God’s forgiveness, no one can or must be punished for his own good.

Instead, we must say: “We must see that all persons on earth, whether they be of Chinese origin and religion, Caucasian or Indian origin, whether they be believers or unbelievers, are one family. Our life, our spiritual and moral lives, are all interdependent. If one person hurts or is harmful to another, he must be punished. If everyone hurts every other person, nobody will be safe. It is the spirit within all persons of every nation of every religion which must live in all of us. Only when we can do that will we call a truce within the circle of human life and can unite around the common goal which is the well-being of everyone on earth.”

When we forgive others, we are forgiving God because his spirit is in us. And, when we are forgiven, we must be saved not just for a while but forever and, therefore, we need to say prayers of thanksgiving.

Today, we believe that God has not yet returned to earth personally, but if you want to pray for the arrival of God in person, you must also say prayers for the “Risen One” who will make us live for eternity in our spirit.

We must pray: “Lord Jesus, our saviour, from now and for eternity, you and your Holy Spirit dwell within our spirit, so that we may be resurrected and live spiritually forever. We thank you. Amen.”

We all need and ask forgiveness from God, from each other, and from the innocent people we have hurt and, therefore, in the Easter cycle, we must also pray for",1
"Prompt: Jesus returns, to a world populated entirely by robots. Story:  In which case, I’ve got the solution. It’s a little heavy-handed and obvious, but it’s exactly the kind of story I want to be telling, a way I want to be telling the story of apocalypse. It would, I thought, be an interesting experiment to do, to see if I could work something for a feature film. I love the idea, and I love the original concept.

I’ve got some screenplays. I’ve got a couple of stories about robots. And at the top of the story is John Connor. (You may remember, he is the hero from Terminator.) But you’ll understand what I mean when I tell you that John Connor is very, very boring.

I began thinking that it was a cool subject to work — for a while — but that it was too familiar: I had already done these stories. I’d started them at different points in my writing career. I’d already dealt with the subject. I’d already thought about the possibilities. But it was like I was walking around the room, looking at all these images on the wall, and saying, “What’s the one image that stands out? The image that would be the most iconic. That would be the one image that is not just the wall, but the entire film’s wall. That would be the image you see when someone first meets the film. Or that’s the image you see that would be seen a year later. That’s the image that will be seen a year from now. That would be the image that’s gonna stand up for the rest of the film.”

The answer, of course, was the image of a little girl running down the steps. [SPOILER FOR T2: TERMINATOR] What comes to mind? The image of John Connor running. He’s got that look on his face, he’s running, and as you watch him run from the first time frame and move into the middle one [SPOILER for T2, from James Cameron] you see the Terminator. This is the icon that stands as a reminder of how Terminator is about all-encapsulated by one image — the iconic image — that you will have in your mind, for a long time.

What I’m thinking is that if I could put in a time-jumping effect — that’s the reason they never made The Terminator III: Future-John Connor: the idea [SPOILER T3] that you’re watching a scene where John Connor is being sent into the future. I thought it would be interesting to try that with the idea of the apocalypse and time-jumping. In Terminator 2, I do see a Terminator: and he tells the [SPOILER from T3] little girl who’s watching the movie, “When the dust clears, there will be a moment that I’ll wish I’d kissed her.” She’s looking at him with this look and this is how he knows what she knows, the look between them, that’s the last image of the Terminator in the movie.

You need more than one image to understand the whole thing. You need the idea of time-travel. There’s another important image of the end of the world from Terminator 2 — we see the Terminator as it’s about to destroy the [SPOILERS from time line] world with an atom bomb. We’ve seen the Terminator in many ways — we’ve just had a picture of him, that’s not a really deep look. It’s a different story that goes into the Terminator’s back story. There’s a lot of other [SPOILERS from time-line] we could have done. We could have done a whole lot. It’s a bigger story, and it would [SPOILERS from time] take a lot longer to tell. Why do that? Terminator is about one image to the end of the world and that first image we see is the one we remember. It stands up there in our heads. To me, that’s the movie they should do a movie about at that time and for that point in history, and the one image of the end of this time was it — for a few years at least. That was the image of the end of the world. And that’s an interesting thing to think about.",1

"Prompt: Teen social life in the 25th century ( 2400 AD to 2500 AD ). Partying, prom, graduation, etc. Story:  http://kikolojika.com/2012/06/03/tear-joint/





I am here, to see how you are doing on the project...

Here are two of the characters that I am working on. Theirs the only models that I am getting right, at the moment.



Roxann - https://kikolojika.com/2014-03/13/tear-joint-roxann-and-kadir-on-the-pond/



Kadir - https://kikolojika.com/2014-03/21/tear-joint-kadir-pond-dice/



I think they have potential. I really hope and I work very hard at improving them.



I have two more characters I am working on besides these two. One is a guy with a prosthetic hand - http://kikolojika.com/2013/11/18/dice-pond-kadir-and-prosthetic-hand/ that I am not too sure on how far I am going to work on. They have great potential - I think the best character is coming up...



The other character I really want to work on is in the middle two pictures. I am interested in making the third photo that I have in a way that a person can see the character that I am building. I want to make a girl that is in a bikini and she is sitting on a rock with her back turned to the camera with her arms crossed. Her body language is also very calm. She is pretty happy and confident.



Do you think I can make it so that I can make a girl like this?



Do you think it can be done?



Thanks!









If any of you are interested in helping me draw some better characters and some better backgrounds go into the comments on this page. I would appreciate it.



In other news I have the idea that Kadir is probably not a guy - he is part of a family and he has been raised in a family for all his life. He is also a smart guy. I should not only build a character, I should build a whole family around him. That way, I can have a whole group of people instead of just a single person! Who would not want this?



Here's the idea:



The whole point of the game I am making is that, in some kind of futuristic world, a girl becomes addicted to using the internet and it destroys all her relationships in her life. She then has to go to the past, back to the 25th century, to live somewhere else to recover from all the addiction she has to do.



It's a great premise for a game and a funny premise but I am not yet sure what it will end up looking like. I don't plan on it being a shooter game, more a adventure game. I want it to look good and have good characters and story line. If I manage to do this I will make the best game I can.



The game I will make will take place in a virtual reality (VR) world. I am using the Oculus Rift as my development tool in order to get closer to the experience of being immersed in the VR world. I should get to that in a few weeks when I am done with coding the actual game part.



If somebody is interested in contributing to the project and making art for it, that is great. I will most likely be looking for somebody to draw better, higher quality backgrounds. I will also be looking for a person to model, again higher quality. I want a fully detailed character to be created.



I am also going to keep looking for people to write stories and story lines to the game. Some of these ideas I am already working on. My best part about writing, is that I actually work on the story lines before any art design. So if I find a great story line that fits into the whole VR adventure game that I am creating I will have a story line ready that should look great - because I am going to story board it before trying to model anything to it.



For me, it works really well.





I also really want to make, out of all the characters I am building, a main character that the player will be in control of. I am still working on that concept.





I am building on a theme. I want to explore the theme of ""love"" through my character development in the game. I want the player to be able to control Kadir; I want the player to be able to control",1
"Prompt: Suddenly, everyone on Earth becomes immortal, free from physical injury or disease. Except for one person. Story: 

The man walks into a room to find a girl. She smiles at him and asks if he likes the dress she’s wearing. He realizes she hasn’t yet aged because he’s experienced time at a faster pace than her, and so he takes an extra moment to think.

“It’s really nice,” the man eventually says. “When was it made?”

“About 20 minutes ago,” the girl replies.

The Man’s jaw drops. The girl hasn’t aged a day in the last 20 minutes.

“What about all the people that were here, their children, their grandchildren? If you were here twenty years ago, your children would be this age, the people they are now, they would still be this age, and your grandchildren are at this age right now.”

The girl doesn’t understand.

“Look at this watch I have.” He passes it to her. “It says it’s three hours ago.” She takes it and looks at it. “See, here, these are the people standing in this room. We were down the block fifteen minutes ago.” The girl stares blankly at it. “But here, we’ve been down to the other side of the Earth. See how much older everybody is?”

The girl is silent.

“Why haven’t they aged at all? Why are we just fifteen minutes older?”

The girl is lost for a moment.

“Well, do you have kids?” the man asks. “Do you have grandchildren?”

“No.”

“If you do, how will you explain this?” The man shows her the girl’s watch. “Even if you don’t go into this room, someone will go into this room. Every single person in the world, every single person goes into this room. Every single person is this watch. But here, you’re not, because you haven’t been for a while. And so to all of these people, you don’t look older.”

The older person sighs in defeat. “All right.”

“So we see in the future where this girl sits here and we say, ‘See, she’s aged normally.’

“But if we don’t age,” the man continues, “you’re probably looking at a very strange world in which almost no one has ever aged.”

There’s a very uncomfortable moment of silence, and the man decides to make a joke: “So don’t take pictures.”

The man, I don’t know how, will be the only person from the present age who sees the future. He is immortal, which makes him a powerful person. All the rest of the world will have no memory of themselves and they will not know they have a future, so they will not be able to tell themselves “We will be like this.” When they see the new world, they will be as surprised as this man.

This is the second story in my series. The first, “Time Machine,” was published in New Scientist in October of 1984 and ran as the cover story the following summer.
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check-theories-in-a-new-xkcd/the-xkcd-time-machine/

In the summer of 1985 I received a lot of feedback about this illustration, that the guy wasn’t wearing pants, so that was taken out. (Also, I had to make a number of minor changes to match the story, like explaining the watch.)

Here are some reactions that I got from news stories over the intervening years:

“How can we avoid such a world of “non-agers”?”

“The only solution to such a dilemma is to kill yourself”

“If you want to stop someone from dying, you can either shoot them or poison them. It’s no difference. If they don’t die, they’ll age. If they do, you’ve saved their lives and you have to shoot/poison yourself.”

“The best solution, because it is kindest, is to let them die. If they don’t do it themselves, nobody else should have the power",1

"Prompt: Tot save the life of your best friend, you have to challenge the devil to a game of chess. You are pretty good, but the devil already has an eternity of practice Story: 

Play

How to play:

If there are five hours until the sun comes up, the clock will stop. The last person walking around the table wins.

If someone makes a move the clock will stop; in a real game, this would happen when someone makes a pass. The clock will then continue to run in an indented pattern. The first person to stop the clock wins.

If it becomes obvious that there will be no winner, and the players agree to continue anyway, the clock will run faster than in a real game. It will stop when there are no more turns left for the game. Whoever has the strongest move wins. If there is a tie (both players have the same number of points), the game is over immediately.

Variants in the real world:

In the real world, if everyone wants to make chess a draw, the clock will run slower than normal. If the last person to make a move wants to make it a draw, they can make the move last longer than everyone else to reach this end.

In real-life chess, the clock is stopped whenever the king is safe, not when it is on the edge of a trap or is the last piece. In that case, the clock does not run. This is known as a standstill.

The clocks are usually set on the wall face forwards, with the clock itself set to '8.00'. On clocks for computer games, the second hand moves continuously from 2.00 until the end of the time setting.

A chessboard is traditionally set up using a 7x7 grid, in the form of a seven-step octagon, but different arrangements of the chessboard (such as 8x8 or 9x9) can be used when the number of players is greater or a different method of counting is used.

There are eight pieces in the game: the king, the rook, the queen, the knights, the bishops, the pawns, the queen's knight and the king's pawn. Pieces are not interchangeable; a queen can never turn into a rook or a rook into a bishop.

The starting position of a chess game is known as the 'fianchetto' position — in which the pawn is turned into a fork. This is done by playing...e5, forcing White to play a6, attacking the exposed e4-square for a piece. White would normally recapture by playing...c5 in order to put his rook on an a7-square. The starting position is usually chosen based on the positions of the players. For a three- or four-player game, it is more common to play on a 10x10 board with a white square at the centre. A 5x5 or 2x2 starting position is also frequently used for a two-player game.

The chess clock is made to sound a series of five chimes by striking its bell; this is done for seven chimes after a rook has been captured and for ten chimes after any move that makes it necessary to mark the board with ink (see rules).

Play

1. The beginning of play

The first player to place the white king on the eighth rank moves first (from the starting position); the next white king (on the 7th rank) moves diagonally to the square beneath the first white king, and so on. The black king does not move yet, but may appear.

Play continues in clockwise fashion until a player's king is checked by the opponent's king; this constitutes capture. A player who is checkmated loses immediately. The time of each player on move is set by a clock or by agreement of the players, who mark their moves with the aid of a chess clock or chronologer (see rules of the clock).

2. The rules of chess

If a move does not fulfil the conditions necessary for an immediate check, that is when the king touches an opposing king, rook, or bishop. The player who moves, or whose move causes an immediate check, is awarded ""checkmate"".

A piece may be taken only if it can be checkmated (see rule 3 below), and the defending player loses his turn if the piece is captured.

There are two ways to checkmate the king, and there are various ways to ensure the king is caught:

When the king is on the edge of a trap (see the article on traps).

The defending player may voluntarily give up his turn; this is called 'drawing' or 'taking a draw', and counts as the winning of a draw, although the game is not over.

Drawing automatically causes the player to lose the game.

Write a really, really, good story that's as short as possible.

You should really think to do a story which you will make it good.

Also, you should try to avoid using very similar stories with similar characters before and that are done by more skilled writers.

How exactly?

Why didn't you pick the first story, the shortest story in the list?

Why did you pick the second story? Is there another story in the list that you'd rather write now instead of that one?

Write this character's backstory at the beginning of the story.

Don't show more about the character's back story than necessary.

How exactly?

Write a ridiculously terrible paragraph.

I mean, write a paragraph that will definitely make people want to kill you.

Seriously, write whatever you want, but the first part should be very descriptive and the end should be very emotional. It should not be just ""lol my cat puked on my hair"", but ""my cat puked on my hair because I was really sick and I had to stay in the bathroom for a long time because I couldn't eat for a very long time"".

Also, if you don't want to do a story in the list, write your own story and write an essay describing what the main reasons are why your story is better than the other stories in the list.

That's how the storywriting tag works. Basically, you can say whatever you want. If you write a lot of the same story, however, you will get flamed.

Also, a good way to get flamed is to tag each story with a very descriptive tag with only a line or two, and then write a really emotional tag with a paragraph or so. You can also try tagging every single story with [story] or [essay], but you'll get even more flamed.

How to Write a Story the Hard Way by Michael Scott

How can we write stories? Stories are very important.

And writing a story by yourself is not an easy thing

There are two ways to write a story

One is the way people do it. That’s the easy way to write a story.

It is a way to describe a story.

A story can be written by the easy way. It is very simple.

That way, anyone can write it.

Anyone can write a story easily.

The second way to write a story is to write a story by yourself.

That way is very hard.

The second way to write a story is to write a story by yourself.

How can you write a story by yourself?

The first thing you must do is to write all the information about the story.

The second thing you must do is to imagine the story very well, but do not write it already.

The third thing you must do is to write the beginning of the story. You must try to write a story that is not just a way to describe a story.

You must try to write a story that is very interesting and has a very emotional feeling.

You must write a story very well to try to write a story that is very interesting and has a very emotional feeling.

"Prompt: A man orders a `` cheese pizza with no crust '' from a local pizza delivery joint as a joke. Unbeknownst to him, that pizza joint is a drug front and he just placed an order for a kilo of cocaine. Story:  the next day, youre at work when you notice the pizza in its box on the kitchen counter. Youre wondering how long the delivery from the night before took to get here, and how hungry you are. It was just sitting there since the night before; if it arrived in the middle of the night, there wouldnt be any pizza to find in the morning since you probably slept through it. Youre still wondering how long it took to get to the kitchen. Suddenly a call goes out for pizza. The delivery guy is standing there and he takes your phone from you and calls you. Youre taken away, handcuffed and stuffed in the back of the police car. Its a good thing that youre in a white collar criminal defense firm; you think; this is one case that you wont lose because it defies the laws. You and your client have been charged with manufacturing cocaine. Its funny, you always thought the only crimes in your firm would involve people who steal cars or rob banks, or any other kind of crime that would put someone behind bars, and you figured a criminal defense case never would be one of them. But this time, it actually seems like a case that could come easy. Youve seen the headlines now; The pizza has put your firm in the spotlight, and now theyre making you sweat to come up with the right kind of proof. When were the drugs brought into the house, and how did they happen to turn up in your house? The police never arrested you, so youre in the clear on that. And you have a decent alibi for where you were, so that doesn't affect their case. But theyve got you on the manufactured cocaine; are you going to be able to win your case? The manufactured cocaine charge carries a potential jail sentence of between 5 to 9 years; depending on when you were caught, and depending on how much stuff were were dealing.

But its really important that the police don't see you trying to hide anything. And if there are two or three people charged with this crime, and they arent your confidents and you don't know them, you really have to try to look like you havent even noticed that there's a crime going on, but if they do notice, youll have to explain how you found out about it. You need to be able to prove that it was not you doing the crime; that you were just being set up, set up by somebody you have done several business with, or somebody else. These are the questions that you need to ask your lawyer; but before you get to him, you see that everyone is looking at you as they walk into the courtroom. Theyve got to know that you are going to be in the same line-up as the other two, and that you could have done this crime. At the same time, when you look up into the box and realize what they have done to you, all you can do is stare right back at them. Your life will never be the same. Your life will never be normal again. You will never be able to work in the pizza business again. You will never be able to get an apartment in the same neighborhood as any of your co-workers. You may live to be fifty or sixty years old and never able to have that kind of relationship with a person again. For now, you have to go to therapy and work through the pain; try to deal with all the other emotions associated with this ordeal.

You go to your lawyer and explain everything that you were going over with him earlier. He tells you if he has any ideas, and if he doesn't, he will work on one for you. You leave the office and try to work as best you can. This will be your career forever, and now you have to think about your life on the outside, as well. You see your neighbors and the people you work with, but it hasnt really hit you how much different your life is now. You think about how you could probably take over the pizza business that you used to work so hard in every day. While you didnt have a license back then, you thought about how you were going into business, and you had no idea that there was any law involved. You will never be able to do that anymore; at least not legally. You can still do small deals, but you cant really think about it that much, since you know were not dealing any coke now. The idea of having to hire managers so that no one would get hurt is something you couldnt even have known about. You are a man now, and what men do and what men do to each other is their own business.

What

This is the first film to tackle themes of mental illness in an immersive way, taking the viewer into the minds and hearts of its sufferers, and exploring the relationships between them in ways that most films of this kind do not.

The Story

In the post-apocalyptic world, the majority of people are infected with the disease that turns them into a zombie. Two young men, David (Aussie comedian Jacki Smit) and Simon (Australian actor and comedian Matt Moya) are at a crossroads. Simon is now officially a zombie. Their relationship is strained, and their worlds do not include each other, nor do the people around them. As they fight for independence from each other, and a new future, Simon becomes trapped in the relationship with David and in a life of zombie conformity.

What was most important was the idea of telling the story of their relationship: how two people, once friends, become lovers and then ex-lovers. This is the story of the end of a friendship, the beginnings of an affair, and the end of the affair.

What We Can Do

The story of Simon and David is a deeply personal story, and as a result, our story could never have been told without the support, encouragement and collaboration of people with mental illness and their families and friends.

Although we made this film, and will be releasing it as a DVD, this project was made possible by the support of the Australian Government as well as other organisations, institutions and individuals. In order for it to be possible for us and for people like you to be helped, we must raise funds to be able to continue. Our aim is to be able to keep this film going, and to help as many people as we can.

We have created a fundraising page so you can donate to the project you find most comfortable with.

This project is in post-production, and is being released in 2020. We plan to continue releasing this to the public after filming ends, including releasing the script to our supporters after we are finished completing the film.

With your help, we can continue our journey towards producing this project and releasing it to the world. Our goal is to produce a film that can help and encourage others, and in doing so, educate the public on the experiences of people with mental illness.

Our Story

How We Got Here

The idea for this project originated from two of our co-producer, David Foy and filmmaker Jason van Schooten. In 2014, they were producing several documentaries under the banner Film Xplore Productions. One script they were working on was about a man whose mother had been diagnosed with manic depression. With a combination of her illness and the man’s, they began to think about telling this story in a new way: an animated, surreal short animation. It would use humour to explore the impact of mental illness. Jason is the filmmaker with the experience with this particular kind of animation: he directed a zombie film called Zombie High produced by Film Xplore Productions in 2010. That short film won several awards in Australia, and also gained some international attention and screenings internationally, particularly in Vancouver, Canada.

When Simon approached David about this idea in February of 2014, they knew they wanted to help Simon. The most challenging part for Simon and Jason would be filming the documentary with his mother. In our production, their experience in this kind of filmmaking is extensive.

Simon was a friend of David’s, and they had recently become friends with Jason’s partner. When Simon suggested that David and Jason help him make this film, they immediately became eager to take the chance.

The plan was to do the short documentary first, and then do the animation, which is a first of its kind.

Filmmakers as Mental Health Advocates

The film was written in 2014, and we thought we would be able to have a release by 2014 or 2015, but we ran into difficulties. It was a project that needed to be completed by one person, as we have an animation team. Our initial funding was not enough, and we needed to find more money.

One of the ways we were able to raise more resources was to produce this project as a documentary. It could be done and released quickly. With the experience and confidence of Jason in this area, we decided to make the documentary into a movie script to",1

A knock is heard at the door. Opening the door, you look at the man standing there, and wonder how in the world he's found you. He asks for you by your wife's name, and says he has important news about your wedding. As he tells you of course you were married to your wife for twenty-one years, you wonder how he got the information. You go to the living room and tell your companion, who you know is dead, that you have some other friends you wish to talk to. You bring in two men and tell them you would like them to come and live here. They tell you of their own marriages and have children, and you give them directions. The men are pleased with their new ""home"". You are the Mayor of the city, and they, the new owners. They live in the city for a few weeks, until they find a townhouse in the suburbs, which has some good schools for the children. They tell you of their wishes to live in a large city for their grandchildren's education. They say they think people in a large city will like them more. You tell them you will be in charge at your new job, and that you will give them your full assistance to help them find housing, or anything else they might need. You tell them they are very welcome to stay here. You offer to take them out to dinner. When they say that is nice of you, you thank them. They live in the city for two more years because they think people like them in a city environment.

(author's note: My husband and I were planning our wedding and then he died. I guess it was fate that brought me here. But really it's just a story.)

Chapter 2

Five years later:

They are back. They brought back my mother-in-law as well. Since you were such good friends with the Mayor, how would you like to stay in town with us, for a change?

If you choose to leave the story now:

(Author's note: My wife died when I was in grade school. My father was in hospital recovering. My sister was only two and she died also. She died of natural causes; my father was in and out of hospitals for heart trouble. But after my second hospitalization, his heart condition would not heal, and he died after a long illness. I remember him dying too. The doctor told my mother in law one night that we would all visit him one last time. When we got there he was fine, we played games, and my mother in-law made the visit pleasant. My mother in law had been his nurse and housekeeper. I was her great-nephew. We talked awhile in the hospital room. Then she and I sat in the chairs by the window on the opposite side of the room from her husband. She said she wanted to stay in case I needed to talk to her again, and I said I thought that would be an interesting experience. Then she closed her eyes. I thought she was fast asleep, but when I touched her shoulder she said, ""Is it time to go, son?"" I said it was because we had to get ready for dinner. She said to leave it. She died in her sleep, and I went into the room and I held her, and I talked to my father for a few minutes. We didn't even know I knew him, but I did, because he died about the time my mother in law had been in our house with me. The doctors told my mother that if she could get away before everything bad began to happen to me, she was welcome to come. I think because of that, I can remember her, when she was a very special woman of great caring, when she was with her husband. All the years that have gone by were really nice years. I met the man I married, and we got married with your parents. My wife has died. Now you know why I'm telling you all of this. I wish you the best in your own life. I will keep in touch. Goodbye;

(author's note: I never went to the hospital to say goodbye. We just sat a while, then left. I've had a wonderful life. But there has been",1
"Prompt: A budding young sociopath sits on Santa 's lap. Story: 

It wasn’t difficult to spot the child-devouring ghoul. For one thing, he was dressed as a jolly old Santa claus. That would be like putting a plastic bag over a vulture to make it look nice to the kids. Then there was the giant candy jar. He was too short to reach that much, which is a pity, because it looked pretty interesting.

The ghoul’s eyes glowed blood red, and he was very attentive to what was going on around him. A nearby child pointed right at him and asked “Did you see the guy sitting at the candy jar over there?”

“Who was he?” asked another child not far off.

“Well, he looks like Santa!” said one of the kids. “But he has long, thin fingers. And did you see the big jar, with all his candy!”

“Who could it be?” wondered a third. No one dared talk about the fact that Santa was a cold blooded murderer.

The ghoul just sat there. He didn’t say anything. It was very quiet, just the soft hum of children’s happy voices all around him. He just gave his two hands a squeeze and took out a couple more chocolates. But he had to work hard to keep his body from melting away with so much candy.

Suddenly there was a loud screaming that sounded like “Santa! Santa!” Everyone turned towards the source of the sound.

“Oh my God,” said one of the children and took an involuntary step backwards. The ghoul stood up quickly and his big candy jar fell over with a bang. He quickly caught it before it hit the floor, as well, and stood up holding it in his arms like a child himself.

“We gotta go,” he told the children quietly, before he ran swiftly from the room.

“Santa?” called the children out of sight, but the door had already closed after the killer elf. No one said anything for a long time. “Santa, come back! You were supposed to bring us presents! It’s Christmas!” someone called.

This comment got only brief chuckles from the other children. “I know how it is to lose a parent,” said one girl. “I don’t care who we are talking about here!”

The children got up immediately. One of them went over to the door and tried to open it. “It’s locked!” he said in a squeaking voice.

The children looked around and tried to think of every way they could sneak out. They looked from the floor, to the roof and the windows. But nothing had any working mechanism. They could see a whole lot of stuff, but couldn’t get hold of anything.

After a moment of thinking, a boy said “Guys: He killed both of my parents. He’s a cold blooded killer! I’ve gotta get out of here!”

The other children nodded. They all knew who the killer elf was. He was the child that had killed their parents already at Christmas when they were young. Santa Claus had to keep the guy safe. Otherwise he would kill all the other kids one after the other until he was sitting in Santa's chair again. But he had no choice.

They waited for a few minutes, hoping that someone else would show up. But it was as still as a tomb there. The children waited until some children began playing with a little pet that Santa keeps for the children to interact with. After a while, the pet decided to play with them and the ghoul just happened to get in the way.

“Santa, the ghoul's in the way.”

“Where?”

“There! It’s Santa, the ghoul!” one of the children shouted.

“I see you. I have to go, bye,” was Santa’s response. “I’ll return in about four minutes.”

The kids waited. They played around with the pet, but the ghoul was now blocking the whole room from sight.

“Santa, we’re all going to die!” someone shouted. “Santa!”

“I have to go, I have work to do. I’ll return soon!” he told the kids. His long fingers were working very fast and the ghoul had to keep up to catch as many chocolates as possible from the jar, but",1

"Prompt: When you die, you do n't go to the afterlife of you 're religion, you go to the afterlife of the religion whose tenets you followed most closely, knowingly or not. Story: 

Preston, Texas, the capital of small-town America, has been hit by an outbreak of some form of brain tumor that has produced an extremely potent and deadly strain of zombie plague. The outbreak occurred within the walls of Preston's only two local hospitals, and while it seems the virus has begun to subside since the official end of the epidemic, hundreds of dead people lying in the halls of the hospitals are rotting away, causing local panic and raising grave questions about where they are going to house and what condition the corpses will be left in. While city officials have tried calling for volunteers to act as ""bodyswap"" and remove the corpses in the hallways and hospital beds - essentially performing the role of a hospital mortician - most of Preston has refused, with many locals believing a zombie plague is simply ""not going to happen here,"" with the town instead choosing to use its limited funds to provide aid to those less fortunate. However, the citizens of Preston are unaware of the real facts: that the zombies are caused by a zombie vampiroid, a flesh-eating virus that was produced in the Preston labs three years prior, and their government has turned away from humanity rather than provide an easy solution, choosing instead to maintain the status quo of a highly dangerous, undead-infected populace within its borders.. [source]

After the cataclysm, the population of the planet has recovered, but the civilization left behind has become strange and barbaric.

Humanity's recovery is driven more by evolution than any conscious effort. The post-cataclysm population grew large and varied rapidly, reaching a population of over 10 billion individuals in only 200 years. Those not killed or banished by the events now have begun adapting to a wider variety of humanoids, environments, or philosophies. The new society is generally divided into two groups: the ""civilized"" and the ""wild,"" though there are also a number who are neither. The civilized are the descendants of those who survived relatively unscathed by the cataclysm and the aftermath, and are the only people still living on the planet. They are the descendants of those who adapted to surviving the cataclysm, and have since adopted the language, traditions, food, arts, sciences and philosophies of their forebears.

The wild are everyone else remaining on the planet, as well as the descendants of those who failed to adapt to survive the cataclysm. Their knowledge of ""civilization,"" having been forgotten or eradicated, is either incomplete or absent completely, and few of them remain literate in any language. Those who make use of a computer, smartphone, or other modern technology still use it at an instinctive level, rather than adapting their reasoning or behavior. Their ""civilized"" children and other relatives are seen with contempt - being, after all, ""uncivilized"" - but not much, and often have little interest in seeing their cousins in the wild survive.

In the wild, few of the survivors live in cities. Instead, they live in small towns that are at least somewhat self-sustaining, such as farming, fishing, hunting, or simply herding animals. They typically dwell in small villages or large tribes. Many wild men are nomadic, following animals or other groups instead of permanent villages or tribes.

It is also a commonplace that the wild can't communicate with the civilized, and they don't try. Those in the wild tend to feel a sense of superiority, and contempt, towards their civilized cousins.

Many of the wild live apart, existing as hermits or in small groups of two or three, with many believing the future belongs to them alone. Others live in gangs, hunting and banding together with others of their kind to kill their game, or work together to survive in an inhospitable place. Among these gangs are the ""re-populous"", who believe they will live on, and adapt to the post-cataclysm world. Many of them look back at the civilization of their ancestors with nostalgia; they admire and respect the accomplishments of those they once saw as their parents, but feel that in the post-cataclysm world they have far greater freedom than their forebears ever had, and could adapt to whatever new landscape they find themselves in. Others look back on that time with disdain, believing themselves to have far greater freedom than to remain in the ""stew,"" as they term it. Still others see the wild and the civilized as one, without the need or possibility of their ever meeting, and believe it to be meaningless that they have never done so.

While humanity's existence has returned to a sort of norm, it's a new normal with a dark, deep and dangerous undercurrent. Although much has healed, the wound inflicted by the cataclysm has never, ever been healed",1

"Prompt: An important press conference, with rows of cameras pointed at you. Dozens of journalists wait with bated breath, until finally you mutter, `` no comment '' into your microphone. The room explodes with excitement. One of them yells, `` this is going to be front page news across the planet! '' Story: 

A couple of questions at the press conference. ``What on earth do you do?'' `` I am an artist. ''

I think you are one of the best journalists to ever work on TV... it shows. But I am still hoping that some day your own art will get the attention it deserves without the help of your journalistic skills! But I guess I have to give up, cause the whole world will be watching you... that is what the journalists have in their mind, anyway.. maybe your art will go the same way, too. But it won't.

Wow, this was great! The author's writing style is great! He was very descriptive and gave the reader a good feel of what was going on in the scene. The story is very interesting and I enjoyed it immensely. One thing: the spelling should be cleaned up, e.g. ""I am a"" instead of ""I'am a"" (I am a) etc. It could look like an illiterate wrote it or one who did not spell check. I wouldn't want to read it that way so it would be worth cleaning it up before sending away for publication.

It is a very well written piece and had me in stitches. At times I couldn't help laughing when reading it but I believe any laughs made from it are completely appropriate. I would definitely read this piece again and recommend others to read it as well.

Excellent piece, very enjoyable and engaging. Well written with an excellent style of descriptive writing, an interesting plot line, and some nice humor incorporated into it. The author makes use of vivid imagery, which will certainly make the viewer's imagination run wild while following the story along, which makes the storytelling and plot a bit more entertaining and intriguing. This also contributes to the fact that it is very easy to read and is a fast enjoyable read.

I enjoyed this novel very much, especially in part because of the novel's setting, which provides some of the plot details. However, this novel does need to be revised and edited for spelling, verb tenses, and paragraph spacing. You have much to learn as a writer and it is much better for you to know how to write first, before you try to write an entirely original piece. Perhaps you can get a friend or someone in your community who can help you with editing and proofreading so that the story and character development are not lost in the noise of such ""mistakes"". Then you can focus on your creativity and originality.

Thank you for a great novel. I can see this is well-written and it sure seems someone really worked on this. I can actually see a story line in my mind, which is rare, as usually I only hear a part of one. I like the idea you used for your story. I think it has a lot of potential and it sure looks like you wrote it pretty good. It sure was interesting and captivating.

This work was a very interesting read (in a good or bad way depending on how you look at it) and very entertaining. However, although it was quite enjoyable, I found it hard to believe at times because there were no concrete details. It was just ""I went there and saw that"". I would suggest you rewrite it because if it is about that specific thing (the thing that happens), you have to describe it in more detail or at least provide more information as to what was happening. I found myself checking to see if the story was actually about that subject. On the whole - this is good, just needs some rewriting. The style is not bad at all, but you need to fix it.

An impressive and intriguing story. I loved it and it left me asking a lot of questions. The story was engaging and the dialogue was really well-written. For a story like the one on offer, there are some grammatical errors such as misused words which make it hard on the reader, especially those not used frequently, e.g. ``dance''. The other grammatical errors (for example, in the second paragraph under ""the first question"") are very hard to see. Although I would not grade this piece, it's a very well-written piece that provides a great introduction to the world of writing.

This was a very interesting and interesting story. The story of the press conference is very funny, the way your character deals with it is also funny, and the way her parents interact with her is very funny. It also explains a lot for the readers wondering how she became ""the news"". The characters in the story are also very well developed and interesting. However, it needs a",1

Summon rain on people sitting in the park, waking people up at 3AM using your sonic booms while flying through the air, stuff like that. You ’ re on holiday when a real villain decides to take your city hostage ... You 're furious. Story:  Click here

When I looked out at the horizon from our balcony over the Mediterranean, the sun was setting. It ’ s a shame, ’ I told María. I hate being stuck in bed. Being on holiday is one thing, but being confined to a hospital room is a real pain in the balls.

“ The sun ’ s setting, ’ she said.

“ What ’ s a shame? ” María is my wife. And my girlfriend. And the mother of my two beautiful kids, who are also her two beautiful kids.

“ Nothing, ” I said. “ I was just saying we ’ re stuck in the hospital room. Just stay inside for a while, I ’ m heading downtown for dinner. I ’ ll bring you a good meal back, so you get your strength back.”

“ I would rather be out and about, ” María said.

“ But the kids. ” I said.

“ I would rather be at home, with them, ” she insisted. “ I ’ m not a strong person.”

“ María, ” I said. “ María. ” She stopped talking. The kids had come into the room, and they “heard” me say it. And my ex. And the mother we don ’ t live with. She ’ s María ’ s mum. “ María. Can you please stop that? ”

The kids ’ eyes filled up with tears. They ran towards their mother and wrapped their arms around her waist, and she held them.

“ I ’ m sorry, ” she said through tears. “ I ’ m not thinking straight.” She got a good, long hug back.

“ It ’ s okay, ” I said, “ It ’ s okay.” María looked like she was finally about to cry, so I stood up and got hold of my old phone. I grabbed the charger for it and plugged the phone in and handed it to María. My daughter was sobbing, so I held my head and just let it all out. It ’ s hard to explain. It ’ s a lot to take in, when you first enter into a situation like this. First of all, not only one of us is going to die this time. Also, I ’ m going to jail. That ’ s what the lawyer says will happen if we ’ re stuck in this situation. He says there ’ s so much evidence on both sides that he ’ s confident a judge will send me to jail. They ’ ll keep the kids while I ’ m going away with him for a while. My ex ’ s family ’ ll be taking them, on their own. I ’ m their dad, of course they ’ re going with me. But she ’ s going to fight me for the kids. She ’ s so good at winning battles, she was a lawyer for a while, so she seems that way.

I ’ m going to the police station next, and they ’ ll want to hear my version of all this, from start to finish, which I ’ m going to give them. And they ’ ll want to see me. They ’ ll want to look at all my phone messages, and the whole thing. And it ’ s going to take days. In my case, it ’ ll take a whole week, a whole week of being stuck in the hospital. Days. So I ’ m not only going to lose my María for a while, I ’ m going to lose my kids for a whole week. To let this play out. It ’ s going to be a while before they can come too.

I ’ m going to spend a week looking like I ’ m about to do a jump out of a plane. Stuck in bed. With a bunch of meds in my blood.

“ It ’ s going to be a while. It ’ s going to be a long time,” I said. “ Are you okay? ” María looked more fragile than I ’ d ever seen her, and I knew it ’ s all going to fall apart. Like the foundation falling through the cracks, everything falling apart piece by piece",1
"Prompt: Scientists discover an algorithm for predicting a person 's date of death with 95 % confidence. When you finally decide to enter your parameters into the algorithm you see a surprising result. Story:  The human life time expectancy has risen at an unprecedented rate. In 1900, the average life expectancy at birth was around 45 years. Today a life expectancy of at least 85 years is reached even for young people in most developed countries and has increased more than 20 years during the last sixty eight years. In developing countries the situation is quite different and averages in those regions lie between 27 and 30 years. In this blog article you will read more about the history of the rise in life expectancy as well as the causes of the aging process and the current situation of our elderly societies.

The first life span pioneers

The development of modern medicine and a proper nutrition over the past 200 years has saved many from early death. For instance, until well into the 20th century heart attack, stroke, infectious diseases, and pneumonia were a much more deadly combination of problems for the majority of people compared to today (for the population at large). As long as humans did not develop a resistance against common diseases it is an illusion to think that people in a developing country were living longer than today. Nevertheless, people would survive for many years because they had a high chance to survive for at least one of the main diseases. In recent times improvements in medicine increased the chances that newborns will survive.

For instance in 1900 infant mortality was a significant problem in every country except the US where it was lower than in many other countries. In that year, the global average life time expectancy for the total population was 50 years. To give you an impression, consider that back in 1900, most of the world's population did not live longer than 50 years. However, in the majority of the Western industrialized nations the mortality rates have been reduced to less than 50 dead per 1,000 births in 2005. Furthermore, newborns often have a relatively good chance of survival despite the presence of certain diseases or conditions. Newborns are protected by their mother and are kept clean by her breast milk.

By the way, today less than 5 children died below the age of 5 around the world. In this same period the total population grew from 1.5 billion to 5.2 billion. However, a growing population of course means a much faster growth in numbers of the elderly, children growing up and dying.

Why did the life span increase so rapidly?

However, at some point, the life span started to slow down. In 1950 only 1 person in 500 lived beyond age 70. To give you an indication of how short people were living up until 1950, remember that by the time a person was 70, he would have to live for 30 additional years. So until 1950, life expectancy could increase at least by a factor of 10 during one generation. It was a significant change and led to a huge shift in societal demographics. The question that naturally arises is, why did the life span increase so rapidly? This is something that has puzzled generations of mathematicians. Until recently these were unsolved problems.

The current situation

Since 1950 life expectancy increased significantly. The annual increase rate per year increased from 0.85 years until about 1970 when the increase turned slower to 0.15 years. However, in spite of the slow increase in population and life span there were not many deaths caused by infectious diseases. People died of various other causes, such as stroke, heart disease, and cancer. The number of people living beyond 80 years increased only slightly between 1950 and 2000. If today's elderly in the US were a society by themselves they would have more than 35% life expectancy in the 65 and older age group, but they would be only about 6% in other countries where they have less than 35 years life expectancy. It is evident that we are aging quite well. The average increase rate for the entire population of the US has been 0.78 years from 1950 to 2005.

Nowadays the increase is slower than it was during the beginning of this century. This shows that we are still able to save the lives of newborns at the same time as increasing survival among older people.

However, a more specific question has been asked many times. Why are people living longer today than they did 100 years ago. This has been the question of the ""Calorie paradox"" from about the 1980s. Is there a point in time where calorie restriction will help us live longer? The answer is not clear and might depend on many factors. However, it is interesting to consider that even a short period of time after birth could cause problems. For instance, if we would have been born around 1900, life expectancy would have been reduced by about five years compared to today (1.65 years for the US). This is not a very large effect, but it is likely related to the fact that many of our ancestors have survived less than a year.

"Prompt: Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate. Story: 

2. The roommate gets on your nerves.

Slowly make it obvious that you can't stand this person and that she should find someone else to live with.

3. Make your dislike for your roommate very clear.

Find things about her you don't like and make those things known.

4. Tell your roommate that she should find another place to live.

Start by telling her that you're going to talk to the college officials and that you've finally had enough.

Continue the story:

5. Make a serious threat to kick the roommate out of your room and out of the college dorm.

Make the threat as loud and clear as you can.

6. Tell her to start cleaning the room.

Don't give her a chance to explain that she couldn't possibly take care of one more task.

7. Tell her that she has two days to vacate her room.

Be firm but nice. Tell her exactly what you told me.

8. Give her notice for what you called in to say about her habits on Saturday night.

Now you're really done. It's like you were telling the story to the police, but only in a better way.

9. Tell her that you are not going to have any more roommates after tonight.

That way, she will have no choice but to accept this new roommate choice.

10. Start cleaning the room again, only this time with a cleaner rag.

Make a big show of cleaning up every nook and cranny. Then you should be more than safe in the knowledge that the roommate will have to give everything away by the time you get back.

11. Clean the bathroom once you're back in the room.

This is a real pain and you will definitely get a lot of dirty looks from your roommate.

12. Tell your roommate that you are moving back into your old room.

This is the best option for your situation, but your roommate will almost certainly do anything she can to stop you from leaving.

Continue the story:

13. After you move back into your old room, tell her that she should move out and find another place to live.

This is a nice way of getting her out of the room and your hair, which is always a plus.

16. Start calling college officials.

Make the call with your friend present. Tell them how awful the situation has become.

Then, watch as your roommate is interviewed, and the roommate's side is given a lot more weight than your side.

18. Tell your roommate that you know she has been doing drugs because of the smell.

This will either convince her to start cleaning up or to leave the room for good.

19. Have your roommate get arrested.

Let the authorities do the dirty work. If your roommate is still in the room and has yet to leave, then you know she can't get out for the time being.

20. Turn on some music and start cleaning up the room, getting down to the last few remaining things.

Let out your deep anger and frustration by screaming about how awful this person is.

This is really done for your best interests. You will no longer have to deal with this person and you don't want to be stuck in the room with them.

21. Go sleep in your old room.

You want to know if the roommate is coming back or going when you hear the news about one of her friends.

This is a story about a girl named Sarah who had problems with a roommate she lived with back before graduating from high school. Sarah decided to write a short story about her experience, and it's an amazing story that you need to know to make your roommates not hate your guts.",1
"Prompt: It had been 12 years since your high school girlfriend suddenly died. Today, on vacation, you bump into her. Story:  Your girlfriend and you have been apart for many years, but she appears before you on vacation on the coast of North Carolina, a place you’ve gone to before. There she is, not changed much at all, except that she is now…

This is a game of many styles and genres, and it offers its players a huge array of weapons, characters, and skills. As with most RPG games, this game is not without its quirks. This game has been compared to an RPG, but most reviews I’ve read are of the style: it’s more in the spirit of a classic JRPG like Chrono Trigger, with combat similar to the Dragon Quest series. If you’re looking for more of a modern take on an RPG, give Brave Frontier a look. There’s a very interesting trailer for it you can watch here.

Story

The game’s story begins with a girl dying in mysterious circumstances. It’s suggested that a demon came and killed her at night while she slept. She fell back, choking on some sort of blood, and was taken to the city of Kalevala by a group of sailors. The girl woke up a whole day later, on board the ship, and the crew claimed that she woke up just fine, save for a slight coughing and choking sensation.

However, the girl has never been outside of Kalevala, her hometown, so the crew knew it must have been something else.

The girl never returned home. The crew brought the ship around but could not find the exact location nor the city, or anything else; everything was just sea. To make matters worse, the crew’s captain died of fever a month later. The crew was sure it was due to stress, but no one could prove it. The girl and captain died in the same year, and the only crew member left with any sort of history about the girl was the first mate.

The first mate tells the player of the girl’s journey and death in excruciating detail. On her death, she was possessed by something, a demon, and the captain died of fever a month later. The crew assumed that the captain must have been the one in charge of her death, and it seems plausible.

However, the first mate doesn’t know exactly what happened, but does claim that the girl had been seen in the seas with a red scarf hanging around her neck. That’s why the crew could not find her.

Then the first mate had an hallucination. A girl said that she was the one who possessed the girl, and told the first mate to take the name of the girl, Kalevala, from her hometown and give it to his crew; she also pointed out that a demon was taking her own life just as the captain was getting sick.

The girl told them to get her to the land of the sun (from here on, you’ll be talking with the second mate) and she’d be fine and the demon could rest in peace.

So the crew set sail for the land of the sun, but after six months, their ship just vanished.

They were lucky enough to find a place on a land-based ship to call home, called the Oikumeneis.

The first mate then became their captain. It seemed as if his fate rested in their journey.

The crew’s plan was to go to the ocean to search for the land of the sun, but on the ninth day their ship vanished. The captain never reached the shore. He died on the night of the ninth day, still looking for his beloved city, Kalevala. If she’s alive, she had died as well.

The second mate believes he had a spiritual connection with the girl, and is on the journey to the land of the sun to atone for his sins. He believes that the captain had something to do with his death.

The second mate seems to have it under control and is going about the business of being in control. The first mate did not keep a close eye on this second mate as he’s more experienced on the seas, and there’s been a lot of strange happening since he’s been away, not only on the first mate himself and the crew, but also the second mate has his own crew of nine.

If there is no second mate, the second mate’s role is taken over by another crew member named Fionas, and he does not seem like a friend of the first mate.

It should be added that there are no other ships in the area, suggesting that, if the two ships that were seen were the Oikumeneis and some",1
"Prompt: Dora does not know the truth. Boots, Swiper, and the Map do, and they must never let Dora know. Today, it just got much harder. Story: 

Chapter Eighteen: The Spy's Secret

Dora opened her eyes to the new morning. She wondered if she would ever sleep again.

""Swiper!"" Dora yelled. But she wasn't yelling Swiper's name. ""Swiper! Please wake up. Something's wrong,"" she continued. I've got to save you this time. If it's the last thing I do.

Dora walked over to the window. She had to open the top button on her pajamas top. The buttons were so hard to open the last time, but it had to be done. The sun was out but it was cloudy.

""Swiper!"" she screamed.

Dora was at the door. She pushed it open then walked into the living room. She walked from the living room to the kitchen. Dora looked out the window again. She saw Boots holding a letter in his paws. He didn't want Dora to read it but he read it. There was no mistake. This was the letter from the Map. Swiper ran towards the door.

""Swiper!"" Dora screamed.

""Dora, please go back to bed,"" Boots said. ""I read the letter.""

""No. Please. I don't want to lie down. I gotta save Swiper!"" Dora went running to the door.

""Dora, no,"" Boots said trying to block her exit from the door. Then he pushed aside his mother. Dora pushed him away and headed outside.

Dora ran all the way to the door. She opened the door then looked down the porch. Swiper was gone. Dora walked outside. She looked left and right. Nothing. Then she heard something rustling in the shrubs.

""Swiper!"" Dora yelled. ""What are you doing?""

Dora looked at the bushes. They were alive with tiny hands pulling Swiper backwards. Dora couldn't do anything. She yelled again. ""SWIPE!""

Dora went rushing back to the house.

""Dora,"" Boots said after stepping in front of her, ""You can't read the letter.""

Dora looked out the window again. The bushes were full of tiny hands. They were pulling Swiper back towards them. There was no chance Dora could jump or climb on. Dora ran back up to the third floor. She went into her room closing the door behind her. She slammed the door then sat on the bed. Swiper was out of sight but his footsteps had alerted Boots.

""Dora, I can't stand this. I'm so sorry,"" Boots said.

""Sorry? What do you mean,'sorry,'"" Dora said. ""If you want to help me save him, then tell me what's happening,"" she continued.

She was talking to Boots but she was just thinking about the Map and his threat. Dora hoped, maybe, she can talk to him. Talk is not Dora's strong point but maybe if she got him to talk, it would help her understand. The Map would talk then he wouldn't. Dora hoped it wouldn't hurt too much. It was too dangerous to wait much longer. She was hoping the Map would do it. The Map just might.
She began to shake and get a little nervous. She wasn't a fan of heights because of the last time. Her head was in her hands. She sniffed. She was crying. She had to be patient.

""It's too dangerous. Let him do his plan.""

The Map came knocking on her door. He took his hat off. Boots was glad he kept it on.

Dora didn't know what to say.

""Are you angry with me?"" the Map asked. He put his hat on his head. Then he put his right hand on his hat. ""You may not like what I say but it's the only thing that might help you save Swiper. He needs to stay calm. He should get back to you.""

Dora wiped her eyes and said, ""Let's do it, then."" She grabbed his hand then the hat.

""He's scared,"" Dora said.

The Map put his hat back on his head. He took his left hand and tried to hold onto the door knob. He looked down at him and said, ""You have a lot to protect, don't you?""

Swiper was now outside in a huge tree waiting. He knew something was wrong. He could hear the bushes rustling. He was shaking. The tiny hands were pulling him from above.

""Oh no you don't",1

In his later writings, he made little or no attempt, either by word, thought or action, to oppose this government or to oppose the war in Vietnam, which he had supported by making a good deal of money. He left his business enterprises to his brother, David, and moved to Santa Barbara, California.

He then became president of the University of California. One of the first things he did was to introduce ``academic freedom,'' which was defined as the protection of the faculty from unreasonable governmental interference.

He was an advocate of the civil rights revolution.

Later Life

For his service as a member of the United States Military Academy Class of, he was assigned to its administrative office in Washington, D. The U. S. Patent Office, and the U. S. Patent Office and the United States of America.

In the early eighties, the military was looking for a new family of anti-armor weapons, and the tank companies began seeking input.

It was the most significant achievement of his administration. Also a prolific lecturer and author, he was also a contributor to The Atlantic Monthly, The Sciences and many other periodicals, and he lectured and published a number of volumes.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. For a discussion of some aspects of the work and its consequences see: The work of Alfred Kroeber was wide-ranging, both in its technical and general dimensions.

This entry is a complete inventory of Alfred Kroeber's publications. This list is for publications that Alfred Kroeber published during his lifetime. The list is in chronological order. A brief bio of Alfred Kroeber. In Alfred Kroeber's words: The scientific community is full of people who know what science is.

They know how to do it, they know how to do it well, they know how to do it in a proper scientific fashion, but they do not know the subject matter. When it comes to the science of the human mind you could search in vain for a teacher like Kroeber.

One of the reasons there are so few scientists who are truly great is that they do not produce any original work that will endure for future historians.

Kroeber spent his lifetime working on human culture, the mind, on a people who made up the first culture that created language, and on a people who made up the most complex society who ever lived — the Maya.

After a life spent in the field of anthropology and on the Yamparika Indian peoples, Kroeber had this to say about them: The word science has a double significance.

As an Americanist it means the knowledge of the mind. When I speak of the mind I am thinking of the mental processes in man, the mind as developed in man, as it is developed in each man. In this respect the word science includes not only those disciplines which are associated with the scientific study of the physical world, but also those disciplines which study the mental process.

It refers to the body of knowledge, to the accumulated knowledge pertaining to the human mind as developed in man. There are many disciplines within the umbrella of which I use this word. I am referring to the various specializations within anthropology such as cultural anthropology, linguistics, archeology, the study of the human mind — what I have come to call cognitive psychology.

When one speaks of the mind, one means the mind, the brain, and the body — the sum of physical, mental, and biological activity. Since our interest here is primarily in the cognitive processes of man and man s behavior, the word science — referring to our knowledge of the mind and the mind s ways — I use in a technical sense.

For my own part I have been most interested in those phenomena that relate to this particular area of knowledge. I have been especially interested in the cultural and biological aspects of the mind, the biological aspects being those that have to do with the brain — its organization — and with the processes of human development.

With our growing knowledge of the structure of the brain and the importance of the chemical and physical processes of the brain, we have come to realize the need for a neurobiology that would explain the way in which the brain is organized and how it functions.

For some time now, especially since the discovery of neuro-transmitter substances, our knowledge of the nervous system and our concept of mind s function has expanded at the same time that our knowledge of the human mind and human behavior on the basis of brain function has grown. Although we may not have, as yet, a complete theory of the workings of the mind, the biological",1

"Prompt: Write a deep, philosophical piece about anything you choose, however all it builds up to is a reference. Story: 



This isn't a very big post. After all, I just reblogged a story I wrote several years before that already had its own, longer post. But I thought (at the time) about the nature of truth, and how you can sometimes talk yourself out of truth by being too attached to that idea. I figured the reblog should be as complete as the original, plus one more reblog. The truth in lies.



***



The truth in lies...



Let’s face it, the truth sometimes can be a little painful. The truth is always bad enough in the abstract, but when you have a specific individual in mind, well, there is almost no limit to what they can do you in. Of course, there is always the exception, like the story I just recounted. If you are lucky, you can take something the person did wrong and use it to twist it into the truth. But if the wrong did not actually result from someone telling the truth, then there is only one option. You must lie.



It’s not easy. If you were to lie in a situation like mine, you would almost certainly be caught. They would know. There is no reason for you to lie. The person would not have told you a lie, but by lying to him you tell him he is lying to you. And if there is any question about it, the question will be asked of you. The person will have to decide if you are being truthful or not, and if he does take a guess it will almost certainly be the wrong one.



It is easier to tell a truth. Of course, if you were on a first date and you were asked on one knee what type of person you are looking for, there is a good chance you will just come right out and tell them you are looking for the person that doesn’t want to get married. This saves a little time because it has to be the truth and if you had a choice, you would tell them a lie.



In real life, you can’t always come right out and say you just don’t want to get married. It will not necessarily be a complete lie, but it will be a partial one. You have to make it as true as you could possibly make it, and then try to make the person believe it. This is much harder than a simple no to a question.



A true lie is a lie because you really believe what you are saying to be true. Whether it is, is up to the person you are telling it to, just as one can believe a falsehood to be true because he wants to so badly, even though it is not. A true lie is also true because it makes you really think what you believe are true things are true. If your opinion is that marriage is a contract rather than a commitment, then saying you don’t want to get married means nothing more than you are not intending to commit. Not true if you believe marriage is a contract and then tell someone you don’t want to get married. There is a fundamental difference in your words between then and then. When you say you want to not get married, the message you are sending is clear and definitive. “I don't want to get married.” But then you say a false thing and say you don’t want to get married anymore. “I don't want to get married anymore.” That statement is much harder to understand, much harder to believe.



If you are a liar, if you want someone to think what you want someone to think, it will be impossible for them to grasp what you are saying in a way that makes complete sense and does not force them to take an idea you do not wish them to believe is a truth. You must make your audience as confused as possible, and make sure they are sure of what you are saying. You must convince even yourself that what you say is true, or at least believable. This is a skill that takes time to learn. It is hard and tedious and it takes forever.



If you are a liar, you must not lie about that, and your audience must not believe you if you tell them a truth. Because then it is true and you are lying to them. You must be truthful about it, as well.



The truth is not good if you are not truthful about it. But the truth is even harder to come by than the truth. To come by what the truth is, you have to come by it in the first place. To come by a truth, though, you have to be able to recognize the truth.

"Prompt: A dystopian future where a pack of Big ( Bad ) Wolves terrorize the human population, and the only saviors are a group of female warriors donning red cloaks/hoods. Story: 

You Can Play The Next Level - This Is Your Second Chance.

In the game of life, there is a Second Chance Area. Most go by it without reading.

You Can Make Another Start On The Game, but most will not read the details.

A Good First Choice Can Often Improve Your Game.

It is not an easy thing to find where the Second Chance Areas exist, unless you are in the minority. It is my privilege to reveal to you:

Where they can be found, so that you don't miss out on yours.

First, the Second Chance Areas don't have to be in ""a safe zone"" to qualify for the opportunity to gain advantage. This is quite contrary to what I usually see in the media and on the internet.

As a ""typical"" player of the game, one would expect one's initial choices to make one's further choices worse. And most of my observations match that prediction.

But, that is not always the case.

What really interests me is, what if you make your initial choices, but do all your future second chances, or second chance moves on the second chance board, because you have the opportunity to do so?

I hope this helps you understand how the game is played, and how it is played out in real time by you.

It is not a game for those who don't want to play in real time. But, you make your choices, so you take the ""real risk"". This is a different kind of game than playing it on a chessboard...with time between moves.

What I discovered, is that to some, my suggestions about Second Chance Areas, made several choices that turned into positive experiences. But, those choices were not planned or intended when I first put the strategy I offer in motion. So, my thanks are to them for taking action on it.

In the Second Chance Areas, there is an opportunity for you to start a new course of life's moves. Sometimes, starting a new course will enable you to achieve something different.

There is no ""wrong"" choice, so, it is the player's own free will to choose where to go and how to play the game. To me, if you are ready to play, ""You Can Play - The Next Level"".

Some people don't understand their real self, and they take ""what is easy"" for granted. They don't know, at the beginning of a relationship, that they have to invest emotional and/or financial resources, on their partner. Even though they have to do it, because they are the one getting hurt, when they walk away.

They expect too much, they want too much. They think that they can have any relationship, with any partner. They think they can have a relationship with anyone, if they invest. They haven't noticed that when you give a gift, in some relationships, you get a gift in return, but in other relationships, you don't.

The ones who think they can have any relationship, and it is just a ""normal"", ordinary relationship, that they have their heads in the clouds, or not paying attention.

That is not to say that there is anything wrong with the relationships of successful relationships that are common around the world. That is a very different discussion...one that I could have a whole website about, if I wanted to.

If you are like the majority, and if you have been reading my blogs for a while, you already have some experience. So, no need to do some extra time getting to know your real self. You know what it is. You are doing OK, just fine if that is your game.

I am referring to those who want the ""best"", but don't know how to put it together, so they are waiting for the opportunity to start their new story.

There are people out there that do this every day. They can be described as...The Ones with their head in the Clouds, Looking up.

It is an opportunity for you to take the step to get your head out of your clouds, so you can start taking better choices.

I want to share with you, a method I learned...a method that has always worked for me.

No one has had to put a lot of effort into me. I have been taken care of, given what I need, and I have always had the opportunity to start a new story.

I hope you can take a moment to think about the people you care about and remember...how would they respond if you were to take the next steps you need to take with you?

If you are in that position, I would like to",1
"Prompt: You are a lost musician in a neon lit city. Describe your experiences and people you come across. Story: 

The first thing that I remember after entering the City of Light is that my voice started to speak. It sounded like the same voice I used to read to my sister and my mother as a young child, before they understood that I was pretending to be someone more powerful than myself. I was suddenly so desperate to impress them again that I went up to everyone I found in this enormous place, to try and get their attention. I tried to act like a beggar and I tried to sing and act in a way that would persuade these strange strangers to give me coins. I went up to a group of teenagers and began making strange noises. I was crying at this point. I was feeling so empty and useless. I had no idea what to do with my life. What I imagined life looked like. I wanted to go and find something to tell me that I am doing a good thing, because I could not find anything that said it was. I found some coins, and I was relieved. I looked around me in that huge street to see people all doing the same. I was happy. But then I was happy again when the boy I loved suddenly came by, and it felt like a gift that I found him again. The next day, as I went to him, he suddenly disappeared. As I looked around for him, I had a bad feeling that I might never see him again. I went back to the corner, and people around came asking me the price of the books I was holding. I lost myself to their demands. I suddenly felt alone in this huge world. I felt like I would never find what I really desired.

We were on our journey, and I was getting really tired of that, and I wanted to stop for a moment. My sister’s voice suddenly spoke to me. My sister’s voice used to comfort me when I was alone, afraid, scared. But it hurt me when I was tired and didn’t dare to speak to her or to tell her why I was scared. But now, to my surprise, her voice came to me again. She said, “Now you have to stop. Soon you will be on the other side of the river and I cannot help you.” So I looked at her, and I realised she was no longer there. Her voice was my only family member on this journey through the world.

I was confused and scared, afraid of the world. I had just realised that the only words I would ever speak were the ones with which I had comforted my sister when we were children, but that no longer worked for me. The voice that comforted me, was no longer there. She died.

I continued my journey. Then I saw a group of street musicians playing a song. The girl sitting beside me started to sing, and her voice sounded close like my sister. It was a song that I remembered hearing her sing. My eyes were opened. The music was so different from the music of the world I heard around me. I started to feel like I was standing at a place where I was no longer a small mouse but a giant eagle. My voice was big. My throat and face were covered with hair. My feet and hands were covered with golden claws that could spread and walk like the legs of an insect. My chest was covered with golden armor. I was a monster. On the corner, I found a place where I could hear the music that I had been looking for. I started to dance and sing in front of a crowd of people who knew how to treat me better than I had expected. I was proud of those people and I decided to sing a song that I saw them sing. They were singing a song that I have not heard at all. I began to speak like I saw them and I had never seen people behave like that in my home town. If my song was bad in my home town, no one could hear me. If my song was good, even if it was only a small one, I could sing my song in front of people and people would listen.

In those moments, the people who spoke to me with so much love and generosity, invited me to become a part of their group and asked me to sing songs for them. I said a lot of things to this group. These strangers seemed to be the ones who I used to ask when I was young. I wanted to become a part of the group. I spoke to the crowd and I made that crowd sing like my sister and mother used to sing to me. I had to try and make those strangers sound like my family was. I had to try and act like my real family was singing to me and I could not make my family to sing again.

The city was like this for days and days, I was the center of everything, at times I felt like I",1

Staring Down an Endless Staircase

by

Alexandra Tynan (Tynan, Alexandra)

As he fell, the sound of wind rushed in through the gaping hole in the side of the mountain with a force that made me feel like my head was being ripped in two. It felt cool, and at the same time the wind coming in through the hole was getting warm and dry, like the air was being dragged in directly from the middle of Africa, where the sun never sets. The hole was deep too, like the hole in the side of Galt, just not so wide, and I could feel the force of the wind coming in behind me. It pressed on my back and chest with relentless speed, and before I knew it, I was moving through it at incredible speeds, and all the while I felt like if something went wrong I'd be in an instant pulled out from the darkness of the air to take the end of the winding stairways to the bottom of the mountain.



That's right, I'd gone down a winding stairway. At first, the thought of going down one made me afraid, but as I climbed up, I stopped being afraid and took in the landscape. The stairs were deep, deep, into the earth. There were lights of all colors along the stairway, some flickering and some steady, and up above them hung bunches of glowing mushrooms, or spheres, or clouds, but they only looked like they were floating, never touching the sides of the stairway, which meant they actually were. In the middle of the stairway, which was about fifty floors down, stood a tall tower of glass that stood above the other towers, all of which were the same shape, only they had different colors, and I knew without being told I was on the Tower of Knowledge, which I hoped meant it wasn't impossible to survive down here.



The Tower of Knowledge was the only reason I knew I hadn't gone down. Down there was a river, and as I watched it for any kind of sign of direction, it took on a more distinct and recognizable look to my eye. It wasn't as dark as it was deep, and it wasn't as wide as it was tall. From down there, I could see the lights in the Tower of Knowledge for miles, and I knew if that wasn't a guide, it should be the only one.



But for me, the Tower of Knowledge was just a sign that I hadn't gone too far or had taken too many wrong turns. I didn't know what would happen down there, but I knew what would happen if I went down more than fifty flights.



The Tower of Knowledge seemed to change its color as I got to it, and while I couldn't see any more than this, I could tell it changed its color from white to gray to red, and then when I got to the end of the stairway, the Tower of Knowledge shone with a bright red light, and I felt the wind come in from everywhere at once like a hurricane. It was strong, strong, and all I knew was that if the stairway had stopped going down, if it had somehow led me to the center of the earth, I would have been in a real predicament. That, as I reached the end of the Tower of Knowledge, was when I realized that going down one more step might be more than my brain could handle.



I knew it, I knew it right away, and the wind rushing in around my body as I sat in the grass at the bottom of the tower wasn't enough to distract me from reality. The wind blew every bit of feeling out of my legs and feet and arms, and I knew that if I tried to stand up, I'd be swept off this floor and away from there with hardly a thought left in my head as to why it was happening.



I let go of the rock I'd been holding onto, and as I watched it spiral away a little faster than I wanted to believe, I knew what I actually ought to do.

My eyes snapped open to the sound of two men arguing, but instead of hearing the voice of my father, I heard the voice of the stranger I'd met before.



I rolled onto my back, staring up into the sky while the sky's blue faded from my sight, and when the world stopped spinning, as it was wont to do between sleeping and waking, I realized that the stranger before me was saying those same words I'd been hearing the last time I'd laid in an unconscious state",1

Chapter 18 - It Ain't Just the Money...

The sun slowly disappeared behind the horizon as the air began to cool. In the distance I could see the fire lights from people cooking, laughing and drinking.

“You know I should ask you for help, but I don’t need any help.”

“I’m asking, because you helped me last time.”

“I only helped because it’s my job, and if I didn’t help him it might make me look bad.”

“And what are you afraid of exactly?”

“That you’ll think I’m weird,” she replied, smiling.

“I can see why you wouldn’t want me to think that, but if you did then I can honestly say that I’d be happy for you. You are a beautiful woman. You are smart and kind, smart and funny; even if you do sound crazy for a change.”

She continued to smile and looked up at the moon. “I didn’t really understand it before, but now I do. I have to remember that life is about the journey, not the destination.” She sighed. “This is my destiny, this is the life I want to live. I have a purpose. I know I’m not a hero, but I am more than an average person. I’m going to enjoy my life while I can because it might be the last time before I die.”

“Do you know why I was on the run? Because I didn’t realize I was just a cog in a machine. I didn’t understand that this job and everything else wasn’t about me. I was like an ordinary man making a living. I was in love. I had a house in the mountains. Things weren’t so bad. I should have stayed.

I didn’t know that I was playing for the wrong team. That I was in the wrong game.

I’m sorry I couldn’t save you.”

She was silent for a while before she looked at me. “You don’t have to be sorry about anything, just being. I’m not. I’ve never had any regrets. I’ve always been too busy trying to prove myself. My mistakes made it harder for those I cared about to see me for who I was.” She looked down and the smile slowly left her face. “I should have listened to you. I guess I just wanted to die instead. I wanted to be with her, but I couldn’t because I was here. I wanted to get home; that was my plan. To go home and stay there forever. I wanted to keep my life the way it was. I was angry too, angry that I hadn’t died, angry I didn’t die, for being a coward about living.""

I wanted to protect her, when I could no longer protect myself. That was the reason why I had lied to her and said to stay, but I had to protect myself first. ""She was better together than apart, she was my whole life.“ I sighed.

“But in the end I could not do it. I didn’t tell you the truth. I did not tell you how much I was trying to forget, and I didn’t tell you that I missed her too. I left. I left you, leaving her behind. There is something else you don’t know. I did not die because I did not want to live.""

""That’s right I know you, I met you before. That wasn’t me either. That was someone else. I did not die, I only lost my life, the past and present. I found it and it found me.

I have to move on.""

"Prompt: Three people are standing in a room. Only one of them has a shadow. Story:  You could, of course, place the shadow to one side of the face in the light and the person standing in the shadow could be a dark-skinned man. Or it could be a very tall woman, standing in the light.

The face is a perfect oval, with large eyes, small nose and a closed mouth. The woman looks a lot like an Egyptian queen wearing a wig.

The story is a riddle. And the solution is that the dark-skinned man, the queen-like woman and the shadow they were seen in have all been placed in a room together. They have all been standing in that order, the order in which you saw them.

If we move them around, in front of a mirror, or into a darkroom, the three people will still look the same. But the three people are no longer the same. They are now shadows. And the shadow is them.

""The Shadow is Within,"" The Shadow Inside

A few years ago an expert on human perception came to visit my company and we spent a day together talking about The Shadow. She told me that in the course of learning to identify The Shadow, she had met very few people who would not go into a dark room and find it.

The Shadow could be anywhere, even inside.

There is an old story about three men who found Jesus walking along a road, with a shadow walking next to him. The men asked Jesus what was wrong. He said, ""Jesus walks with me, and I will make his light shine on the earth, and make his darkness visible.""

Jesus was saying that The Shadow is within. We cannot see it, but we all have it. It is the internalized part of our identity with which we try to see ourselves. It is part of our consciousness, and it is the part that shapes our reality. But we are never the same. No two Shadows are the same. Every aspect of us, from who we think we are, about what we feel we can be, and especially about what other people think of us, is the product of the same thing. The Shadow.

Shadow

What did you do today? What else happened today? How did you feel in that moment? You may not even know. But someone else did know. For you there was not much of a Shadow. There was not much there. If your Shadow was the same throughout your life, most certainly it would not show in anything you did. It would not be noticeable, especially in your daily life.

Every moment you live you are creating a Shadow. It is your conscious reaction to everything you do and see around you.

As you walk down the street, you think about how much you do not like your job. You tell yourself you are going to quit. You think about how hard you had to work, to achieve what you have achieved. You wonder what it will be like to retire.

Wherever you go, whatever you see, whatever you do, be it a walk, a day on the boat, or a conversation with your children, you have a Shadow. You walk in the sun with your Shadow and it casts a dim light on your face. But you are a human and your Shadow doesn't exist everywhere at the same time. For the rest of your day your Shadow will stay on the surface of things, and you can barely notice.

On the next to the last day you live, you will create a Shadow around your actions. That Shadow is yours. It is your story, your life. It will be the same as it was, the day before. You will carry on doing what you always do. But, in this moment, as you create and shape your own Shadow, you become aware of The Shadow.

Each day you live is a new creation of awareness. Each day is the creation of a Shadow.

One of my students asked me once, ""Do we create our Shadow while we are alive in a way that can be altered or changed?""

I answered, ""Yes. We are the creators of The Shadow.""

""What are the chances of us knowing ourselves?""

When we have the knowledge of ourselves we can create a new reality, for ourselves and those around us. We know our shadows. But we do not want to live in them. The problem is what we create for ourselves, the way it is in our present. But we can choose to be in the new and the different. When we know our Shadow, we know what we are.

Chapter 5 (S) The last battle The end

""I am your guardian angel."" An angel said to a friend. The angel watched her for a short time.

The angel said. ""I hate you. You're a demon, I wish you are already dead.""

""I am not a demon, but I know your life isn't that good. I would suggest some changes. First I will show you some dreams. Then I will show you your future.""

The angel showed his love to his friend for the first time. The angel and his friend were lying in the grass. Then the angel explained the dreams of the friend to her.

The angel said. ""Most likely she will die after you are born. The reason you are here in your dream is to be with her in her last moment.""

The friend thought. ""What a beautiful dream you've shown me. Is someone in her dream also?"" asked the demon.

The angel said. ""Yes, another guardian angel who is my enemy, and he hates her."" The demon couldn't believe who he was talking about. ""How is it possible for him to be with her?"" asked the demon friend.

""He watches her all the time, but she is unaware of him. He likes the girl's name but her father doesn't want them to be together. The demon and her father have fought with each other a long time. Now she loves him, but the demon hates him and the father's wish. The demon hates the father so much that he has agreed to help you kill her. He knows you can't feel love for her because you were born with an iron heart. Don't let him destroy your heart. He can take your life. Then I wouldn't be able to stop him.""

The demon said. ""Why would you want my life, if you despise me?""

The angel said. ""Why would a demon try to kill someone? It doesn't make sense but my enemy's hate you, you are a good person. It's a long story. There will be a reason for everything I tell you.""

The friend replied. ""How do you know I am your enemy?""

The angel said. ""I've known you for a long time. I've watched your heart. The last guardian angel is your enemy too. It's because you and your father have the same name. He wants to see you die because you will become the ruler after him. Your father's rule would bring him more enemies, more demons, and more wars. Then he will lose more people. He is a good man even though you don't believe. I watch your dreams but your parents don't trust me to show them only the best. They trust you. But I can easily see your heart is different from them. I know you can feel the love they have for each other."" explained the angel.

""I have to go now, your parents know I'm nearby. If you tell them where you are, I won't help you. I'm leaving, it will be better for you."" said the angel.

The friend asked. ""How can I trust you?""

The demon and the angel smiled at the same time, and the angel had the last word.

The friend said. ""I love your help when I was in the middle of all these problems. How can I repay you?""

""I'll leave soon when you are with your girl with full of happiness. I'll tell my enemy you are now the King of the World. I'll try to take your body to protect the innocent people from harm. However, I can't take your life, but I can take your time, when you are asleep. But then you can still feel your life slowly dying, it will make me sad. I can't take your life, but I will destroy your life without taking your life. It will be fun."" explained the angel and winked.

The demon was shocked.

The angel thought. ""They will be happy to know you are the King of the World when you get back home. They will be happy to see you again. Don't forget me."" he whispered.

The angel left before the demon could shout or say anything back. The friend understood everything. She would not fight with death itself in this world. After the angel left she was sure she could get her heart back when she returned home. Even if she had to die. The friend felt sad because she",1
"Prompt: The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Story: 

**P ERSUBS: ANTIQUITY—HIGH TIDE**

As our hero lies dead at the hands of a wicked king, the water rises and the shoreline recedes. The waves wash up and push against the crumbling castle walls. The firstborn son of the fallen king escapes to the mainland....

**B IG BANG—LITTLE BOOM**

The citizens rejoice that their hero is dead. The princess—the princess of the lost island kingdom!—is safe and no longer a virgin. The evil king is gone—with no intention of coming back, it seems—and his kingdom becomes the new target of the waves' power.

**U NDERWATER!**

The king's second son—a prince destined to become heir to the throne—has been missing since the first son escaped. It seems he may be dead.

**N OT AVAILABLE!**

But what about the hero's loyal friends? In fact, what happened to any heroes from days of old?

## **HOW TO LIVE A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE**

The king of a kingdom rules over those living on land and those living under water. Over the years, he has collected an array of powerful magic artifacts. He holds one of the artifacts, a giant pearl, in the palm of his hand. It is said the pearl contains the secret of the hero's sacrifice. At the moment, the pearl is floating about just a couple of inches below the surface of the sea, attached to a giant wooden board by a chain. One strand at a time is visible when the waves push the board up and down along the bottom of the ocean. The king is desperate that the pearl not be dropped while he sits on his throne, safe above the waves, or even while he is in a boat. He orders that it never be taken out of his sight. There's a problem, though; at times he forgets about it.

As a result of his forgetfulness, the next heroic adventurer discovers the pearl and goes on to be the hero that saves the people of the land. Some find it and are soon heroes when they take it to the king. He uses the pearl as a substitute for his hero—the pearl is in his palm, so his hero is in his palm, and it's just like him to be so forgetful! Many find the pearl in the sea and get away with it, even though no one should be so lucky.

Some years follow and the hero who goes on to be the hero—the one who helps others and does good things for the sake of others—is killed in a conflict in a faraway land. The princess stays safe, the kingdom thrives once more, and the king's next son becomes the young leader in charge. He wants the same pearl that he has—so the story goes. The story does not end there, because someone has the pearl, or else they could have found it and got it back.

What are the points to remember?

**1.** Everyone is born with a talent. No one is born a hero, though the ability lies in each of us. To help people is a talent. It is an important talent to have. Some people think that the only way to help people is to become a hero for them. Don't get me wrong, I don't oppose helping those who need it, and I really need help all the time. But I want people to know that other talents come naturally to all people. Maybe we need to learn to apply them, so they can shine in the same way that heroes do.

**2.** If we are honest with ourselves, we know we are not perfect. We all fail at times, and when we do, we may take it out on others. We may not show it but we all can be selfish to a certain degree. At times, though, we have good character, and we know better. The goal is to try harder to live a good life—to live with good intention and to change when we fall short. The pearl is attached to the board by a chain, and a person must live by the word ""no."" We don't want to be a hero for someone, just because we think it's who we are.

**3.** This book is not about becoming heroes. I don't care if we are born a hero, a villain, or anything in between. I only care that we do a good job with the gifts that we have. We each have our own talents. Let us share them with those who need them. Let's put all our talents to good use every day, no matter how small they may seem.",1

Write a news article that tells about the following items. (Choose only one for this week.) (1) Who died? (2) Where were they when they were killed? (3) When the accident happened? (4) Who else was injured? (5) Were they rushed to the hospital after the accident? If so, tell which hospital. What did the man who was killed do at the hospital? How was he killed? Explain. (6) Who was injured? (7) Where were they when injuries were sustained? (8) Did the other workers die or were they rushed to the hospital after the accident? Why? (9) Were there people injured who were not hospitalized, but in the accident scene? How many were injured at the scene? Tell how they were injured. (10) What was the name of the bridge that collapsed and the time of the accident. (11) Were any lives saved in the accident? Why or why not? (12) Tell what you consider the major fault in the construction of the bridge and the construction process itself. (13) What are the other major construction faults you think the bridge could be improved on? Explain. (14) How did people get to the area in the accident area? (15) What could the contractor do to prevent the failure of the bridge? Include any changes that could be made to the bridge construction process to prevent a tragic accident like this.

Explain why it is a good idea to warn people about a possible accident. (18) How did the contractor perform in your opinion?

The major fault in the design of this bridge appears to be that it was not built on properly prepared piers.

The construction process for building bridges is a dangerous one, and it is imperative that the contractor take more responsibility for preventing accidents from occurring. The safety of the workers is the first responsibility of the contractor.

The accident that caused the death of these two men can be prevented if:

(a) they are well prepared to cope with the cold,

(b) they are made aware of the dangers of working in the cold weather,

(c) some of the workers wear clothing such as caps and mitts with heavy insulation in them,

(d) the men, being adequately prepared, also wear proper shoes.

Criminal fault in this case is the workmen's negligence of driving in cold weather and not having mittens on.

This bridge could have been built on a safer location, the contractor not being the least bit concerned with worker safety.

It is not so unusual for piers to wash out, but they should be properly lined before the work is begun and workers made aware of the dangers of freezing and working in the cold.

The contractor ought to have taken all possible precautions on this construction site.

The contractor should have provided for proper protection against blizzard and sub-zero weather.

The contractors were negligent to start on work before winter weather was assured and they had the means of doing so.

All bridges should be built according to a safety plan that is designed first for a good worker environment and then tested over and over again to make doubly sure that they are safe. If any bridge is used, it should carry a load of several ton weight and if tested can handle that load even in the bad weather of the year a bridge is built. Bridges should be tested in all weathers before they are completed to make sure they can safely be used.

The piers on this bridge were placed by unskilled laborers. It is amazing that the man died who drove his pickup truck. The bridge piers were poorly installed and if they were properly installed it will be possible to prevent this type of accident from ever occurring again.

This accident might have been prevented if the workers could have done something like this:

(a) they were prepared at the start of the construction for any cold weather conditions

(b) they would have chosen a place where their equipment would most easily be able to pick them up

(c) the workers could have tried to remove their equipment from beneath their car or truck when they felt it was a bit too much of a cold spot to keep working in

(d) if they were in the position of having to pull over in order to free things they could have either tied a cable from the equipment to their truck or they could have placed a chain on the",1

"Summary: Parents beam with pride, can't stop from smiling from outpouring of support. Mom: ""I was so happy I didn't know what to do"" Burn center in U.S. has offered to provide treatment for reconstructive surgeries. Dad says, ""Anything for Youssif"" Article: 

Parental Acceptance of a Child with Type 1 Diabetes {#Sec1}
===================================================

We see two parents beam with pride at their son Youssif's treatment at a U.S. burn center. They smile at us from the sidelines of a group of about a dozen people who have traveled from Egypt to see their son. Youssif's mother, who has never spoken to a journalist, sits in the group, saying little. The father is more vocal. His smile reflects an almost fatherly pride and a quiet pride. He is a professor at the University of Nasser.

Youssif has the same name as his father. Both father and son were born in Cairo and educated in the United States (the father in the U.S., the son in Egypt). Their paths diverged.

Youssif's father is a professor who wrote extensively about the history of Egypt. Like his dad, Youssif graduated from American high schools and received his PhD in the U.S. with a passion for Egyptology. Youssif continued his studies in Egypt and earned his masters and his PhD. Then he moved to England for the rest of his studies. He now is teaching at the University of Oxford.

""Do you know what your father does?"" The question catches us by surprise. ""Oh yes, he studies the history of Egypt, especially ancient Egyptian history,"" we reply. ""But what else?"" ""Oh,"" we say, ""he is a professor at Cairo University and a writer and a researcher, like Uncle Tawadros [my uncle]."" ""How lovely,"" Youssif's parents whisper back to each other.

In contrast to the parents at the hospital, Youssif's father is reserved. He smiles, gives a one-word answer when I ask him how he is. When I ask him about his son, his face softens and his smile widens. ""Well, he is Youssif. Y is very happy and healthy. I am very proud of him as is his mother.""

How have the parents come to accept that this is how their son lives? What is important to note from this exchange, the contrast between the parents and their reactions to Youssif; the emotional distance between the son and his dad -- the father is visibly the more empathetic; the parents are emotionally far apart. Youssif smiles back at his parents, a smile of deep understanding, even though he knows that his dad is unable to connect with all this. Youssif smiles back, with a slightly sad smile, a smile he can see in his parents -- the smile of a boy who knows that his parents are unable to connect.

Diabetes-Related Challenges in Childhood {#Sec2}
=========================================

It is at this point that the mother speaks. I am surprised when I hear her speak. My initial take on Youssif is that it is the mother who is the more empathetic. It isn't until Youssif's mother speaks that the mother takes center stage. I am surprised at this, because I am used to seeing parents, or mothers at least, take center stage. The mother's words are, ""It's really not that easy for him."" Her husband adds, ""It's Youssif. He is proud.""

The mother pauses and says, ""I am not even proud. Well, at least as I remember, I wasn't. But this year in college, I realized that this is life, this is how it must be. I know it is a difficult disease for both me and for Youssif to accept. It is okay for Youssif to be proud of himself. He is very special, but this is my son too, and I will struggle to accept it, and that's okay."" Her facial expressions suggest she is in pain. I don't have to ask her to finish her thought. ""I don't love my son, as much as you do, and it's not fair. And the first day he was admitted to the hospital, I broke down and cried. I just started crying like it was the end of all that is good and happy in life. But it's all right to break down, although you might not feel like it afterwards. And it's all right to start from a place of love for Youssif, because he is not ready to understand. When Youssif was younger, he really didn't know what diabetes was about -- and then he got serious,",1

How the process works

Your research should include finding a reputable NGO that provides services such as food and clothes to vulnerable families and that is active in the area where you live. For example, CARE International has offices in England, Afghanistan, the Philippines, and in the Middle East. You need to contact the office nearest to home and identify a case worker who can advise you in the most appropriate way to reach families. This is often a challenging process because when you get to the office you find no records. However, if the NGO has been in the area for some time then it is likely that you may be able to meet with a case worker after a referral. This person may be able to tell you about a local shelter or food bank that provides a service similar to the way your NGO is helping.

If you decide to choose an NGO that works within your country then you will need to decide which type of NGO to approach. For example, a large NGO could have dozens or hundreds of case workers in the same region. Alternatively, a smaller NGO could only offer services in a small area and have no permanent staff. The key consideration is how localised the NGO is when you ask for help for a family.

Case studies – using cases

You will need to research the problem and look for potential case studies. Case studies are more informative than just a simple news article. A case study may include many different aspects of a situation that can help to raise funds and public awareness. You should therefore do your research on the problem, and then focus on a particular problem that may have solutions for funding the development of long-term plans and helping families in need. These may be people for whom there is a long-term need such as young people in difficult circumstances, women who need to access services to get money for their children, or children with needs such as special education who need a home that will help their situation or keep them safe. All of these are things that, as a group, you have been trying to tackle and overcome. If you are working on a case study with the same problems then you will be using a similar methodology and your campaign may be designed around that single problem. Your research should demonstrate the real-life issues that your group faces so you can start to identify the key concerns. Some case studies may include one aspect to demonstrate that this approach is effective, such as raising awareness of the problem. You must try to demonstrate that the work is worthwhile and will work to help people, and is not just a case study to raise funds. Your organisation hopes that people will be interested and donate to support your campaign through individual and corporate sponsorship. Sometimes when an NGO raises awareness of a problem in one part of a country their work may lead to the awareness of problems in other places as well. You must make sure that your audience knows where you are coming from and what you are doing. Do not create a cause where you pretend people are similar and that your group is supporting one other in difficult circumstances.

Using examples of 'true life' incidents

You will need to find examples of'real-life incidents' for your group to use when you ask for financial donations. These examples should be true-life incidents of what you experience and should demonstrate real need for help. You should make sure that the examples are local or from a known case study about a similar problem in another part of the country. You do not want to be accused of taking advantage of people in a situation that they find difficult to bear or that their charity has helped to create a need in another part of the world. One example of a real-life incident could be working with a group that is trying to provide better opportunities for people. Their efforts to give food to the poorer areas of the capital and train people to cook could produce an increasing number of people who need to provide for their families in this way. It could be good to illustrate this situation in the news story. Another'real-life' incident to raise awareness around poverty and need could be to go to a school for disabled children where parents cannot provide for them and ask for donations from",1
"Summary: Tomas Medina Caracas was a fugitive from a U.S. drug trafficking indictment. ""El Negro Acacio"" allegedly helped manage extensive cocaine network. U.S. Justice Department indicted him in 2002. Colombian military: He was killed in an attack on a guerrilla encampment. Article: 

El Negro

An investigation into the death of a Colombian politician last week in Venezuela has raised the prospect of high-level political fallout in Washington that could damage Venezuelan counter-narcotics cooperation with the United States. Colombian politicians and business interests are trying to contain a political fire that started after the investigation disclosed that El Negro was the victim of a Colombian military intelligence operation. According to an investigation published by the daily El Tiempo on March 25, El Negro Caracas was killed in an ambush on a guerrilla encampment in northeastern Colombia. According to the report, he was killed in a U.S.-backed operation by Colombian intelligence ""in collaboration with Venezuelan authorities."" The operation allegedly took place in December 2005, and involved the joint participation of the Colombian military and Venezuelan police. In the early stages of the operation, an aircraft was used for surveillance flights over the encampment. In addition, sources report that intelligence teams moved between the encampment and its base in Caracas. In the aftermath of his death, ""numerous Colombians linked to powerful families"" who reportedly collaborated with the operation resigned from their posts. The operation against El Negro Caracas was a joint effort by Colombian security forces, including the Colombian army and the Colombian intelligence agency DAS (Delegación de Análisis y Sistematización - Department of Analysis and Systematization - DAS), whose chief, Mauricio Rodríguez Gallego, is a member of the National Assembly. This week, The Miami Herald said that ""a former high-level DAS official with direct involvement in the intelligence-war effort also was accused of playing a role in the operation that took down [a] prominent drug trafficker."" The report indicated that the operations against El Negro Caracas and Carlos Castrejon, leader of a rival paramilitary group, occurred only three weeks before the Colombian military and Venezuelan police dismantled Castrejon's network.

Castrejon

Castrejon was killed when Colombian military intelligence operatives raided his mountain stronghold in early January 2006. El Tiempo alleges that the Castrejoneños' alleged cooperation with Venezuelan authorities prompted authorities in Bogotá to turn against them. ""The operation against Carlos Castrejon was the last straw"" for a group of politicians who had been dealing with his group by offering them political concessions, a Bogotá lawyer said to El Tiempo. According to a statement released by Colombia's Defense Ministry on March 27, the operation against Castrejon Caracas was conducted in coordination with Venezuelan authorities.

DAS-connected politician

The revelations are likely to have repercussions for relations between the Venezuelan and U.S. government, which has been making inroads in its South American counter-narcotics effort. A new intelligence-sharing agreement between Venezuela and the U.S. was signed in August 2005. In August 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez met with U.S. President George W. Bush in Trinidad. On February 3, 2007, Venezuelan and U.S. diplomats signed a memorandum of understanding on intelligence sharing. Colombian drug trafficking is the biggest single threat to Venezuela's independence. The Venezuelan government signed onto an antidrug agreement between the Andean Initiative for Counter-Terrorism (ATI) and the U.S.?on April 5, 2004 to counter growing violence and drugs-related corruption in Venezuela's border region. The Colombian guerrilla movement FARC has had a significant presence in the border area since the mid-1970s.

Castrejoneños

The Castrejoneños, or Colombians, have had a significant presence in northeastern Colombia since the late-1970s. The guerrillas fought for control of the mountainous region along the Colombian-Venezuelan border in the 1980s and 1990s. In January 2006, the Colombian security forces killed another suspected Castrejoneño leader, Alberto García Abadal, in Cesar province. Colombian media reports suggest ties between the Castrejoneños and Venezuelan intelligence agencies. On January 25, 2006, former Colombian defense minister Jaime Córdova told reporters that in 1999, Colombian authorities uncovered the Castrejoneño network and that Colombian National Intelligence had offered them political concessions in exchange for their help. He also said that Colombian intelligence shared information with Venezuelan authorities. According to La Jornada, Córdova has been the target of death threats from a group of retired Colombian military officers for ""revealing information on the complicity of intelligence officials and the Colombian army with terrorist entities."" He has also been named as one of the most powerful members of the conservative Colombian Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Colomb",1
"Summary: President Bush says Tony Snow ""will battle cancer and win"" Job of press secretary ""has been a dream for me,"" Snow says Snow leaving on September 14, will be succeeded by Dana Perino. Article:  Snow (pictured right) is currently battling his third form of cancer, lymphoma. Perino, a White House staffer for nearly 27 years, will be a co-host on ""The McLaughlin Group"" until December and the press secretary job is a top priority, sources have told CNN. Snow told ""Fox News Channel's ""Hannity & Colmes"" Wednesday that he was ""at the brink"" of the ""worst weekend of my life"" when he learned that he would have to undergo two weeks of chemotherapy and radiation. He has ""had a great year"" and said the treatment would ""make me a better husband, a better father."" ""All kinds of dark places are possible and probably will be, when you're about to face (his) greatest health challenge in his life and your whole life is about to change, so the only thing that's predictable is probably your emotions,"" Snow said. He spoke to his wife, Janet, who was with him when doctors gave the diagnosis in May. ""We've been through this before, you know. And we both had a little bit of fear, but you have to do what you're told if you do that (treatment) because it worked for others."" Perino will step in when Snow departs, the source said. She said the ""job he's doing"" is ""a dream for me."" ""He's making all these people look so good,"" she said. Perino told CNN she will return ""to work soon."" ""They're the people best equipped to do what the White House needs,"" she said of the administration. ""It's what they do."" Perino will be the first woman to hold the press secretary job, but she wasn't the first woman in the position. Jan Easton served for a few weeks in 1989. Perino, who has two children ages two and six, came to the White House in 1989 and started as press secretary in 1991. She is among those leaving when Bush leaves office in January. Perino told CNN, ""It was the best Christmas vacation of her life, and I couldn't have asked for a more qualified successor. And she will do an excellent job as press secretary, just as she always has."" ""I am humbled by the president's confidence in me,"" said Perino in a statement. ""We have a huge job to do to make sure that when the president leaves office, he's leaving behind an administration that is focused on the American people."" Asked about Perino's departure several weeks ago, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said of her: ""I think she'll go into a new role."" At a farewell party for Snow and others on Friday, he called her a ""warrior."" After learning of Snow's cancer diagnosis, periorn said: ""She looks just wonderful. She's totally cool, and that tells you a lot about Dana."" Snow has been the White House press secretary since January 2003, during President Bush's second term, and is one of the few remaining Bush staffers. He was the president's lead writer for the book ""A Charge to Keep."" He also has worked as an editorial writer for ""The Washington Times"" and as a ""Pentagon Correspondent."" In addition, Snow has been a radio host, columnist and commentator in a variety of venues and he has appeared on ""The Today Show"" and ""The Late Show with David Letterman."" Snow was appointed editor of ""Newsweek"" in January. Snow's third cancer was found after he complained that his right testicle (which he thought might be a testicle removed last year) was enlarged. He underwent surgery Wednesday to remove the ""fleshy"" tissue around it. The biopsy came back positive for lymphoma. Lymphoma is a cancer that affects the lymphatic system. His father, Joe Snow, died of lymphoma in 1973 at age 43. During the presidential debates, the vice presidential debate and last fall's State of the Union address, Snow did not make any jokes or take questions from journalists. Asked how he feels about not delivering his familiar jokes and quips in the briefings since he learned he had cancer, he said he was ""more focused and more ready to take on the job. I just get on with the business of representing the president and the White House"" on ""Hannity & Colmes."" He said about his ""dream job"" of being the president's press secretary: ""It's been the best year of my life."" ""Hannity & Colmes"" will go on hiatus for two weeks starting next week after Snow leaves and resume in October. Perino was a Republican co-host on ""The McLaughlin Group."" She joined the show in 1996. A Republican, Perino has worked as chief political director of the",1
"Summary: Empty anti-tank weapon turns up in front of New Jersey home. Device handed over to Army ordnance disposal unit. Weapon not capable of being reloaded, experts say. Article: 

A report published by the US Army, The Army and NBCU News (NBC Universal) on 16, January 2005, states that the anti-tank weapon found in a Jersey City home could potentially cause serious problems for the home owner and her family if it were to explode. Despite being unable to be reloaded, ordnance disposal experts say that the anti-tank weapon poses a threat because of the potential of a high-explosive blast-force.

The report comes after an unidentified man called the army with information about a box filled with explosives. The box was found on the side of the house on 1st Avenue in Jersey City, New Jersey. Although the man stated the box was his, investigators believe there may have been another man involved. Ordnance disposal members took the device to Fort Lee. The device turned out to be an early version of the ""Pop Flash"" anti-armor weapon. These are used in the military for the purpose of disarming anti-tank bombs. It does not, however, disarm mines, since most anti-tank mines do not use the same systems as their anti-armor counterparts. It is also not capable of being reloaded, which is a major problem due to the potential of having a blast effect, according to the report. On February 15, NBC News aired an investigative report, called ""Operation TNT."" On the program, a weapons specialist stated that most experts do not believe a bomb would cause a major threat to the city, but they recommend an explosive ordnance unit be sent to investigate the device, because it is unknown what the military does with an unexploded anti-tank weapon, according to the New York Times. On February 17, NBC News returned with a follow-up report on the device. It stated that if the family does not know what to do with the device, it could cause a major threat to the city, because it remains ""in a box"" and there is no way to dispose of the device. It also noted the potential of an explosive blast for the first time. The report states that there is ""no real plan"" when it comes to the disposal of anti-tank weapons.

The Associated Press provides insight into a plan by the US government to dispose of anti-tank weapons, stating that the Department of Defense hopes to end the use of the weapons by August 2007. According to the article, the Pentagon has had no experience with these weapons; they can be up to five feet in length. They also do not provide the same type of protection as anti-tank mines. ""These are deadly weapons"" one person said. They are made of magnesium or lead and can be used to protect soldiers from being attacked by the enemy, or to attack them. Ordinance disposal experts have stated that once these weapons are ""downgrade"" there are no laws about what happens to them. The government has no plan about how to deal with the anti-tank weapons, and they have no system for transporting the weapons to be destroyed. Currently, there are three military facilities that contain the devices. There are more than 80 anti-tank weapons currently in use in the U.S. Armed forces.

The New York Times provides an important commentary that the situation at hand is similar to the way the government disposed of weapons in the Gulf War. They state that on August 21, 1991 at Fort Greely in Alaska, two military officers detonated more than a million grenades, according to an Associated Press report. The grenades were made from old artillery shells that came from the Vietnam War. The Army did not follow their military disposal procedures when it came to the disposal of the grenades; instead, they left them to the local community to deal with and there was no system in place to deal with them appropriately. The grenades were left to degrade and some were destroyed, but several hundred were stolen and used to make weapons like mortars, or they were dumped. This was a similar situation to the one at hand, the authors of the article state. They add that the anti-tank weapons also have no way of being transported to a facility.

A report issued by the Department of Defense, The Army and NBCU News, on 16, January 2005, states that the anti-tank weapon found in a Jersey City home may pose a threat to the home owner and her family. The report states that the device consists of a ""Pop Flash,"" a primitive weapon used by the army to disarm anti-tank mines. Although it is unknown whether the soldier was using the weapon to disarm an anti-tank mine or to dispose of the device, the soldier called the army for advice. The anti-tank weapon was discovered in the garage of a house on First Avenue, in Jersey City, New Jersey. It turned out to be an early version of the ""Pop Flash,""",1
"Summary: President Bush to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Wednesday. Bush to say that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists. Speech will be latest White House attempt to try to reframe the debate over Iraq. Article: 

I did and I was corrected by one of our editors from my spelling mistake. Although I couldn't figure out why he made the change. After all it was I who was the best writer in the group. He always gave us feedback.

I think there are always people at the news company when you submit a copy to them. They always have the latest copy.

But that was before Google came along. Now if you just put in your query words you'll get the results.

My question was why it was corrected. It's not the first time my spelling has been noted. Perhaps we should all stop submitting news items.

The real answer is that he wanted me to see that in the time it took for me to correct my mistake he had already sent out an e-mail to someone else for correction. But I would have known that. No point in waiting for a change.

Now, that's not to say that if he was the editor of news and his job was to go through, let's say, the entire article in our words. He certainly wouldn't do that. That's not the job requirement.

The point is once the article reaches him and he takes the time to review or proof read it, we assume he's a writer and knows what's right. This is true whether he's at an actual news company or is a freelance writer.

As we all know, if you're a freelance writer you don't get paid. They have to do it themselves or they can't write. Or if they find someone else do the work for them. Or if they find others to do the work they write up your article and then you get the payment. That's why you can't find a freelance writers or even news editors. There are far fewer positions than there are people to fill them. It's not that hard to find a news reporter and you hear of them every day.

Some news rooms have a job requirement that people working there have to finish their own articles first. If they do that they can submit a copy, if not they can't do it.

But even in a news company a writer is always asked to proofread his or her own article. I've never worked for one who wouldn't do that. Especially if I had made any mistakes. So if I had a chance to fix the typo I would do that.

As for the other one... he told me not to put that question. He didn't want to answer it and then the editor might try to explain why.

There is no point in you and I asking him what he did. It's not our business what he did. In fact he would do the same thing he does for an article we write.

He told me to stop wasting his time. That what I was doing was a violation of Google's policy that was outlined in our Google Ads and AdSense Contract. As I am a freelancer he pointed out that there was a difference between what we did and what we were being paid for.

Of course he would say that. But the problem is that if someone wanted to look up the definition of freelance, they wouldn't. They probably have no idea what they mean by that. In fact, who would know. I do and I'm sure you know what I mean if at least you're not a novice user.

So what he was told and I was later, is we can't do it and he needs to stop. When I pointed out that it was the editor who did the changing and not me what he said was not to talk about it. That was his warning. He didn't want further explanations or I was just wasting his time. That's all.

Perhaps he was being an ass. Perhaps he was being overly controlling. But I don't know because I did stop.

But when I started posting ads on the right side of the news page we always had ads on one side or the other. Or we didn't. If we didn't, there were other ads in the middle. No problem with that.

But what happened was one day the entire page went pink. The whole page. No ads. You couldn't even read it. It was pink.

Now, to anyone not familiar with that, you should understand that no one has the power to shut down the page or change our color. It is an ad program. It's been installed and runs on the server that we pay for. It was just pink.

The fact is Google didn't want it colored that way. They didn't want our story to be visible to the millions of people who go on the news site. I'm sure",1

"Summary: President Bush will have a routine colonoscopy Saturday. While he's anesthetized, his powers will be transferred to the vice president. Bush had last colonoscopy in 2002, which found no problems. Article:  His colon is about four feet from the back side of his stomach. (In 2006, Bush underwent a preventive quadruple bypass surgery to treat high cholesterol. The bypass was needed after he developed heart disease, and doctors had no way to predict which heart would become diseased. All bypasses are similar and successful, but doctors worry that the disease Bush had may recur. Many people find this fear disturbing). Colon cancer affects about 200,000 people a year across the United States. The American Cancer Society recommends that those over 50 get routine screening.",1
"Summary: President Bush says he and first lady are deeply saddened by the tragedy. Mine Safety and Health Administration chief: We've run out of options. The six men have been trapped underground since August 6. Seven bore holes drilled into the mountain have found no signs of life. Article:  The U.S. government is providing technical assistance to the mine owner. Three other rescue teams have been unsuccessful. The men, all employed at the mine, might face a harsh winter unless help arrives soon.

What types of research did you conduct?

I didn't conduct much research. My biggest challenge was gathering the actual information from the U.S. government: the press conferences and information reports. I gathered these in a variety of ways:

Reading the White House Briefing Papers every day (more than 20 pages a day).

Scanning U.S. government websites looking for the information I needed.

In addition, I used Google alerts and scanned the search results for more information.

What kind of research did you need to know to prepare this project?

I needed the most basic information and the most specific details. For example, I needed the date and time of the rescue team's last attempt to reach the men, the time the men were declared dead, and the location of the burial sites. I also wanted to learn more about the specific rescue efforts. What are the challenges in a situation such as this? And how do the rescue teams handle the challenges they encounter? When are the men at highest risk? In some cases, I was able to get information from a person with insider knowledge: a worker who has been on the rescue team, an official who is in charge of the rescue operation, or a reporter whose interview or article contains new and important information. Often, I had to conduct additional research into that person's background and past experiences to determine credibility and reliability.

What steps did you take to conduct good research?

I made several attempts to contact the mining company. I wrote to the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Executive Officer, the President of the U.S. branch of the company, and someone at the International Mine Safety and Health Association. I also consulted members of the United States Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. Once, I wrote the president and chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. I was told they never open mail addressed to them but might be able to answer my question if I would call their offices the next time I was in Washington, D.C.

What was a challenge faced while you researched this project? What obstacles did you run into?

It's very hard to find information on this type of subject. Mining is a very secretive industry, especially when it comes to safety. The U.S. government is not the only player in the field. Mine owners have their own safety teams. Also, mining companies have their own media departments and press conferences, so it's even harder for reporters to break through to get the information they need. In order to make progress with this project, I had to get creative. Some of the tips for getting information about the U.S. government that I developed in the research phase are also useful for researching other subjects, so I included them in my Tips & Strategies for Investigating a Government Webpage.

Why might this information be important to the researcher's field?

U.S. mines employ hundreds of thousands of employees; the miners are the backbone of the U.S. economy. The mining companies and mining-related unions have powerful influence upon government, so it's useful to understand where the mines are located, how they operate, and how safe they are. A government body might be charged with overseeing a safety program, a task that is only one of many roles the U.S. government holds. For example, the Mine Safety and Health Administration is responsible for ensuring that the nation's mines are safe by conducting periodic safety inspections. It is also responsible for monitoring the work safety record of the mining companies. It is also charged with investigating mining accidents when they occur.

Is there anything you may wish you had known before you began the project?

In researching the topic, I realized right away that I would need more time than I originally estimated when I made the proposal to write the article. I needed to be as thorough as possible, but I also had other priorities. I only had four months to write an article that was due in September.

What do you hope will come from this project?

My hope is that the piece will spark an interest, or concern, among people who care about U.S. mining. While I've been involved in political campaigns, I've not been a journalist before, so I wanted to take this opportunity to learn something about the media. I also hope that if I do my next piece of investigative reporting, people will be interested in reading it.

It is explosive, and will produce a fire blast. If a C4 type explosive is set off in an airplane or other vehicle that is made of foam or other flammable material, it will burn as it explodes.

When a C4 is detonated, it produces a noise that is similar in pitch to a bomb blast. C4A: This explosive is similar to C4, but produces a much less powerful blast. It is stronger than normal explosives, but less than a detonating bomb.

It can be used as a detonator for bombs.

C4-A is used a lot in car bombs.

C4A is usually set off with the aid of detonators. This type of detonators usually cost less than normal detonators.

This type of explosive will produce a fire blast. If used in an airplane or other vehicle, they will burn. This type of detonators usually cost less than a normal detonator.

"Summary: Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees. Scientists suspect a virus may combine with other factors to collapse colonies. Disorder first cropped up in 2004, as bees were imported from Australia. $15 billion in U.S. crops each year dependent on bees for pollination. Article: 

1.

Colony Collapse Disorder has killed millions of bees

2.

Colony Collapse Disorder has also killed millions of Monarch butterflies

3.

Colony Collapse Disorder has also killed millions of bumblebees



4.

Bees and wasps are considered to be among the most essential insect pollinators, playing a crucial role in sustaining food production; more than one-third of food supply depends on insect pollination

5.

In Australia, colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees

6.

In the United States, one of California’s primary pollination districts — almonds, grapes, broccoli, cantaloupe, carrots, citrus, avocados, alfalfa, apples, cherries, olives and plums — all were affected

7.

As the U.S. and Canada began to receive millions of bees from Australia, experts predicted the U.S. honeybee population would decline by half over the next decade

8.

During a visit to Australia in 2004, U.S. President George W. Bush met with Prime Minister John Howard and other officials to express concern about the impact of Colony Collapse Disorder on honeybees.

9.

After returning to the U.S., Bush issued an executive order that created the Office of Pollinators. The order directed agency leaders to develop programs to promote the health of bees, other insects and birds that pollinate crops

10.

The White House, the Department of Agriculture and the departments of Interior and Interior are now working to prevent Colony Collapse Disorder in the United states.

11.

Experts say Colony Collapse Disorder is responsible for the demise of up to 30 percent of honeybees in the United States, a critical source of pollination in the nation’s agriculture industry

12.

Experts say Colony Collapse Disorder has killed more than a million honeybees

13.

Over the past six years or so, experts say Colony Collapse Disorder has killed between one and two million honeybees

14.

Experts say Colony Collapse Disorder has killed more than two-thirds of bumblebees and one-third of honeybees

15.

Experts project $15 billion in U.S. crops annually dependent on pollinating insects.



16.

Experts predict the loss of 30 billion bees annually

17.

In 2005, Colony Collapse Disorder killed off the vast majority of honeybees in the nation. In 2006, experts started to notice that the bees in some states were doing better.



18.

The following year, the bees in some states were doing so well that experts say there was a major setback in 2008 and then again in 2011

19.

In 2012, bees were thriving again and some bees were even flying outside. Some scientists say bees are the most important pollinator of flowering plants in the world

20.

In 2013, the bees were again thriving and experts predict the honeybees will experience an unprecedented honeybee boom.

21.

In January, scientists found why. A microscopic pathogen was invading the brains of bees and turning them violent.



22.

Experts estimate Colony Collapse Disorder has killed billions of bees

23.

In March, a report came out that experts say found the most likely source for Colony Collapse Disorder

24.

Colony Collapse Disorder may be caused by the varroa mite, scientists say



25.

According to a 2013 report, more than three-quarters of all U.S. honeybee colonies are vulnerable to Colony Collapse Disorder due to the varroa mite

26.

The varroa mite carries diseases that can make honeybees sick and weak, killing them.

27.

Experts say there is a varroa mite that has been found in China, Japan and Europe

28.

In March, researchers identified a new varroa mite that is resistant to almost all common methods of control

29.

Other studies show a varroa mite that has been found in Europe is resistant to almost all existing mite controls, but can be controlled by two drugs

30.

Experts say that the best way to control the virus is to make sure honeybees are not brought into the U.S. from infected countries

U.S. scientists had to fly some honey",1

On May 3rd, 2000 Oakley was charged with four felonies, one felony involving the export deal.

"Summary: Two employees bought, sold weapons on their own, company says. Company fired workers, turned them in to ATF, says source. Feds investigating claims Blackwater employees made illegal arms deals. Blackwater in spotlight after shootings last weekend that killed 20 Iraqis. Article:  Blackwater is not-for-profit but does work for the government, and it does some private security work, including in Afghanistan.

Write a critical analysis of why you think the news report is biased (for example, by giving the impression that Blackwater is doing something illegal without providing details, by giving facts that are not true). What evidence would you need to change your opinion?

The last part of the article seems to indicate that Blackwater may not be engaged in ""illegal and unethical acts, but simply the very nature of providing such services makes it illegal to sell weapons to another person."" This would mean that as a for-profit organization, even if Blackwater knew that it was breaking the law, it would never be liable for wrongdoing. Given the lack of details in the original article, the best way to challenge that is to find out whether the company operates in that manner, or whether the government is simply taking advantage of a company, like Blackwater, that may be reluctant to refuse a request.

It should be noted that since the original news article, Blackwater has responded and stated that the incident in question involved the legal transfer of weapons, and they provided the ATF with names of the employees involved. It will be interesting to hear what information sources can find on employees and what facts they can come up with that they believe challenge the company's right to exist.

Blackwater is a private company, they don't have any special privileges, they are just like any other company in regards to legal. The laws just don't seem to apply to them, because no one is going to try anything illegal. The federal law governing weapons and explosives goes into extreme detail when it comes to dealing with these things.

How far do you have to go down the rabbit hole to find your evidence? The author made a couple of references to private companies selling weapons illegally but didn't elaborate on what was illegal about private companies selling those kinds of weapons.

Blackwater is a for profit company, and is used to defend and enforce the law. It is not exempt from the laws that say, say that I may not possess firearms or not transfer them.

The law doesn't say you can't sell the gun, it just says you can't transfer the gun. It doesn't say you can't give it away, it just says you can't transfer it to someone you dont know. And I hope you don't think you can get a gun legally, if it says at the bottom of the application: ""I am not responsible for any guns I give away as I think it is up to you to make sure you don't give it away. Also, I am not responsible if any of the guns end up in the hands of a murderer."".

Blackwater is not a non-profit company. It is a private company. Non profit companies are given federal and state funds and pay taxes at the same rate as non-profit companies. When non-profit companies are involved in things that are illegal, they break the law, and their owners and employees go to jail.

Blackwater is a private company. And it should not enjoy any exception from the normal laws that affect private companies, such as the law being passed by congress that limits them to owning guns that can not exceed the number of guns legally purchased by all other private gun owners combined. I'm sure if you wanted to, it could be argued.

There's nothing wrong with private companies selling guns. As long as they are within their rights to offer them to willing buyers. It is still a crime for any private company to sell illegal guns, and if someone buys them who gets them from the company, it is considered illegal for them to get possession of them.

Blackwater is doing something wrong, but the article is not giving enough details to give them a very good idea of what they did wrong to be sued. If they bought illegal guns and kept them, that's a different story. If they kept them and distributed them to other companies who then sold them, then that can also be a problem.

If the government did anything wrong, at the very least, they would be violating some law for illegally entering a home and not finding any weapons, so they should go after the homeowner and not the for-profit company.

For selling weapons that they are not required to sell, they are indeed illegal.

""Blackwater's critics charge that it is un-American to allow private companies to sell weapons that they are not required to sell and that that makes private business owners guilty of a federal crime."" What? First, there's such a thing as being a government contractor, which applies when the government",1
"Summary: Boy on meeting Spider-Man: ""It was my favorite thing"" Youssif also met SpongeBob, Lassie and an orangutan at Universal Studios. Dad: ""Other than my wedding day, this is the happiest day of my life"" Article:  Lassie: ""You're a great lover - thank you, thank you"" Boy on meeting Spider-Man: ""He was talking to my dad"" Lassie: ""Get in, get in""

SpongeBob, Lassie, the boy and another orangutan visited California and had a great time at Universal Studios. They met an orangutan playing golf, a boy on whom Lassie was acting as a surrogate mother and a man that had a wedding there on November 17.

In the evening, the people went to the movies. Lassie and SpongeBob met Spider-Man. Spider-Man said: ""Lassie, I am Spider-Man. Do you see all these buildings with the red stars?"" In the boy's house, the people had a snack, Lassie was eating a cookie, and the boy looked at a Spider-Man comic booklet.

Halloween has passed, so the people decided to prepare for Christmas. SpongeBob prepared a Christmas tree, which he decorated with a tinsel. The boy put up a Christmas tree and decorated it with a tinsel too. They went to the living room where the orangutan played with an Xbox game.

The boy watched a Christmas fairy tale, Lassie told a story about her first time when her human loved her, and SpongeBob, who was not happy because Christmas was coming too early, thought about the coming winter.

Then, Lassie and SpongeBob went to the toilet, and the orangutan went to the kitchen.

SpongeBob, Lassie and the boy went to the beach to see the sun. They collected seashells and went back to the house. They got to know that there are many people who don't have enough to eat at the beach.

SpongeBob thought about the people that are suffering because of the weather change at the Earth. Then the boy asked about his friend Spider-Man who was playing golf, and decided to ask Spider-Man to help. But, Spider-Man forgot the boy's friend.

In the evening, Spider-Man decided to go to a planet where there was a big fight. Spider-Man arrived in a space vessel. He sent Spider-Man's spaceship for the planet that the boy had mentioned.

At night, Lassie was thinking about Christmas. Then, Lassie decided to prepare Christmas dinner. She made the Christmas cake and then made the roast of turkey, which was going to be one of the main dishes. Meanwhile, the boy was lying in the bed and listening to the Christmas fairy tale.

One morning after Christmas, there was a big commotion in Lassie's house. The boy and SpongeBob came to her. They saw that she was crying and asked: ""What is the matter, Miss Lassie?"", but she didn't answer. Then they also started to cry.

Soon, Lassie and SpongeBob went to the beach as usual. They collected seashells and went back to the house. They had a breakfast, and Lassie and SpongeBob went to the kitchen. Lassie started to cook some sort of meat, and SpongeBob put the tablecloth.

All went well until they received a message from the boy's friend. His friend asked Lassie to take care of the boy and his animal family. In the evening, they would be arriving soon.

At night, SpongeBob thought about the boy's friend who would take care of them.

""Lassie, I am going away for an adventure, goodbye"" said SpongeBob. Lassie got sad and was crying, and she said: ""SpongeBob, you can't leave us"". But with tears in his eyes, SpongeBob told her that he wanted to start a new adventure.

SpongeBob went to the galaxy with his submarine, but he found out that they could only come to the Earth. The first day was cloudy. The submarine was not able to see the surface of the Earth.

The boy and his family visited the place where Lassie's people lived. The boy asked his friend about where Lassie lived. ""The house in the mountain"", he replied. The boy went to Lassie's house and told her about his friend's adventure,

""What do you mean that no such thing exists, my friend, the boy is lying"" said Lassie.

To make the boy happy, she tried to make him believe in Santa Claus, that all the things that children want could be possible with him.",1

This is a brief summary of the article and does not include sources used or quotes used.

Kouchner joined Sarkozy's government after being rejected by the Socialists as a candidate for the position.

""We have always warned France that when the situation was critical, such as with Libya, we have taken action. But we didn't want to scare the French and make the situation worse. Now we've had that warning - when a situation is critical, the French want to use all of the tools they have in hand. They want to take direct action, which is what we've done in the past.""

""In the past I would say that the Arab street were always looking at us with a more hostile attitude to us than to anyone else except for the Israelis.""

""I came to Iraq to express France's solidarity, both on the humanitarian front, but that wasn't enough for the United States, so that is one of the issues that I hope there will be changes on the ground.""

""France isn't ready to act as a military power. But we are ready to help if we need to. We cannot ask from the United States what they are prepared to provide, but if we need help we have the means to provide it.""

""Some of the people we are worried about are people who are close to Hezbollah. These people need to be stopped from doing anything which would harm our interest, if such action is to be taken.""

""My message to the people of Iran is to maintain their dignity.""

The US has called on nations in the Middle East to make a public declaration of their nuclear weapons programmes or face US sanctions and military action. But some have described the proposed ultimatum as blackmailing and provocative. Will France give in?

The US has called on nations in the Middle East to make a public declaration of their nuclear weapons programmes or face US sanctions and military action. But some have described the proposed ultimatum as blackmailing and provocative. Will France give in?

French foreign minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said in an interview with French news agency AFP that if the world community - not just the Americans - cannot prevent a spread of nuclear weapons then the world will have no other choice.

France already has a nuclear force as do the United States and Russia. It has been one of the few members of both the nuclear club and the Security Council to use the veto as a bargaining chip and use its influence to create conditions for peace. So are the French more committed to non-proliferation, or were their criticisms a smokescreen to gain French favour with Iran.

The French government has taken a hard line in its opposition to Iran. French President Nicolas Sarkozy angered Iranians and the west during the war in Lebanon in 2006. But will the French use their influence to get Iran to comply with the nuclear non-proliferation agreement, or will they simply be an obstructionist?

For example, would French foreign minister Phillipe Douste-Blazy's suggestion that Iran be declared a nuclear weapons state be an isolated French manoeuvre or a reflection of French concerns? The French, like all countries, are still weighing their options in regard to Iran's nuclear aspirations.

The US secretary of state has warned Israel that the US cannot protect it indefinitely against threats from Iran if it continues to stockpile nuclear weapons. But Israel has threatened to go it alone in an attack on Iran to prevent it developing nuclear weapons. The issue has the ability to escalate out of hand. Will the US be prepared to use force in the event of an Israeli strike?

Will the US intervene if Israel launches a preemptive strike on Iran?
Would America use military force in its regional area to protect Israel (see question 4)?

""France is one of those countries which has always maintained its neutrality and will continue to do so. The French army has a clear mandate to maintain the stability of France and it acts based on that mandate and it will continue to act that way. It has never intervened, it has never been involved. ""

Aunt May stared into the distance, not taking her finger away from the trigger. ""She's not looking at me. She just said she wanted to look away."" She looked at him for a minute, then shifted her gaze to May and cocked her head to the side. ""But she needs me.""

""I'm here,"" May said, and smiled. She did not want to say it, but she suddenly felt like the last link to the person they had all been, and she needed him.

All this for a woman who, six months earlier, May would have said she didn't want to talk about her anymore.

""I'm not going in that way,"" she said, looking down at her feet, the black bandanna tied around her leg. ""I'm sorry.""

It was the most I could give, she thought, as tears spilled down her cheeks. It was an apology she could not have come up with in words, so she had drawn May from her face to show her, and let herself into whatever was to come. She stared into May's blackened eyes and reached forward for her hand. ""Come,"" she said.

""Don't call them that,"" she said in response. ""That's what I meant...""

Article:  Analysts say she will face many challenges, not least in dealing with the country's most corrupt politician, former Prime Minister, the Congress party's main ally Pranab Mukherjee, who they say has a conflict of interest because of his government's role in bringing India's telecom giant Airtel into the banking system

Summary: India elects first female president, official results show Saturday

Pratibha Patil's supporters are calling victory a boost for women's rights.

Bitter election campaign was marked by scandal.

Pranab Mukherjee was the chief minister of Chhattisgarh state in central India.

72-year-old Patil was the ruling coalition's nominee for mainly ceremonial post.

Analysts say she will face many challenges.

India's main opposition BJP party withdrew its prime ministerial candidate, a Hindu cleric, following allegations that he was connected to a murder and a rape after he won a seat in last week's Hindu nationalist party primary election.

With two days to go before President Pratibha Patil was due to swear-in her successor, the official results showed that he won.

The president's office announced that Mr Modi of the incumbent BJP and his three main party competitors -- a Congress party leader, an arch-rival leader of the regional party he heads and another regional leader -- have tied in the nationwide election for the country's top elected office.

Mr Modi won an absolute majority in the 643-seat Lok Sabha in the country's general election on Sunday with a record margin of victory, and will easily be re-elected on Monday, party sources say.

Mr Modi is believed to have won the post of prime minister for the second time.

'Saviour' and'mobiliser'

As he was preparing to start his second term as Prime Minister, party officials say he is a divisive, charismatic politician who has united India's Hindu majority and driven record economic growth into its fifth-largest economy.

His election as the first full-term BJP-led government in India is seen as a strong endorsement of Mr Modi's policies in the country of about 1.2 billion people, which has seen some of the worst economic growth rates in the world.

Mr Modi, 53, is credited with cleaning up India's chaotic bureaucracy and restoring growth to the country long plagued by slow growth and corruption.

In his first 100 days in office, Mr. Modi has managed to attract praise, even from critics. But it is his divisive Hindu nationalist image that has made him seem less open.

He has been credited with driving down prices in India's vast countryside, which is largely poor and relies heavily on cash for its existence.

""Our goal is not to run a party, it is to run a nation,"" he has often said, insisting that he wants to reach out to all Indians.

But Mr Modi's critics say they are frustrated by a lack of transparency. They accuse him of being anti-Muslim after nationwide riots in 2003 left more than 200 people dead when Hindus and Muslims clashed after a Muslim ruler converted to Hinduism in the northern state of Gujarat.

As a chief minister of the state of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, he was seen by some as a Hindu nationalist zealot

His critics allege Mr Modi allowed Hindu religious leaders to play an influential role in shaping economic policy. But supporters say Mr Modi's economic track record speaks for themselves.

In five years, real gross domestic product (GDP) has risen 6%, the second-highest figure in the world, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).

""This election is a triumph,"" wrote the influential political magazine India Today. ""This is a new dawn in Indian politics, in the process, India's first woman president took over on 21st May to lead the country for next five years.""

Amit Shah, a 39-year-old leader of Mr Modi's BJP, is expected to be the next vice president, while the party's traditional leaders, including 69-year-old chief minister of Gujarat, Mr. Modi's home state, Mr. Modi's home state, Narendra Modi

Analysts say the president was chosen because she has the advantage of being a former chief minister of the Indian state with the world's largest state, Tamil Nadu.

But her victory comes at a time of deep political change in India. More than 40 million citizens have voted in the 6th general election since independence in 1947.

While India is one of the world's biggest economies with about $1.8",1

We are being asked to write a news article in which we provide information from a source other than the source of our story idea. You’ll use another story to direct your own ideas into clear, organized, and compelling paragraphs. You should use appropriate transitions and language to connect one thought and idea to the next. This is an example. If you choose the summary we have provided, you can provide your own ideas and information, rather than copying verbatim. Write your own story on a different subject.

You should read the article and think about what is happening. Then write your own article, taking into account your ideas, thoughts, opinions, and research. It should include original material, in addition to information from the source. Remember to mention where you got your information.

We have given you a summary of information. The summary is based on an Associated Press article. You may use that summary, in whole or in part, as a starting point for your own article.

As you read the summary, you should ask yourself the following questions:

Why is this happening? What is the story here? The question: If I was the writer, how would I sell this story to my editor?

Is this a breaking news story? How is it that this isn’t already on the wires? If you think you can answer this question, your editor will say, “I’m going to get you on the story.”

Is there a human angle to the story? This is why you came up with your own idea. Is it a human interest? Is it about race? Is it about class? The questions: There is no human angle here. There are so many things here to write about, why isn’t it on the wires? If you have ideas about what people should be asking themselves about, that means you have a unique perspective to the story. You should write about these things.

Is it possible to write this kind of story? This is about what can be written about the story. Does it contain the kinds of problems that most newsrooms face? Does it have the kinds of risks most local newsrooms face? Does it involve the kinds of resources your newsroom can offer in such a way that is possible to write the story?

If this is going to be on the front page, what will it take to get it there? Should the story run in all the local print media? Will it be nationally syndicated? Could it run in a major wire service?

You can use your own information and add your ideas. If you do that, remember to mention where you got your information. Your idea should be on the page.

You’ll write your own news article with the following headings at the top, plus some of your own. Note that we are not providing these headings; you should use your own:

Title This is your headline, a very important component of your story. You may choose the subject from the summary or from your news idea, based on what you find to be the most important element of your writing.

Lead This is a statement that provides the reason for covering the story. It will be on the first few paragraphs of your story. Here is an example where your idea is the lead:

Fierce jabs are flying as one of the nation’s largest hospital chains gets ready for battle

Body The body of your story. You will introduce your story with a fact or two. You will provide the information that lets your readers know where the story is going to take the reader.

"Summary: Chadian president wants journalists, flight crew released. Red Cross, UNICEF, UNHCR interview children that charity tried to fly out of Chad. Most are not from Sudan and have families, agencies say. Six members of Zoe's Ark, 11 others under arrest in Chad. Article:  They are also accused of providing shelter to 14 others.

News articles

The Chadian government ordered that seven foreign journalists, aid workers, and two flight crew released on Wednesday following a visit to refugee camps in eastern Chad, said the group.

It said they included four journalists from the BBC, four from France’s TF1 and one from Al Jazeera.
“The release order, which was given after the visit, took us by surprise,” Chris Hazzard, a Chadian government spokesman, told journalists when they had left the camps on Tuesday.

“Our government and all international partners of the Chadian delegation, especially the Red Cross, had expected that these journalists would leave Chad tomorrow. We were surprised to see them leaving today,” he added.

The journalists, who had arrived in the Chad capital N’Djamena five days earlier, were on board a U.N. helicopter when they were escorted by the government to the border with Sudan on February 7. They were taken out of the capital to El Fasher.

Two U.N. workers, who witnessed the escape of the seven, were released a few days later. They were also flown out of Chad on a U.N. helicopter, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which coordinated the mission.

A separate team of more than 30 humanitarian workers and Chadian and United Nations officials had also been held captive for several days.

The Red Cross told the seven journalists that they could leave the country only after they returned some of the children that had received their care.

The U.N. Children’s Fund said it was waiting for the agreement of its agency or others to take in more children, but only after they were given the opportunity to say good-bye to their families.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had not been asked to participate in the operation.

Last month, Chadian authorities arrested 11 adults in the northeastern Darfur region, which borders Chad, on suspicion of providing shelter to at least 14 other people.

UNICEF said it was the first time that it had experienced something ""quite so dramatic"", in addition to having to deal with cases of children ""who face multiple trials"".

UNICEF said it could not say for sure whether the sheltering children were from Chad, but it suspected some were Sudanese.

UNICEF deputy director of programmes in Chad, Jean-Pierre Perrin said: ""We received no request from our government or from our host government Chadian authorities to help in the repatriation of any refugees.

""Obviously this is an exceptional and unique case of a repatriation with a very large number of refugees and Chadian nationals being held in different places together. In this case there are some reports that some children were being looked after by people who claim to act on behalf of a religious group.

""And, therefore, there is clearly a lot of suspicion that the children taken to Chad were Sudanese.

He said he had not heard from those involved, including the Sudanese authorities, as to the whereabouts and identity of the people.

He said any children currently detained had no relatives in Chad, and said it was ""very, very difficult indeed to locate people who have no close contact (with) their family"".

He stressed that the repatriation went ahead despite the fact that international children's organisations were not part of the mission.

Mr Perrin said there are a lot of questions to ask about the circumstances surrounding the repatriation and people responsible for the decision.

""There is some concern among us that this might have been an over-ambitious and potentially illegal exercise by people who are concerned they would be blamed for any kind of problems that might arise,"" he said.

He said it is not clear what would happen next for the children.

""There are no relatives here to take them in to, to care for them,"" he said. ""They are all kind of in limbo.

""UNICEF is providing help for any children that we have in our care but obviously we must wait for the decision to be taken about the others.

""Of course we will work with the national authorities and others, but we will also have to respect the decision of the children.""

However, he said UNICEF had not been asked to cooperate in the mission.

Sudanese officials in the capital, Khartoum, said they were still investigating reports of people illegally entering Sudan to take children from the Chadian camps.

"Summary: Earth has warmed one degree in past 100 years. Majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise. Some critics say planets often in periods of warming or cooling. Article:  NASA says most of the surface of the planet was warmer than now in past. Some critics agree while others say temperatures can fluctuate up to ten degrees in a decade. Experts say humans are affecting the climate cycle. Some say that human activity like burning fossil fuels is the cause of recent temperatures. Others say they have not seen any warming on the surface of the planet since 1997, the hottest year.

A large number of people around the world have called for an increase in the level of global temperature.

Many people believe that the Earth is becoming warmer since a major period of global warming coincided with a rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

The theory goes on to state that the increase in temperature will ultimately result in some sort of catastrophe which will befall humanity.

Climate sceptics argue that there were periods of global cooling, in the past. A rise of the temperature, or even a mild cooling which has lasted for a number of years will never be a problem and that it is all down to natural fluctuations in the Earth’s temperature.

They also claim that the Earth is always getting warmer because of greenhouse gases (molecules with gasses trapped in them) being emitted into the atmosphere.

Some of the experts believe that the only way to make an informed decision with regards to climate change is to understand the past. This may enable the experts to correctly predict any future global warming which may have disastrous effects.

If temperatures were to remain in what they are today for another 100 years, climate scientists argue that there may, or may not be effects such as a melting ice-cap (ice caps already melted once in the past).

This video gives an indication of how the experts feel:

The following article discusses the effect of greenhouse gases on climate and the effect it may have on the Earth.

This video gives the opinions of both scientists and critics. There are opinions on each side concerning the level of the Earth’s temperature. Watch and see what you think?

Greenhouse gases: the cause of the Earth-s temperature

Many people will take a different view about greenhouse gases and how it affects the earth.

The video shows that carbon dioxide is mainly a gaseous substance. It is the main component of the atmosphere of almost a third of the atmosphere.

An essential greenhouse gase in the atmosphere is Methane. It can be found in large amounts in the oceans of the world.

There are many chemicals which emit Greenhouse gases: Water vapour, Methane, Carbon Dioxide, Nitrous oxide and Halocarbons. These are also used by people in a number of areas of industry and even residential use. Greenhouse gases can be found in industry for instance in boilers used for the generation of electricity and even found in industrial ovens, the burning the coal will emit.

Cement also emits Methane, the cement kiln creates Methane which is released into the atmosphere along with Carbon dioxide.

Burning fossil fuels causes the Carbon dioxide to enter the atmosphere and is created by burning or rotting plant matter.

Carbon Dioxide, Methane and water are also created as a result of farming activities which release large amounts of Methane into the atmosphere.

If these gases enter the atmosphere at an elevated level then this would have an effect on the temperature since Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.

Many people say that carbon dioxide is responsible for rising temperatures.

Methane is also responsible and so also is water but water in it’s vapour state is just water.

When there is a warmer climate where there is humidity in the atmosphere, there may also be more moisture in the atmosphere which will allow more plants to grow thus there will be more production of both water and Methane gases.

All of the above has led to an increased amount of carbon dioxide being created by various means in the future.

If the carbon dioxide is being released from one area, like a massive oil company or a mining company, and then being released elsewhere, then that will increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere but that does not mean the greenhouse gases will affect the overall average greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere.

This would make the argument for or against global warming fall. One argument would be that the atmosphere has always been heated and cooled. But another argument would be that the amount of carbon dioxide is rising and that will only affect greenhouse gas levels in one area.

The video, as mentioned, is taken from NASA’s website:

“Earth’s average temperature has been steadily rising since the 1800s.”

Since carbon dioxide is a gaseous substance which is released",1

Police: Case shifts from a missing persons search to a potential homicide. Friends and family: Stacy Peterson expressed concerns about her husband. Article: 

Examiner.com Legal: Drew Peterson ordered to exhume wife Stacy, says court papers cite 'improper purpose' in seeking body.The lawyer for Drew Peterson's third spouse has written that evidence he said would show that Stacy Peterson was killed would now be inadmissible for the death of her husband, in a ruling that could force the former suburban Chicago police chief to stand trial on more grave charges that he killed her and disposed of her body.Attorney Randall Samborn, who will be arguing for a reversal of Judge Edward Burmila’s decision in a hearing Tuesday, argued the new charges are completely ""different"" than those in a July 19 ruling.Burbila said an order to exhume Stacy Peterson’s body was made without good reason with an ""improper purpose.""

The ruling makes the exhumation of her body necessary to help prove he killed her and disposed of her body.Samborn maintained that Stacy Peterson’s body could be identified by a relative but that would violate Burmilas order to protect other pending lawsuits that may be affected.Samborn also pointed out that Stacy Peterson wasn’t even a formal missing person at the time of Burmilas order to exhume – just someone who was living at the home without a lease.

Prosecutors announced Friday that charges are being leveled to include her murder, and that they had evidence that Drew's body could be recovered.

According to a Chicago Tribune report, the body of Stacy Peterson has not been found, and the case's focus is shifting from a missing-persons search to a potential homicide.

Examiner.com: Judge orders exhumation of Stacy Peterson's body.

Chicago Tribune.com: Body of Drew Peterson's third wife Stacy Peterson found in shallow grave.Former suburban police chief Drew Peterson has ordered the exhumation of the body of his third wife in what a defense attorney described Friday as a last-ditch effort to salvage his client's pending murder trial.

According to a Chicago Tribune report, the body of Stacy Peterson has not been found, and the case?s focus is shifting from a missing-persons search to a potential homicide.

Judge Edward Burmila ordered Peterson's lawyers to submit an argument on the exhumation motion early next week. It was not immediately clear whom defense lawyers will be arguing for their client.

Examiner.com Legal: Drew Peterson to face more charges, body exhumation ordered.A judge has ordered the exhumation of the body of Drew Peterson's third wife to help prove he killed her and burned her body, prosecutors announced Friday.

According to a Chicago Tribune report, the body of Stacy Peterson has not been found, and the case?s focus is shifting from a missing-persons search to a potential homicide.

The exhumation has been ordered in part because of information that the body may be within Drew Peterson?s yard, the prosecutors said.

Drew Peterson, the former police chief who has been charged with drowning his third wife in his bathtub in 2008, was in court on Friday to learn if the remains of his third wife Stacy have been found in a shallow grave.

In February, an Illinois judge issued a ruling to exhum the grave, but no final determination has been made.

Stacy Peterson is believed to have disappeared around May of 2008. Drew Peterson said in August that authorities told him they were able to identify her based on dental information and other evidence, but prosecutors said the body could not be positively identified because of how it decayed.

Authorities said in an interview this week that they have evidence that Peterson burned the body of his third wife.

Stacy Peterson?s body had been missing for 11 and one-half years before a judge ordered a search to be conducted of Peterson?s property in Schaumburg last month. Peterson is facing several felonies, including first-degree murder, for allegedly drowning his third wife. He has pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutor's Office: Drew Peterson? has order directed exhumation of wife Stacy

According to a Chicago Tribune report, the body of Stacy Peterson has not been found.

Peterson has been ordered to have the body exhumed in case no remains are found, officials said, though a decision whether to exhume the body has not yet been made.

A judge has scheduled a hearing next week to hear information in the exhumation effort of Peterson's wife's body.

On Feb. 5, Judge Edward Burmila ordered a search of Peterson's land in Schaumburg based on information from",1
"Summary: Julia Vakulenko has reached her first final on the WTA Tour at Bell Challenge. The Ukrainian third seed will face Lindsay Davenport after beating Julie Ditty. Former world No. 1 Davenport defeated Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva. Article: 

Write a news article based on the following summary:

Julia Vakulenko has reached her first final on the WTA Tour, which means that she can have more points than the second highest-ranked player on the list. The Ukrainian third seed defeated Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain 21:9, 21:13 and reached her first final in singles on the Tour at Bell Challenge 2007. It is Vakulenko`s first final on the Tour, because the player didn`t have a chance to reach the final in any of the previous three tournaments.

Meanwhile, the former world No. 1, Lindsay Davenport, defeated Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva, who reached the final for the first time on the Tour, 21:12, 13:21. Former world No. 1 Davenport is an eight-time grand slam champion, who was the first player to win four of them in a row, in 2003. The American is the second oldest player on the Tour but has lost in the finals of some of the best tournaments in her career. Davenport managed to win her first title in six years after she had last reached the Final in 2005.

WTA ranking points are won only by those who play in WTA-approved events, and each player is only allowed to gain one-hundred additional points for winning a Tournament of Champions. The total points is therefore equal, for example, to ten WTA players reaching the final.

As Julia Vakulenko lost her last match in one of the biggest tournaments in her career, it will be the first final on the WTA Tour this year. So, she will be one of the highest ranked players on the list, and as the player hasn`t managed so far to reach her first final on the Tour.

Julia Vakulenko began her career in 1997, at the age of just twelve, and managed to rise quickly in the ranks by winning her first title at just 13 years. This happened in 1999 when she reached the Finals of the junior final tournament on the Ladies event at the US Open when the first round was played. She also beat top seeded player Amanda Coetzer in this tournament. Vakulenko`s progress brought a new experience to all tennis fans, because the WTA did not accept the player before 2000, but she made it all the way and finished the year ranked the world second best junior in the world by WTA.

The next year she played mostly doubles, however, she made it to a Grand Slam Final in mixed doubles at the US Open. She also participated in every singles event, but fell to players ranked in the top fifty most players. Her ranking rose to No. 39 by the time WTA approved her. Vakulenko remained on the list of qualified players for more than three years and reached the Finals in 2001 at the French Open. In the last event of the tournament she defeated the third seed Dominique Van Roost, but lost in the Final to the seventh seed Anke Huber.

Although Vakulenko was a talented player, she didn`t manage to get any titles, despite winning many games through her high level of tennis. Meanwhile, she managed to lose her ranking but didn`t become a Top 50 player, so she was dropped from the WTA in 2003. She started to play a lot of doubles events and gained her best success in some smaller tournaments. However, she managed to have a successful year when she reached the Finals of the Fed Cup and the Sydney Olympic Games. By the time the start of 2004, she still hadn`t won any singles title as well as a Grand Slam event.

Vakulenko came back to the WTA at the end of 2005, when she was ranked the world third best player, mostly playing doubles events. She has reached the Finals at the Hopman Cup in the last event of the year. Her ranking dropped to No. 20, making her ineligible to enter any singles event on the Circuit.

Vakulenko came back to the WTA the start of 2006 where she ranked the world world No. 35 in singles. She had very little to do last year, until the start of the 2007 season when she reached the semifinals in her home country at the Ukrainian Open in one of the most important tournaments of the year. She managed this tournament along with the doubles tournaments, where she reached the semifinals. The player also lost her last match against the tenth seed Kim Clijsters in one of the most exciting hard-court events. The following week, which took place in China, turned out to be even more",1

South Africa vs New Zealand, 1st Test, Cape Town, Oct 20, 2009. New Zealand lost first Test, South Africa won.

The first test of the five match series between New Zealand and South Africa ended in disappointment for the visitors who, under strong leadership and inspired endeavour, had the chance to win this Test match and draw level with a historic first test defeat in South African history.

New Zealand lost for the first time since the start of its tour, when a South African side lost the 3rd Test at Lord’s. The New Zealand team was captained by Stephen Fleming and included Joe Root, Colin Munro, Martin Guptill, Michael Vaughan, Mark Taylor, Jesse Ryder, Ryan Fulton, Jacob Oram, Andrew Ellis, Peter Fulton, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum and Daniel Flynn.

South Africa, led by captain Graeme Smith, won with a first innings lead of 287 runs. In their second innings South Africa added 185 runs for the first wicket. Allrounder Jacques Kallis, after being caught for just four on the first day, top scored with an unbeaten half-century, of 38, having been dropped three times. Dale Steyn, one of the world’s greatest fast bowlers, returned 5-34 in the New Zealand first innings and claimed match figures of 9-113 from 28.5 overs. He was the first to post 10 wickets in both innings of a Test match. The other three bowlers to claim five wickets were Sean Abbott, Morne Morkel and Richard Levi.

South Africa's Kallis, far left, has a laugh as other members of the team celebrate the fall of Steyn's first over of the match in the first Test on Friday, in Cape Town, South Africa. The Proteas bowled New Zealand for 111 to claim a 5-run victory and win the first Test by 285 runs.

A record of 0 for 30, which has only previously been achieved once in Test history, remains the top Test score by any captain, while the world record for bowling the most maiden overs since 1882 stands at 15. New Zealand’s last three Test matches – all lost – have ended with bowlers being dismissed for 0 at a rate of more than one every 10.5 overs.

FOUR OF FIVE. Captain Graeme Smith looks on as Jacques Kallis collects the man of the match award.

“We are very proud to win the game and get back in the series,” Smith told reporters in Cape Town. “We batted well and bowled very well in the second innings. Kallis batted very well.”

Smith and the rest of the cricket public were left to guess when New Zealand would win – if ever – as the fifth Test in Port Elizabeth started in the early hours of Thursday morning. South Africa had won the toss and fielded, choosing to bat first, and were dismissed for 120, with Fleming, a South African who became the 13th Test captain, and Taylor both falling lbw with just 10 runs between them.

A fourth Test victory would give South Africa a winning start on their first back to back series win since February 1997. But it was not to be. South Africa’s record breaking paceman Dale Steyn gave New Zealand some reason to worry after returning to the wicket for his ninth tour of New Zealand to claim 5-34 and set a new Test match record. The third highest match tally of a 5-Test series remains that New Zealand team had on their tour of South Africa in 2009.

The series opener – a first South African test victory in New Zealand – had seen the home side lose by an innings in its last four Tests in 2009, all of which they won, with a first innings loss coming in the 3rd Test of the series. In three consecutive defeats, four New Zealand wickets fell in the space of 41 runs for 24 runs and there was another example of the visitors being caught on the hop at the start of their second innings in the 3rd Test. However, the visitors still had enough in the tank, as they lost just two wickets on the day to add 185 runs for the first wicket. Allrounder Jacques Kallis batted for a half-century, with 38 off 77 balls, before being caught by wicketkeeper Andrew Elliott off bowler Stephen Fleming for four, which was the closest he came to passing 50. After making four, he was dropped a second",1

Be careful not to overuse your tanning bed. A garden is for eating.

Your paper must be written on a topic, and it's important that you use your own style. Read the following two articles for inspiration. Read first the following article and then write your own article based on the author.

When writing a research paper, check out the Internet. There is always something that can give you good ideas. Your teacher may even assign you to find an article online. Try to find a website that can also include a forum in which you can comment on it. Be careful when choosing a website, though. Ensure that it is credible.

Write at least one thousand words for your paper. The more words you are able to write, the higher the grade you will likely receive.

If you are having trouble with what to say for your paper, look online. There are numerous websites that give sample papers. Be careful about choosing a credible source, though. You can use sites that are designed for this type of topic.

Knowledge is power, and this is never more true than when it comes to writing. This can really help you stand out in college or as a graduate student. This tip can really help you succeed in school and lead to a great future of success.

Do not simply copy the original papers for your topic. It may be helpful to browse the internet on the subject. Look for something about the subject and try to make an original contribution to the debate. You can even make a brief blog post about your contribution.

Keep up to date on your college classes by reading the material assigned. You will not be able to make as much progress on assignments and study for your classes if you are always caught off guard.

Consider using the Internet to get information. These websites have information and will even provide sample papers for your paper topic. It is important to do due diligence in choosing credible and legitimate websites.

Do you have paper to complete? If you do, try to stick to a subject and write at least one thousand words. That way, your grade will not be too bad.

Try to write in your own manner, and if you're not the best writer in the world, so be it. However, it can make the difference between an average paper and a stellar paper. You can easily start writing your paper by paraphrasing, summarizing, or taking bits of paragraphs and organizing them into a paper.

Think carefully about the structure of your paper before starting to write it. Your teacher may give you an outline as to what your paper must include, but you have a few options. You might write as if you were a reader and describe to yourself the overall format that you would like to see. Another method is to think about your topic, what you want to include and what you must, but also to be a reader and to know where the paper will end.

Use your subject as a starting point for developing a coherent paper. You can start by researching and finding information. The more information you gather the easier the paper is to write.

Keep focused. You can easily get lost if you look at the writing of another student. You are on a mission to succeed, so don't get caught up in the words of someone else. You can easily lose yourself in the writing of another and miss the point of this assignment.

Write an outline of the paper before you begin writing. This will help you to know what to put in your paper and how your paper will fit into your course. It is important that you make sure you read your outline, in order to make certain you are on a sound topic.

If you would like your paper to be published in the school newspaper, you should follow the instructions your teacher sets out, though, including an assignment outline and information on the type of paper you are expected to submit. Your teacher will likely inform you of what paper to choose as well, and that paper will include a brief writing sample for you to follow.

Write an outline for your assignments, or get a sample paper to analyze for some ideas. You must first think about the question you are answering and the paper format. Writing that helps you organize the thoughts about your topic is important for writing a successful paper.

You may find that the internet can be quite helpful in learning about different methods and strategies for writing a research paper. There are many websites available that you can search for specific answers to research project problems. Always be aware of how reliable and",1
"Summary: Jordan opens school doors to all Iraqi children, regardless of refugee status. Principal says her school is 20 percent Iraqi this year. Education minister: Iraqi kids will be incorporated into ""mainstream"" life. One student says he lost five family members in Iraq. Article: 

This news summary is adapted from an article written by the author.

You should be able to recognize this type of news summary – this is what I teach my journalism students, what I give in my journalism courses, and what I assign in my own classes. You would know this summary as the basic news hook, the central theme or ‘hook’ that should emerge from any news story. While each news story will have a different ‘hook’ to be a hook is a common element you should all look for.

“Your job is to go out in the world first figure out what is the central issue or issue that most people care about. It’s not a great story on the price of gasoline. Then, find some way to make that into a great and interesting piece of writing.” – David McCullough

The news hook – news story summary – is a critical element. A story without a news hook is a story without purpose, without meaning and without impact. A story without a hook has little resonance, because the message does not connect with audiences. While many elements in journalism form the basis of news hook, two of the most universal ones are lead and news hook (summary). A story should be based on what readers care about and then, in some way make that central concern appear to be a newsworthy element. It is the hook that allows readers to find the story within the news.

Jordan open doors to many Iraqi children

Principal says her school is 60% Iraqi this year

Education Minister: Iraqi-born students will be incorporated into mainstream society

One student says he lost five of his family members in Iraq

Jordan opens doors to many Iraqi children

Jordanian school principal says her school is 60% Iraqi (News)

Principal of an Iraqi school in Amman says 60 per cent of her students are immigrants, and a further 20 per cent Iraqi, after the government’s decision to allow them to attend public schools in January.

“Jordan has one of the lowest birth rates in the Middle East and the number of Iraqis coming into the country and enrolling in universities has been increasing, and this gives [children born here] a chance to gain more cultural heritage by meeting real faces from their home countries,” said Fadia Jabbar, principal of the Baghdad-born High School, which currently accepts both Iraqi and Jordanian children of both sexes for the primary nine-grade school.

In a telephone interview, Jabbar spoke about the school’s plans for the Iraqi students to help them “integrate” into ordinary Jordanian society.

“We plan to celebrate Iraqis’ and Iraqi-Jordanians’ cultural heritage” through music, dancing, cuisine and other activities, Jabbar said. “We’re not an Arab school… Jordanians and Iraqis are living together and they need an understanding each other,” she stressed.

Jabbar said she sees no difference in the school’s policy for Iraqi and Jordanian students.

“We do not distinguish between Iraqis and Jordanians and no Iraqis have been expelled from the school for having committed a crime,” she said.

This article has a great deal to say about the role of “integration” in the contemporary Jordanian culture. While integration is the word used, rather the Jordanian culture is “ancient.” This is the Jordan of the past; Jordan of before the influx of Iraqi refugees. An integral part of what has been built here is the Jordanian education system. Since before the 1920s the education system has been designed to “integrate” people. It has always been about bringing people together. It doesn’t matter what race, religion or creed, to be part of Jordanian society is about “intimacy.” It is about sharing and getting comfortable with people who you might not see too often, if ever.

“Our classrooms are places to get to know everyone, places to understand our country’s people and to teach children to love their country,” said the principal.

A 20 per cent increase in Iraqi enrollment has already taken effect in the coming months due to the government’s decision to let Iraqis enroll in elementary schools to help them “integrate.”

At the time of the article the number of Jordanian children registered at the Baghdad School was a little over 4,000, and the number of Iraqis registered was around 3,500, according to government statistics.

An examination was carried out to determine the amount of ammonia in a well which was pumped regularly (on a monthly basis) to prevent souring. The levels of ammonia were too high to be considered normal and had to be treated. A survey was carried out to investigate whether there was a relationship between rainfall, runoff and the levels of ammonia. It showed that there was a positive relationship between rainfall, runoff and levels of ammonia in the well.

"Summary: Congo rebels blame Rwandan Hutus for attack, report says. Internally displaced Congolese flee as rebels attack government troops. Torrential rain makes refugee movement difficult. U.N. refugee agency: Some 375,000 have been forced from homes in past year. Article:  Congo’s government: Rebel forces use civilians as porters. Rwandan government denies involvement. U.N. refugee agency: Attacks, abductions, rapes are continuing. Rwandan government is accused of supporting rebels. Rwanda denies supporting rebels. Congo government says Rwandan President Paul Kagame is a ‘‘terrorist.’’

Do all U.N. refugee agency officials say that?

Is it possible to interview a Congolese refugee who left Goma a month ago, or a Rwandan person who left Kigali about two months ago, and that their stories should be reported accurately?

What would the story look like if the U.N. refugee agency’s officials were asked to comment on Rwanda’s behavior during the conflict, and Rwandan media sources were used to support the allegations that Kagame is a Rwandan terrorist? What if you took Rwandan government leaders at their word and concluded that they support the rebels?

This story of the Congo and Rwanda in the aftermath of the conflict is difficult to report — and very rare when it comes to Rwanda. The situation has been made so confused by the war’s many players that truth telling has been difficult. The following story attempts to untangle the events and explain the truth behind the war — which is being waged not in Congo, Rwanda or Burundi, as is often reported by the media, but by the United Nations.

In the war’s aftermath, many of those who fled the conflict returned home. ‘‘Many of the refugees have now come home,’’ according to the report.

‘‘A major problem for these returns has been the poor condition of roads.’’ While the roads have improved, the returns remain very difficult; with hundreds of thousands of Congolese who fled the conflict returning home, many others have become internally displaced.

‘‘The international community is working actively to support IDPs, but much remains to be done.’’

‘‘The UNHCR [the United Nations refugee agency] has identified that about 1,100,000 IDPs have returned from camps to their local communities,’’ it said. As of Dec. 12, 2012, 375,000 refugees crossed into neighboring Burundi. Many Congolese ‘‘in the south-east returned to their home areas. Many people living in Goma began to return home with the road conditions improving, and with help from UN agencies and many local community organizations.’’ About 130,000 IDPs have been admitted to camps in the northwest, according to the report, while ‘‘over half a million IDPs remain in northern Kivu (the Democratic Republic of Congo) and South Kivu (Democratic Republic of Congo).’’

The war’s toll on Congo is difficult to fathom, it said.

‘‘The impact of the [Congolese] armed conflict on the lives of some 8.8 million people is catastrophic,’’ the report said. ‘‘Some 2.5 million Congolese have been internally displaced to become IDPs, or they remain refugees in DRC, Burundi or Uganda.’’

‘‘The conflict has impacted the lives and livelihoods of most populations,’’ it added.

‘‘Most of the more than half a million who have left the territory have chosen to do so by crossing into Congolese territory.’’ Those leaving have not gone into Rwanda, however.

‘‘There is evidence that some of those who fled have been caught by Rwandan soldiers as they attempted to cross the Tanzanian border crossing Kacyiru,’’ the report said, ‘‘and have been held by Rwandan forces.’’

‘‘As many as 2,900 have reportedly crossed into Burundi and about 1,000 into Uganda,’’ it said. ‘‘A total of 2,600 remain detained. The numbers of people detained and being held at the border has not previously been publicly reported and is the subject of investigation at this stage.’’

‘‘In many cases, the Rwandan army does not always respect people on the Congolese side of the frontier,’’ it said, adding that ‘‘this has resulted in the forced detention of [people] while they",1
"Summary: ""Wine Library TV"" Internet show has about 40,000 regular viewers. Show takes irreverent look at wine business. Wine consumption has risen in United States for last 15 years. Article:  Last year was record year at U.S.

In January we started a new webcast titled ""Wine Library TV,"" (see link on right side). We will be airing each Thursday on internet webcast and Youtube channel at 6:30 pm Eastern Standard Time, and then repeat Sunday morning on our Youtube channel at 10:30 am Eastern Standard Time.

Today I want to share with you my perspective. I am a big proponent of taking advantage of social media, in order to have mass-market penetration of information/experiences. For this reason, I am a Facebook/Twitter/MySpace etc. junkie!

With that being said, how do you get those people to your company's Facebook page? For example, we get about 14 comments per week, if you break it down - they are all at least 5 friends off! They are, as I said, junkies. I want you to understand that those are the people you want to target. How do you get them? Well your first stop, as I've said in the past, is to use one of the free social networking tools like MySpace or Facebook to get the people, but this is only 1/3 or so of the population. In the second category, you try to get them there by asking your friends that they like you on Facebook to do a friend request. There is a problem when a Facebook page is not linked to a website - it's like a door without a lock. You need to tell Facebook that we are a legitimate website and that your fans can come visit us.

How can you know what people like me have for a favorite restaurant? Here is a good answer, because we have all been there and we all know a good place when we go. We are asking you to take our word for it: write a review.

This is a simple formula and if you are in our market, you know the value. We are a social networking and web content management software company that offers social networking solutions to small and large companies.

What was the main reason for that move? We received some negative press, with no real negative impact to the company yet. It’s called a preemptive strike, and is often used by companies when they foresee trouble on the horizon but still make a point to move before the problems hit.

After reading all of the responses, it looks like the company should have moved sooner. I was surprised to see this negative response since I always know the company will eventually rise out of everything, but the damage was already done. I think now, they’ve already set themselves back too far to make anyone think twice about their business.

Another problem was that their competitors were using this news to take marketshare against them. Even a company as great as Microsoft could not escape this issue…

They’ve always been extremely cautious with online marketing, which is probably a natural approach given the high levels of customer fraud and scams they’ve experienced over the years online.

In 2006, however, it appears they’ve realized that they need to make an aggressive move, given their recent problems.

Some major problems and questions:

1) Why did they wait so long to act on Facebook’s recent change, which I’m sure they had foreseen?

2) Will they be able to fix these negative press images by moving more aggressively and sooner?

3) How much revenue is lost by not having access to Facebook or MySpace.

4) Where do they think that their product really belongs? At the end of the day, will this move be too little, too late?

The company has several strengths:

1) The company was a winner from the start. They weren’t trying to break new ground. They were good at what they did: they made great software that made people’s lives better.

2) They are very passionate about their product and its value. I think they just got caught up in the excitement of social networking and forgot (like I did) that they have a real competitive advantage.

3) They have a very devoted customer base of people who are really ready for social networking.

4) Their product works. Their customers have all said that it’s the easiest product they have used.

5) They have a small team. This keeps costs down but they also work very hard.

The main problems are all tied into the second question above. If only 1 person would have said no to them, they would have been fine. It’s when several people say no that it’s a problem. They may be working",1

"Summary: Italy win 2-1 in Scotland to secure their qualification for the Euro 2008 finals. The result means Scotland cannot qualify and will now finish third in Group B. France will also be reaching the Euro 2008 finals after the result in Glasgow. Article:  There are more details available here.

A quick note for those of you who will be unable to watch the match: This is a match involving a group of friends so I know that our timezone differences can play a part. For this reason, I will not be monitoring this page live - but I will check in during breaks and after the match to check who wins.

As I'm writing this, we're just over half an hour in. The first chance we have of knowing whether Italy or Scotland win in the first half was when the scoreboard was updated on this page with the scores in. At this point, Scotland have led 1-0.

The first goal of the match arrived at 2'21'' when a deep cross from Roberto Donadoni was headed home by Francesco Totti. Scotland replied in the 34th minute, as a headed ball into the box made its way between two Italian defenders, through an open gap and into the path of Gary Caldwell a few yards from the penalty spot - and the Scotland man put it away!

The game was really going at this point. There was a general feeling that Scotland must now win by one goal, but a penalty for a hand ball and a foul for a foul on Donadoni - both given against Scotland, made the score 0-2 to them. A chance for England was wasted though, as they sent the ball long when a throw-in was heading their way. This was quickly followed by an Italian corner which was headed away by Scotland's goalkeeper. Five minutes later, they were level.

Caldwell nodded the ball into a huge space on the edge of the Italian box, and it deflected off a defender for John Ruddy to tap home. Two minutes later, there were cries of ""Ruddy, Ruddy, Ruddy"" from the Scottish support, the goal came against, and Ruddy was sent off.

Caldwell came back on with some of the crowd's support. The referee blew his whistle in celebration and the Italian players looked relieved - it seemed as if they had been hoping that they could score the winner in the final minutes of the match. A minute later though, there was a penalty to Italy as Tommaso Rocchi was tripped in the box. Rocchi converted the penalty kick - and we were back level.

It was now in Totti's second half. It seemed as if an extra minute had been added as the Italian fans could be heard screaming ""Nessuno finisce di vederci manco"" (no one finishes the match). This was followed by England being unable to clear the ball, and a low shot from Andrea Pirlo was pushed out by the goalkeeper, and Italy took a 2-1 lead. Not to be deterred, the away support still sang: ""The sky is falling, the sky is falling"". Some of the players were certainly looking at the heavens.

The rest of the half was fairly scrappy, Italy and Scotland both looking to pass the ball about. Totti was having a good game, showing some great skill, and he was well supported by Pirlo, Giuseppe Rossi, Claudio Marchisio and Daniele De Rossi. Unfortunately for Totti and the rest of the Italian team, Scotland found their feet better throughout the half. A chance for Ruddy to put them into the lead fell to Stephen Pearson after he was played through by Chris Killen. Pearson sent it high and wide.

When the half was over, we were able to see if we would win it. There was the odd, desperate shot from the Italians, with the Scots' goalkeeper doing well, but the score remained 1-1. Ten minutes into the half of stoppage time, Italy thought they had earned a penalty at the other end and Donadoni was sent off for handball. At this point, the two managers were arguing with the referee, and even had a little scuffle. There was no real impact though, as the ball still went out of play.

The Italians missed a chance in the last few moments when Donadoni was replaced by Domenico Criscito. Two minutes later, we had a goal. I hadn't seen this coming, as I expected it would be a penalty, but the ball was headed in by Giuseppe Rossi and he passed it off to Criscito who hit it into the empty net.

The end of the match brought disappointment for the Italian fans: They did well to support such a good team. They had really bought into the match and were really getting into it. They must have had the chance of a European finals' place in their sights",1

Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday.

In the days ahead, we will be working with the government of Azerbaijan to implement alternative plans to achieve the diplomatic functions critical to our bilateral relationship at its intended scale.” Russia, Iran and China remain the top three sources of U.S. oil imports, as the oil industry recovers. The Saudi Oil Minister told media that that the world supply is at risk: “If the oil crisis doesn’t pass, the whole world could hit a wall.” U.S. crude oil production is forecast to reach a record 8.0 million barrels a day in 2010. The Wall Street Journal reported on the global economic crisis on Monday. The United States’ fiscal deficit is nearly $1 trillion in the current fiscal year, and the federal government is running a deficit for the first time since the end of World War II. President Obama ordered the Treasury Department to sell $35 billion of U.S. Treasury debt on Monday in an attempt to avoid a taxpayer showdown over the $1.2 trillion budget deficit. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that there is a “very high probability” that the U.S. will not be able to balance its budget by the deadline of 2012, though the President said that he’s “pleased” with the progress of deficit reduction. The President is expected to sign a budget on Tuesday that will reduce the national debt over the next 10 years by roughly $4 trillion. Oil prices hit their highest point on Monday since 1973. On December 17th a fire ignited during drilling operations at a well in the Russian Far East. Shell, who owns the well, said that the fire was put out the following day, but on December 22nd the well ignited again and was stopped. Reuters reported that there were three people missing. Russian President Hubert Ouahouda said that the well is pumping oil at a rate of 50,000 barrels a day as well as natural gas. There is concern that a new Siberian gas pipeline could reduce Russia’s gas exports to Europe. The North American Energy Partnership (NEP) announced an $11 billion natural gas export project in Russia in November. Some of the gas will go from Russia to Europe and the rest will go to Asia through a proposed pipeline across Siberia. The pipeline will pass through the United States. The Economist and the Financial Times are also predicting that gas prices will rise in the long term. On Monday the United States, Canada and Mexico signed a trade agreement that will create the largest free-trade agreement in history. Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper said that the agreement will create ""thousands"" of jobs. The agreement will be effective when it's ratified by all three parties. The European Union said on Monday that they would use a new law to regulate the financial sector after the European Court of Justice said that it was illegal for a company such as Morgan Stanley to conduct business across a number of their countries. The EU did not specify which type of financial service would be affected by the new regulation. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said that the agreement will “give momentum to the global economy,” and U.S. Treasury officials said that Japanese investment will contribute to U.S. growth.

Says shopping for wedding dress is ""grueling"" Article:  experience. In interviews says she doesn't need or want her own kids one day.

I used a different approach this time:

Summary The star of the hit movie Knocked Up Katherine Heigl just released a statement announcing that she’s set to marry actor and former 'Friends' star Joshua Jackson. The two have been dating for five months. She says they both feel as if they’ve known each other for life but they were only introduced months ago. In an interview recently, Katherine spoke about her feelings about having her own babies. She says she may or may not be ready to do so.

Use:

1. Katherine Heigl and Joshua Jackson will marry in June
2. Katherine Heigl says she feels like she’s known Joshua Jackson for life
3. She says he’s also known her for life.
4. He’s been a constant force in her life.
5. They love each other deeply
6. “It was a good match.”
7. “It doesn’t matter whether I get engaged at age 50 or at 24.”
8. “At some point you want to be in a relationship that’s serious and you want to know he’ll be with you forever.”
9. They got engaged in September
10. “I got a beautiful ring.”
11. She also said she’s not ready to have a child – either today or soon.
12. Her engagement is for life.
13. She met Jackson in Los Angeles while shopping for a wedding dress.
14. “Now I feel like, yes, I was looking for a dress, but I was also looking for a man.”
15. “It’s almost too much to buy a dress, but shopping for a ring is harrowing. I look at a dress in the window and think, ‘I’ll be miserable in this dress,’ but when I go to the jewelry store and I look at 10 rings and I’m like, ‘I’ll never pick!'”

In the next hour or so I’m going to be writing the synopsis. I figured it was easier than writing the actual articles. I’m going to use: “Knocked Up”, “Katherine Heigl”. The word “knocked up” because its one of Heigl’s catch phrases from the movie and “Joshua Jackson (ex “Friends”)” because of what the synopsis will be about.

Using a different approach is good though. Its good to be careful.

(Katherine) Heigl has one of her own

On the cover of People, Heigl looks absolutely stunning in a silver grey Armani. Under its headline “I’m knocked up,” Heigl opens up about her first wedding since then-husband Tom Green.

“I went through so many emotions,” she says. “I wasn't sure he wanted to get married again either. It was a good marriage, but it was a good marriage for four years. We had both grown and our relationship had grown. It just didn't click for me for four years, so it felt like an opportunity for me to find other people in my life. You can find a million wonderful men out there, believe me. But there was not one who stood up and said, ‘She is who I want to marry, and we are going to have a family.

“I felt very happy and relieved when I found Joshua (his real name is Joshua Jacob Jordan),” she continues. “You can't be together for four years, not even four months, and just not click in the end. I think it’s good to know when a relationship isn't ready.”

Jackson and Heigl have been dating about four months, and Heigl says they both view life in a way that’s different from what most people envision.

“I'm a work-a-day girl. I've had a career since I was 18,” says the actress, who's busy shooting the new Charlie’s Angels film in New Mexico this week. “So I have to plan, I have to think, ‘What's next?’ And I can't be selfish. I'm married, and if we are meant to be together, then that's what should happen",1

In 1996, a San Francisco man sexually abused at least 12 boys in Vietnam and Cambodia. At least four of the victims have committed suicide, one victim was a boy with a disability, and one was a boy who had escaped from his abusive home.

The man is now serving nine months at an undisclosed placement facility in the San Francisco Bay area. According to authorities, the victim, who identifies himself online as a Buddhist, is believed to have used the names of Vietnamese monks in online messages to recruit victims. Authorities were aware of two websites that the man used to recruit potential victims. One site was in French and the other in German. The online photos of the man were posted to at least four sites that are listed with the U.S. Copyright Office. The photos showed the man in a variety of sexual positions with several teenage students. One photo was of the man performing oral sex on an underage boy and was posted on Sept. 30, 1995. Another photo of a teenage boy lying in bed with the offender was first posted on Dec. 28, 1995. After he was convicted of committing lewd acts with a minor in October 1996, investigators found a photo in which he was apparently having sex with two children in a room in the middle of the night. The photo's caption read, ""Night sex!"" The man was an elementary school classmate of the victim's family.

Law enforcement authorities believe that the victims were lured with money or promises of help from friends of their family, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In 2001, after the attacks were made public, it was believed that the man was having sexual relationships with younger boys in Cambodia who had fled their homes to live illegally in the U.S. One of them was only 10 years old. His case went unsolved for four years.

The man's name has not been released because he is a juvenile.

His attorney, Jeff Chiesa, said it was likely that the man was the victim of bullying.

""He was targeted by other students in his school, specifically because of his background and he was the victim of harassment,"" Mr. Chiesa said.

In the original case, the man was originally charged only with one count of lewd conduct against a minor and one count of possession of child pornography.

""At the time I was just happy to be charged,"" the man said.

He was charged with three additional counts in 1997, after his release from prison. Although the victim, the man's family and Mr. Chiesa said no one wanted to press charges, they were afraid of the community from which they came.

""My father was not willing to do anything because he didn't want to stir up the Buddhist community,"" the man said. ""There were all of these threats. My mother was worried about how she would be treated. I know when the police showed up looking to talk to me, my mother was in the house and she had to hide.""

In 2004, the man's lawyer, Mr. Chiesa, was approached for help in the investigation of three young males (ages 12, 14, and 15) who had been sexually abused by the man. In December 2004, he was contacted by a former coworker, Richard K. Tull. Mr. Tull, who had been a classmate and a friend of the victim from the San Francisco Unified School District, had been working with the California Department of Justice during his time in prison and had identified the man.

The victim was not prosecuted at the time because he was a minor. The charges laid against the man in 2004 were for four counts of lewd conduct with a minor from 1997 when he was a minor. He was charged with three counts of lewd conduct with",1
"Summary: Reuters was founded in 1851 by Julius Reuter, transmitting market quotations. The company was first in Europe with news of President Lincoln's assassination. Today Reuters has 196 bureaux serving approximately 131 countries. Article:  It claims 40,000 people work on it at the headquarters in London, and its worldwide web site, has over 600 news stories at that moment. ( http://www.reuters.com/ )

An article, based on your research, will be written to include the
latest information on the topic.

1. Reuter's history

The London-based multinational business news network called Reuters was founded by Julius Reuter in 1851 and incorporated in 1862, with one of his sons as chairman. Julius Reuter, who is often identified with the name of the company, was a successful stockbroker and was among the founders of the German national newspaper Allgemeine Zeitung. They were, however, not the first. An Amsterdam-based trader Johann Eduard Rheinberger and Carl Rungius were already transmitting news from Europe. The information was transmitted not only by news, but by telegram. (1)

2. The creation of the corporation

The next step which was taken in Reuter's company included the organization of the news reports. First, the news was transmitted over telegraph lines to printers in Germany. These were then published in the paper. (2) Later, the company also began to relay the news over landlines which were built and owned by Reuter's company. (2) It continued to grow in importance. (3) At the time, Reuter's company was the most important in Europe.

3. Julius Reuter (b. 1815 m.1874)

Shortly after the death of Reuter's father in 1837, Julius took over control of what little property he had. He managed a banking business. He entered into the stock market and started buying and selling. With his earnings from the business, he founded his company in 1851 (Reuter's company). In 1852, they also launched a first telegram to Berlin using a ""receiver"" of Reuter's company, who was working near the German capital. (4) It was already a pioneer company due to its early incorporation and in 1866 it was granted the prefix ""Reuters"" by the German media.

4. Rheinberger, Carl Rungius and the London Times

By 1830, the German stock exchange had a certain reputation. As in 1842, a new company was created to trade with the market, the Deutsche Börse. (5) The two founders of Reuter's company did not take part in the process. Rheinberger and Rungius founded the Telegraphic and Telegraphic Exchange in 1845. This one also had a telegraph service. The company also published the news in a newspaper. The exchange in Zurich and other European capital cities followed.

This exchange was also connected to a British company which began to be the leading newspaper. The Telegraphy Times was founded by the printer William Bulmer in 1855. (6) He was later joined by his brother. The two brothers had to get involved in politics to keep the financial success. After the success was achieved, they continued it to the detriment of the newspaper. The Telegraphy Times was sold in 1862 and the owners went bankrupt. (7) The British government invested 10,000 pounds in Bulmer's company. At first, it also published letters between Berlin and London. In 1858, it took over the newspaper ""British Times"". In 1863, Bulmer bought the ""Westminster Gazette"" and it was renamed the ""London Gazette."" In 1864, the ""Telegraphic"" was added. Bulmer, who took an interest in the Berlin to London telegraph line, was later appointed as the manager of the company. The British connection lasted until 1968. (6)

The British journalist, Francis Place, used the name Reuters in 1794. It was derived from Reuter's company. For a time, the company was based in the London area. For a while, Reuters provided news reports on stock prices from London and from Paris. (8) Later, it worked mainly in London and was located in the British capital's Stock Exchange after it was built in 1965-66. The building is located at Reuters's current location in City Road.

5. London's capital city

In 1846, the city fathers decided to invest in the London Stock Exchange. In the United Kingdom, all major financial capitals also invested in the capital's companies. The stock exchange was opened in 1848 by the Queen. A financial newspaper, the London Stock Exchange Gazette, was founded in 1847. It came later under the ownership of Robert Fleming. It grew so that by 1852 it sold 80,000 copies per day. Later, the paper became the organ",1

A house fire at the home of owner James M. Smith was suspected of being intentionally set Wednesday afternoon, Feb. 6, when the six University of South Carolina students, who were staying at the home, were found dead of smoke inhalation.

(Article continues below)

The deaths of the seven USC students, who are all in their 20s and from the Charleston area, were first reported 10 minutes after the fire was reported at 4:16 p.m.

At 4:36 p.m. on Feb. 6, the official cause of the fire at 471 W. King St. has been released to the coroner.

The house fire began at 3:24 p.m. and firefighters quickly extinguished it.

Mayor Debbie Smith said Thursday, that she did not think the fire was malicious.

""We don't think that anything was set on purpose,"" she said.

Smith also said that one of 11 firefighters at the scene was treating a family member of the owner of the house.

Smith said she had not talked to the family member but was told that the family member had injuries, and they were not expected to survive.

Smith also said that another firefighter was being treated for smoke inhalation at a hospital.

According to Smith, firefighters had received several reports about suspicious characters in the area early into the day.

""From the time the first fire alarm was tripped until the fire was brought under control were about four hours. During that time, there were a number of persons of interest that were investigated, many of which were cleared of any wrongdoing,"" Smith said.

James Smith is the owner of the house and is president of John's Cleaning Company, which provides commercial cleaning services.

Investigators are continuing to collect evidence and determine the cause of the fire.

No one involved in the fire has been identified.

Summary: In late May, thousands of troops returned to Iraq following a four-month absence. With their arrival, some sections of Baghdad experienced quiet—at first. Security patrols, and the city's streets also were quiet, and the workers who had returned to the capital reported a rush to reopen businesses. But over the last several weeks, the calm has been disrupted, sometimes violently. An assault of a major Shiite pilgrimage center in the city of Karbala in the northern part of the country turned into a deadly series of attacks throughout the city. A bomb exploded at the entrance to the National Insurance Building. One more car exploded near the US Embassy, injuring two US soldiers and the US Consul in the area. Later in the month, a US soldier was killed near Karbala while attempting to recruit Iraqis into US Army battalions. More than 300 Iraqis had been recruited but were told they could not serve because their papers may expire between now and the start of the US Army's 2006 Iraqi recruitment period. The US military said it was halting the recruitment entirely because of safety concerns, as a result of the continuing violence, which leaves some Iraqis doubtful they will return.

There were still some security pockets in western and southern Baghdad that were calm at best, but violence in the capital did take a downward turn in the first half of May. In Baghdad, violence in the capital in the period from mid-January to late April was at its worst in 2006; according to the Iraqi Human Rights Ministry, 758 Iraqis died during that period as a result of violence compared to 583 in the period of January to April 2005. The figure represents a fall of 394 (54%) when compared to the period beginning January 2004, but the ministry warns the figure is probably an undercount. During the first two weeks of May, violence in the capital city was very sporadic with only two reported major attacks; one car bombing at the entrance to the National Insurance Building that killed 11 Iraqi workers and the shooting of two US soldiers at the US embassy that left each of the soldiers with two gunshot wounds. A number of large attacks of limited scale occurred in the capital within several days between mid-May and early June, however. In Baghdad on 21 May, three women were killed in a car that exploded in the street, the first violent death in the capital in May. A car exploded at the entrance to the National Security building, another at the headquarters of one of the security companies",1
"Summary: White truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road near time fire started. Charges filed against man who allegedly set small fire and walked off. Catalino Pineda one of five arrested in arson investigations this week. Arson investigations continue across multiple California counties. Article: 

How many of these answers are plausible?

A.1.2.3.4.5.1.1.1.6.7.2.

2.""Two men are being held on suspicion of starting a small fire in a grassy area between Highway 41 and Santiago Canyon Road, just east of Lakeview Parkway, and then removing their shoes before fleeing the scene Friday morning before fire investigators arrived to examine the spot, which has burned and smoldered since March 31.(Daily-News [San Bernardino, California] - 11.16.2017)

This news article is about an arson investigation that began on a Friday morning, on a Saturday, on a Sunday, and on the Tuesday and Wednesday before it was closed by the news media on Wednesday morning.

When was the day the fire was set in 2017 compared to other days since the year was created?

1797(A.1.2.3.4.5.1.1.2.6.8.3.1.1)2.

3.This is the one that's easy! When the fire was set in 2017 compared to other years in the newspaper's records of fires.

1797(A.1.2.3.4.5.1.1.2.6.8.3.1.1.1.1.)5.

4.One of the charges being filed against the accused arsonist was arson of an outbuilding. This means that the offense was committed by starting more than one small fire, or by starting a fire or causing it to burn in a large area.

There were probably a lot of fires set back in the year of 1797 in the United States that were set or caused by arsonists. In the month of July, people were setting fires to clear brush away from farms, and the people who started the fires were generally never caught.

When was the year 1797 created?

1797.

How many of these answers are plausible?

A.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.6.8.3.1.1.2.

5.) One of the things that was done after the fire was started that caused the fire to spread was that the investigator put out a red ""hot fire"" flag to warn of the danger. The investigators were hoping that the fire would eventually stop burning on its own.

The investigators were asking the public if they had seen the suspects, or if they had seen anything out of the ordinary over the past few days, and then trying to find out what they were doing around the fires they set by talking with nearby residents. The investigators were also trying to determine whether additional fires were being set and whether anyone was trying to burn down a house.

The ""hot fire"" stands for fire that is very hot in the grass near Santiago Canyon Road between Highway 41 and Lakeview Parkway, where on Friday, the sheriff's department called for the San Bernardino County Fire Department to extinguish the burning on a large expanse of dry grass by a red fire flag that had been stuck into the ground to warn people away from the grassfire.

When all five arrests took place and the investigators were at the location making their observations, they saw someone in the area where they were looking, and they realized that he had a large pile of ""hot"" firewood on his shoulders.

The investigators, led by the Deputy Chief of the San Bernardino County Fire Department, had arrived on the scene with some kind of small, handheld fire extinguisher. When the person saw the group of fire investigators approaching, he ran away, into the nearby brush, and was apprehended when the team pursued him.

The man was taken into custody by San Bernardino County Sheriff's Deputies, and then handcuffed.

What is the news article above trying to tell readers?

A.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.6.8.3.1.1.2.3.)1.

B.The investigators found a large, dry pile of kindling or hot, flammable firewood next to the dry grass where it was originally started, and the person who had the pile of hot firewood on his shoulders had set the pile there on Friday around the same time as the fire started and had fled when the investigator appeared. This is why the investigators had called in additional fire personnel to the scene and asked the public for any information.

If you've ever read a mystery, a murder mystery is a story that takes place in the present day, often in a modern city or town. A reporter or a detective gathers information about the case and attempts to work out who committed the crime.

  2. **Who does the book belong to?**

Your publisher has written a book by a particular author. This is a good starting point. For example:

    * _Crime and Punishment_ (Fyodor Dostoyevsky)

  3. **Who is your favourite detective?**

A lot of people would like to become a detective. Some famous detectives include Sherlock Holmes, the world's first professional detective, and Dr Watson. They don't get a lot of help though. If your favourite detective did get some help from other people, find out about them. Who were they? Were they famous? What did people say about them?

  4. **What is a detective?**

In crime fiction, a detective is a professional person who solves crimes. In other books, a detective might be used to mean someone who investigates something, or a person who tries to work out what was happening in a situation or mystery.

Most writing books tell you to write about yourself. That's fine if you have other things to write about too, but it's good to let your readers know a little bit about you too. Make sure to write a **WORD COUNT**** for your news article. If you haven't done any for a while, you'll need to make a start by doing a sample article **WORD COUNT****.

UK intelligence chief says children as young as 16 and 17 are ""involved in supporting or taking part in the preparation of terrorism"" around the world.


*

The article summary (Source article for the title only)

At least 2,000 people in Britain who pose threat to security MI5 chief said the actual number could be double that. MI5 chief Jonny Evans said the intelligence agency had the highest number of suspected terrorists against whom there was an operational lead since September 11. A total of 16 were being investigated after a review by specialist counter-terrorism officers. He said MI5 and counter-terrorism officers were ""not close"" to identifying a core al-Qaeda cell operating in the UK. But the threat from al-Qaeda in the West and UK-trained and -inspired radicalised Islamists was ""undoubtedly"" the most worrying. Ms Evans said the majority of cases were low-level, but those who pose a serious threat are ""involved in supporting or taking part in the preparation of terrorism"". She also warned there would continue to be high risk from UK nationals returning from the Middle East and North Africa. Home Secretary Theresa May refused to say whether she thought UK-suspects were involved in terrorist plots. But she said the numbers had fluctuated in every year of her 10-year tenure, and that ""people who are genuinely involved in carrying out terrorist acts in the UK are on the police and MI5 watchlist"". Ms May added that she ""could not guarantee"" that terrorists could not enter Britain during her tenure. Ms Evans' remarks came as a London-based security service, understood to be MI6, said up to 30 children had travelled to Syria or Iraq to support the fight against Assad. Children as young as 15 had been radicalised while ""under the gaze and touch"" of British adults who provided them with money and the belief that they did not possess the same rights as adults, according to a report from one of the country's leading counter-terrorism experts.

Navarrette: Opponents See Hispanic Immigrants as Weakening U.S. ID? One town demanded all library books be in English, Navarret says. Hispanics the latest to find themselves at center of culture war.

By Jose A. Navarra

9/23/12

Opponents see Hispanic immigrants as weakening U.S. identity. One town demanded all library books be in English, Navarret says. Hispanics the latest to find themselves at center of culture war.

An online petition created in 2008 and signed by more than 1,800 towns across the country, and now making news in El Paso, demanded all library books be in English. It's one of the more outlandish examples of resistance to more diversity, to say nothing of the latest in a series of examples of how Hispanic immigrants have become the center of the culture battle raging in this country.

I don't know why the U.S. Library Association thought it a good idea to accept the petition. I do know that once the association and I learned about it, a call to the library was made from El Paso. Some of El Paso's most educated, sophisticated adults thought such a thing had merit. The petition said: ""We demand, request, and implore that all books, pamphlets and magazines which are purchased with tax dollars, be read only in English.""

The idea behind it? We are a nation of immigrants who have enriched this country, said the petition's creator. We want them to assimilate. Assimilation is the backbone of the melting pot, a melting pot that has become quite a thing.

I read the petition, and it made no sense. It never does when people get their hands on these things before me. First, because when more than two people are involved in a conversation, there is always someone who believes the point",1
"Summary: A Mauro Camoranesi goal earns Juventus a 1-1 draw with leaders Inter Milan. Argentine striker Julio Cruz had given injury-hit Inter the lead in the first half. The result maintains Inter's unbeaten record and moves them two points clear. Article:  A successful summer for former Juventus coach Marcello Lippi.

The Summary

Juventus won the Serie A title last season, but not without incident. Top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a broken nose in the first round of the Champions League on his debut for the club. Ronaldo was injured in a tackle from Manchester City centre-back Matěj Vydra at the start of the first half of Juventus's season opener. Juventus have finished in the same position every season since 2001/02 with the exception of last year, so the season's aim will be to keep the club's hopes of the league title alive for another season. Manager Marcello Lippi has a reputation for attacking play and an abundance of attacking talent. However, many critics have suggested he relies too heavily on Ronaldo and not enough on other creative players.

Inter Milan are competing in their third season in Serie A under new coach Lippi. They have been in excellent form in the competition and were only two points behind Juventus last season before the latter's title win. Coach Lippi arrived at the Milanello stadium having had spells at Parma, the national team and Parma and is expected to take the side in a new direction, having recently signed talented midfielder Nesta. Former Juventus and Italy midfielder Daniele Bonera now plays for Inter and has a track record of strong form. Inter opened their title challenge with a 3-2 win at Udinese, and then beat Napoli 4-0 with a brace from Adrian Mutu as well as an own goal. However, they lost 3-0 away to Inter and missed the chance to equal Napoli's record by drawing with rivals Roma that could well prove vital to their eventual title challenge.

Team News

Juventus have lost Cristiano Ronaldo to a broken nose with a slight fracture. Ronaldo was caught in a tackle from Manchester City defender Vydra in the first half of the opener. The Serie A champions were also without striker Alessandro Matri, who was replaced by Antonio Cassano. Inter star forward Javier Pastore was unfit for the Italian Super Cup and missed the cup of cup tournament.

Matchday Summary

Juventus's Ronaldo is back. The Argentina forward is a key player for his country and has missed the opening matches. However, he has now been back in training for several weeks and has come through a tough test while on the sidelines. A new centrepiece for Inter Milan, Nesta, has signed the midfielder and has impressed in pre-season. ""In my mind he is a key player,"" said former Juventus and England centre-back Alessandro Del Piero. ""He is quick, intelligent, he has a beautiful left foot and has great control."" Although he is not yet in great condition, Nesta has plenty of ability and will be vital to Inter Milan's title hopes. While Juventus play the second leg of the Coppa Italia semi-final against Parma on April 30th Juventus can't play the top two sides in the division. ""If we play Inter who are there, and Fiorentina, we have a difficult draw,"" said Juventus boss Marcello Lippi. Although the Champions League has been an issue in the past, the new ban introduced last year ensures that it is not a concern. ""It has been in the papers, but our focus is more on the domestic league,"" said Lippi. ""We have to be realistic."" It is a tough call to decide who is the best player in European football. Ronaldo is the undisputed top scorer, but also a poor goalscorer in Serie A while Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is scoring almost on average a goal a game against a more defensive style of football in the Premier League. Juventus have made a statement of intent with their first goal in this season's competition against Parma. Ronaldo's goal has brought some much-needed cheer to a Bianconeri side which has looked a shadow of their 2015/16 Serie A winning self in the early part of the season.

In the US? Write an article that compares the political situation in each of the following countries: Finland, Sweden, Venezuela, and Sweden.

1. Finland. In 2013, Finland elected a new president, Pekka Haavisto (pictured left). His election was the second time in three years that the government had been forced to deal with the threat of a new protest movement. Previous movements, including those by anti-immigration parties, had been unsuccessful. Before and after election, Haavisto had made a string of anti-immigration comments.

Haavisto is not alone. According to a 2013 study (PDF), Finland has one of the most anti-immigration parties in Europe.

In 2013, a coalition of conservative-liberal and social-democrat parties formed the center-right government, led by a center-left Social Democrat (pictured right). This time Haavisto was part of the center-right coalition.

But in November of 2013, the coalition broke down when the Social Democrat party and the liberal Alliance party joined forces to oppose further immigration.

On the day after the coalition fell apart, riots began in and around Helsinki.

2. Sweden.

For more than a decade, Sweden has been considered a paragon of modern multiculturalism.

According to a recent study, Sweden has more immigrants, both legal immigrants and refugees, than any other country. At a population of 10.8 million, 12 percent of the people in the country are immigrants or foreign-born residents.

During the 2010s, Sweden experienced a surge of terrorist attacks across the country. Most of the attacks were linked to Islamic radicalism; many of the attackers were recent immigrants. In 2015 alone, there were 10 deadly attacks in and around Sweden.

In the latest attack, which occurred in November 2017, a terrorist drove an SUV into a group of people in Stockholm, killing four people and wounding about 15.

The attacker is reportedly from Uzbekistan.

During the 2014 and 2016 elections, Sweden experienced massive waves of protests.

3. Venezuela.

The US economy is struggling. Unemployment is high. People have lost their jobs. And President Donald Trump blames immigrants for the lack of new jobs.

On top of this are the problems in Venezuela. The country that used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters is now suffering from hyperinflation of thousands of percent and a collapsing currency.

After four decades in power, Hugo Chavez's (pictured left) government is now headed by his successor Nicolas Maduro (pictured right). It has also faced an economic meltdown.

In 2009, the government imposed a financial freeze on hundreds of private companies and individuals associated with the opposition.

In 2017, inflation reached 1.6 million percent. That's why Venezuelans can't buy basic goods, such as baby formula, medicine and diapers. Instead, they eat pasta and rice.

People flee Venezuela for fear of violence; according to the UN, around 2 million have left since 2015.

Since 2014, dozens have died during anti-government protests. According to Reuters, government estimates put the death toll at 70, although independent estimates are around 100.

After Chavez's death in 2013, his wife and daughter also left the country.

"Summary: Documents say after suicide attempt, Jeffs repeatedly banged head on cell wall. Transcripts say Jeffs confessed to ""immorality,"" said he is not ""the prophet"" Jeffs' attorneys say he has recanted statements. Jeffs due to be sentenced November 20 on accomplice to rape charge. Article:  A copy of the transcripts shows Jeffs said he wouldn't lie.

Jeffs was seen by prison mental health professionals last year for ""thought problems,"" they wrote in a memo to the state Department of Corrections.

On March 14, 2008, Jeffs was found in a prone position in his cell with bloody scrapes on his face and head, according to the memo. He told the nurse that he had been beaten that day by ""unruly brethren"" but refused medical attention, according to the memo. He ""stated that he was suicidal,"" and would harm himself, the memo said. Nurses gave him a sedative and left.

In September 2008, Jeffs told a nurse that he had been in a fight -- but when he tried to demonstrate his injuries, he couldn't, he said.

After the alleged sexual assaults, Jeffs did not seek medical attention, according to the memo, which was written by a prison mental health consultant.

In January, ""Jeffs stated that the beatings [were] from the Prophet,"" because he didn't obey his instructions, the memo said.

After suicide threats in September and October of last year, according to the memo, Jeffs admitted to ""immorality,"" said he was not the Prophet, and that he did wrong in sexually assaulting the 15-year-old girls.

Jeffs said he did try to commit suicide because he didn't want God to get angry with him.

""I think God will make it right,"" Jeffs said in a ""prepared statement,"" according to the memo.

When a nurse asked whether he wanted to see a psychiatrist, he responded that he wouldn't sign anything.

The memo said Jeffs was diagnosed ""with conduct disorder"" and that psychiatrists had ""concerns about his mental stability.""

Prison officials tried to call Jeffs' family on Feb. 26 to discuss his history of psychiatric problems but couldn't get through.

In an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune on March 5, Jeffs' father, Merril said he didn't know about his son's suicide attempts since 1998.

In a letter to the Tribune on Thursday, Merril said his son has ""for the last two years (has) been a well-adjusted productive member of society.""

Merril said he's never received documentation of his son's prison visits and didn't know whether medical staff tried contacting him.

He said prison officials contacted him earlier this year, but told him they were investigating the case.

Jeffs was due to be sentenced on the two counts of accomplice to rape charges in 2nd degree felony cases that were filed in March. The sentences were also to run consecutively, so he would be sentenced to about 25 years in prison.

Jeffs' attorneys asked the judge, Don Wilkins, to not sentence him because he was mentally unstable.

But Wilkins said he would only allow the defense to delay the sentencing so they could find another judge who would consider the circumstances.

Jeffs then took responsibility for the crimes, and he also admitted that he was a ""bad"" person, Wilkins said.

The maximum sentence for the crimes is only 25 years, but it is the ""maximum within reason,"" he said.

The judge said Jeffs' testimony helped the state and it would be considered because he helped prosecute other cases, Wilkins said.

Wilkins also said Jeffs' testimony would also help the state for purposes of his accomplice to rape charges in 3rd degree felony cases.

On May 17, Jeffs was indicted for rape in 3rd degree felony cases by the Cache County grand jury.

His attorneys still are trying to get a mental health evaluation to support their argument that Jeffs should not be sent to the Utah State Prison.

They argue he doesn't get enough medical attention while he's there and is being denied therapy, psychiatric drugs, the right to have personal property and visits from family.

They have asked that his sentences be suspended since this was his first serious psychiatric incident. But the judge denied their request.

In a case that some are calling the largest prison scandal ever in the history of the Utah prison system, documents obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune reveal that a state hospital in St. George was asked to test 15 male members of the FLDS polygamous sect, the Tribune reported March 13.

The FLDS had been convicted in Texas of sexually assaulting children born of plural relationships with men and married women who have left the sect, the newspaper reported",1

Lewis Hamilton's lead over Fernando Alonso in the world championship was cut to four points after the McLaren team-mate's victory in Shanghai. The championship head-to-head record was level after the race. Fernando Alonso took victory during a race of two stops, leading home world championship rival Kimi Raikkonen in the second Ferrari. Meanwhile, Red Bull's Mark Webber's hopes of making up the points deficit to teammate Sebastian Vettel in the world championship looked less and less likely with Webber retiring from the Chinese GP with suspension problems.

""It's a small mistake and for sure it will affect me a little bit in our championship fight to lose so much points,"" said Alonso on his victory. ""We know Lewis well, from last year in Barcelona he finished second and he was a lot stronger than this year so we know that he's not going to give anything. We know that every race he can make a mistake or be a little bit weaker but in the end he's going to be stronger, and that's why I am confident we can challenge for wins."" Alonso insisted that his team's second place finish was not a result of their qualifying pace. He claimed that they had been expecting a second-place finish. ""When you expect everything, you are still confident,"" he added. ""You are in the fight and trying to be quick, and if you are that's enough and it's not a big difference, you can still beat the competition but we are still in a championship battle now so",1

I. INTRODUCTION

According to the news sources cited below, on Thursday March 9th, 2011 two bombs exploded in the Algerian capital, Algiers, as the Algerian government was having a meeting with other European countries to discuss ways to combat al Qaeda. A series of explosions occurred at the U.N. headquarters in Algiers, Algeria. At least ten people were killed and about a dozen were injured. According to the Algerian government, a total of 76 people were killed. Algerian officials blamed the bombing on the al Qaeda terrorist organization. President of the United States called the attack on the Algerian government a terrorist attack.

II. BACKGROUND

Terrorism is a serious and growing security threat around the world. It is one of the biggest problems that modern societies today have to face. It is a growing problem even in countries that have peace and security. Terrorism is defined as a use of violent action to change the political and social environment. It’s goal is to alter behavior, usually politically or economically, in order to benefit the terrorists. Many people claim that it is a response of a oppressed group of individuals seeking to rid themselves of the injustice or government tyranny that harms them. Others believe that terrorism is the act of one individual that has no connection to the broader organized group.

For many years the world has been faced with the issue of terrorism. In recent years, it has occurred very frequently within western countries. Within the last week or so, some of the highest profile terrorism attacks in the history of the world were launched against the world’s largest industrialized democracies.

III. EVENTS OF THE LAST WEEK

U.S. - A series of blasts hit a number of public places in Boston, Massachusetts on Boston and three other bombs were left at the Boston Marathon site near the finishing line on Patriot Avenue. Some of the bombs detonated and killed 3 people and injured some 300 others.

Algeria - According to the Algerian government, on the morning of March 9th, about 8:30 in the morning, two bombs exploded at the U.N. offices in the suburb of Algiers. According to the Algerians, the bombs, planted in trash containers near the U.N. building, exploded at about 8:30 AM. Six people were killed and thirteen others were injured. About 50 to 70 Algerian officials had gathered at the U.N. Building to discuss ways to combat al Qaeda. According to the Algerians, twenty-seven of them were killed. Of those killed several were Algerian ambassadors of other nations that are not involved in the Arab Spring.

According to the Algerian military, another bomb had been planted in a different location nearby. That bomb exploded after officials walked away from the U.N. building. Six foreign service staff and three Algerian guards have been identified as having been killed immediately in that blast. Another 17 Algerian officials are reported to have been wounded.

The explosions occurred a few miles from the U.N. headquarters, where Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had just arrived on his first visit to North Africa since the Arab uprisings broke out last year. Ban issued a statement saying that the attacks were a ""brutal and cowardly act,"" and pledged the U.N.'s unconditional support for Algeria.

Within hours of the blasts, a huge fire burned at the U.N. building. According to the Algerian government, the U.N. has since reported that at least five of their staff members have been found dead, but that some of the dead employees may have died of smoke inhalation and that at least two others were not physically injured in the explosion.

"Summary: Lionel Messi scores for the sixth game in a row as Barca defeat Atletico 3-0. Real Madrid stay top of the Primera Liga table after defeating Recreativo 2-0. Sevilla's crisis continues as they lose their four league match in succession. Article: 

Introduction

In Primera Liga on Saturday 20th November, Atletico Madrid travelled to Las Palmas to play the penultimate match of the campaign. They had won the league on the previous weekend in a 2-0 win over Valencia.

As had been the case for most of the season, things were not going their way. They had collected 17 points from their previous eight games and were only a point above the relegation spot.

Atletico's league form had seen their league position stagnate since their 3-1 win over Barcelona that had put them top at the start of October. A draw against Madrid in October had followed by a 2-1 defeat in the league cup to Barcelona.

Atletico needed a win to secure a tenth title. Las Palmas had a slight advantage as they were playing at home. However, results in Spain had evened out, with Real Madrid having lost their top four positions on goal difference.

Real had suffered back to back home defeats for the first time since 2010 as they had been beaten 2-1 by Osasuna, and then 2-0 by Valencia. While Atletico had been the team expected to win the title for some time, Real were in crisis, and their hopes of claiming the title for a third successive season were slipping away.

Barcelona had dropped down to third after being beaten 5-0 by the eventual league champions Deportivo La Coruna on the penultimate weekend of the season. On Friday 16th November, Messi scored to put Barcelona ahead in the league, but they lost the game 3-1 to Girona.

In the Copa Del Rey semi-final the first leg was ended 1-1 after a 1-1 draw had been thrown away for offside. Real were leading but were reduced to nine men after Dani Alves' second yellow card was shown correctly despite the Argentinian being onside at the time of the incident.

On Sunday, Osasuna were beaten by Depor 4-2 to extend Real's title drought to six seasons. A goal from Nacho's last minute winner meant that, despite the points gap being cut to just two, the title was heading to the Santiago Bernabeu.

After six games without a win, Real won 4-1 at Mestalla, as Madrid had now won their last three away league games at the Bernabeu.

At 3-0 down in the derby, Atletico needed a response before they went to Las Palmas.

Formation

This was the same 4-3-3 formation that had been used by Atletico for most of the season. They had the best record in Spain by a long way but they had a reputation as a counter-attacking team that was not usually known for controlling the ball and sitting and absorbing pressure.

On top of that, there were also concerns that Atletico's gameplan had been somewhat limited due to Diego Simeone being suspended for eight matches in May after his club was punished for refusing to sign a new contract (he went to Inter Milan instead).

One thing that had been clear was that this season Atletico were going to play with the ball being kept in the middle third and waiting for things to go wrong.

As such, it was no surprise that the home side set up in a 4-4-2 formation, with an overload in the centre of midfield. Atletico often played their fullbacks a little narrow, meaning that Atletico were more than happy to have the ball in the centre of the pitch.

Barcelona had not been able to match this approach but they still looked to maintain possession in midfield. Atletico, on the other hand, would make Barcelona give the ball away and try to win it back.

The same formation was adopted in the return leg. Atletico were happy to sit deep in the first half, but when Real opened the game up, Atletico sat on the front foot until Dani Alves had a shot blocked.

The Ball

Atletico had done the majority of the ball possession on Saturday, winning 66% of the ball between them and their opponents. However, most of it was a bit of quick running and a few good passes.

What stood out was that Atletico had a low pressing game. Atletico's centre-backs stayed high up, meaning they rarely pressed the ball in order to get the opponent forward.

Coutinho played a long ball down the right when Atletico moved the ball forward to the wingers. Atletico had three advanced players up but only a central player and Alves were prepared to go",1

The goal of this activity is to give students the opportunity to research a real world issue. By reading an article about one, students will find out about the issue and also acquire the knowledge and skills to use a news website to research the issue. To complete the activity students need to use the assignment link. This link can be found here: http://d1.saber.org.au/assignments/topic-research/article-example.

There are three options for the students to investigate; the second and third of these options will require the students to use the “find” feature in “Google” to provide information to the student about their chosen issue.

The second option allows students to look at one of the news channels; “CNN” or “Fox News” and a specific video. On the student’s own initiative, students will need to type the name of the video into the “find” function in “Google.” The Google box will then appear on the student’s screen and the student can then click on the video to watch it. Students will then be required to explain what their reading found out or didn’t find out and why this information is relevant to their topic.

The third option allows students to find sources of information about their chosen topics – either on an individual basis or as a whole, this option is best suited to a one-on-one discussion or small groups. Students will need to research their topic using “Google” as the “find” function is limited to a few thousand websites when searching for information.

In addition to finding out information about the chosen topic, students should research the credibility of the sources they find as well as the reasons why they should trust the information they are given.

To complete this assignment, students will need to read an article that explores one of the three options provided. The articles are linked below.

The goal of this activity is to give students an opportunity to investigate information that might not be readily available. Working on this activity also helps to develop students’ research skills. The information needed to complete this activity may not be in a student’s school library.

"Summary: Three Austin cave explorers are safe and are out of the cave, officials said. The University of Texas students went into Airman's Cave Saturday. The 12,000 foot long cave complex has tight twists and turns. Unclear exactly how the students lost their way, but cave is complex, official said. Article:  One of the explorers was injured.

""I don't care how well you're trained; you can go in there and die in a heartbeat,"" said John McCaffery, operations manager for the D.H. Burnham & Co.

What was the most memorable moment for your story/series?

A.J.: This quote from the director of caving. ""I don't care how well you're trained, you can die in a heartbeat.""

L.W.: I've never seen a cave like this. There's no lights. The rocks are craggy. It felt like I was in a movie. You hear the dripping water, and there are puddles in spots, and it's hot, and there are things in the water and in the air. It felt like a monster was watching me. I felt like I could get lost in it, that I might never be seen again. It was really eerie and made me wonder who was watching me.

C.S.: We got into the cave and were pretty much immediately stuck. We'd never been caving before, and we were told it's not for beginners — that first time it can be pretty disorienting. We thought we were in too deep, as someone kept telling us the cave could be hundreds of feet wider or narrower around the next bend. So we got a little caught up in the moment and kind of lost focus on what we'd been told. We're pretty much out for sure, but we'll never know for sure, because we kept getting lost in all of the twists and turns. The air was stuffy — there was a thick layer of mold all over the surface. I actually thought I smelled the water coming in through some of the cracks. We had no idea how long we were in there. If we go down again in the future, I plan to bring a camera with a very decent zoom. I'm going to want to start recording, just so I can have some sort of record of where we were when we went in.

L.B.: It's just so weird when the ground disappears, and you feel as though your head is about to be ripped off. It's very claustrophobic. You've got 20 people and a very well-defined tunnel with some very strange lights and cracks in the ceiling. It's just kind of bizarre.

How much did the location influence your story?

L.W.: The cave is such an amazing place. It's beautiful, and it's dangerous. I was never really sure what it had to do with the story. I'm not sure I could have made anything up that would have seemed more amazing or romantic. It was the location that gave us the story.

L.B.: You could feel the air getting thin when you entered the cave. It's more like you're on a cruise ship than you're in a cave. I think we would have been really freaked out if we'd been on a boat.

What would you change about your story?

C.S.: I wish we had had time for more than two of us. It would have been neat to have had more of a team of six or seven people. For the two of us, there was too much ""I"" going on. It was too focused on my perspective. I think I would have been a little more patient if there had been more than just me. As much as I enjoy the idea of adventure, you always have to take what you can get.

A.J.: I would have liked to have seen more of what they discovered. It was such a special place.

C.B.: We didn't hear any animal sounds, like mice or rats or owls; there were no insects. It was very clean but dusty. I was expecting to see a lot of trash down there, because caving attracts kids. This is one example where it's a bit cleaner than many other places.

How did you manage to conduct a story in real time?

L.W.: We were all on handheld radios. If we needed to contact someone, it was important that we get that message out.

A.J.: After the first night, we'd send messages like, ""I think we're stuck; the batteries are going to die.""

C.S.: As night fell and the temperature dropped, we felt the cave really come to life.

C.B.: At night, you could see a reflection of the lights from the surface. There were times when it felt like the dark",1
"Summary: Laura Bush calls on Myanmar junta to ""step aside,"" allow for a democracy. Military leaders must give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people, she says. Junta should release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders, she says. Her rare foray into foreign policy was published in the Wall Street Journal. Article:  [5]

In other news, a US court ruled in favor of an illegal immigrant, who had been repeatedly arrested for shoplifting, had the case dropped against him. The illegal immigrant and his girlfriend were ""arrested for first time in 17 months after taking the same merchandise through a store's checkout counter multiple times"" and were given ""a suspended sentence"" instead of ""criminal charges."" [6]

Laura Bush will make her ""first public appearance"" today, ""just shy of her six-day visit to Baghdad"" and is ""expected to promote the 'Mission for Iraqis' and to discuss Iraq. [7]""

Laura's friend Jenna Bush-Wyman, the sister of Bush 41 son Marvin, called to invite herself to a lunch for women to support ""the women of Iraq"" and ""to discuss the Iraq situation."" [9] When Laura Bush heard about the lunch she told Jenna Bush that ""she'll have to come because I'm not much at talking to women. But I'll try to work on that though."" [10]

Laura Bush's husband was ""proud"" to announce the birth of his and Laura's first grandchild, Eli, on December 27. [10]

Laura Bush had lunch with her mother. [11]

According to Laura Bush's sister, Mary Matalin, Laura's ""favorite book is The Kite Runner"" and that she's read it ""so many times before."" [12]

Laura Bush's sister Dorothy will join her mother for Sunday brunch. Mrs. Bush had brunch with Laura at a hotel last Sunday too. [13]

Laura Bush may speak publicly the first time since returning from Iraq last week for a speech today. The White House is saying ""no announcements or announcements about the trip will be made."" [14] An unnamed White House official said, ""She will also be talking about Iraq. Not Iraq and terrorism in the days ahead because there's been a lot said."" [15]

Asked Thursday, Mrs. Bush said that she ""can't take"" anymore questions about the war in Iraq, or about whether or not she has ""been working at the President"" on the question of the war, or ""whether the media really wants to know"" about that stuff and would ""never answer in the affirmative"" if she did. [16]

Thursday afternoon (December 3), Laura Bush was asked by a reporter about her husband's request for her to say, ""the White House has learned from the tragic loss of life in Iraq, that the 'hardening of society' is not what is desired if Iraq is to be stable. What is the White House's plan for dealing with the 'hardening' of society?""

Laura Bush said those ""questions"" were ""not questions in any way about the Iraq decision.""

Laura Bush said that the ""responsibility"" to ""fix"" Iraq is theirs. She said the ""responsibility"" now ""belongs to them,"" the Iraqis. She emphasized that the security ""now can be provided,"" the ""responsibility"" for which they now have.

Laura Bush added, ""I just am, honestly, frankly, confused by the hardening of society. And the things that we know are important to do,"" she said. ""I'm not sure exactly what the questions are meant to be. I said I had a very hard time trying to answer that, and I would try to answer them as best I could.""

Asked if it might take a couple of months for the US troops to leave, Laura Bush said that it may take a couple of years for Iraq to gain the capacity, ""so they can provide"" their own security. [18]

Laura Bush responded on Thursday to remarks about America that were made during a speech she was scheduled to give to women's leaders in Washington, D.C. Mrs. Bush was in the audience during the address and she was ""not sure"" if the speaker mentioned her. The speaker was addressing the issue of women in Iraq. Laura Bush was there because of the ""Mission for Iraqis.""

The woman who spoke on the issue of women in the Iraq said that America is giving away Iraq to ""certain families and certain countries,"" like Israel who want an ""oil-rich country."" To the woman, Mrs. Bush said, ""Thank you for your comment."" [19]

""Laura Bush is not going to be on board"" with a US President who has ""moved to the right,"" to ""the right of center"" or has ""made a decision""",1
"Summary: Bush says most of Congress ""acting like a teenager with a new credit card"" Bill would have funded agencies, but also a prison museum, sailing school. House panel chairman: Bush's veto ""not responsible and not credible"" Democrats to schedule override vote, but Bush GOP allies confident about veto. Article:  House Democrats are vowing to override any veto attempt, though it is not clear how long it may take to reach the two-thirds majority they would need. Senate Finance Committee also to vote on bill.

Here is a summary of Bush's veto message: ""America's war on terrorism is not confined to the war theater. It also includes efforts to disrupt and destroy terrorist efforts that lie closer to home. These efforts can take the form of a museum dedicated to our fight against terrorism, an organization to teach our youth about our struggle to rid our nation of terrorists, even a school to introduce America's children to the heroes of the antiterror war. But the Congress acts like a teenagers with a new credit card, approving spending sprees without regard to the consequences for our Nation or for posterity. A few members of the House decided to try to score political points and force me to veto their appropriation package. Their reckless spending habits must come to an immediate end. We must not be held hostage by the same Members of Congress they so frequently attack. If they are unable to control out-of-control spending, we must be prepared to do so ourselves. For the good of our war on terror and for the good of our economy, it is time to stop the runaway spending by Congress.""

House Speaker Hastert says the bill will be passed, but it will be hard, ""There will be no override of the president. That's one thing I can guarantee is going to happen."" The House is scheduled to convene at midday Thursday. The House Budget Committee is expected to pass the same-day spending bill Thursday but have it ready to go to the floor if the veto is overridden. President Bush had promised to veto the bill. House Rep. Bob Barr said it is a political stunt. ""What they are trying to do here is to embarrass the president by overruling the veto... If you don't want to deal with the problems of overspending, you don't have to, you can just use the Constitution as a crutch... The president has done more than any president in our history."" But President Bush says the Republican's House action is ""just typical"" and ""nothing more than politics.""

In the other house, the Democratic-sponsored spending package was scheduled for a House vote. It included a separate prison museum bill, a bill to expand access to higher education through scholarships, a $10.7 billion spending bill for State and Homeland Security and a measure to keep the government operating through September.

""This is a terrible bill, so full of pork and so irresponsible,"" said House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ""The American people see it. The American people don`t believe that they need a museum to learn about al Qaeda. In fact, they don't need one to learn about the terrorists who have been attacking our country. All they need is their intelligence service to find them -- the FBI, the Justice Department -- and get them arrested.""

Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said the bill sends the wrong message. ""The only message we get this week is that our Congress is controlled by members who like to be in control.""

The spending bill passed the House 245 to 152, with 31 Republicans voting with the Democrats.
House Speaker Hastert said there will be no override, ""I think we should pass it today and it will be overridden tomorrow... All this bill does is demonstrate how out of touch Congress is with the economy. It demonstrates that every time you raise taxes... You just put our economy in a worse way and this bill demonstrates that perfectly."" The president has veto power on the bill.

Republican leaders in both houses are confident they will have the votes for their own budget bill after they pass the spending measure Thursday or Friday. The speaker said, ""We will get all our money back. We will be a law abiding member of the United Nations again.""

In addition to the prison museum measure, the spending bill included a $40 million for a facility in Missouri intended to train police and guards to deal with the mentally ill. The same amount of money will go toward establishing an ""intellectual property office"" within the Justice Department to deal with intellectual property theft. Some $24 million is slated for the operation of the federal prison museum. Some $13 million of the total comes from an additional $18 million in tax increases on tobacco and firearms.

House Democrats have vowed to override a Bush veto of the bill by a majority of the House. The Senate may also use the same override threat to approve the spending measure, giving them the two-thirds majority of both chambers",1
"Summary: France lock Sebastien Chabal cited for a dangerous tackle on Simon Shaw. Chabal faces disciplinary hearing on Monday after incident against England. Sale forward will miss the third and fourth-place play-off is he is suspended. Article:  England beat France 29-11. The Rugby Football Union disciplinary panel on Sunday is the third disciplinary hearing for the French prop since his tackle on England outside-half Simon Shaw, although he has never been formally charged. Chabal, 31, was cited three months ago for a dangerous tackle in the first round but his name was not officially sent for disciplinary proceedings. France captain Marc Lièvres, who has been handed a 10-month ban for a dangerous tackle on Dan Carter, is a teammate and former club-mate of Chabal's. France's World Cup hopes are hanging by a thread after a 31-29 loss to Australia and their fifth-place finish. Chabal was one of their best players before his controversial tackle on Shaw. With Australia in front by 29-12, Shaw had a touchline clearance from Francois Trinh-Duc to put the English side 10 points ahead. However, a moment later his fellow centre, Maxime Medard, touched down in the Parisian 22 and France scrambled downfield. Chabal tackled England's England winger Shaw from behind, and after Shaw's foot flew off the ground and he fell, referee Nigel Owens called a penalty. With half-time approaching, Chabal was sent to the sin-bin and when Owens arrived at the pitch, the French prop was being stretchered off with the injury, and Medard replaced him. ""He was knocked over and didn't get up. The referee (Owens) came over and the doctor and I (stretcher-bearers) went over to his head. It looked like it might not be serious,"" England captain Mike Tindall said. France assistant referee Tom Tierney was asked about the tackle on the touchline and said it could have meant the difference between victory and defeat. ""I don't think so,"" Tierney said.

It's one of those things where it's a matter of degree. It was a case of not quite being in the act of contact, but it was the same kind of contact I got when I was playing back in the 1980s. The incident happened in a moment, but afterwards, the referee would have seen it, he would have been aware of what had happened.

It's a dangerous tackle. He hit Shaw in his shoulder and neck area, it's one of those things where it's a matter of degree. There was just a niggle of a knee in the neck or the neck in the knee. I'm not sure, you can see it just before Shaw goes down. It was a case of not quite being in the act of contact, but it was the same kind of contact I got when I was playing back in the 1980s. There is no doubt it's a dangerous contact in terms of his health, and it's against the law as well.

I'm not sure there's any difference, he doesn't seem to know where he is. At least not the only place he can be. The referee would have seen it and he would have been aware of what had happened.

No, I still think a couple of guys from the French bench were talking to him about ten minutes afterwards because they had had an eye over at the incident. Afterwards they came back and talked to him about it. I wasn't watching the whole game and the referee didn't come over so I didn't have a go at him, I didn't think it was that big of an incident. It's a matter of degree as well. It was a case of not quite being in the act of contact, but it was the same kind of contact (I made) when I was playing back in the 1980s. A tackle like that, I don't know if you can make a definitive judgment about the neck. He got a knee in the neck, I don't know, some of his friends said he didn't hear any whistle or he didn't think he heard a whistle. There was just a niggle of a knee in the neck or the neck in the knee. I'm not sure, you can see it just before Shaw goes down. It was a case of not quite being in the act of contact, but it was the same kind of contact I got when I was playing back in the 1980s.

England captain Mike Tindall said Shaw's neck was sore at the end of the game. ""I don't think we should worry about an injury of that type, but then when it happens to you you wonder if it matters, if you are concerned about it. But if you were concerned about it in certain positions, then we would start looking very hard with injury.""

You have to wonder what happened to Shaw that day. He didn't complain. He",1
"Summary: Some witnesses say Colorado does nothing to protect them. One witness spent over 10,000 dollars on security after being terrorized. Community activist says Colorado's witness protection program is ""a joke"" Article:  and doesn’t work. Community attorney says no matter what the state does, ""I'm not scared anymore."" Colorado will take your calls at 1-866-WITNESS.

Colorado's witness protection program has always been, and still is today, a ""hot potato."" The process is long and arduous and is fraught with error. Due to this, many people have been killed, and innocent people have been thrown in jail and convicted of crimes they didn't commit. People have even been murdered for testifying. Colorado's program used to be the best nationwide. Today, it's among the worst.

The goal of witness protection is to keep witnesses out of trouble and out of harm's way. This process consists of a community ""witness coordinator (coordinator)"" who investigates the situation, as well as a team from the state witness protection unit. The team includes several ""agents,"" including an investigator, polygraph examiner, social worker, and attorney. The team conducts interviews to determine if the person is a victim of a crime or is the probable perpetrator. Witnesses are put into ""protective custody"" which is a special program within Denver County.

""Protective custody"" is a status given to witnesses who require special protection or are at risk. It takes a long time for a person to transition into protective custody. If it doesn't go well, the person may stay in jail awaiting trial. If it does go well, he or she may be given ""protective witness housing"" which is an apartment with security until it's determined whether or not they're a witness to a potential crime or an actual perpetrator.

Witnesses who testify during a trial are given a special designation under the name of ""fleeing to avoid prosecution."" The name is assigned by the court. This designation is usually something like “William Jones” or “Mary Jane Smith.” Witnesses who are protected through the witness protection unit or who are otherwise given special legal status by the court are given protective witness housing under the designation, 'fleeing to avoid trial.'""

Denver County's witness protection policy has been rewritten and expanded to a very high degree in the last few years. The policy was rewritten to address concerns the coordinator had regarding the number of witnesses being sent to ""protective witness housing."" Witnesses were being placed in these houses based on just what they looked like instead of by what was needed for the safety of the witness and the community.

According to witness advocates, ""the system is now run by bureaucrats who have the power to send a person to jail without anyone else's input."" With this change, anyone arrested for a crime can be sent to ""protective witness housing"" no matter if the crime is real or a lie.

""Witnesses are being placed in ""protective witness housing"" without anyone else’s input.""

Witness advocates have stated ""the program needs much more supervision. There are many witnesses who are at risk because they aren’t being taken seriously."" The advocates have stated “the system needs more accountability. There’s a problem with retaliation.""

Witness advocacy has also been questioned due to the lack of public information it releases. According to a recent court review, the advocacy organizations have also been very secretive about their methods of operation. However, there has been a lot of public support for witness advocacy and witness protection and there's a lot of work being done to reform the current system.

The first goal is to have the program's current procedures changed so the coordinator doesn’t have too much control over witness selection. This means the coordinator wouldn’t be taking the primary role in witness selection. Instead, it would be done through a jury trial, in which the judge would decide if they feel the witness is really a victim or is a potential perpetrator.

After that, the coordinator would have someone else, like a social worker or case manager, review the decisions made by the jury trial to see who did and didn't deserve ""protective witness housing."" The coordinator would then refer witnesses to various ""protective witness housing."" However, it would be up to other social workers to determine if a given witness needs it and how fast they can move them into the housing.

There would be no need for witness housing anymore unless the witness has committed real crimes where someone else was in danger or has done much of the crime. People would also have to be ""transitional witnesses"" who are still trying to get their life back on track due to a past crime or situation

The second goal is to have the current coordinator replaced, at minimum, with a second coordinator.

Today, about 150 witnesses are placed in witness housing per month, yet there are about 3,500",1

A new book has alleged Prince Charles has a habit of ""groping women and touching children"". The allegation came after a reporter suggested Kate Middleton, who has been involved in several charitable and political events with the prince, should check on his behaviour. Royal biographer Katie Nicholl, on Monday, claimed she wrote all the material in her book about the prince - which was released earlier this year - after meeting him for coffee on the day of Princess Diana's funeral.

An inquiry was launched to investigate whether MPs' expenses were illegally claimed. Claims by two Conservative politicians were investigated after complaints from the public. Lord Woolf, former deputy prime minister, admitted he may have been ""misleading"" after he was billed for £6,500 worth of champagne and cigars. In a separate inquiry, former Labour minister Paul Rowen, who went to university in the 1990s with Labour MP Fiona Mactaggart - whose claims were later investigated - was told not to use Commons claims forms.

Sir John Armitt (56) has been appointed as the head of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. He will take up the role on October 1, replacing Michael White. Armitt has served in various director general positions over the last two decades, including four years as national secretary of the Liberal Democratic Party. He was director general of NATO's Military Committee, responsible for all alliance military-related activities from 1993 to 1994.

A government report could recommend the introduction of a ""bedroom tax"" for the most deprived in England. In their autumn statement, the Conservatives ruled out a tax but said cuts in welfare benefits for the less-well-off would be extended to 2013 and ""no one"" would be left vulnerable. Some councils are considering setting the age of someone considered to be homeless at 40, compared to 50 for the under-25s. A government source told the Daily Telegraph: ""There is no such thing as a free house - and if you can't afford rent in the private market, you can't afford to go without it."" Under Labour's housing benefit scheme, which was scrapped, households losing their home were able to keep as much rent as they received from housing benefit.

The US ambassador to Syria said he is not going to call on President Bashar al-Assad's regime to step aside. Robert Ford met senior Syrian government and opposition aides Monday. US experts say there is no way Syria could have used nerve gas inside its own borders. The evidence ""clearly implicates"" Mr Assad's government, the US ambassador told the BBC World Service. He added the US did not think the use of a chemical weapon would be the last.

The BBC should show more black history events on its programmes, the chief executive of the Royal Television Society has said. The Society is calling on the corporation to show more black history and culture events as part of its education and diversity programmes. A study found that in the 2001-02 BBC2 drama series EastEnders, there was a single appearance for an ethnicity other than white in a period of eight years.

The head of G4S has spoken out against plans to sell a £90m house the group bought on the outskirts of London in 2010 - a move critics say will leave the company at a disadvantage. Richard Brindle told a Commons inquiry into G4S's role in the immigration and asylum system that he had been advised to sell the building, but said he had refused to sell after hearing the buyers also wanted to turn it into an office building. ""Because the buyer wanted to turn the current use into one of offices I've not agreed to it,"" Mr Brindle told the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee.

London mayor Boris Johnson has made his first intervention into a key planning debate on Monday, saying if Britain is to remain a global city, Britain must remain a global city. During the debate at the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA) in Chatham House on the future of the City of London, Johnson said that Britain could be ""cut off by sea"" politically, economically and financially and so needed to ""step up"" its global profile.

Lord Mandelson has taken the lead in an attempt to secure support in his fight against the Daily Telegraph and to get rid of the editor-in-chief. A Labour peers' committee has raised concerns about the treatment of Peter Rippon, the Telegraph Group's deputy managing director. He is believed to receive one of the highest salaries in British newspapers.

According to the Associated Press report on the Republican presidential debate in Cleveland, the moderators ""shied away"" from asking the candidates for their positions on immigration, as well as their immigration plan.

In the opening question of the debate Tuesday night, CNN moderator Anderson Cooper asked the candidates, ""Will undocumented immigrants, will they have a path to citizenship?"" (See: Marco Rubio On Undocumented Immigrants: Their Path to Citizenship Can Be Reached Via a Pathway To Citizenship)

For the third debate in the past five weeks, the Republican presidential candidates will not use a podium, but will instead share their stance via a webcast.

In the second debate on October 28, the moderators used the ""town-hall"" format, where the candidates faced questions rather than moderators asking the candidates questions in ""stump speeches.""

The question of podium and question were key questions in the town-hall format at the second debate.

""I've had the experience of having some of the hardest-headed people in the Republican presidential candidates, and I think having a podium is a good thing. And I think it allows people on the stage, in a more natural way to speak to the American people. We're all pretty good speakers in our family, and in our neighborhood,"" former Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell said during the Republican debate on October 28. ""I think it's a mistake to take away the opportunity for our candidates to speak to the American people."" (See: RNC Chair Reince Priebus, Debate's No Podium: ""You Can't Ask A Child How's His Kid's Day. We Don't."")

Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said he felt the questions were ""appropriate.""

""You're asking questions of candidates who haven't been asked questions in over two months, and for a good reason. You know why? Because before we started this campaign, I said, 'Look, there are two things that are important: This is the presidential campaign. And the other thing is, when candidates face an audience, they speak more. They reveal a more human face, and they'll get stronger. The people that go to a podium, and talk to an audience, they get stronger and the people go, 'That was a good answer.'""

""Look, I was there last time on those podiums, and I was more comfortable standing on those podiums than I was standing up here. So to me, the podium doesn't matter because I could do either one the same, and the questions were appropriate.""

"Summary: YouTube questions address taxes, the Bible, abortion, gun control. Giuliani, Romney, Huckabee spar over immigration. McCain challenges Paul over suggestion to bring troops home from Iraq. Nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate; 2,000 more than Democratic debate. Article:  All candidates have 10 minutes for questions; first three have five-minute blocks between each. Other candidates who get on stage may also ask questions.

A:

As written, this question is asking you to reword the original statement into a more grammatically correct and succinct sentence, while retaining the meaning(s).

Question about the YouTube debate 

The following is a rewording of that question, using your edit with modifications to rephrase the statement as a full sentence (with one of the sentence's most commonly used subjects being altered for a less commonly-used subject, and the two verbs in the first line are changed so they are in the progressive as opposed to the simple tenses - there would never be a need to use different tenses to express the same notion of movement) and one change that improves readability:

What are your top five YouTube questions for the candidates?

The answers you're looking for in this case would revolve around your question of what you've written now in the question statement. Your answer should also explain why you think this is the most relevant question for the candidates. It should also focus on any major policy issues these questions address. Of course, you need to include at least one question about abortion and one question related to gay marriage for any candidates who say they support these issues (it's an irrelevant question, as these issues are not related to YouTube as far as I can tell, but the questions need to be written anyway as a matter of consistency) in addition to the general themes of taxes, the Bible, and gun control.
This sort of editing is really all you should be doing here, so you can probably just copy/paste the rewording into your answer at this point.

"Summary: More than 1,000 freed detainees reportedly keep pledge not to rejoin insurgency. U.S. general tries to reassure Sunnis that detainees face no abuse. More than 80 percent of detainees are Sunnis. U.S. airstrike kills 13 suspected terrorists west of Baghdad. Article:  Al Qaeda still active in Iraq’s Sunni Arab heartland despite recent efforts to quell violent attacks.

This is part of our daily series, On the Record, where we invite the people of the world to send us their thoughts on issues of importance to them.

As we go through each entry, we’ll give you a chance to respond in the comments section at the bottom of each article. For information about how and when to comment, please visit our Community page.

On a personal note: I’m going to keep this one short, as there’s not much more to say about it. And as the article notes, there have been an endless number of promises and pledges in the Iraq war — so let’s all just agree that nobody’s actually ever lived up to them. I personally think they’re all bunk and should never be taken seriously, but that’d make a great topic of discussion anyway.

From what I’ve heard, the “1,000 detainees” are going to be freed within the next few weeks. I was under the impression that the U.S. military had already started to release the detainees. I suppose this will take place in conjunction with the fall of Iraqi forces from Anbar province.

My feeling after this operation is that the insurgents will now make a move to seize power in that area. I’m pretty sure the insurgents are now confident that Anbar province is safe as far as the coalition is concerned.

I think we now know why the insurgents didn’t make a move to seize al-Fallujah — they never really thought they could hold the city. This is their chance, and they’re taking it — the question is whether they can actually seize power in Anbar province despite the fact that the Shiites have already lost most of the power they had there.

I don’t think we, as a people, should be surprised at all. When I was back in the UK, where the insurgents made their biggest gains during the Awakening, there was a lot of coverage that I hadn’t heard before — as well as what I had heard before.

I think the insurgents now know that their chances of success in Anbar province are nil, which is why they’re doing this now. I think the surge has left them in a pretty good position, but they would have been in a better position had more time been spent in recruiting Iraqi security forces.

In other news, U.S. soldiers shot and killed 13 suspected Sunni insurgents west of Anbar, apparently during a raid on an al Qaeda safehouse in Waziriya. This is a serious blow to the al Qaeda movement in that province, and I think it makes al Qaeda nervous about their stronghold there.

The U.S. military is working hard to try to quell violence, especially since the Shiite militias are starting to get their power back. The Shiite militias could be in Anbar province before long, after the Iraqis surrender. The U.S military is doing a good job in its attempts to prevent that from happening.

I think in the long term we’re in big trouble, and it can’t get much worse than this right now — al Qaeda is starting to become the dominant political and ideological movement in that region of Iraq, especially after the U.S. forces were able to leave the province.

The U.S. forces did finally retake Fallujah. This was something the Iraqi military had wanted to do for some time, but they needed the help of the U.S. forces to give them the opportunity to do so. I think they’re going to be working hard to ensure that they never lose the provinces of Anbar and Mosul, because that would enable the al Qaeda forces to completely dominate the rest of the country. These are two provinces that were once very important to the coalition forces. Now they’re the provinces that are vital to securing Iraq’s future.

In Iraq and at home, the U.S. is still trying to decide which version of the surge it wants to follow and implement. It’s a question of what kind of policy it wants to adopt in the months and years ahead — and it’s no easy decision. We’ve seen that the surge isn’t entirely working yet. It’s going to be a difficult decision for the U.S., and there’s no way to know how that decision will work out. As I noted in the other article",1
"Summary: Mary Winkler convicted earlier this year of shooting her husband to death. Winkler served time and was released; the couple had three children. The children live with their grandparents, who oppose visitation. Winkler has not seen her children in 15 months. Article:

18. What are people saying about the incident?

A murder case. When a husband who had been abusing his wife over a two-year period shot her to death during a fight, authorities said the motive was not money or any drug or alcohol problem. Instead, family members tell 20/20, the homicide was a case of ""overcompensation.""

""He couldn't get any satisfaction out of beating her and leaving, so he finally just snapped,"" said Mary Winkler's father, Jerry. ""If we know how he's been with her, we are absolutely amazed at what happened.""

When Mary Winkler was in high school, her father Jerry and mother Joan had a bitter divorce and a drawn-out custody dispute about the couple's three children, 13-year-old twins Kristin and David, and 8-year-old Kimberly.

At the time, Jerry and Joan Winkler were barely friendly to one another.

""I was always worried about their safety,"" said Jerry, ""especially when I found out the kids were spending the night at Mary's mother's house. You're always worried about what's going to happen.""

Jerry and Joan Winkler were finally divorced in 1992, with custody of Kimberly going to her father. But the couple got back together a year later, remarried, and Jerry moved his family back into Joan and Mary Winkler's house.

Four years later, Jerry got a job offer in Minnesota. Joan says in the years that followed the family was happy together again.

""I felt that I always knew Mary would come back [to us],"" Joan said. ""If she did have a problem, it wouldn't affect me; she would have come to see us. I was a mother, and she would have come to me if she had something to say she didn't want her parents to hear.""

Despite that closeness, things between mother and daughter began to sour in the late '90s.

""I kept wondering 'Why did things happen? Why can't it be a perfect place to live?' "" said Joan. ""But Mary was so hurt by my asking about what went on and her wanting to be left alone with her daughter. I just wasn't asking the right questions. I knew we couldn't ever live the way we used to again, so it took me a long time to come to the realization it was over.""

"Summary: GEO-TV president: ""It seemed very obvious that they were going to do this"" Order comes on the request of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. GEO-TV and ARY Digital offer varied programming, including news. Both networks transmit from the United Arab Emirates. Article:  It seems to have come in response to complaints by Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf over what has been described as biased coverage by ""western"" media. Musharraf said he had not been able to change the coverage of the election period.

The content of this question as submitted by an examinee is as indicated by the following news report:

On Saturday, a team of GEO-TV and ARY Digital journalists, both based in Dubai, were summoned by the Pakistani Interior Ministry and Pakistani government officials to the Foreign Office in Islamabad, and there made to sign a document stating that both media organizations would cease to be biased and their reports would henceforth be fair and objective, according to a GEO-TV press release. In October, GEO aired a special on Pakistan's recent history, including several positive and negative statements about the United States. Musharraf charged last month that the network was biased.

He told the press that the coverage in their news program was not being fair to the Muslim community and had not properly reflected Islamic values and how the U.S. was perceived in the country.

Although President Pervez Musharraf gave no reason why he sought Pakistan's complaint about the coverage, one commentator saw the move as ""a sign that the United States was not sufficiently understanding of Pakistan as one of its closest allies and its strategic location.""

The Pakistani Government has complained to the United States at least twice that its ""western"" news outlets were favoring a candidate or party in this month's election.

Pakistan's Interior Minister, Senator Nasir-ul-Mulk, said Friday that ""our channels should be fair to everyone else, to the government, the candidates, the political parties, and the people of Pakistan.""

He said the Interior Ministry has asked GEO-TV to ""reform a way of reporting in which it shows a proper position that should reflect the Islamic values of Pakistan.""

As part of the agreement with GEO-TV and ARY Digital, the Interior Ministry is asking for a monitoring unit of experts from Pakistan, or from other countries, to review coverage of recent elections in Pakistan. Senator Mulk asked that the experts' report be ready by May 31.

In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States is concerned that the elections have not been free and fair and will be closely watched by the international community.

Boucher added that on the part of US officials, there are reports of the media being ""sorely biased. ""

Musharraf was due to meet American Senator Richard G. Lugar Wednesday in New Delhi to discuss the election. Mr. Lugar is also chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Musharraf's office said he will be discussing with Lugar the progress of the election and the role of the media.

Mr. Lugar's spokesman said Lugar was hopeful that Pakistanis' desire for reform would lead to a government that will represent all the people of Pakistan in the election.

A BBC story by Jonathan Beale (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6348948.stm) also reports the new guidelines:

Islamabad was unhappy with the results of the first round of polling in the general election last month and had complained to the US that GEO had been unfair. The US embassy in Islamabad has suggested that Pakistani broadcasters make a list of news items, put an equal number of each one on screen and then have them edited so that all the items reach the same length and are equally covered.

Pakistan has also asked the US to stop airing the BBC World Service and Voice of America radio stations, it has been claimed.

The US broadcasters are worried about their licences being revoked if they broadcast from inside Pakistan.

But the Pakistani government says the two stations are biased and must stop broadcasting in the country.

Officials say the move to ban their transmissions is retaliation for their earlier complaint about the GEO election coverage.

The Pakistani government's media regulator has set up an advisory committee to try to resolve the problems with GEO and ARY, the privately financed networks, with both broadcasting from Dubai.

But if the US broadcasters refuse to stop, the government plans to block radio waves in a part of the country where the stations operate.

In a move that could be seen as an attempt to placate GEO, a statement was issued late on Wednesday from the company's chairman to the effect that the channel's objective was to provide balanced news and views.

"Summary: Fire Department spokesman: 14 have been taken to area hospitals. Firefighters still fighting hot spots Wednesday afternoon, official says. ""It's a hellish inferno,"" he tells reporters. Article:  ""All of a sudden, people start pouring in."" Rescue workers are trying to cool and stabilize the victims.

Summary of article:

The number of dead has risen to five, Fire Chief Anthony J. Coogan told reporters, while 23 are still missing. Officials said those numbers can change as firefighters continue to fight the flames.

The dead were found in a basement in three- and four-story buildings that had wooden siding or other combustible material.

The fire caused an estimated $12 million in damage, Coogan said.

Coogan said that no sprinklers had fired at the fire, but that the fire burned too quickly for them to be an effective defense system.

""Nothing's really working against it,"" Coogan said. ""The fire is too fast, there's really not anything that can stop it. It's almost impossible to put it out.""

A building collapsed in the middle of the night on Thursday as two men went for a night swim in water-logged downtown Detroit.

The pair were in the water around 11 p.m. and ran from a fire in the building near Livernois and Woodward. The building, which burned through Thursday night, was a popular restaurant.

Police called it ""staged.""

Cops arrived, but one of the men, John ""Fonzie"" Kinchen, got the jump on the cops and headed for his car, Detroit Police Sgt. James White said.

He had been on probation after pleading guilty to an arson charge in 1992, White was told by a police source.

But the source said the conviction was for a $1,000 blaze in 1997.

The fire burned through three buildings in a neighborhood of row houses in downtown Detroit, and the two-alarm blaze was still burning Friday.

The cause of a fire that gutted three downtown Detroit buildings, killing four people, is believed to be arson. Fire officials say they are keeping an open mind as they probe the origins of Thursday's destructive fire in the heart of Detroit.

""It's been determined it is arson,"" said fire inspector Robert Scharron. ""We're working on the cause, and we can't say more than that at this point.""

The fire, which gutted a house, business and restaurant just feet from Michigan's Capitol building on the west side of the city, started in a building at 2427 Plymouth Ave., the fire department said.

The fire started Thursday about 7:30 p.m. and spread to the former Lazy Dog restaurant at 2542 Plymouth Ave. It then extended to 2429 Plymouth Ave., near the Detroit River, where a second building and a business were damaged. The third building was located at the corner of Plymouth and Grand River.

Four people died in the blaze, and 23 escaped unhurt.

The deceased were found in the three buildings between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. Friday at about 8:10 a.m. At that time, Coogan said the fire department believed the fire was under control. It would be up to investigators to determine the origin and cause of the blaze.

""We're not going to speculate at this point,"" Scharron said. ""The investigations are ongoing by the Detroit Fire Department and the Detroit Police Department.""

The fire department said it had two dozen firefighters on the scene and that a medical helicopter as well as several other departments from Lansing to Ferndale were assisting.

The chief of the fire department said the investigation likely will take months as his staff reviews hundreds of hours of video.

At 11 a.m. Friday, a Detroit police officer, who was helping at the scene with Detroit police arson squad and a deputy fire marshal, directed The Detroit News to a two-story house behind the restaurant, where he said he had spotted smoke coming from the second story.

It was there, said the officer, that investigators discovered a charred body. It was recovered from a crawl space in a concrete foundation about 4 p.m. Friday with the help of a fire inspector and his dog.

At around the corner, a building with heavy smoke pouring from it was evacuated and firefighters were at work trying to contain the blaze.

On the opposite side of Plymouth Avenue from the burning restaurant, an adjacent vacant building was also engulfed in smoke. At the same time, firefighters were battling the blaze at the Michigan Bell building at 2248 Washington Blvd. and were working to stop the flames from crossing Woodward Avenue to a third building also vacant.

Michigan Bell had two large generators nearby that were not damaged, said police spokesman James Ritchie.

"Summary: Death Penalty Information Center: 42 people have been put to death this year. That's down 57 percent from 1999 level, when 98 inmates were executed. Figure partly due to states questioning the constitutionality of lethal injection. Texas leads the nation in executions this year, according to DPIC. Article:  Texas says it needed the legislation because of its drug restrictions. (767 words)

This essay has a purpose to show how the use of the Death Penalty and Capital Punishment could provide a measure of control in the management of law-breaking in a democratic society. The Death Penalty and Capital Punishment provide law enforcement with a certain set of rules to enable them to use a punishment commensurate with the crime committed.

The Death Penalty

The Death Penalty

According to the Criminal Code of 1961, the death penalty was to be the punishment for the worst crimes, murder, treason and aggravated rape. The purpose was to prevent crime, as no one would want to see an innocent person executed. However, since that moment in history, crimes are getting more complex. The development of new technologies and new ways to commit murders has allowed more people to use more means to commit crimes than in the past.

The increase of the number of offenders and the increase in the number of violent crimes have also increased the number of deaths linked to these crimes. The Death Penalty was introduced to deal with crime rates that were very high after a certain period. People began to feel more comfortable with the idea of making an example of those whose crimes were so dreadful to the society that they should die.

However, crime rates have gone down since the death penalty was introduced. Today, there are no specific murder rates in Canada or in the United States, a period without a substantial increase in the number of killings. The trend is for the Crime rates to go down after the introduction of the Death Penalty and Capital Punishment. According to ""Moloch: The Seven Curses of God"", a study done by criminologists James Alan Fox and Matthew Engel, most murders do NOT decrease in numbers after the introduction of the Death Penalty. However, other violent crimes increase because of the deterrence created with the Death Penalty on offenders. The reason for this is that those who are aware that they will be treated more harshly after committing a crime are more likely to refrain from doing it.

Capital Punishment

""Moloch: The Seven Curses of God"" study mentioned before revealed that violent crimes increase and crime rates fall after an increase in the number of executions following the introduction of a new system. Capital Punishment is different from the Death Penalty. Capital Punishment is the punishment of death without trial. Capital Punishment can take the form of the State giving a convicted person the sentence of Capital Punishment and putting him to death. But other forms of Capital Punishment are also available in Canada and the US.

According to ""Moloch study"", Capital Punishment was used in Canada mainly to kill convicts who were given the longest sentences when an increase in the number of crimes was considered.

According to ""Punishment and Reform: Capital Punishment in Canada"", the punishment of Death by Capital Punishment is a punishment ""beyond the reach of the ordinary citizen."" In contrast, a person on the Death Rook can understand what he did and why he did. The fact that capital punishment is rarely ever used to prevent crime is not because there is not more crime and a large population in today's society. One can argue that the Death Penalty in Canada is a deterrent to crime, but this can not be proven because Capital Punishment in Canada is not used to kill repeat offenders - crimes of first-degree murder by an offender ""with a violent background or history"".

Since the introduction of the Death Penalty in Canada, there have been very few cases of Capital Punishment. This is because the laws in Canada prohibit capital punishment; and Canada as a democratic society believes that the innocent shall not be punished. Since 1994, the Federal government has banned executions in Canada in an attempt to avoid a human rights nightmare such as the United States.

""Punishment and Reform: Capital Punishment in Canada"" found that the number of cases involving capital punishment in 1991, had risen to three per year. This number has remained steady since then. Only one death has been executed in Canada since 1991, and this was the case of David R. Smith, who was convicted in New Brunswick on two counts of rape and murder and was sentenced the death penalty. It took several years to carry out. Smith chose to die by lethal injection. Smith's execution was a ""sham"" and was an absolute mistake in the eyes of most Canadians.

Death Penalty Information Center

"Summary: Scottish league leaders Celtic held 1-1 at home by managerless Hibernian. Celtic now lead by three points, having taken just six from last five games. Second-placed Rangers have three games in hand ahead of trip to Aberdeen. Article: 

Scottish Cup holders Rangers will not be caught by any team this season, despite suffering a shock one in the semi-final of this year's Scottish League Cup.

Celtic have lost for the first time in six.

They lead by three points in the SPL thanks to their 1-1 draw with Hibernian this afternoon.

The Old Firm were playing their third game in succession, after winning their first three matches.

But Rangers will be disappointed they missed several opportunities to score.

Ilyas scored after 24 minutes, his first goal for the club.

It was all downhill for Hibernian after that.

Moss kept out a powerful shot from Neil Lennon.

Celtic captain Barry Robson was left out of the squad, but Lennon said his injury was due to a ""little niggle"" and not the result of ""a broken neck"" as reported by the Herald.

Both clubs face a busy Christmas period, with four matches in 12 days.

Rangers have the home game with Motherwell on Tuesday night, and play Kilmarnock, St Johnstone and Motherwell at Ibrox.

Celtic host Ayr United, Kilmarnock and St Johnstone.

In an injury-hit SPL, I am surprised Celtic were so close to being overachieving last season. I think they still needed a bit more luck and a little more talent to be a serious competitor in one of the best leagues in the world.

As long as Celtic continue to go in the right direction and do well until the summer months, they should be fine. I believe for the most part this season they should do okay. Maybe, a slightly easier run than last season to be perfectly honest.

However, the most important thing is that they still have an excellent core of players who, after last season, have learnt so much. There have been a lot of changes and everyone is saying they want to be better. They need to look for it. There should be no complacency. As the season goes on, we can expect them to become harder as well.

I just hope they can be as resilient as ever.

At this stage of their history, the club deserves to be up there. To be in the mix with the best clubs in the world. This is what I am hoping for.

However, I am beginning to doubt if they can reach up to it. If by some miracle they do, I am quite confident they will. But it seems more like a distant dream at this stage of the season.

I am really confident that the club can win cups and trophies. We'll see.

The season has been tough for Celtic so far. It is almost as if the players are getting the hang of it.

However, the game will take a bit of time to settle if it comes off tomorrow, in my opinion.

I see the players have some very clever tactics prepared and tactics they can use. They will be doing stuff they should be doing, but we haven't seen it too often from Celtic so far.

Celtic need to take their chances. I saw something on Twitter about Celtic's best attacking team having the average possession is about 50 per cent. They need to find ways of scoring goals.

There have been some defensive lapses of late, but Celtic were not the greatest when they did concede goals.

I don't see any panic on the players front of me. I think they are playing some fantastic stuff.

What I can see they lack so far is a killer touch. They sometimes try to play their way out of trouble. They play the game in a more negative way.

But for the most part, they are playing some great stuff in the final third. It is getting a lot of the ball down to the players. I think it showed in the recent defeat to Dunfermline that they got it right.

The way the league looks right now does seem a bit of a three-horse race.

It is so tight. It could easily be four or five.

There will be plenty of games until the end of the season, so I am hoping they will get some reward. I don't see the league being won at this stage of the season. I see it being decided in the summer.

However, when we do finish for the season, then we will have a proper view. I would like to say I think they will finish in the top three but I think that is a bit of a stretch.

It is very tight",1
"Summary: Some see connection between the Bible and Interstate 35. Believers pray by the side of the highway, which runs through six states. I-35 runs from southern Texas to northern Minnesota. Article:  Some think that the road was paved with gold on which angels walked. Others see an invisible being standing on the road, which was designed to test believers.

We are a Christian company, owned and run by Christians, writing and creating a newspaper for Christians. We aim for the high standards our readers have come to expect. But because the newspaper is non-profit, we don't get to choose what kind of content appears. We don't even write the headlines — a Christian advertising agency does that. (That’s just one kind of news reporting — there's much, much more than that.) Because we are non-profit, we are forbidden from putting advertising in our newspaper.

So you will have to ask yourself what a Christian paper is supposed to be. This is the answer.

What a Christian Newspaper Supposed To Be

""He who doesn’t love reading is like the man sitting in a hot room with his mouth open — and at no time would he even miss the slightest opportunity of exchanging the air with the people around him to take in food when the necessity of living obliges him to breathe."" (Socrates)

A person of Christian faith should read a Christian newspaper in order to learn more about the faith. (Or at least about some aspects of the faith) It is one of many ways to interact with God and other Christians, which is the very purpose of the church.

What do we want to teach people about God?

How Jesus was executed by humans (or not — it's not too important, but it might help us think)

Who are the disciples? (or, How Jesus had others follow him)

What are the main stories in the first 100 pages of the Bible?

Who is the King of the whole world?

Why did Jesus say, ""Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews, must die"".

How should the life of Jesus be understood?

What are we doing to follow Jesus and to follow God?

How do the apostles view God?

Is the cross a just punishment?

Why is there suffering?

Why did Jesus have to die?

What is the greatest commandment that Jesus gave?

How should we respond to God through the Bible?

What does it mean to be ""saved""?

Would you like this paper for free?

Yes, of course.

No, thank you.

No, too much work.

Yes, thanks!

What will you do with all this knowledge?

I just want to learn.

My soul doesn't just want to hear, it wants to learn from the Lord.

My soul isn't fully-formed like I think it should be. (or like that of a well-read person)

I plan to do something with this knowledge.

I have a different plan for my life. So I don't need to do something with the knowledge.

What is the ""truth""?

What is the ""truth""?

This is a newspaper for Christians.

All of these are false.

Which of the following is true?

Only Jesus, is true.

I don't know what ""Christian"" means, but I'm a ""Christian"" in some way.

Other churches or denominations don't say this, and yet they are still ""Christian.""

I think that this is true.

I think that (something else) is true.

All of the following statements can be true.

Which can be false?

This is a newspaper for Christian. But it also for all believers.

For all:

This is a newspaper for the true Christians

The Gospel Message

All, the whole Bible...the only Christian book.

The Gospel.

For all:

God's Word. It is the only true and accurate source of teaching. All its teaching is based on what God said and what he wants Christians to know. It is also the highest authority, for without it, all other teaching about God and Christian living must be viewed with suspicion — some of what we find in the churches and in the lives and teachings of Christians is a result of the failure to uphold the Bible.

Christian, All, all of the Gospels.

The gospel.

God, What God does.

The Gospel.

What God says.

God's Word.

The Bible.

God’s Word.

That which God said.

All the Bible is true, and true.

Experts: Removing trans fats, finding healthy replacements also critical. Article:  Experts at CNN's first Fit Nation Summit held in Atlanta proposed a new approach to obesity that would combine national solutions and local solutions from people in their communities.

1. Explain the nature of the conference.

2. What is your primary purpose as the author (examples from the article may be appropriate) Explain?

3. Explain the significance of the first Fit Nation Summit.

4. How does the first Fit Nation

5. Explain your primary purpose as the author in writing this news article. How will an accurate, balanced, and honest portrayal of the conference help your audience?

6. Discuss and describe two

opposing perspectives about

obesity and healthy living.

The most difficult thing in writing such a news article is to give a balanced and fair view on the subject by considering the viewpoints of experts, government officials, health advocates, and others. This may be done by summarizing the different points of view and making points for those who take the opposite view and to consider the facts about obesity and healthy living, the arguments that are made, and the people making the arguments.

Obesity Expert: The Nation should make an urgent resolve: without a national obesity solution this nation risks collapse. Expert says, unless national action to address obesity is taken, this nation risks a collapse and losing its economic clout.

Obesity expert says, without national effort to address the obesity crisis, the US will risk a collapse or a ""collapse"" and we ""will lose the economic clout that the rest of the world is now seeking"", experts say.

""It's a major public health crisis,"" said George Blackburn, the chair of the Council of Health Promotion of the National Preventive Health Association in a CNN report. ""Unless we tackle it, we may lose what we have worked so hard to gain. The US is not doing what it should to stop this public health nightmare,"" he said.

""The costs are high, the taxes are high, there's the health care and the human

dignity issue and there are a lot of factors, and if we don't look

at this issue, it's going to undermine everything we've worked so hard

to come out of and attain, it's going to undermine our economic clout

across the world,"" says George Blackburn, former Surgeon General

""Obesity and the related diet-related non-communicable diseases

are expected to account for as much as 9.4% of the global

income lost to premature mortality, according to a United Nations

study of trends in overweight and obesity, up from 7.5% in 1990, and are estimated to cost the U.S. $174 billion in health care spending by year 2020.

It is estimated that in 2035, obesity-related illnesses will cause $190 to 210 billion in health care spending worldwide. A new study by a team of British researchers using data from the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization showed that while nearly half of the world's obese people live in the developed countries, two-thirds of the global economic costs of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases come from low-income or middle-income countries.

To solve the global obesity problems experts must address the health risks in the United States and in other countries.

Blackburn said one of the key things that needs to be done is to get people involved. ""We need to motivate our children. We need to get the adults involved. We all have a role to play,"" he said.

""How do we get people to see that this problem exists?"" said George Blackburn.

He added, ""We need to be proactive.""

Obesity is a significant problem in the United States. Since 1990, the rate of obesity has increased by 30%.

According to the report published in the journal Obesity, obesity-related issues ""will increase in importance as the world population expands and develops economies in the developing world.""

It was ""the first conference of its kind,"" which set a national goal of preventing and solving obesity by 2030.

According to studies:

40% of men and women are obese

Nearly one-third of the U.S. population, or roughly 80 million people, is overweight.

This is an ex-girlfriend talking about a case where the suspect had ""made his initial court appearance."" She seems to be pretty upset about it. If you want to have her say a little more about it, you might include the fact that she feels so strongly about the case that she cannot sleep at night. I found that interesting.

I agree that the main point of the first sentence should be emphasized more. After the description of what happened, there is a line that starts with ""she"". One problem is that ""she"" is talking of her when she says she ""has had her share of nightmares."" If this information about her is important, you would have to include the description of what she is talking about, which is the case she has had nightmares.

""She told police that she didn't see why he shouldn't receive a 30-day sentence because he got out of control and was very intimidating"" - the line that talks about the person the quote comes from is the second sentence.

I think it could go either way. ""I'm sick of running"" suggests running away from someone or from a situation, which makes it less likely that he did it to avoid spending time with his ex-girlfriend. Also, ""I'm Chester Stiles"" is a pretty weird name for an ex-girlfriend. But he could have changed some of his given name for the sake of the arrest, or, more likely, she gave police his full name when they",1

"Summary: One dead as hundreds of thousands flee rising floodwaters. About 80 percent of the city of Villahermosa is under water. Tabasco and Chiapas states hardest hit. Authorities say 700,000 affected and 300,000 still trapped by flooding. Article:  About 150,000 in shelters where at least 4 people have been killed by lightning, fallen trees and flooding.

Chiapas, Tabasco worst hit by flooding

One man drowned and another was in critical condition last night after lightning struck a home in the northern state of Tabasco, killing both people inside, officials said yesterday.The second body was recovered by a rescue team working in a region that has been hit by extreme rain and river flooding [that has killed at least four people].

The storm was likely triggered by a powerful earthquake [that recently hit Chiapas] yesterday morning, at around 05:15 GMT, in the south of the country, said Mario Sanchez, director of an earthquake monitoring centre [at the time].

Chiapas and Tabasco state have both been hit by flooding.

“Since [the earthquake] we have had the hardest rains in 10 years,” said the director of the Chiapas seismological institute [Trujillo said yesterday].

Villahermosa – a town of 400,000– has been hit worst, with 60,000 out of a population of 800,000 evacuated in the past two days as the deluge of the last few days continues. [Some officials say] as much as 80 percent of the city is under water, with the city centre submerged [in the north of the state, and in the Tabasco state capital of the same name].

Emergency [officials] say that 600,000 are affected, with more than 300,000 persons reported still trapped by the floods.

Hernan Perez, director of the Tabasco government’s [on Tuesday] said more than 300,000 people were forced to flee.

“In the village of Cintalapa alone, the floodwaters from Mayagozapa and Mayabell, rivers that are connected, forced over 75,000 to escape, many of whom did not have a roof over their heads,” Perez said.

One man was believed to have drowned during the earthquake early yesterday [at around 05:15 GMT], as his wife was pulled to safety by firefighters from the Chiapas state rescue centre.

“Unfortunately two workers from the rescue centre died. There were two deaths: one man and a woman,” said the head of the state civil defence commission [Lorenzana] Efraín Aguilar.

Yesterday morning, he said, “three of the 11 firefighters fell to their deaths” when a lightning bolt hit a house where they were helping evacuate people from a region of Tabasco.

“We can’t say exactly [why] they died because the man who fell was caught in a tree during the earthquake, that’s why we can’t confirm [why he died] yet,” Aguilar said.

A further three people were killed by electrocution during the night, and seven more were in hospital with lightning or falling trees.

The storms that have been battering the region for several days will soon end [and normal weather conditions will begin to return] according to the National Centre for Seismology [CNE] director [Pedro Ferriz].

Ferriz said the storms in this region in the Gulf of Mexico, would produce wind gusts of 30 kilometres per hour.

However, he noted they come at a time when heavy rains are expected over Central America [and parts of Mexico].

“Rainfall in this [region] has a direct link with the activity of the storms from the west of the world,” Ferriz said.

Fernandez is optimistic conditions soon will return to normal, noting that the current situation is [as a result of] earthquakes. [In contrast] heavy rains are a normal climate situation in Mexico.

Trujillo [another southern state] said its two [injuries] have been caused by thunder [or lightning].

“The first person died in the night, the other while being pulled out [from a flood]; the man was pulled down by the force of the flowing waters and died when he hit the ground,” the mayor of San Juan El Alto told Agence France-Presse by telephone.

“As of yesterday morning, we’re at [injuries of] eight, seven people drowned and four people [were injured] in the village of El Salado [west of San Juan].”

In 1992, people used drugs to treat illnesses; in 1992, the drugs used to treat illnesses accounted for 51% of drug revenues, but in 2007, the same drugs accounted for only 42% of drug revenues. In 1993, drug consumers had used drugs to obtain spiritual guidance; in 2006, the same consumers were also using drugs to gain a spiritual advantage because that spiritual guidance is now free of charge. In 1993, women consumed drugs as part of their socialization; in 2006, women used drugs solely as a means of achieving pleasure. In 1993, children used drugs as part of their religious education; in 2006, children used drugs solely to obtain pleasure. In 1993, street drug consumption centered around cannabis, opium, and phenylacetone derivatives; in 2006, people's preferred street drug had shifted from cannabis to opioids.

You may need a third party writing service online just to give you some help, or you may want to have all of the required work done for you. Be careful, though; some of the writing services out there prey on people who are just beginning to write so they end up with poorly written essays. This is not the work you need, this is not the service you need, and you will regret engaging the services of a poorly written essay writer.

First, you need to be sure you are using the most accurate and the most relevant keywords in the title and the text of your page. If you are working on your blog or website, you need to be sure that the keywords you are using come from the pages that are providing the most value to your readers. You want your reader to get to your blog or website and come out of the page or visit the page and know that you are the best, most relevant, or most trusted resource for that keyword. You can do this by researching the competition directly on Google (for example, if you are looking for a keyword to purchase a blog related to the topic of ""trying to conceive"" you can enter ""trying to conceive"" and Google will show you related keywords. From this list, you can get a sense of what your competition is doing, what they are writing about, and what they are bringing to the table through their research and content. You can then use a keyword research tool or service to find the terms your competition uses that are most effective in driving traffic to each page of your site. The key here is to do this before you make a keyword investment. You want to use what your competition uses and not what you think you will use.

The third component of content marketing is social media marketing. As we've seen, traditional forms of advertising on the Internet like banner ads show less conversion than social media advertising, even though banner ads are often a part of social media marketing. Because social media sites lend themselves so well to social interaction, they are a perfect place to do two things: create brand awareness, and generate leads.

What to Write - Now that you have the content in mind the next step is to begin drafting the perfect article. You should start by thinking of the main thesis of the article. Is it offering an opinion? Is it conveying a fact? Is it trying to make someone laugh? There is a great article by Dr. Neil Thorns at ArticleTrail.com that has a very helpful breakdown of different types of writing. You can also go to one of the many resources available online that will breakdown subjects.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Drug abuse problem rising; money supply shifting away from illicit drug trade; international police group pushing nations to attack problem. Agent urges NATO forces to adopt an offensive strategy. A U.N. commission urges providing money-generating alternative for farmers.

The main purpose of the first paragraph is to offer an overview of the information. Make sure that you have included all of the vital information without taking up too much room. Make sure that the reader can get an idea of the theme or point of the article. You could say that you are providing a summary, but it helps your reader to know that they're about to read an entire article, not just the first paragraphs. You could also say that you're providing context for the essay by telling the reader who you are and what you're all about.

First, you need to be sure you are using the most accurate and the most relevant keywords",1

"Summary: Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 in South American qualifier for 2010 World Cup. Juan Roman Riquelme nets twice as Argentina win third successive match. Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez quits after 5-1 loss against Paraguay. Article:  Argentina’s next match is against Honduras in a home-and-away series.

2. Argentina qualify to 2010 World Cup for the second consecutive time.

At 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Argentina won their first game. In second game, they defeated Honduras 2-1. In final match of group stage, they came out against Nigeria 3-0. In their first match of Round of 16, Argentina defeat the United States 1-0. In quarterfinals, Argentina face Spain. As the Argentina team manager Diego Maradona said, winning the match was more important than qualifying for the second World Cup.

During Argentina’s qualifying campaign for the South Africa 2010 World Cup, Argentina went through a five games. They won four games of them, and lost only one game. On 23 September 2009, Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 at home. After winning this game, Argentina went ahead at the top of their group.

Bolivia was next. After Argentina beat the Bolivia national team 3-0, they went ahead at the top of group, with Argentina. Argentina will face Ecuador and Honduras in home-and-away series. Their first away game was against Ecuador in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The first match kicked off on 1 December 2009 at the Estadio Atahualpa, Guayaquil. Argentina won this match 1-0, with a goal from Carlos Tevez. The match was marred when Roberto Ayala was sent off after being adjudged by match referee Ricardo Tevez for a second bookable offence.

Argentina played against Honduras in the second-to-last match of the group stage. Argyle, as home-and-away series was designated, Argentina beat Honduras 4-1 at the Estadio Atahualpa, Guayaquil. Argentina had a two-goal lead in the first half and Honduras had a goal in the final minutes. However, Argentina could not hold on to the lead and finally lost against Honduras 0-2. Therefore, Honduras had the chance to qualify for the Round of 16 as the second best third place team.

Argentina qualified for the 2010 World Cup. In their third game of group stage qualification, Argentina beat Venezuela 4-2. This match was the Argentina’s eighth consecutive victory. In March 2009, Ecuador had been the opponents. On 4 August 2009, Argentina beat Ecuador 4-2 on penalty shoot out at the Estadio Nacional in Quito. The first match began when Argentina drew 1-1 against Ecuador. Ecuadorian coach Luis Fernando Suarez felt that his team would have qualified for 2010 World Cup. However, this was not to happen. In the second half, Juan Roman Riquelme got his first goal for Argentina. The final score of the match was Argentina 4-1 Ecuador.

The next game of the group stage was against Paraguay. On Tuesday 8 August 2009, the Argentina’s team manager Diego Maradona said, “I’m not at all happy with the result, because I expected a win in a very important game.” The result was not good for Argentina. They lost the game 1-2. The first match commenced at the Estádio Centenário Roberto Meléndez Canavery with the game beginning at 19:00 UTC+3.

After losing against Paraguay, Argentina beat Colombia 2-0 in Colombia. Argentina qualified for the Round of 16 of the group stage of qualification. On Wednesday 9 August 2009, Roberto Ayala converted the opportunity which fell to him. In the final match, Argentina beat Venezuela 5-0 in home game of the third group match. Argentina scored five goals in the first half. The second half was even more exciting as Argentina broke through the defence and scored two more goals.

Argentina is the second ranked team. At this year’s World Cup, the Argentinian team was selected as the best South American team. For many observers, this is just the start of the journey for Argentina and their amazing team.

3. Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 at home to qualify for 2010 World Cup.

On 23 September 2009, Argentina beat Bolivia 2-1 at home to qualify for 2010 World Cup. Argentina had led at halftime and they had an early lead thanks to the goal from Alejandro Silva which was then confirmed by Ezequiel Lavezzi to make it 1-0. In the 62nd minute, a fine counter-attaque by Gonzalo Jara gave Bolivian playmaker Paolo Montero a chance to give the side the lead. It was not until the 81st minute",1
"Summary: John Edwards calls for immediate withdrawal of 40,000-50,000 troops. Sen. Hillary Clinton says withdrawal of 30,000 troops by July ""too little, too late"" Sen. Barack Obama calls for an immediate start to troop withdrawals. Article:  Sen. John McCain does not call for troop withdrawals until the Iraqis have their own nation.

As the first Presidential debate came to a close, John Edwards suggested that the United States could withdraw all of the troops from Iraq within the next 30 days. Meanwhile, Democratic frontrunner, Vice President Mike Pence, reiterated his previous call for withdrawing 100,000 troops within 30 days. Senator Hillary Clinton called on the President to begin withdrawals of 30,000 troops starting ""as soon as possible,"" but she, too, suggested this should be done in 30 days and not before. However, Senator Obama said that he supports the same timetable as Mrs. Clinton's, but with the added proviso that the troops could be withdrawn as soon as January.

John Edwards is a political liberal and Democratic presidential candidate from the United States of America. He supports universal health care and free elementary and secondary education for low income children. He believes that education should also be available to everyone else. On the social policy front, he favors a public health system to manage medical costs. Edwards has worked in the medical field for several years and has also served in the military medical sector. On the campaign trail he says that there simply is not enough support for the war in Iraq in the United States. Most of his opponents say the same thing or something similar.

Sen. Hillary Clinton is a Democratic senator from New York. She is a politician with a background in the government. She is a former First Lady to her husband and is currently a US Senator from New York. She is known for her support of gun control, and her work in favor of universal health care. She supports a health care system that provides all Americans the ability to choose their own hospital, to keep all their doctor contacts and to be able to seek treatment whenever they prefer. She also supports free higher education for every citizen. Senator Clinton was critical of President George W. Bush for starting a war with Iraq when there was no threat to the United States. She now says that she believes the war should be done with more speed and that it should not be extended beyond the mission set it by the Bush administration. On the campaign trail and in public forums she continues to call for a withdrawal of any troops by the end of July of the following year, 2008.

Senator Barack Obama is an African-American politician who has run to be President of the United States. He was formerly a Democrat but currently says he will run as a Republican. Obama has been a community organizer and has helped a large number of people on Chicago's South Side. He was educated at Occidental College, Columbia University Law School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Divinity School. Obama is presently campaigning for a position in the United States Congress. Obama has been accused along with Senator Hillary Clinton of trying to split up his political opponents and force them to take positions that he does not wish them to take. He has previously advocated a timetable for troop withdrawals from Iraq before April of 2007. He is no longer supportive of that timetable and now supports a withdrawal soon, but after some sort of transition period. Obama is currently leading or has passed Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic party primaries.

On the debate on September 21, 2008, Senator McCain said ""the mission was ill conceived, poorly executed and ill advised"" but he says that he supports the war in Iraq until it is completed and to withdraw some troops from Iraq as soon as possible. Senator McCain is a military veteran who has fought in numerous conflicts overseas since the second World War. McCain is a conservative, having voted against the Affordable Health Care Act and for tax cuts. He believes in supporting defense and military budgets, as long as they are within the American taxpayer's spending limit. McCain has also said that the Iraqis can't be trusted to run their own country and that they cannot stop the war if the Iraqi government is a part of it.

Sen. Obama strongly disagrees with John Edwards and the Republicans. He says that he would be unable to support a military budget that was in violation of the country's spending plan as it is currently being planned. He has said that the United States should not be fighting wars unless there is a threat, such as an attack on the United States. If he were to become President, he would be able to withdraw troops from Iraq within 30 days. On the campaign trail, it is often hard to determine if Senator Barack Obama is speaking from personal conviction or political motives. He may be making political statements to appeal to the electorate or to split his opponents up in order to gain support.

Although this presidential debate was held more toward the end of the campaign, Senator Barack Obama still supports the complete withdrawal of troops from Iraq. He and other Democratic leaders call a timetable of withdrawal ""f",1
"Summary: ""Inspiring Impressionism"" looks at Old Masters, other influences on modern art. Featured are works of Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, Cassatt, Morisot. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" runs through January 31, 2008, at the High Museum. Denver Art Museum and Seattle Art Museum get the show next. Article:  The show will be on view for nine months. Read more here.

""In his first solo show in New York since 1989, German artist Andreas Gursky has an ambitious exhibition in which he shows more than 160 works from all over the world that he has mounted into a series of photographs inspired by one of the most influential art movements of recent times: Impressionism,"" writes Tom LeDû in the Daily News. Read more here.

""He was the first artist of his generation to paint the 'big picture' -- an idea that many of the new-wave painters had also explored, but none had achieved,"" writes Richard Greene in the Boston Globe. Read more here.

""His images -- from the mundane to the sublime -- are as arresting now as they were for the first time more than a half-century ago. Indeed, even in the middle of World War II, the American painter Andrew Wyeth was looking back through the years,"" writes John Richardson in the New York Times. The new retrospective exhibition ""Andrew Wyeth: The Artist's World"" has been mounted in The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and is on view through January 16, 2008. Read more here.

""As the latest work from one of the most distinguished artists of our time comes to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (see below for his complete bio), it's important to remember a few things about his oeuvre,"" writes Christopher Knight, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in the Boston Globe. Read more here.

""Andrew Wyeth will have a big showing at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, January 10 to February 25, 2008, which is not a great coincidence with the birth years of each of his 12 children, the first born in 1942, the last in the mid-1970s, by his then wife Josephine. His daughter Harriet says the exhibit marks the first time his children are represented in 'one major show.' Mr. Wyeth took great trouble with his early landscapes, which are not as easily accessible as his most famous work, the paintings of farmhouses."" Read more here.

""You've been looking at Andrew Wyeth for a long time, and now the great painter goes on at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. We all know his work, of course, but that's not enough. Because of the artist's prodigious output and because one way is not often as good as another, his catalogues, museum shows and the books he published as his career unfolded were of interest to serious art historians for years. His life's work amounts to a visual tour through the last 125 years."" Read more here.

""The works on view on the walls of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, represent not only an incredible span of personal and artistic life, but a reflection of the American spirit that has led to, and helped define, the great successes and failures of modern life. The collection includes paintings, prints and drawings, and all media, ranging from the intimate domestic to the expansive landscape, from urban and urbanized scenes to the more distant and exotic. 'In this remarkable selection, we discover the spirit of America in the works of many great names, from Washington to Wyeth, from the Hudson River to New York Harbor, and beyond the borders,' said MFA curator and chief executive officer Steven F. Sperman."" Read more here.

""In a world where most artists who work hard to create a work of art end up having their work rejected by most critics and the public at large, a rare, honest and courageous artist has emerged and has taken his art to the people. Wyld's simple and uncomplicated images can be found in galleries around the globe as he has done the unthinkable: create art in the true spirit of the American people."" Read more.

""Andrew Wyeth's paintings of his native New Hampshire are among the finest achievements in 20th century American painting,"" writes Tom LeDÛ in The New York Times. ""His work has become a symbol of American values of honesty, simplicity, directness and an unspoiled sense of nature.... Read more here.

""Although Wyeth was born in 1941, 'he can't be labeled a children's artist,' the show's chief juror, Lisa Phillips, explained during a preview of the Wyeth exhibit at the Baltimore Museum of Art Saturday. Instead he's a painter who has focused 'on the landscape of childhood, the land and animals,' and his art, she said,"" recounts David McComb, Baltimore Sun. Read more here.

"Summary: Nemanja Vidic plays in Man United's Champions League tie at Dynamo Kiev. Serbian defender sat out 4-1 win at Aston Villa with after-effects of concussion. United started group campaign with wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma. Article: 

Nemanja Vidic has a reputation as a fierce battler but is also renowned for his composure at the centre of defence. 'He is one of the best centrebacks in Europe and has probably the best work-ethic of any of the Premier League players I have seen,' says Roy Carroll of Birmingham Sport, who has interviewed the defender.

Vidic's calmness and determination have played an important part in the United team's impressive start to the group campaign. Vidic's former United team-mate, Gary Neville believes that, at 28, Vidic is coming into his prime. He added: 'Vidic has become a bit of a man-mountain. You don't want to try and play him. He will play you. He is one of the most popular and respected players at United.'

A former Newcastle and Tottenham player, Vidic started out as a defensive midfielder. Under Sir Alex Ferguson he moved to centre of defence. Vidic's performance for both United and Serbia is highly rated by most commentators. He has been included in the FIFA World Players '10' list of the world's best players every year since it was first published in 2005.

Expert's view

John Aldridge writes for the Daily Mail:

Vidic is a quiet and unassuming central defender, whose only real interest is his career at Old Trafford. He is probably more intelligent than most of the players around him but rarely attracts attention to himself.

Aldridge also considers the prospect for Vidic at Old Trafford next year. 'I think Vidic gives the United defence all they need. He is brave and he has good technique. He is a solid defender and is one of those rare individuals who can be relied upon in every game, week in week out. He has been fantastic for United this season.'",1

"Summary: South African reggae legend Lucky Dube killed in attempted hijacking. Dube, 43, killed Thursday in Johannesburg after hijacker tried to steal his car. Death casts shadow over South Africa's preparations for rugby World Cup final. Article:  South African authorities were tightlipped as to what happened, but the reggae legend Lucky Dube was killed Thursday in an attempt to hijack his car. Police later disclosed that the 44-year-old reggae artist's death cast a shadow over preparations for the nation's Rugby World Cup final in New Zealand. Police said a hijacker, who had forced the former Transvaal Steel Band singer out of his vehicle, killed Dube after a gun fight. Witnesses said the reggae legend was gunned down outside his Johannesburg home before a woman who was driving a car was also shot and wounded in the incident. Earlier Thursday the 44-year-old singer was forced out of his vehicle as he left home and the driver of the hijacked black Mercedes Benz S-Class sedan was shot in the leg. Dube, the lead singer of the Southern African popular reggae band was killed in an attempted hijacking on Thursday.

In an attempt to hijack the singer’s vehicle, the driver of the hijacked black Mercedes-Benz S-class sedan was shot and wounded in the leg. Police later disclosed that the reggae legend was gunned down following a gun fight. “We can confirm the death of the musician Lucky Dube,"" said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. ""The shooting was in a suburb called Sandton. It was a violent confrontation between a hijacker and a victim who was a celebrity that was involved in the media.""

In response to the death of the reggae legend, the singer, who was in a limousine on the way to his hotel in the upscale upmarket suburb, said it was an unfortunate incident that could have been avoided. “The man who stole my car is a hijacker,” he said. “Had I not gotten out of the bus then he might've shot me. This should teach me to be more careful when riding in cars that are not registered to me.

""I have just returned from Israel where I was being treated for a broken foot. I returned today to my home in Sandton because I was not feeling well. I have been in the car only for 30 minutes and someone has tried to steal it.

""I did not need to go. I am in good health, all is fine. I did not need to go,"" said the singer. ""I'm sorry to have been inconvenienced, but it's just life. I have done a lot of work, a lot of jobs.""

Pretoria - A police officer in South Africa’s Soweto township says he was shot by a man with a submachine gun during a raid on home in which members of the Inkatha Freedom Party were detained in an armed exchange. Police arrested and detained at least two activists of the party who have been wanted by the South African police for a number of violent incidents.

Police officer Moses Ndege also suffered injuries to his face and abdomen and was admitted to a Pretoria hospital for treatment. Ndege is a member of the SAPS’ counter-terror unit.

The two other detained men were freed, said Ndege. The arrest and detention of the IFP members are the latest in a wave of violent incidents by the party, which has been accused of perpetrating attacks on rivals and government officials over the past two years.

Police have arrested and detained at least two activists of the Inkatha Freedom Party who were wanted by the South African police for a number of violent incidents. In a short statement released Thursday afternoon, the South African police said that on the night of 26 August 2015 two IFP members opened fire on the police. They were later taken to prison. It is the first police record of arrests and detention on IFP orders.

A former Inkatha Freedom Party member, who was arrested last week for allegedly throwing a molotov cocktail into the house of ANC leaders in KwaZulu-Natal, was released on bail by the South African police.

The man, identified as Thembile Makusha, was released in Durban Tuesday. He had been taken into custody following the explosion in his yard on 10 August 2015. He is a former member of the now outlawed IFP. He was subsequently joined by two other men, one on the morning of 11 August and another this Wednesday. They were taken into custody and later discharged from prison on the evening of 12 August 2015.

Makusha was released on R5,000 bail in the KwaDukuza Magistrate Court. The incident happened while Makusha was playing with fire. He is accused of starting a fire in the middle of the streets in his yard. The police say",1
"Summary: Nationwide Airlines pilot dumped fuel until he landed plane Wednesday. An object was sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground. 100, including crew, were on the plane; no one was injured. Plane passenger: ""Everyone started panicking"" Article:  but we were told to ""keep calm"". Passengers on the ground: ""You should have stayed inside"". Passenger plane: ""We're not built to make emergency landings like this, it feels as if our tires are melting"". Passenger: ""It took about 1/2 an hour for us to be on the runway"".
What's the one thing that can cause an in-flight emergency?

Here are the details (this is a rough draft, I did not edit it and can't add any more details):

A pilot at Nationwide Airlines told everyone to ""stay inside and not panic"" as he dumped fuel until his plane was safely on the runway.

The plane, a Delta 88, went through an engine and an object was sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground. The plane was heading south around Charlotte from Detroit at an altitude of about 15,000 feet when ""it started looking really rough - we were really low on fuel"", the pilot said. ""He said he was looking around for the safest landing he could, and decided to dump most of the fuel.""

""You are about to land on the dirt that was not there about a year ago,"" the pilot said he told passengers.

Everyone was instructed to sit still and remain calm.

But a passenger said the plane was ""in total darkness, with the only light coming from the cabin"" and ""no one had any idea what was happening,"" until they landed safely on the runway.

The pilot called for an ambulance to meet them at the end of the runway and then met with first responders at the airport. He gave an interview to a crewmember on the ground and said ""we're not built to make emergency landings like this, it feels like our tires are melting.""

""Everyone began panicking,"" he said.
The passengers thought it would be safer to walk away from the plane rather than walk onto the tarmac, said other passengers waiting for a flight.

""Keep calm is about the safest thing you can do,"" they said.

Several passengers boarded the rescue truck, which took them to the terminal where they were met by family and friends waiting at the gate. They weren't sure what to say to their loved ones.

""We're not built to make emergency landings like this, it feels like our tires are melting,"" the pilot told people waiting at the terminal.",1
"Summary: FEMA doesn't face utter devastation as in Gulf Coast in 2005. Victims can escape in own vehicles on open roads. Communications infrastructure remains intact. Agencies learn from Hurricane Katrina mistakes. Article:  Federal assistance will be needed for weeks in order to rebuild.

1. Which of the following BEST explains why you think the media have ignored the potential impact of this storm?

(A) They did not believe the storm would be as large and affect as many people as it did in 2005, (i.e., “it was less impactful”). (B) They do not understand that “superstorms form in the same place every 20 to 30 years and have been proven to be more deadly than previously believed.” – Michael H. Powell. (C) “Media outlets are busy covering real news that the public wants to see while ignoring non-news items, such as the storm,” said John P. Fox, Director of NOAA’s National Hurricane Center. (D) The media have a difficult time covering a storm involving the word “tsunami.” (E) They don’t have enough trained staff who understand how to cover meteorological disasters. (F) Storm victims, unlike those in New Orleans in 2005, won’t suffer from lack of water, fuel, basic needs or medicines due to their location thousands of miles and many degrees of latitude from the Gulf Coast.

2. In a recent interview, President Bush spoke about Hurricane Florence. Here are some of his comments. (A) People with more money should use it to protect against potential storms. (B) He would not order people to evacuate. (C) “As bad as this one is, it could get worse,” said the president. (D) “This storm is more inland that any other major hurricane in U.S. history.” (E) “We’re going to see the same amount of rain as we did in 2005 — which was not a hurricane.” (F) No one knows how many lives will be lost. (G) “It’s an extremely dangerous storm.” (H) “I believe people understand the nature of hurricanes. They understand they’ve got to be careful.”

3. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Florence would strengthen further before hitting the U.S. today. The agency says it expects a “life-threatening storm surge and rip currents” in parts of North and SC. It said “major coastal and inland flooding will affect large coastal communities and numerous inland ones.” But will the public be warned that a life-threatening, potentially deadly storm is on its way?

(A) NOAA will issue a hurricane watch in the Carolinas region, and coastal storm surges will be expected to exceed 13 feet. (B) NOAA will issue a hurricane watch in the mid-Atlantic region, including Virginia, Maryland, Washington, DC and New Jersey. At this time, no coastal storm surge predictions are available. (C) NOAA will issue a hurricane watch in the Mid-Atlantic and eastern U.S., where a 4 to 6 foot surge is expected in the region. (D) NOAA will advise the public about a hurricane watch, and that coastal storm surges will be expected to exceed 12 feet. (E) NOAA will issue a general statement alerting the public if there is a chance of a life-threatening storm. (F) NOAA will issue a hurricane watch, and coastal storm surges will be expected to exceed 12 feet

4. Which of the following BEST explains why we don’t always see “large storms” on U.S. coasts, including in the mid-Atlantic?

(A) “In an atmosphere, air moves towards the equator faster than it goes towards the poles. So it’s really more like a circulation than a storm."" (i.e., as a hurricane develops it moves toward warmer waters and cooler air) -John P. Fox. (B) “If water cools, it goes deeper. If air cools, it rises higher. If heat rises the pressure goes down. If pressure goes down, the temperature goes up. And the water rises at 3 to 4mph. When the storm winds up, the water will not have to rise as high to form this hurricane. A storm is no longer a hurricane when it is “no longer moving” away from the coastline. This means it no longer has the strong winds that you see with an actual hurricane.” - Mike Powell. (C)“It really just means that water that becomes warmer as it rises and gets into the atmosphere is not as dense as cold water. So there are fewer clouds in the atmosphere, and fewer winds to be destructive,�",1
"Summary: Vince McMahon: WWE has one of best drug-testing programs. Wrestling boss tells CNN that individuals bear responsibility for actions. Critics say WWE penalties for drug use are not harsh enough. Wrestlers still can get drugs if they have prescriptions from doctors. Article:  McMahon also tells CNN that he does not condone smoking, drugs or drinking and is not aware of athletes taking illegal substances. He further explains the company’s testing policy.

“Drug-testing policies are set based on laws,” says Jim Sharp, president of the United States Anti-Doping Agency.

“If you are going to be a member of sports, you have to abide by those laws,” says Vince McMahon, who has been a performer in professional wrestling for 28 years.

McMahon explains that WWE’s drug-testing policy is developed in cooperation with the National Football League, basketball’s NBA, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the Professional Golfers’ Association and the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The companies collaborate over testing protocols, but WWE has no connection to professional or student programs within the NFL or NBA.

A WWE policy states there’s a limit of 10 supplements per athlete per month, with the exception being if an athlete suffers from clinical symptoms. Athletes are prohibited from mixing drugs, using products bought off the shelf, or from purchasing over-the-counter drugs from websites like Amazon and eBay.

Critics argue that McMahon’s anti-drug effort isn’t effective because performers may still be taking performance-enhancing drugs that haven’t come to the company’s knowledge. McMahon dismisses those comments, arguing the drug-testing system is designed to catch steroid use before it gets into the hands of an athlete. WWE has also taken steps to ensure athletes can’t purchase large amounts of anabolic steroids on the black market or buy them from other online sites.

McMahon, who also is the executive vice president for corporate and legal affairs at WWE, tells CNN that he wouldn’t condone what he calls “substance abuse or abuse of any kind” among athletes.

“There’s a difference between substance abuse and substance-enhancing drugs,” he says. “Our policy is very strong.”

McMahon says that since 2000, every WWE performer has had to undergo a pre-employment physical examination. The company now requires every performer to have a prescription for an anabolic steroid if it’s the prescription is written by a general practitioner or a specialist in a clinical field.

“We’d have no idea that a wrestler was taking steroids, whether they’re prescribed or not,” he says. “The person who is writing the prescription would know, but they’d certainly know in real time.”

A WWE policy states steroids must be kept locked up in off-site vaults, which are monitored by the company’s security officials every day, he says.

McMahon further explains that if an athlete does cheat, they would be subject to a multi-year suspension for the first offense and a four-year ban on competition for a second offense. He says athletes who test positive for steroids will lose their title belts and face a possible suspension for another violation.

“Wrestling and drugs are not synonymous,” says McMahon. “Drugs can help them perform in the ring, and we wouldn’t allow that in our business.”

Critics say McMahon’s policy is too soft and that it’s inconsistent with the harsh penalties currently in place in other sports. In 2003, when WWE wrestler Chris Benoit was found dead, the company suspended wrestler Eddie Guerrero for a year and removed him from his role for a time. McMahon says that he’s not aware of any evidence to suggest that Eddie Guerrero or others had an issue with steroid use. WWE’s drug testing program was tested in the Benoit case, in the Benoit’s autopsy, as well as by Canadian and UK medical experts who concluded Benoit had used testosterone and possibly other banned substances.

“We didn’t have any evidence to support that, other than what was found in the autopsy,” says McMahon. “The evidence in that autopsy was consistent with a strong suspicion of the use of these drugs.”

The drug-testing policy also is consistent with the rules of competing in sports with high-profile careers, such as the NFL and the National Basketball Associations, according to John Crezee, a sport policy expert at the University of Delaware.

“Drug testing is consistent with all the major sports that have been tested,” he says. “There’s a long history of drug testing in",1

At least 39 people are reported dead and more than 700 injured in floods across Pakistan where people are still recovering from flooding four weeks ago that brought water and mud deep into homes and farms and damaged thousands of livelihoods.
In Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Sunday, at least 10 people have been killed over the last 24 hours as flood waters started rising, local police said. A woman and her child died in Rawalpindi after their roof collapsed, while two men died and a woman was rescued from drowning.
In Lahore, five died when one family, including two children, drowned while trying to move to a safer area after flood water damaged their house, said Deputy Emergency Manager for Lahore Mohammad Anwar.
Another woman was found dead and two children were missing.
Hospitals said they treated more than a dozen drowned people in Lahore's Nishtar Medical College hospital, including a pregnant woman, her three-month-old baby and four others in their first trimester of pregnancy.
The family and some neighbors tried to move their belongings from the flood zone while flood water was still receding, but they could not cross the fast-flowing water and were trapped.
""Five people drowned including one pregnant woman and three of her five month old baby while they were trying to rescue their relatives' belongings outside the house,"" a deputy of the hospital told AFP after the bodies were brought in.
Two of the dead were found in the hospital morgue.
The deaths underscored the misery of thousands of others living on the banks of the River Ravi which burst its banks in the Punjab province.
Millions of Pakistanis are on the move to escape rising flood waters.
Around 250,000 are camping on temporary camps and some 2,500 are at three shelters operated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, according to estimates released Friday by the United Nations. The U.N. warned the number of displaced people could exceed 600,000.
About 40 per cent of the districts in the central regions of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are now under water. The army continues to deliver food and drinking water to the worst-hit areas as wells dry up fast around the flood-stricken towns and villages.

"Summary: Polish diplomats brought pointed shoes to Britain in 1300s. A female runner sewed two jock straps together for first sports bra. Men wore earrings in Egypt in 1500s. Article: 

In the year 1300, some men in Poland were wearing pointed shoes, or clogs. They wore these clogs because they could be used by peasants who had no shoes. They were also able to wear these shoes over rough stone walls which they had to climb while working as peasants. Today these shoes look more like slippers than pointed shoe, because men have worn regular shoes instead of pointed shoes.

The shoes were brought from Turkey by a group of Polish merchants who traveled to trade between Europe and Asia. They were merchants who wanted to keep their clothes as regular shoes instead of wearing the loose robes that Turks used. These loose clothes that Turkish merchants wore made it hard for Polish merchants and diplomats to do business with Turkish merchants.

The pointed shoes were brought by Polish officials who traveled to the Khan's court in Russia to make the first embassy in 1317. Men in Poland wore these pointed shoes because they did not want to show the Khan the looser clothing, robes, that Turkish merchants wore. These Turkish merchants brought their loose clothing from Egypt. The Polish men wanted the Khan to wear normal or Western clothing. This loose dress was only known by the people in the Arabian countries.

This first sports bra was made by Maria Theresa Loehr, who later married a rich man. Maria was sewing a shirt for her husband one night and thought it was easier because of the shape. A week later, her husband took it off because it was too tight. After her husband said no to wearing this, she thought he looked stupid and began dressing like the wealthy men.

This first bra was made by a woman named Mary G. She and Mary W. designed the bra because they were looking for something that was more comfortable than a bra that was tight in the top and loose in the bottoms. Mary G. worked for the department of commerce. Mary W. worked at the women's service of the post office. They both thought this shape would be perfect for a bra. This bra was different and was designed to make women feel better. It was made the same way Mary A. was. They designed this bra while they were sitting in two different rooms.

In 1453, a woman, named Catherine de Medicis, married a King Louis XI. She was pregnant with the king's son but Louis wanted to marry her. She was afraid because a pregnant woman could not go out. She asked the King to let her do some exercise to get better. The King said no and ordered her not to do any exercise at all. Catherine's mother and sister came to her room and she wanted to run away to go somewhere to exercise. She asked her sister to take care of her son, but her sister told her she could not do that. Instead, her sister told her not to do anything and she would have her servant to dress her everyday, so Catherine did nothing. She took a piece of paper and wrote ""Je vis moy."" Then, she took her piece of paper to her mother, who was sick and told her mother she was going to France. They were so shocked that they did not know what to do. Her sister let her go after she saw that her mother was not a danger anymore.

The first soccer team to travel in the year 1799 was named the New York Phantoms, and the first team to travel to England in the same year was named the New York Rovers. They made stops in Boston and Philadelphia. The name of the team was chosen because their first trip to England was on the anniversary date of the signing of the Treaty of Peace in 1783, which had the same year as the French Revolution. Their first manager was the team's founder, George De Peyster. In addition to De Peyster, they had the New York Football Club as a manager at the time.

The New York Rovers met with a coach named Thomas Barclay and a trainer named Edward Robinson. They went to the first international match on England's first ever international soccer game between the New York Rovers and the Old Etonians of England, and won both games.

The first soccer team to travel to Europe was a team from Germany. It was named the New York Rovers II and met with a group of English footballers. The New York Rovers II played in England until 1904 when the English team was disbanded. They traveled with a coach named William Jackson who helped them adapt the rules of the game to the English rules.

In 1872, Charles A. Lindbergh, the first person to travel from United States to Europe, started his adventure. The man who helped him was Charles Lindbergh Senior, who taught Lindbergh the correct way to ride through the woods, how to drive a car properly, and how",1

Hi!
Thank you in advance for taking the time to read the following response.
As you’re probably aware, writing essays is crucial for academic success. So it is important to ensure the best possible outcome.
In your essay, there are several places, where the argument is not made clear. So my first piece of advice would be as follows:
Make sure that all your sentences begin with strong and clear verbs, with appropriate complements: (i.e. “make the argument with” and “explain “).

An argument is a persuasive or convincing approach that seeks to sway the reader to agree with the writer’s point of view. The argument is structured to support the writer's assertion. An argument has three components: a position (or stance), reasons to support that position, and a conclusion which summarizes the main point. Some arguments use only the reasons section to support their position, with the conclusion merely summarizing those reasons; others use the reasons to argue for or against the writer's position, while presenting a separate conclusion. Arguments can use logical reasoning or appeals to one's emotions.
An argument is more than simply a persuasive presentation of facts; as such, it needs to have a context, which is the reason why. If the writer does not consider the audience with which the writer is presenting one's argument, then it is ineffective.

It's quite normal to be aware how one is going to write this type of paper, that is why the purpose of the research is to gather information about this particular topic, in order to formulate one's opinions and ideas.
The main aim of this paper is to create a",1
"Summary: CNN's Octavia Nasr: Will Lebanon's brief renaissance be snuffed out? Nasr says Lebanon's key power players haven't changed since 1980s. Nasr: Current struggle threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years. Article:  Nasr: She predicts new civil war as Syria crisis spills over borders The Syrian revolution has spread across the Middle East and North Africa. More than a year after its start, events in the region are becoming increasingly unpredictable. In Lebanon, Prime Minister Najib Mikati appointed a new security cabinet that contains the country’s main political parties, despite their bitter fighting. His attempts at reconciliation have been futile though, amid disagreements over key issues. In what has become a familiar pattern, the country is now in its most serious security situation since the Taef accord in 1989. Although the country is generally free of hostilities, tensions have been mounting over the government’s inability to solve Lebanon's economic crisis. The war in nearby Syria has also had a negative effect — as the Arab Spring brought about a surge of refugees into the country. Many people say that Lebanon did not have a strong opposition when the uprising against Assad's regime began. They say Lebanon's political and social situation was dominated by a small group of powerful families who were allied with the pro-Syrian Palestinian group Hizbullah. Syria has recently intensified its air strikes in the area as the military advances, taking advantage of the chaos that has swept the West. However, the Assad administration continues to stand by its previous position vis-a-vis Syria's neighbor, Israel. And that's exactly why Nasr is so excited about the country. “This is the first free election the majority of people will have had in Lebanon for 15 years,” the journalist tells DW. “When the Syrian people rose up, they were so afraid of their own government, they were so afraid of the Syrian army that they wanted to join them. So, after that, they were looking for somebody to take over. Lebanon is a very corrupt country and has a very small group of powerful families behind it. Lebanon has always been seen as very safe in the Middle East. It always has been. And if you don't mind the corruption, you will have good life there.

And there's always been some money. But it's been getting worse and worse. A lot of times in the past 20-30 years in Lebanon, there have been protests for more government transparency, but these people were very peaceful protests. This time around, they have no other weapons but their ideas and their slogans to get into power. These people say that corruption goes hand in hand with terrorism and it needs to be stopped. So, this is something new. But it's going to be hard to clean up. The economy is not doing too well, and the country is in a huge debt crisis. And so, people are afraid of having another conflict. And so, they need to take advantage of this new environment. They need to take the chance now. Nasr says that if you look at Lebanon, its political establishment has remained relatively unchanged since the 1980s. The political elite continues to consist of powerful families linked with Hizbullah; the Maronite Catholic Church, which has a strong relationship with Syria; and the politicians aligned to the Free Patriotic Movement of Syrian Christians (PCF), a political group based in South Lebanon. Syria and its allies are also backed by influential groups linked to the Shiite-dominated Hizbullah.

The country's political division remains unchanged. It’s just that, this time, the country is facing a new threat

“So, that's the old power structure that we still have — that same group of powerful Sunni, Maronite Christians and Christians aligned to the Free Patriotic Movement of Syrian Christians (PCF)… but now we have Syrian minorities being drawn into the revolution in Lebanon, and, in a sense, they are pushing back against the hegemony of these families who hold up corruption. They're saying, 'Look, the Syrian minority doesn't want to live in a country that's controlled totally by these families. We want a more democratic system.'” These Syrian minorities represent, according to Nasr, the new threat. “If the Sunni-based parties are strong, there's still going to be no democratic change in Lebanon. They're going to continue to use sectarianism as the primary way of influencing governance. … That's why we're seeing Sunni-based movements becoming dominant in the Arab Spring. They're the strongest, most organized groups and most charismatic. That's why they're taking over Tunisia and Bahrain. That's why they're taking over Egypt. Because, again, it's the issue of political empowerment for the people who don't really trust the old government,” says Nasr. The Syrian minorities have a lot of political experience having lived in Lebanon for more than 30 years, she adds. They were the ones who helped President Elias H",1

I am writing a creative writing piece on a family whose summer home burnt down very recently. How would you go about this? Is there a particular approach you would like me to use? For instance, should I write about the immediate or broader issues associated with the family? I am writing this is an academic course; the piece will not be published anywhere.

When a fire burns, people react. Depending on what stage the fire is at you’ll have different reactions within the city. I want two paragraphs. In the first write about how a fire reacts within San Diego and the effect that has on those involved in San Diego. Have you ever witnessed a fire burn? What is it like?

The second paragraph would talk about the reaction of those involved in the fire (fire department, ambulance crews, etc.) Have you ever witnessed a fire? What is it like?

At the beginning of each draft of your story, you need a ""straw man."" That is a skeleton or template that you build upon that provides a clear indication of where your story is going, whether it will be funny, exciting, depressing, etc. You can even include things like a ""happy event"" or an ""epic battle."" The ""straw man"" has to be so obvious that the reader knows what kind of story it will be and can begin preparing to write before you even start writing your first draft. Take a look at these examples:

Straw Man Examples:

Paragraph 1: A new story starts at the edge of the known universe, in an atmosphere so different, so alien, that it's unlike anything ever known.

Paragraph 2: A young couple, tired of the life, run off and create their own reality where they can be free of the pressures and demands of their reality.

Paragraph 3: The city has been put on fire. Every building is destroyed except the one which serves as the office of the mayor, which is destroyed as well.

Paragraph 1: The great bear walked the forest and it didn’t matter the path to the sea, it didn’t matter because she knew she would not be stopping for anything as long as she needed to be free.

Paragraph 2: The people of the forest were happy. Their days of fighting and fighting over territory and water were over. They had seen it all. They had fought it all. They had had their fill of fighting.

Paragraph 3: The old witch looked at the forest. The trees were so tall it would take days to walk across it. They looked down at her. From her perch in the cliff she watched the people come and go. How many? Hundreds? Thousands? And how many years must they live? This would be her last and she knew she wouldn’t leave the forest alone.

Your Straw Man should be so simple that you should be able to recognize it and start writing in the exact place you see it. It’s not just an outline because it can be different and it’s not the story you should actually create, it’s simply a place to start.

Now that you have your Straw Man and you’ve written your first draft, you’re ready to write your second.

I would need a title for this. I want an abstract that summarizes the major point my essay will make. You could also go with an overview of the topic or a general introduction. The abstract is like a mini-outline. Have you ever seen a movie where the first five minutes summarize the plot? This is what the abstract needs to be like, only easier to understand for your reader.

Straw Man:

In the forest the animals were happy. Not all were safe, there was a witch. So many things happen in the world that make everything seem unstable. What is the role of a witch?

Paragraph 1: In the forest, in the summer, the fire was spreading. It came down the river and took off at a record pace. When the fire started, the deer were all trying to get into the forest and were in a panic. They ran and ran, trampled to death on the way.

There was a bear, and a wolf, and a fox who took a liking to the deer, but he was not yet ready to take their place. Then the witch came and went looking for a new place for her. The witch is a strange creature. She comes out at night",1

Manages client assets worth $1.8 trillion, formerly bank's CFO. Tells MME: ""we're very bullish"" on economic potential of the Middle East. Article: 

""That said, we think this is probably the best time ever to be investing in the U.S. because we have low inflation; the dollar is stronger and emerging markets are not as strong. We are more comfortable with the U.S. than we've been since 1992, so maybe what we are seeing today is, for the first time in the last 20 years, something to take advantage of"". (This is meant to be very brief and shallow. It is meant to be for a reader or a journalist.)

In the last few years, Sallie Krawcheck, boss of Citi Wealth Management (CX) has managed client assets worth $1.8 trillion. With clients in the U.S. and Asia, Krawcheck is known to be one of the world's wealthiest women having achieved the rank of eighth most powerful woman in the world by ranking published in Fortune magazine in 2007.

In the middle of the last decade, Krawcheck worked as chief financial officers (CFO) at Citigroup. Then she went on to become the first ever employee of the Citigroup Global Markets unit in London as it was then called. She eventually assumed the position of chief executive office of the Citi Global Securities Services (CGSS) in London, where she became managing director, responsible for CGSS businesses in the Middle East. She is often called the CFO of the Middle East. She is presently in charge of CGSS business in the Middle East, and Asia.

Sallie Krawcheck came up and has spent her career mainly with Citigroup. She has been associated with Citi in roles like managing director, head of institutional marketing, and head of institutional communications all at the same time. She is Citi's first female global managing director and is also the first female to lead Citi's global financial services business. When at the time of interviewing her in May this year, she spoke at a press event at Citi's Abu Dhabi headquarters with a large photo of her and then CFO Vikram Pandit at the podium. She had just been there for over ten years, and he, a few months recently.

She has also worked at Lehman Brothers in New York as co-heading of Citi's global fixed income franchise and as the CFO of European equities.

From 1999 to 2004, Krawcheck served as the CFO of Citi. At one of her lectures, she noted that, the Citigroup was a very successful firm, but that things changed because after the crash of September of '09, she says that it all became very personal. ""For the first time I really felt the pain of my clients and the bank because we were losing people right and left, including people I did not know personally but I was involved with in the CFO role. We were losing good people. It was difficult, but I felt personally responsible, because we should not have let that happen, no matter what business we were in. The bank was one thing, but I felt responsible and so the pressure I went through was incredible and the pressure we all felt was very intense and personal"".

Krawcheck joined Citigroup after she failed to get a job with Bank One at the age of 30. She got a job to go to California with a bank there but they said that she was too old and too boring to come and meet bankers so she decided that she would join Citigroup instead. Within a single year she went from being a banker and to CFO to a managing director and eventually to the most powerful female position. She was at the peak of her career at 27. As she says, you take what you can at that time.

Sallie Krawcheck started her career at Citigroup with a job at Citibank in Los Angeles in 1980. She was then called to take a job at a hedge fund in 1981. After working for the hedge funds for around a year, she joined Citibank as managing director in 1982, where she served until 1986. She was in the investment banking division and then the institutional side. In 1988, she joined the Lehman Brothers branch of the bank, where she held a position as managing director. In May this year, she was speaking at a press event at the Citi offices in Abu Dhabi.

Sallie Krawcheck says that her experience at Citigroup helped her to start her own hedge fund and start her own company and invest in her own real estate with her co-investor. She is particularly satisfied with her ability to deal with clients.

"Summary: British teacher in Sudan found guilty of insulting religion. Gillian Gibbons, 54, arrested after her class named teddy bear ""Mohammed"" Gibbons was not convicted of two other charges brought against her. UK consular staff, Gibbons' defense team initially refused access to the court. Article:  Three weeks later, the UK government conceded to his defense. Gibbons was released immediately and will return home to Yorkshire, England in May.

Brief description of the issue: A British teacher is being held by Sudanese authorities for what they call insulting Islam.

Background. Gillian Gibbons taught English at an international school in Khartoum. On April 9, she gave a class presentation which she titled, ""The Five Pillars of Islam."" In this presentation, she listed five tenets of Islam, the most well-known of which is ""There is no God but Allah and Mohammad is His messenger."" She distributed a handout to the class which listed these five elements, explaining that ""We believe a divine spirit called Allah existed in the beginning, and he created the earth. He will take over the earth in the end, making it his own paradise."" In her class talk, Gibbons told her students they should ask: ""If we believe in God but not in Jesus as your messiah, why?"" (The students answered ""Why?"" and then asked why she does not).

Gibbons's class presentation angered many in the Sudanese government, which considered it sacrilegious on several levels, including violating the country's Islamic code. They claimed Gibbons insulted Islam and asked for her to be arrested. A Sudanese court held a closed hearing, and based on Gibbons' presentation and comments during the discussion period at the end of the class, decided she blasphemed. Sudanese police raided Gibbons' residence and took her into police detention after the conclusion of the hearing.

She was charged with blasphemy against Islam and two other charges for ""proselytism"" (promoting Christian teaching), which are punishable by death according to Sudanese law. On April 24, Sudanese authorities tried Gibbons in a closed hearing and found her guilty. The court also sentenced her to pay a $3,000 fine. She later learned that the court's punishment for blasphemy was death by stoning. The Sudanese government did not release the punishment for the two other charges. The punishment for proselytism is unclear, but in the Sudanese legal system it is a far less serious offense than blasphemy.

British consular officials arrived to meet with Gibbons on June 6. Initially Gibbons' defense lawyer refused consular access, claiming he still needed another 14 days to prepare the case at the courthouse, which was not done. After three weeks, the British government agreed to the consular access.

After the three weeks, the consular officials were able to confirm she was imprisoned. They also brought her new clothing for the court hearing. The consular officials met with her while she was in her cell to ask for specific pieces of evidence which she had written on her own. They found, among others, a bible. They also asked if she needed any medical attention and to collect any belongings that she lost in her prison cell. The officials visited her cell frequently and also asked what she believed to be her most urgent legal concerns. She told them that she believed she would face a trial within a matter of days. After they confirmed what she believed to be the date of the trial, they were not allowed to see her before the trial.

One of the officials said that Gibbons was told on April 27 that she would be able to return home the same day if she agreed to the prosecution. She was offered financial compensation. Gibbons refused and asked to remain in Sudan.

On July 1, the consular officials learned that there had been no trial and were not able to visit with Gibbons. After they learned that trial was held on July 13, she was transferred to a detention center.

On July 14, the British government flew Gibbons to the UK consulate in Sudan on the same day that her court date was finally held. She arrived in the UK on July 15, was released and flew home to London, where she began a media campaign to raise legal and consular support for herself.

Proper name and title: Ms. G. Gibbons.

Issue summary of the issue: British teacher in Sudan tried for insulting religion is being held for blasphemy.

A news article is an entry on a topic or an event that has been covered by the media. It is generally written in plain and simple language. For example, your news article could be titled “A school bus crashed into a train and it was an absolute mess – see pictures here”. In the summary, you would provide the details of the event, including who was involved and what took place, such as photographs. A news article can be an interview, a review, a report of an event, or an opinion piece. All these types of news articles require one main point and one or more secondary points.

An AP Style guide is a news citation style guide that describes how to report on the Associated Press to make articles more accessible, searchable, and readable. It sets out the guidelines that will be used by news staff, freelance writers, and editors. They also outline the basic rules of good practice in news reporting and editing.

The AP Style book is an American style guide that describes correct usage and proper punctuation used in the Associated Press. The AP Style guide serves as a “convenient reference” and is more frequently referred an AP style. The AP Style guide is different from other style guides in that it does not use a dictionary, but rather, the use of the Associated Press style guide provides a common style for communication of AP articles. To help writers learn the Associated Press style guide, the AP provides a Stylebook tutorial. The tutorial is a video and can be done in five steps.

How to write an intro that really hooks readers. Many of us have used an intro paragraph like the one below to grab attention from the beginning of a news article: “President Obama is back in the US for the first time since he delivered his State of the Union speech last month. To mark this landmark in history, he spoke candidly about the challenges facing his presidency.”

How to choose the best words for your news article and how to write them into the best sentences.

AP Stylebook

It is important that you understand that news articles are written in an objective form, meaning they have a third person tense. Examples of the objective form include: “The President spoke candidly about his job,” “The government shutdown continues,” “Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is 93.” An example of a subjective form is: “You spoke candidly about your job,” “The government shutdown continues,” “Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is 93.”

As a journalist, you are expected to know the difference between objective and subjective sentences when writing a news article.

There are a couple of basic rules for writing stories that should be followed when writing a news article. One thing to remember is to use the same point of view throughout a news article, this will make the article more cohesive. For instance, the use of first, third person or different characters depending on your point of view. “The White House is a good workplace for the President.” “Jane, the janitor in the White House Office Building is lazy but she’s really nice.” The objective voice is used to describe the place or institution, the character who is speaking, actions and beliefs of this place. In this example, we can say this was an objective voice because the place mentioned (White House) has first person characteristics. The person who is speaking is the character, not the place, so in this article we choose third person.

"Summary: Obama holding concerts to win over African-American Christians in S. Carolina. But lineup offends homosexuals, angered by appearance of anti-gay singer. Obama disavows preacher-singer's views, asks gay pastor to appear too. Article: 

Question: What does Barack Obama's decision to repudiate a black preacher's views on homosexuality have to do with religion, politics and homosexuality anyway? Do our elected officials ever have to reconcile their views on sexuality and religion with their views on politics or do they merely want to pick and choose where they want to talk about their views?

The gay marriage issue is one that will continue to divide Americans by race, and perhaps it is because our country was formed from a variety of backgrounds and ethnicities which are still alive and well. It is a very emotional and political issue that people just can’t seem to agree on. However, many people are still talking about it and that might be due to the fact that some of the people talking about it are trying to influence our politics. They are doing this through the media but that could very well be their own opinion, that they should be able to influence us through the media.

As long as the Supreme Court keeps on ruling the way it has with the gay marriage issue, it doesn’t seem that it will ever be resolved. However, some people think that it is wrong to tell people what to do because the other side thinks that it should be a state’s rights issue, not an issue that the court should be involved in. This should be the same thing when it comes to abortion. People should get to decide for themselves because that is what the Constitution says, even if someone else’s opinion isn’t the same as theirs. Of course, our country has never been truly rid of racism and other forms of discrimination. It is just that they were never as pronounced as they once were, and they no longer need to be. What is important to most people, and what has kept our country together, is not the color of someone’s skin but rather, being able to freely express their beliefs. Everyone should be able to do that without worrying about being ostracized or even arrested. It does seem that many people, both in the media and in the United States, are afraid of homosexuals and all their views. They aren’t afraid, but it is almost like they are afraid of us and that is something that shouldn’t happen. People should have the freedom to speak their mind and we should be able to criticize how people speak their minds. The government should be careful not to get involved in any of this because people should be able to have the freedom to express their beliefs.

This article is well written. I like how you have a paragraph for each question that a possible reader might ask themselves. It doesn’t give a ‘yes, no,’ answer. The use of quotations from a variety of different sources lends to the article a certain depth and accuracy. Another thing I like about this article is that it doesn’t give a definitive answer. It just states that the President’s actions regarding gay marriage are politically motivated. I think that is a nice way to leave room for what may happen in the future, whether or not Obama and Romney will support same sex marriage is still a wayyyyyy off. I also like how you’ve pointed out the fact that the media may be overreacting to some of his comments on the subject. Lastly, I enjoy the tone of the article. There is a good balance of opinion and critical comments. I would suggest a little more in the way of opinions than the tone that is used.

This is a very interesting article and I agree that it is not the best that I've read. I think the main problem is that you have not tried to be fair when writing the essay. You are attacking Obama and Romney without stating how fair you think Obama is when it comes to the gay marriage issue. I do not think either of them has ever made any kind of comments against gay marriage, and if they had, then there would be no need for all of this controversy. In other words, if Obama truly supports gay marriage, he would not be as opposed to it at such a major event as this concert. Because he truly supports gay marriage, it means that he truly believes we should be given the same rights that heterosexual couples are given which is the fundamental aspect of any marriage. That is what should be being said, but at the end of the day, not much has been. I think it is important for a writer to write as truthfully as possible. If you truly want to argue a point, then you should really be trying to present it honestly and with a fair opinion on both sides. I can understand and feel some of what you are trying to say, and I hope that my comments made some sense.

This activity is available to all elementary educators in the district. This topic could be any activity (from a current play, a time of reflection, a lesson plan, a game, etc.) that would provide the children an opportunity to reflect upon life and death. The following activity can be used to meet the requirements of a short story that focuses on the experiences and emotional reactions of individuals who are trying to survive a fire.

The first fire occurred in 1911, when there was no fire department. This activity introduces the concept of a fire brigade where students will become firefighters and firefighters. If you could not make it to the end of lesson 12, you can download the whole class of lesson 10 and lesson 11 resources on one pdf.

It is recommended that Fire Brigade Emergency Dispatch is done the day before this lesson. This second edition includes Complete Lessons in PDF for Downloading. Students will research the fire department that will arrive to the fire scene to put out the fire.

Using pictures, words, and the words fire, rescue, fire department, and firefighter, students will learn what a fire looks like; how a fire starts and burns; how firefighters fight fires and put them out; how firefighters are trained; and the importance of putting out fires. After learning what a fire consists of, students will research the history of fires. A sample of a newspaper article or picture that students look through to obtain the information needed to answer the questions is included.

This unit was created by teacher's as they searched for ways to teach the fire of history. Students take a look at a fire in the past by watching a video, using pictures, and reading a historical text. Teachers who are considering using this curriculum will benefit greatly from using these lesson plans together with the suggested curriculum resources for lesson 09 and lesson 10, as well as lessons that can be done the day before lesson 10. Each of the following resources contains at-grade equivalent materials: The sample video shows the fire of an older building.

The sample historical text illustrates the history of the fire that occurred in San Bernardino, California. The sample text is an excerpt of the full text. You may find that you need to use the older materials for this lesson because you may want to discuss the fire as a symbol of the destruction of cities and the devastation suffered in places like the Philippines and New Orleans. If so, the older activities should be used, especially as students continue researching their fire history. You could complete lesson 10 as a class, and then do the suggested activities as homework, or you could leave this as a class project.

It is important to emphasize the symbolism of fire to the students in order to have them better empathize with the victims of the terrible fire in San Bernardino. If you did not have any older videos, you could download one from your library or the internet. You could write in the answers or students would have a copy of the text. In general, there is no limit to the ways you could complete this lesson.

After completing lesson 10, you could have an exciting class meeting complete with a special guest speaker as students talk about their research on fires and share the material they researched.

The first fire occurred in 1907. This lesson is divided into four parts: The first part is the students' research.

Students will find the information for the investigation. Students will learn how the fire began and spread. Students will learn how a fire is put out. They will learn what a fire zone is.

The second, third, and fourth parts of the lesson are the same for all four parts of the activity. Students conduct their research, present their research, and write an original historical news article based on the research they performed.",1
"Summary: Navy says it has lost confidence in officer's ability to command. Crew members on sub disciplined for faking inspection records, Navy says. Ten people have been relieved of duty; six received ""nonjudicial punishment"" Article:  and four were given demotions.

Do you agree or disagree that the Navy's decision to punish and force retire its senior lieutenant's officer for his part in the cheating scandal, with punishment including the loss of the man's rating, is just? Explain.

In the wake of the ""Navy's most extensive disciplinary case ever"" (Daily Mail) and allegations of ""a secret plot to cheat the system in order to get senior officers to win promotion, with junior officers being pressured to pass off the cheating as their own work"" (Reuters), the media has been quick to pick this story up as one of the most significant, and most troubling, scandals in the history of the U.S. Navy.

The investigation and subsequent court-martial of senior lieutenant Michael Loeppke, who had served as a top commander on the guided-missile submarine Ticonderoga and was ""responsible for all of the ship's engineering functions for two years,"" began about 10 months ago. Loeppke -- as well as 17 other staff corpsmen, 12 officers and several warrant officers -- have been accused of falsifying records for inspection with help from some of the ship's junior officers.

The charges ranged from creating false service entries in a journal that kept track of their daily inspections on the submarine to ""falsification of official records, obstruction in an official proceeding, conduct unbecoming an officer and enlisted member, and conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline"" (Navy Times).

The punishments came in the form of ""non-judicial punishment"" (NBP) which, unlike a court-martial, does not include the possibility of an officer or sailor's retirement and are normally non-punitive and not publically known. The punishments for the 17 officers and sailors who were charged included letters of reprimand and two-day loss of license to drive (Navy Magazine).

But in one case, the results of the NBP took on a different dimension; in that of Loeppke, whom the Navy called a ""staple"" -- the person who carries out the day-to-day function of a commander, but is not involved with command -- Loeppke's punishment included a reduction in his rating, the removal of his job title, and the cancellation of his command tour. His punishment was confirmed as ""approved for publication"" on March 10.

Loeppke joined the Navy in 1984 and went for promotion to lieutenant commander in 1999. In his work on the submarine, he reportedly helped to create a system of keeping track of his and other technicians' inspections with the help of junior officers, and he played a role in ensuring the inspection records were prepared and signed off for submission to senior officers, according to the Navy's investigation and in the trial testimony.

According to Navy Times, one of the most important moments in the Loeppke's prosecution occurred on the morning of September 14, 2007, when the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) interviewed him. He is alleged to have told investigators that ""six to ten"" junior officers had played a role in fabricating inspection documents.

He reportedly wrote a letter of recommendation for another officer which claimed that he had ""supervised over 100 inspections"" between January 2005 and July 2006, the report of the official findings said. In an interview with Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigators shortly afterward, he described his own experiences as having been ""a'staple,' "" and to have ""performed various roles ranging from the preparation and signing off on inspections to the preparation of work documentation.""

One of the officer's assistants would prepare the documents, and the inspection records would be signed off by the subordinate naval officers. At trials in 2007 and 2008, Loeppke denied that they helped create the falsified records.

During the 2007 court-martial, Loeppke admitted to the Navy's charge, but did not testify, ""noting that he did not recall any specific acts that had occurred."" In 2009, the judge in the case recommended a punitive letter of reprimand and loss of rank that would ""not preclude future promotion.""

Loeppke's commanding officer was removed from command in the wake of the scandal and court-martial, and he was demoted from commander to lieutenant commander. He has been barred indefinitely from command and the ""supervision of enlisted personnel at any level"" (Navy Times).

In response to questions he received from the Senate Armed Services Committee this week, the Navy commander in charge of investigating the case, Vice Admiral James J. Lyons III, said ""The allegations involving Lt. Michael Loeppke's conduct are very serious, and the Navy is",1

A newspaper article provides valuable information for historians, policymakers, and journalists. However, be sure to read this overview before writing an article or a section of your history. You need to know more about research and writing topics such as how historians read, how policymakers read and how journalists report history. Also, understand the purpose for the section you are writing. A historical report can include:

The date of an event such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy

A person’s name such as the name of a U. S. President, an important person, or a well-known organization

Citations from a library or other reliable resources, such as a website, if you are discussing someone’s appearance on television or radio, newspapers, or in a magazine

A description of a government official, place, or event

A statistic or fact

Here are a few more details to consider when writing an article or a section of a newspaper.

Writing for Newspapers

It is important to know how newspapers report history: they often include only the facts, sometimes the date and place, and sometimes the date and place and sometimes the name of a person.

A newspaper article usually is about a specific topic and includes news about a person or event that occurred during a limited time on a certain date. The information is sometimes presented in a simple but effective headline.

Writing an AP article is similar to writing for newspapers, but you should use AP style.

Writing for History

Understanding the purpose of your writing is vital to the quality and effectiveness of your work.

You should know why and how to write a history report. Here are some reasons for writing a history report:

You are a student researching a subject area for class or for a major project

You are writing a report for your employer as part of your job

You are writing material for a website

History research projects are often presented in an oral report, a paper or a report for a class (that will not have exams), or a project that will include a report to a professor or a group.

The purpose of a history is to record events, person, places, and things, and to describe them or explain them. Also important is to write with empathy, or feel with your audience.

Writing History History Projects

An important element is the “author’s voice.” Write articles such as those for history projects to develop your author’s voice. For example, you might create an article for a history project about a person, an important event, a place, a period in history, and a topic. Keep in mind this is an excellent opportunity to use some of the information skills and to practice research methods as you explore a specific subject over a limited period of time.

This is a form of writing that includes analysis and discussion. It is best to find an interesting topic and then to research the topic extensively to learn the background and discover how someone may remember or interpret an incident, a period in history. When you know all the basic information about how to research and write history, this is a great strategy for a history report because it will be a well-researched report that will impress your professor and classmates as well as your audience.

How historians study and report history

Before writing a history report, there are many skills and strategies to know and understand how to write a history report. Historians read both primary and secondary sources. They use primary sources (referred to as “original documents”) and sometimes secondary or more recent sources (referred to as “contemporary evidence”.)

Primary Sources

Historians use primary sources as the foundation for writing a history report.

Primary sources include those original documents and materials that tell you about a person (sometimes a series of people), a place, an event, or a historical phenomenon. You often use official published documents and manuscripts such as letters and government documents (also referred to as published sources). You can also use records of an organization, institutions, or public and private documents such as newspapers and journals.

In addition, historians often use non-narrative or descriptive primary documents such as court records of a trial, court rulings, speeches, laws, and government legislation. In addition, there are legal documents including contracts, deeds, wills, official letters, and legal orders.

Important sources include government documents, court records, government legislation such as treaties and charters, historical publications, and a record of an organization",1
"Summary: Kelly Pless started gaining as a teen and weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest. Exercise and an ""eat to live"" eating philosophy helped her shed 95 pounds. Pless started out walking but now runs 40 miles a week. She is training to run two marathons this winter. Article: 

Summary

Kelly Pless started the year with the aim of slimming down and increasing her running ability. Kelly worked with her doctor to make a weight management program. ""Eat to live,"" Kelly's philosophy, requires her to eat to live, rather than live to eat. This includes eating small healthy meals and snacks every day. Kelly likes to drink smoothies with fresh fruits and veggies. Kelly also gets to meet with a friend that is committed to weight loss and to her health. A friend committed to her is good motivation to do well in her first marathon.

The most important word that the author uses is the short answer word: ""I want to"" The key word of the paragraph is ""work"": working out, working, was. The first sentence ends with a verb: ""I worked for a year."" The author states she wants to accomplish something as he writes, ""I want to lose 15 pounds.""The author explains why she wants to ""lose weight."" ""I worked out for a year...."" The author states, ""I was working out..."" After telling of how she lost the first 20 pounds, she then talks about working out on her own: ""I started gaining after I graduated from high school.""The author states, ""I worked at a gym."" She worked out there, but it wasn’t enough to get all the weight off: ""I gained 10 more pounds."" She then says, ""I don’t like gym."" She was disappointed and didn't want to work at another gym.Kelly stated about the gym saying, ""I didn’t like that place."" She used a ""don’t like"" phrase. She didn't like that gym. It is a verb. I don't...or, it is used for the past. She had a gym when she was younger, but her parents wouldn't take her there because it was the only gym in town. The gym doesn't like Kelly.She worked in a different gym and didn't get the results she wanted. She didn’t want to work out there anymore.I have to lose weight or work out.Kelly has to lose weight in order to run a marathon.The author is working out at the gym. She has lost 22.5 pounds and is now weighing in at 159.5 pounds. She is pleased about this because she said, ""My goal is to lose 30 pounds.""

She wants to run a lot and this, ""My running schedule is 30 minutes on the treadmill, 30 minutes jogging in the yard and then a nice evening bike ride.""

The author has worked out for a year, so Kelly knows how to lose weight. Kelly had a goal to lose 30 pounds.She states, ""I want to lose weight."" The author is working out and has a goal. She wants to improve her fitness level, her running ability and her fitness and her weight.

Kelly is working out to improve her health. She wants to lose weight, which means she wants to accomplish her goal. People often say that they want to ""lose weight,"" but in truth they do not really want to ""lose weight."" They want to ""lose"" the weight, but they want to keep it for good. This story about Kelly shows that she is very serious about ""losing"" the weight and getting rid of it.

She uses this word in the next paragraph. She wants to do something about this situation, so she needs to make a plan. She decides that she is going to weigh weekly. Kelly needs to write down everything she eats or drinks and then she needs to weight each morning and make a plan. She puts goals on her calendar for her to accomplish this. This would be very helpful for all people who are losing weight and the most important thing for Kelly to do is to watch her caloric intake daily.

I would have found this information more compelling if the main character was a young athlete who has an amazing work ethic. This information is very important if a person is trying to lose weight to prepare for a certain competition. I could imagine this girl at her next competition saying, “Here are some tips for your preparation.”

I'm wondering how good she is at running, because she says, ""My running schedule is 30 minutes on the treadmill, 30 minutes on the bike and then 30 minutes of jogging in the yard."" If she is not good at running, then this seems very strange to me.

The author says that she wants to run in two marathons. She says she is training for two marathons at once. She does this two months before the",1
"Summary: Singapore Airlines A380 superjumbo completes historic maiden flight. Luxury first class cabins have separate leather seats and double beds. One passenger paid $100,000 for the first Singapore to Sydney trip. Article:  Singapore Airlines hopes the world’s longest non-stop A380 passenger flight will encourage further use of its network.

A. This is an important article to read. It is written by the editor responsible for this page. He is responsible for publishing news articles for every topic that is relevant to your life. This means that everyone reading this summary should be able to write an article for our media library on the same topic.

B. This is the first article of its kind. It summarizes a large number of recent news articles found on the internet. Each of these individual news articles is listed below. Many people find this kind of summary to be very time-saving.

C. For more detailed explanations of articles that appear below, simply click on the link. This will always either load the full original news article on a new page, or it will display our summary of the news article on the article’s current page. (Note that some articles have not yet been summarized and will appear on the page along with the rest of the articles.)

D. This summary is useful for everyone reading it. Everyone should be able to understand it and use it to write their own articles on the topic.

A. “The Singapore Airlines A380 “Super Jumbo” makes its historic debut, completing its maiden flight on 4 December 2013. Singapore Airlines (SIA) hopes that the world’s longest non-stop passenger flight will encourage further uses of its network - a feat made possible by SIA’s investment in the A380 aircraft. The aircraft, a wide-body double-decker Airbus with a flight range that exceeds 11,000 nautical miles. Features a lounge that allows its patrons to enjoy premium drinks and snacks, including fresh, hot meals, in a first class flight experience.” [Summary from Aviationwire.com on 27-12-13]

B. SIA’s maiden flight was a huge event. The flight was not just a record breaking event, but also a milestone event for all Singapore Airlines passengers. Most importantly, it was the beginning of a new phase for the airline as a brand. The flight was the culmination of SIA’s $5Bn investment in the A380, which was completed in September 2012.

C. Most analysts believe that SIA’s investment in the A380 was a very wise strategic move. They believe that a few factors that influenced this development. Foremost amongst them was the rise of fuel prices, which caused many airlines to consider reducing the size of their fleet. Singapore’s growth and position in trade also played a big role. SIA’s strategy was to grow the revenue of its business unit and it also aimed to improve the brand image of the airline. Therefore, it adopted a growth strategy that would allow it to achieve this two-fold aim.

D. For many airline industry experts, the most important new advantage of the A380 is that it gives the SIA passengers a sense of comfort and luxury at very reasonable prices. Its design allows passengers inside a very private environment, with more than enough available space for them to relax, work, sleep, or simply engage with other passengers.

A. “The luxury first class aircraft offers up to ten “premium” leather seats with separate seating and a choice of single or double bed. First-class passengers can choose to stay in their separate “boutique” room and spend their time enjoying premium drink selections and gourmet food, and access the first class check-in lounge. Passengers in the first class cabin will also travel free of charge. The flight crew members will provide a welcome beverage on board. First class lounge facilities include a champagne bar as well as a complimentary food and drinks service, with a chef on hand to provide the passengers’ meal and snacks.” [Summary from thedailytelegraph.com.au on 06-07-12]

B. During the first year, the airline had spent an average of around $800,000 to fly its passengers on the first class flights. This figure increased to around $1.4m during the second year, and reached a peak of $12.25m in both 2013 and 2014.

C. The airline’s decision to make its flights on the A380 a first class only flight was a very good decision. It allows the airline passengers to access the amenities of the first class cabin, at a price that the first class passengers can afford. The result of this is that the passengers are able to enjoy first class products and services at a reasonable price. This enables passengers to enjoy extra comfort and privacy.

"Summary: Illegal exports to Iran, China an increasing problem, Justice Department says. Pittsburgh company cited for export of products with nuclear applications. Utah men charged with attempting to illegally export jet fighter parts. Article:  The United States has long regulated the export of sensitive defense items, to protect national security. But President Barack Obama says he is cracking down on illegal exports to rogue states.

US Attorney General Jeff Sessions made the announcement last month. He said the Justice Department was stepping up efforts to “crack down on Chinese and Iranian companies engaged in deceptive practices” by knowingly exporting high tech equipment and other goods that are sensitive for national security.

“We have a duty to protect the integrity of our national defense systems, and to secure them against potential threats,” Sessions added.

To help the US government track the international trade of some of its most sensitive goods the US government requires detailed information about how some defense items are being sent through commercial channels.

The Defense Critical Items List (DCIL) is published by the US Department of State. It contains a list of items that are defined as either “essential” or “highly sensitive”. According to the White House’s fact sheet, DCI or DCIL goods include components for aerospace and aviation engines, electronic components, military and other goods, including nuclear, biological, and chemical materiel.

“Highly sensitive” and “essential” items are specifically controlled under various international treaties and US export controls.

Sessions says that in the past two years, the Justice Department has initiated about 15 criminal cases to enforce the export control regime.

The department is still investigating violations of DCIL in this case. But the department has charged a Pittsburgh company and the Utah men with criminal violations, and has filed some regulatory actions against them.

In the criminal case, Pitt International Ltd., is charged with conspiring to export US goods controlled by the DCIL to China and Iran, in violation of Sections 5032, 5861, and 5861A of the US Code.

According to the criminal charging documents, Pitt allegedly exported a thermal flow meter from 2012-2015 using an export control license that expired in 2013. The meter was a product included in a US Navy contract related to gas turbine engines and engines from a US air force fighter jet. In 2013 when Pitt attempted to purchase new DCIL licenses for its exports to Iran and China, it was denied.

The US Air Force then notified Customs about the violation.

In 2016, the Justice Department accused Pitt of exporting another thermal flow meter, a product included in a US Navy contract to build a gas turbine engine. That meter was also included in the US naval jet fighter engine contract.

Pitt’s CEO is Edward “Ed” G. Leggio Jr., and the company is based in Pittsburg, Pennsylvia.

Leggio and his son Ed Leggio Jr. are being charged in the US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.

They face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $250,000.

The Leggios were charged in an indictment that was unsealed on March 1.

According to the unsealed court papers, Pitt International exported five air compressors, each valued at $75,000, from 2013-2014 to Iran.

Ed Leggio Jr. and his son are also charged in a criminal complaint filed in the US District Court for the District of Utah on October 17. They are accused of trying to export two jet parts.

The indictment charges that the parts being exported from Utah by two defendants were for use in US military aircraft.

A search warrant affidavit filed in that case indicates that in May 2015 US law enforcement agents interviewed Leggio at his business to see if he knew anything about the attempt by two defendants to export the jet parts.

According to the US Attorney Office: “Upon questioning of the individuals, investigators learned the two accused individuals had allegedly attempted to place the two components inside their private aircraft for transport to China.”

Prosecutors charged both defendants with one count of conspiracy to commit an illegal export act in violation of US law.

A criminal complaint is a charging information used to arrest and indict someone. Charges are later dropped and in a criminal complaint there are not any allegations that an individual has committed a crime. A criminal complaint typically contains a lot of extra facts not contained in the indictment.

The other Utah defendant is Jeffrey Joseph Anderson, 49. He is a former Boeing employee from Draper, Utah. He and one of his teenage sons are also under indictment.

According to statements prosecutors filed in the Utah case, the son, Tyler James Anderson, and his father sold items on eBay at least four times in the past that were “related to the manufacture of military aircraft” and one of the",1

"Summary: Genarlow Wilson: Accepting plea deal would have left him without a home. Wilson, 21, promises to be more conservative, alert and thankful in future. He plans to study sociology in college -- ""I feel like I've been living my major"" Wilson served two years in prison after consensual oral sex with teen girl. Article:  ""To accept this plea deal would have been devastating,"" a source close to him told the New Black Star. ""Genarlow has matured a lot. He's a smart guy who's going to make it.""

This case should be a wake up call for those who believe consensual sex between adults and teenagers is harmless.

Wilson, 21, is a college student who served prison time for one year for consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl, despite his attorney's adamant denial that his client's actions violated the law. He reportedly has since accepted a plea deal of only 16 hours-worth of community service. He will also have no more contact with the 15-year-old victim.

Wilson is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 4 at 1:30 pm.

At the time of his arrest, Wilson was attending Miami's H. Wayne Justice Campus of Miami-Dade Community College, a school that bills itself as, ""A World Class College, Where Students Succeed."" He previously had served jail time for a sexual battery that occurred when he was 19, but that crime did not involve a victim under the age of 16-years-old. Wilson attended high school at Miami Edison Senior High until 11th grade. He has an adopted younger brother, who is in eighth grade too.

Prosecutors charged Wilson with four misdemeanor counts of second-degree felony sexual battery for the December 2013 incident.

The victim was 15-years-old at the time, but 18-years-old, and a student at Miami Edison Middle School, when the offense took place.

According a source at the school, she has since quit the school and moved to Atlanta with her parents.

In an interview, an Atlanta Police detective had described her age as between 17 and 19 years old, and the two are believed to have had a relationship earlier that year.

Prior to having sex with her in December, in 2011, Wilson had been involved with her and another girl -- both under 16-years-old at the time.

The police report stated that he received oral sex from her in front of his house, and two weeks earlier, was seen holding her phone. The victim testified she exchanged nearly 1,500 text messages with Wilson.

Wilson was arrested on Aug. 23 after the victim told a friend, who told her mother.

According to police, Wilson told them, ""It won't happen again.""

Miami Metro Police Department's Crime Analyst and Sex Crimes Section Lead Detective, Lt. Cmdr. Kevin McCreary said he could not recall a similar case, when a defendant was accused of sexual battery of a victim under 16-years-old while he was under the age of 30. The age of consent in Florida is 18, but if a teen is under the age of 10, than the parent's consent is required to have consensual sex.

Wilson was initially charged with one count of first-degree sexual battery for the crime committed in December 2013, but that charge was reduced to two counts of second-degree sexual battery. On June 20, 2015, following a pre-trial hearing, he pled guilty to two counts of felony aggravated battery and one count of misdemeanor battery.

""The first time I had sex with her I was 19. It was my first time. The second time, we tried having sex, and she didn't want to. She was a virgin when I had sex with her because she said. It wasn't even real,"" he told a detective.

However, despite Wilson's earlier admission to police, his attorney, Mark O'Mara told the Miami New Times. ""To suggest that my client has admitted to anything is a flat-out and flat-out and flat-out false statement,"" he said.

O'Mara said he did not disclose the victim's age because it had no relevance to the case. ""It was a consensual sexual act of an adult with another consenting adult,"" O'Mara said.

""She is 18-years-old. He would never do anything with a child that wasn't consenting,"" he also said.

However, the Miami New Times reported that another source said Wilson's case is believed to be the latest in a string of ""vendetta"" cases that he and his family had faced. He said his lawyer told Wilson never to speak to newspapers again, and that he took the newspaper reporter on a drive to try to persuade him.

"Summary: British graphic artist's identity remains a mystery despite huge popularity. Feted by the art world and Hollywood celebrities count among his collectors. Despite popularity local authorities have removed his public works. Article: 

A:

Is this possible because they think it is an art work 
rather than a graffiti, and therefore legally
prohibited... so it needs to be ""cleared away""
as he may be breaking a law by exposing a
public work (which is owned by a public
council) to the public by adding his art
to it by drawing in the public space?  

or because they think it is unsightly?

or because they can't afford all that is needed to
maintain it. So just to save money they
have it removed.

Is it because of a lack of maintenance.

A:

""Because they think it is an art work rather than graffiti"" -- No. There is nothing in their description that implies it's an artwork.  If you mean to say that the local authorities don't see it as something that could get them into legal trouble, well, in theory that's true.  But it does not imply that the artist is a troublemaker: his art may be perfectly safe, and he may even be the most responsible person on the block.  If the authorities are going to keep a careful eye out for something like that, I'm sure he'd understand.
""because they don't ""find"" the painting to be aesthetically pleasing""  -- This is more a failure on the local authorities' part as there obviously is something there to find.
""Or because they can't afford all that is needed to maintain"" -- There is no need to be economical.  This could be an indication that the painting is of dubious or potentially dangerous value, as the police tend to be very strict about what they are willing to ignore.  But if the artist is a ""silly boy"" who's not worth bothering about, then that may be a good sign.
""Is it because of a lack of maintenance.  Can they not afford to ""maintain"" the artwork because they think it ""may"" be something dangerous, or ""theft"" material.  They don't want you and me seeing it and damaging the thing."" -- This is a complete out-of-left-field possibility. If I'm not mistaken, he hasn't been arrested so far and been charged for his artwork.  The fact that the artist has been put to jail for what he's doing before suggests that this is indeed a plausible reason for this ban.

Write a news article based on the following summary: A new research report on waste incinerators shows that, overall, incinerators in Europe are reducing, rather than increasing, greenhouse gas emissions. The research report is by the Climate Action Network Europe. Its publication is timed to coincide with news from an EU summit that is supposed to push to make the EU a world leader in combating climate change; this requires a 25% cut in CO2 emissions by 2020.

Write a brief newspaper item regarding the following summary: There is growing discontent in Europe over the high cost charged by major construction companies for large-scale public works projects. A report in Europe is claiming that there is little transparency or competition within the sector. The report, by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), claims that construction firms charge ""exorbitant"" prices for large, sometimes controversial, infrastructure projects such as rail networks, dams and airports. The EESC has written to national governments calling for a crackdown on the sector.

Develop a press release aimed at journalists regarding the following: EU leaders are holding an EU summit in Brussels this week which is meant to be an ""agenda setting"" session on how to curb greenhouse gases. They have already promised the EU public that there will be no repeat of the 1990's situation when the EU was held back from setting a meaningful climate change target. And European Commission Chief Romano Prodi has already said he is not a supporter of a binding climate change treaty within the EU. The summit is also expected to discuss the issue of whether Europe should adopt a binding emissions-trading system similar to that in the United States.

Develop a press release aimed at journalists regarding the following: A report is to be published today by the EESC, which claims the European Commission has over the last five years granted a share of EU funds to big companies. The company, it says, is using this profit -- known as the profit-to-assets ratio -- to bid for public procurement tendering projects. The EESC is accusing the EU of turning its back on open and fair competition. The report has been prompted by widespread public concerns over recent tenders in which big firms are appearing as successful bidders where their size gives them a competitive advantage over smaller competitors. ""We were surprised when these rules of transparency made by the Commission were relaxed and its own rules were put aside,"" said the EESC executive, Simon Wren-Lewis.

"Summary: Russia to send bomber aircraft on long-range flights on a permanent basis. President Vladimir Putin said the move was in response to security threats. The White House says the flights do not pose a threat to the United States. Article: 

Russian President Vladimir Putin has made an emergency trip to Paris to discuss the Ukraine crisis.

""They were afraid of this when you had tanks on Maidan [Square], but today it's the bombers -- and it all has to do with their ambitions. As you know, this is the old problem of Crimea. And in our view, [Ukraine] is Ukraine,"" the president said.

The president said any further steps taken in Crimea would harm normal economic relations and ties between nations, including Russia and Ukraine.

He said it was necessary to use maximum force to prevent further bloodshed.

""If the conflict were left to other people, we wouldn't be living our dream now, would we?"" Putin asked.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday: ""These planes have the same kind of capability that the U.S. has. What they do not have is what Americans have in their inventories.""

Obama and Putin have previously said that the flights are simply part of standard air-defense drill. The U.S. State Department said an earlier flight was canceled Saturday, but it later said the flight was scheduled.

The Obama administration has said it never agreed to cancel the flight.

Moscow's claim on Crimea is supported by its military forces who have installed their own administration, while Ukraine's forces have been driven from the area.

Putin said that he did not want any outside government ""putting pressure"" on him to halt the military maneuvers. He said he is ""absolutely confident the situation will be taken in hand by the responsible authorities.""

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Write a news article based on the following summary: President Vladimir Putin says Russia will fly long-range bomber aircraft into international airspace in ""response (to) the security threats."" He says the flights do not pose a threat to the U.S. The White House says the flights do not pose a threat to the U.S. and the planes are not nuclear-capable. President Barack Obama called the bomber flights ""provocative."" Putin said the flights were in response to perceived threats from Ukraine's new leaders.

Russia will soon start flying long-range bomber aircraft into international airspace in ""response (to) the security threats,"" President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with visiting military officials Tuesday. He accused the aircraft of being designed to use ""deadly force"" against the U.S. while its pilots are unaware of who might be their intended targets. ""Nobody is going to take responsibility,"" Putin said at a meeting with military officials. ""Well, if you want, I am taking responsibility.""

Putin's comments came in response to a question from a pilot at the meeting, who told the president that long-range planes flying near Western countries would prompt ""a reaction"" from Western countries.

Putin said that he and other Russian officials have discussed the issue of flying bombers in international airspace, adding that he is ""absolutely certain"" the flights will be made. He says the aircraft are already in their flight path during ""daily maneuvers"" conducted in ""full awareness that they could be mistaken for a threat.""

The bombers, he said, are ""not on a collision course with anyone."" He said they are designed to use ""deadly force"" against ""those (who) threaten us"" but that their pilots are unaware of who might be their intended targets. He said the Russians are not threatening the U.S. He made the remarks at the meeting with military officials.

Putin emphasized Russia would never use the bombers against another country, though he added, ""You do not need to worry about us and I do not want any outside government put pressure"" to stop the flights. ""We don't want to start a quarrel but would not want to create a threat that causes harm to our neighbor,"" the president said.

The planes, he said, have the same capability of the U.S. -- about which he said, ""Their planes have the same kind of capability that the U.S. has. What they do not have is what Americans have in their inventories.""

He said Russia will use the flights, which are scheduled to begin in four days, in a ""peaceful way,"" adding the maneuvers represent Moscow's response ""to real and immediate threats.""

""You know what, folks, people are always coming up with stupid ideas or making some kind of statements that they're going to invade Crimea. Well, Crimea is a part of Ukraine,"" Obama said. ""And our position has not changed. Crimea is a part of Ukraine. We believe that we shouldn't",1

"Summary: North Korean crew recaptures hijacked vessel. Navy says two pirates killed, five captured; three from crew injured. USS Arleigh Burke enters Somali territorial waters to pursue other pirates. Pirates aboard hijacked Golden Nori carrying highly flammable benzene. Article:  One of the pirates dies at the hands of a rescue team and another is shot and killed while attempting to hijack ship. Search for other pirates continues.

(a) According to the Navy’s press release, on October 13 the PNS Badr (ROK Navy), the PNS Tigr (Israel Navy), the USS Sterett (US Navy), a Swedish frigate, and a South Korean destroyer took off from Sasebo and headed into the Gulf of Aden and made three successful gun attacks on two dhows.

(b) The PNS Badr then found and captured an abandoned trawler carrying more than 1,500 barrels of benzene located about 40 kilometers southeast of the Yemen coast, just off the Somali Peninsula.

(c) The trawler was flying the flag of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who paid $1.1 million ransom for the pirates to leave the ship, which was manned by four Filipinos, two Turks, two Malaysians, and a Filipino crewmember.

(d) The Navy says two of the pirates were killed in action by a Philippine Navy (PN) ship, the PNS Dapitan. The two pirates died of gunshot wounds, according to PN spokesperson Lieutenant Commander Edgardo Burgos.

(e) Two PN personnel were also injured in the encounter, after they were hit with gunfire by one of the pirates, who was eventually killed. One of the injured sailors was airlifted to the main naval hospital in Sasebo; another was treated in a local hospital, while the remaining sailor has been sent home after a doctor ruled out permanent injuries.

(f) On October 14, two PNS vessels searched the Arabian Sea for a second pirate vessel. While the first PNS Dapitan had already spotted a dhow and had shot it down just 12 hours earlier, the second PNS Dapitan was looking for a vessel about 120 kilometers south of Somalia where another dhow was suspected of carrying more benzene, worth about $9 million. Despite a lot of radio communication between US and South Korean vessels and the alleged pirates, they were still unable to find the dhow.

(g) On October 17, one day after the second trawler had been captured, the USS Sterett sent a “rescue team” into an area near the port town of Hudur, where the Philippines-flagged container ship Golden Nori was hijacked. The mission was aborted before it could be carried out. A rescue operation will be carried out soon. The USS Sterett will return to the Gulf of Aden in the coming days.

(h) The Philippines is looking for at least 11 pirates aboard the hijacked ship, while at least one crewmember is still at large.

(i) Three Malaysians, two Filipinos, and two Turks were on board the hijacked dhow.

(j) The captain of the Golden Nori has also said that three Filipinos, one of whom was the chief engineer, were inside the dhow; they were tied up and wounded. Six Filipinos, two Malaysians, and a Turkish were also on board the dhow.

(k) The crewmembers are currently being interrogated, and a ship-wide search for remaining pirates is being conducted.

(l) According to the Navy, piracy incidents have become more and more common off the Horn of Africa, but this year, pirates have not killed or forced a release of any hostages since June, as per usual.

(m) The number of pirates attacking vessels from pirates vessels (PVVs) has greatly decreased since 2004, when there were nearly 40% more PVVs compared to 2009.

(n) The Navy says the most piracy attacks are taking place in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, while there has been a decrease in attacks off the Somali coast.

(o) The Gulf of Aden, which is an international waterway connecting the Red Sea through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea, is an active area for maritime security, especially for the US Navy which has deployed ships to the Gulf of Aden to enforce sanctions against Syria in cooperation with other nations.

(p) Maritime transport through international waters of the Gulf of Aden is the second largest trade artery in the world, after the Strait of Malacca.

(q) The Navy says the US has a total of 22 ships conducting law enforcement operations in the Gulf of Aden. This year, more than 10 ships conducted anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden. This is the highest number of U.S. Navy ships in",1

Some kids have been driven into seclusion and told to stay away from the place and to stop telling people what's happening around this park. After more than a month they have been unable to tell the cops what Stokes is doing with this girl.

""Judge spares Debra Lafave from jail, warns her ""don't come back""

- Court spares former high school teacher from jail, warns her not 'to come back""

- (4-2-2006)-""When David Stokes, 18, told a New York City courtroom one January morning that he had been forced to have sex with a 17-year-old former high school student, the woman in the courtroom was horrified.

But the state judge in the case - who later decided not to send her to jail for violating her probation - was not shocked.

Nor was she angry.

After all, Debra G. Lafave, 37, had already been arrested in October for having sex with Stokes, a student who was 14. As a condition of bail, Lafave, the former music teacher at East Orange Middle School, was forbidden from having contact with anyone under 18.

In the last week of January, she violated that rule by going on a date with the boy who was Stokes's accomplice. Stokes has since been sentenced to a yearlong jail term for coercing the teenager.""
- (4-2-2006)

""But the city court judge who heard that testimony, who decided not to place Mrs. Lafave in jail for violating her probation, was not shocked.

He said he had previously dealt with her probation violations, and felt that she had not learned her lesson.

For, in that case, the judge heard on Nov. 11, the man who was under age when the woman had sex with him was a 16-year-old; though the statute of limitations had run its course, both were charged separately from the girl, whose identity has never been revealed.

The judge gave Mrs. Lafave and Mr. Stokes a stern warning:

'Do not contact each other for one second,' the judge said.

'This is the second chance you have; don't come back.'""""

""In the end, Judge Judith S. Beck's opinion turned out to be the right one for all concerned. Mr. Stokes' case was not decided in the criminal court, but in the city court, which dealt with all juvenile cases. Judge Beck considered placing Mr. Stokes in the 'family division of this court for up to 12 months, or until age 21.' But she opted instead to place him on probation.

'That seems to be a more appropriate disposition,' the judge said, adding that she needed the city to cooperate better with the court.

She asked for the city to 'take it up more seriously' with the court about getting people to come for their hearings on time, and said she needed more court officers to speed up the process.

'There was no excuse for what actually happened,' she said, describing Mr. Stokes as 'the catalyst' for her decision. 'I have no doubt in my mind that had his situation not been quite so extreme, this defendant would have come forward. I do not believe I erred or would have committed an injustice if I had sent him to jail. This disposition was the right one for all concerned.'

Under New York City law, any person between the ages of 13 and 18 accused of criminal conduct that doesn't qualify for the delinquency docket may be tried in juvenile court.""

Cassidy walked in on doughnut shop robbery last week and was shot, police say. Philadelphia police alerted Miami counterparts that Lewis was headed that way. Article:  Lewis allegedly had his mother, girlfriend and a nephew with him and they were all taken into custody. Miami officers showed Cassidy’s picture and Lewis’ mother pointed him out immediately. It was announced that Cassidy had died from his wound. His mother confirmed this and his girlfriend cried. He had been waiting to be processed for robbery, with Lewis facing a robbery charge because he was seen getting money from a register before opening fire. Cassidy’s mother told the press that “He’s the person who really started the fight. He’s the person who provoked this. The police, the city can’t protect them. They should arrest a killer, not a young man.” Miami police announced that Lewis had been arrested by Miami Beach police on a warrant that had already been issued for other charges. Detectives took the warrant from Miami police to Pennsylvania and found that it belonged to another John who was wanted in the Philadelphia area for robberies. Philadelphia police were notified of this and responded to the location. It turned out that Lewis’ alleged victim in Philadelphia was Cassidy. The police found out about the warrant in Miami and responded. Detectives went to arrest Lewis and he resisted so they tasered him. The two detectives found a loaded gun under the front passenger seat of the rental car Lewis was in. They then transported him to a prison hospital where officials found some crack in his system and booked him for all these charges. They also found that Cassidy’s gun had fingerprints on the trigger which matched Lewis’.

The following article is from The Onion and was posted to The Onion 2/5/2006 12:12 pm.

""Bush: Senate 'wasting valuable time' with children's health care bill.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Bush announced today that a vote in the senate on a bill to address the current health care crisis may now be delayed until November by a lackadaisical Congress squandering time deliberating the best course of action for children.

""The failure of this Congress to pass a responsible measure that will adequately provide for our children's lives and health is a shameful abdication of their most basic responsibility,"" said the president. ""This senate is wasting its valuable time with these children when it should be in session passing an important piece of legislation that would serve as an immediate remedy to the crisis.""

Though, as of right now, the senate majority leader has not publicly committed to a vote on a measure this year, the president believes there is no time better to pass a responsible measure to address the crisis than now.

""We've got an absolute necessity to address this issue before summer ends. It's irresponsible of Congress to be holding back an issue of this great importance to the best interests of our children. We all know that if it weren't for the children there would be no crisis. What a shame this Congress seems bent on ignoring them.""

One of the provisions of the measure would fund a comprehensive study of alternative methods to address the health needs of children, while another would fund improvements to the infrastructure of children's hospitals across the nation.

""It would be easy for this senate to pass a bill for the children, but we haven't. The sad truth is this vote could come at any time now. As it gets closer, we have to keep a close watch so that they don't stall it.""

However, the president has offered up suggestions as to how the senate could ensure this measure's successful passage.

""Passing this measure is essential to getting control of the crisis,"" said the president. ""It's imperative that senators take the necessary time in the recess to vote on a responsible bill.""

Bush's proposals include giving the senate a deadline by which they must pass a measure, requiring a yea-nay vote on the measure in order for it to be passed, and making it illegal for anyone to debate the issue again if it is failed to pass in a timely manner.

Further, the president said he would support any additional measures that may need to be passed to ensure passage of the bill.

""We have to let the senate know that if they don't address this issue in a timely manner, we will act. I promise to do whatever it takes to pass a meaningful and responsible bill designed to address this crisis.""

Despite the president's call for action, lawmakers, including the republican majority leader, have dismissed Bush's proposals by pointing to the ""obvious"" solution: letting the legislation fail and creating a crisis among children.

But the president has expressed skepticism regarding the idea of letting the legislation fail.

""That's a rather cynical and irresponsible solution that would make the children suffer even longer. I know these senators and they would not let that happen. This senate's priority is to ensure the children get the help they need.""

While the senate has not indicated whether or not they will vote to pass the measure, one of the democrats in the house has indicated an openness to the ideas presented by the president.

""As difficult as it is to accept, the idea of letting the children suffer is one that I am willing to embrace. The senate should not be afraid to let the children know they really mean it when they say they have their priority.""

While admitting he is not surprised by the reaction of the senate, Bush stated that the democrats' actions were no different than those of the senate in the past.""

""It's too bad you republicans have such a difficult time agreeing on an issue that we all know needs to be addressed immediately,"" said the president. ""The senate and I can probably work this out, but if there's no bill passed by the senate by November, then the democrats will have one more reason to be critical of this congress for all of eternity. I hope to be able to tell all our children one day that this senate at least did its best to try to address this",1
"Summary: Social worker says sniper Lee Boyd Malvo is a changed person. Ten people were killed in Washington-area sniper attacks in 2002. In a letter to CNN, Malvo writes he's still ""grappling with shame, guilt, remorse"" Article:  but ""the anger and hatred"" is gone. He admits he shot the victims on his way to a military recruiting station, a military school and a bank. A lawyer for Malvo is quoted as saying he's hoping to eventually be ""a contributing member of society"". CNN, 5 April, 2003.

Brief answer:

He is just a ""manic depressive"" that acts on impulse. He should not have killed those people.

This is a crime, he should be held responsible.

You don't agree with what he did?

I personally feel that he did the best that he could at the time. I don't know what he feels right now. I will be interested to see how he will be handling this in another year. It may not be too much of a stretch to believe that he may be different now.

My opinion: There are times when people have to feel guilty over certain things. Some things could not be avoided - for that reason, you don't have to feel guilty over it. While I am not in any way suggesting that Malvo does not deserve forgiveness, he has still served his term. Forgiveness does not mean that what you did was good and acceptable at the time.

Brief answer: Yes.

This is a crime, he should be held responsible.

Yes. You may also be able to look into what has changed about his mindset.

My opinion: Yes. It is a crime, and he should still be held responsible.

Brief answer: Yes.

This is a crime, he should be held responsible.

No, it would just prove his statement that people tend to use guns to protect from being hurt, and guns should really be banned. There should be more safe alternatives like the one's he used to hurt his victims. When people are suffering from mental problems, they shouldn't be allowed to own guns, they should have their guns taken away and help them get the help they need to keep from hurting others. Yes...

This is the worst kind of crime, you really don't see any other person that would be capable to kill ten persons and then go and sit at a recruiting station. If he was mentally affected to where he did this, he has to be treated. He has to be locked away and get therapy. This type of crime will never leave a person.

"Summary: Striker Cristiano Lucarelli keeps his place in Italy's squad to face Scotland. Lucarelli impressed by scoring twice in the recent victory over South Africa. Juventus striker Raffaele Palladino earns his first call-up to the senior squad. Article: 

Introduction

Italy will face Scotland in another friendly match on Saturday evening in Verona, Italy. This will be Italy's fifth match since their return to international football from qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and the second this year. Italy travelled to South Africa for the 2010 Fifa World Cup Asian Qualifiers last week and won 4-1 – scoring 3 goals in the opening half of the match. Italy squad to face Scotland

Raffaele Palladino, Luca Toni, Enrico Brignola, Cristiano Lucarelli, Alessio Cerci, Angelo Ogbonna, Antonio Di Natale, Mario Balotelli, Alessandro Diamanti, Claudio Marchisio, Sergio Agüero and Andrea Pirlo are the players in the squad.

Team News: Scotland are preparing for their World Cup qualification round, starting with a home match against Belarus on Saturday 4th February.

There is no international break to rest players between the two matches, and the Scottish National League (as of December 2012) does not have a winter break. The friendly match does provide an opportunity for Italian players to impress ahead of the European Qualifiers.

Italy have one friendly against South Korea in Verona on Saturday 6th March, which is before their international break, but that is a friendly for the Italian U20 side.

Facts, Statistics and Trivia

Fascinating fact: Scotland have never beaten Italy, and currently hold a score of 0-2 in three encounters.

Italy are second in Group B of the UEFA qualifiers behind Spain on goal difference. Italy's 2-0 win over Austria last week was their second most recent win over the Austrians.

Notable statistic: Fabio Grosso has been a substitute 11 times (2 starts), the most of any Italian player.

Trivia: Mario Balotelli scored on his Italy debut against France on 28th February 2011 and then scored a hat-trick in Italy's friendly win over South Africa on 5th March. However, his fourth strike was disallowed for a hand ball. Balotelli has now scored 5 goals for Italy, and is only the fifth player in the history of the Italian national team to score five goals in a friendly match.

"Summary: Erik Prince, CEO of Blackwater USA, testifies before House panel. Hearings held amid an FBI probe into a shootout involving Blackwater personnel. Prince: ""I believe we acted appropriately at all times"" Article:  and there were ""no intentional illegal activities"" by his organization. An investigation by the Department of Justice is now underway.

B. You will need to find quotes to use as source material. Please provide at least three. The quotation should appear in the same order as given here: The House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations is holding hearings today to question Erik Prince, CEO and founder of security contractor Blackwater. Blackwater is a privately owned United States military contractor; its motto is, âWhen hired, we leave.â. In the fall of 2007, Prince was one of seventeen employees fired from the Department of Stateâs Diplomatic Security Services after it was revealed that a Blackwater guard working on behalf of the US government killed fourteen civilians in September of that year. In August 2005, another Blackwater security guard working for the State Department opened fire at the Abu Ghraib prison, killing an Iraqi female detainee and wounding at least a dozen others. Blackwater is currently involved in a federal investigation by the Department of Justice; a spokesman for Prince told reporters today that the FBI and the Department of Justice are investigating three contractors and four State Department officials concerning allegations that they covered up improper behavior involving Blackwaterâs personnel and contractors. A number of individuals under investigation by the Justice Department are also accused of participating in the cover-up. [Emphasis added] House Oversight Subcommittee Chair Elijah Cummings (D. Maryland) asked Prince about the federal investigation; Prince said they are cooperating with the police and FBI but they were initially âunwilling to give anyone access to what, where, when or with whomâ they have been cooperating. âWe believe that we acted appropriately at all times,â said Prince. âI believe we were very well-trained; I believe we exercised discretion, restraint, and appropriate force in all the circumstances in which we engaged, and I think that there was no intentional illegal activities on the part of anybody on our side, and I'm proud of what we did.â The House subcommittee is also considering introducing legislation to ensure that the federal government prohibits the use of private security personnel by the military; the legislation would have required that all requests for private military contractors be made through the Department of Defense and that the presidentâs office sign all contracts over $3,000. Prince also said that it was the right thing for him to be fired. He emphasized the fact that after a few weeks on the job he was unable to train Blackwater guards himself because he was over-committed with the State Department. A few days after giving his statement, Prince resigned as head of State Departmentâs Diplomatic Security Services, saying his responsibilities were âtoo numerous to undertake.â Prince says that he resigned because he thought he had a contract for at least two years and that he had been told it would not be renewed.

"Summary: UEFA has punished Benfica midfielder Augustin Binya with a six-match ban. The Cameroon international was sent off for bad tackle on Celtic's Scott Brown. Brown was lucky to escape injury in incident during Champions League match. Article:  He was forced to undergo surgery on knee on Tuesday after injury during Benfica vs Celtic clash on August 6 and is expected to be out for four to five months.

An official at Benfica today issued a statement of protest to his club after Scott Brown left with an injury sustained in the Benfica vs Celtic Champions League clash on August 6, 2006. The statement read, ""This is a case that is the responsibility of the Benfica fans rather than the club itself. It is an action that does not honour the club and is unacceptable.""

The injury is said to have been caused when Benfica midfielder Benjamim Augustin Binya (21) went in 'low and dirty' from behind in the penalty area trying to win the ball from Celtic's midfielder Scott Brown (34) following corner. Brown was playing for Celtic at the time and injured his left knee in the tackle and he required surgery on Tuesday to correct the injury.

Brown was forced to undergo an emergency operation on his left knee on Tuesday after suffering injury during Benfica vs Celtic match held at the Vodafone Park in Glasgow. It is expected that Brown will be sidelined for at least four to five months after the operation.

It will be a month old when Benfica vs Celtic Champions League clash resumes, and one would imagine, there will be plenty of memories, for the Portuguese and the Englishman. They will, no doubt, share many of them in a friendly and constructive atmosphere and Benfica defender Giorgos Karagounis will be on both sides.

But the fact that the referee in the Portuguese club’s previous Champions League game, against Bayer Leverkusen, was his compatriot, Domingos Paciência, only compounded the sense of injustice among the home fans, when Karagounis was sent off for dissent, rather than disliking the offside call.

That experience, however, was not enough to convince Binya to keep on walking in the same field as one of the men who had given him the red card. He will not be at Benfica’s next two European games either, with the Cameroonian international being suspended for a game for his lunge at Celtic’s Brown in the second-round clash last month. Binya has always denied that he went in 'low and dirty' to win a tackle, even if the referee did give him a red card.

This season, Karagounis, who turns 37 on September 24, has been the only player born in Athens to feature for Olympiakos. It is also a little ironic given the fact that Karagounis was on both the right and left flanks for the Eagles’ 2-1 derby defeat to Panathinaikos, although he was brought off for Giorgos Donis.

The defender has now returned to training with the rest of the squad for Thursday’s Premier League trip to Leicester, though he is likely to take part in less important games before being handed a place in the Olympiakos team against Sporting.

The 24-year-old has been playing in a different league in Greece for the past year or so, but could come back to English football after being loaned to Oxford United.

Oxford, who have failed to make the play-offs this year and are not going up, will go into battle with a depleted squad that includes the likes of Tom Pope and Liam Chilvers, though manager Mike Phelan is understood to be determined to include Karagounis.

"Summary: Russian President Putin backs Iran's ""peaceful"" nuclear program during visit. Putin in Tehran to attend summit of Caspian Sea nations to discuss oil rights. Iran, Russia set to discuss Iranian nuclear program, U.S. push for sanctions. Putin downplay rumors of assassination plot; Iran says claims are ""baseless"" Article:  (2000 words).

In this case, the summary is not the opening sentence/paragraph but an example of the most important sentences at the end. So far the following sentence was chosen and then we have to continue filling in between. (Don't be afraid to skip some of the steps, but be warned that we don't pay much regard to grammar and punctuation in this paragraph. The original article is given below this section.)

Iran and Russia are close to sealing an oil-for-gas deal, and officials are expected to sign an ""agreement of intent"" toward the end of Putin's visit.

In December 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Russia for talks. In exchange for oil and natural gas, China will finance a $40 billion refinery and petrochemical project in Iran, Russia's energy minister Yuri Shafir said.

The signing ceremony is scheduled for Monday. Russia is expected to lift sanctions on Iranian oil exports and allow the shipment of up to 1 million oil barrels a day. Russia will provide a loan of 1 billion dollars to Iran.

The two countries' leaders are expected to discuss Russian support for Iranian nuclear energy development and its nuclear project near the Syrian city of Qom, Russia's energy minister Yuri Shafir told reporters.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin met with his Iranian counterpart Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday. ""We are going to have our first talks in Russia. Then we will see how things go. I hope the discussions will prove constructive,"" Putin said after the meeting in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.

They are expected to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue, US and European energy sanctions against Iran, the peace process in Afghanistan and the situation in the Middle East. Putin said Iran had ""not shown any aggressive activity"" on the nuclear issue. Putin is planning a 12-day trip to Iran, Kazakhstan and Indonesia.

As part of the process, an Iranian diplomat is scheduled to arrive in Vladivostok on Saturday for talks on nuclear energy issues with Russian officials. Russia and Iran are going to sign a deal on oil production in exchange for oil and LNG exports. Putin believes that Iran has the right to continue operating its nuclear program as it has ""peacefully pursued it."" Moscow and Teheran support nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but the West wants to impose global economic sanctions.

Putin said the Iranian government was trying to meet all the international standards. ""Now they work for civil nuclear energy, which is the peaceful variant, we support it. We understand perfectly well that they need nuclear energy. But we cannot agree on the methods used by America and the Europeans to introduce sanctions.""

Russia believes that the Iranian government is engaged in a peaceful nuclear project. There are five projects in the country, two of which are already under construction. Putin said there was nothing unusual about Tehran's nuclear program. In December 2007, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, visited Russia for talks. In exchange for oil and natural gas, China will finance a $40 billion refinery and petrochemical project in Iran, Russia's energy minister Yuri Shafir said. Putin believes his plan will have a positive impact on Iran-US relations.

Shafir said the signing ceremony is scheduled for Monday. Russia is expected to lift sanctions on Iranian oil exports and allow the shipment of up to 1 million oil barrels a day. Russia will provide a loan of 1 billion dollars to Iran. He said one of the most important issues in the talks would be China's financing of an Iranian refinery and petrochemical project in Russia. Putin wants Moscow to sign a deal providing Russia with an opportunity to use Iran's oil and gas.

Russia has a strategic partnership with China. During the visit to China three years ago, Putin and President Hu Jintao discussed the possibility of financing a major Iranian refinery and petrochemical project in Russia. According to Putin, ""We could work together with Chinese partners. But to implement this kind of project, the project should have the Russian state's resources. I do not believe that China would use its financial resources without a government's consent."" Russian officials also want China to finance a Russian refinery and petrochemical project in Iran. The idea was broached during Putin's earlier visit to China in 2007.

Russian and Iranian officials are hoping to sign an oil-for-gas deal on Monday. Russian oil will be shipped to China, and Iranian gas will be shipped to Russia. There are five projects in the country, two of which are already under construction. They will be discussed and perhaps signed at a meeting of the presidents of",1
"Summary: French president returns to France with three released journalists. Journalists are among seven Europeans freed Sunday in child ""kidnap"" row. There are still 14 other people in custody in Chad. Father: ""They never said they would take away our children"" Article: 

1. The French President François Mitterrand recently spoke to the families of the seven freed people and promised them that these people, their children and grandchildren, would be home soon.

2. The Chadian authorities have also released the children and grandchildren of all seven freed people. This is the first time since these child kidnappings occurred that any of the people kidnapped have been free and able to return to the country that they were kidnapped from. This is because the families of the seven were in danger of facing reprisals and torture for standing in the way of the Chadian authorities in their effort to recapture these kidnappers. Their release came as result of the international pressure that was put forth by countries like France.

3. Some of the freed people are in hospitals in France because, as a result of the long imprisonment and torture to which they had been subjected, their health is in danger. Many families are afraid and are considering bringing these freed people back to live with them indefinitely.

4. The French are happy with the release of these people and hope that the other jailed ones will also be released soon, because France sees the release of these people as a step towards bringing an end to the kidnappings. The Chadian president and his representatives are considering a similar plan to release the children and grandchildren of their compatriots who have been kidnapped, in order to prove that the Chadian authorities are not directly or indirectly responsible for the kidnappings. The Chadian authorities say they want to keep their hands out of the whole thing, and that they didn't start the kidnappings. It is all someone else's doing, they say.

5. The Chadian government said they have no evidence that shows any involvement of France in the kidnappings and that they see the release of the seven as proof that the Chadian and French governments were wrong in their earlier assumption that France was responsible for the kidnappings. Chadian officials also stated that the Chadian government has no intention of carrying out its plan to release the children and grandchildren of their compatriots who are behind bars in France, because it would imply that Chadian government had been involved in the kidnappings.

6. But for the last three weeks, the French President, Mitterrand, has said publicly that he regrets the role France has played in the kidnappings. He has said this publicly in the hope that, if these people are made completely free, they will begin asking the questions as to who was really behind the kidnappings, and the French will be able to stand behind Mitterrand with confidence.

7. Meanwhile the French president has called an international diplomatic conference in Paris in order to bring an end to these abductions, and as the first step towards that end he is convening an international committee for the liberation of the remaining fourteen people who have been kidnapped and held prisoner since April of 1984. In all, some thirty people are still missing, thirteen out of which are in Chad.

Write a news article based on the following summary: A French businessman, Mr. M. Desbois, is kidnapped in Ivory Coast. He is suspected of being involved in the sale of arms to the Ivorians to fight their war with Togo.

1. The French government has started an investigation into the case in which French businessman M. Desbois is suspected of being involved in the sale of weapons to the Ivory Coast. M. Desbois has been missing since April 23.

2. M. Desbois was kidnapped by what looks like to have been a pro-government militia in an area controlled by the Forces Populaires de l'Intérieur, an Ivoirian group with close ties with President Félix Houphouët-Boigny. The militia attacked the home of the businessman where he was staying. The Ivorean authorities said an attack on the home of the businessman has been a violation of the laws of war. Ivorian police, however, had been providing protection for Mr. Desbois and said there were no attacks on his house.

3. After the kidnapping, the Ivoirian army began a search for M. Desbois. Meanwhile, the French government put a $10,000 ransom on the head of Mr. Desbois, which he is suspected of having received.

4. A French police officer in Ivory Coast said M. Desbois ""was being held, along with a group of rebels, in the city of Yamoussoukro."" He said ""he didn't know what kind of weapons the Ivorians had sold to Mr. Desbois."" The Ivorian officials reported he had been beaten up after his",1

The victims were Italian citizens, relatives of a military family which, in addition to the four soldiers killed in the incident, also included a woman and two children. The helicopter took off from the base of Aviano Air Base, located about 50 km (30 mi) from Padua, which was carrying soldiers on maneuvers in the province.

The Black Hawk helicopter had 11 people on board. The pilot and co-pilot, both of Italian nationality, died when it crashed into a building at the end of the fire station, while the four victims were Italian soldiers, who were returning the same day from a military exercise. The pilot died immediately of the injuries sustained in the crash. Two passengers who survived the crash sustained serious injuries, one of them the civilian described by the newspaper as a woman of about 50, who died soon after hospitalization. Two children were the ones that died of the injuries reported by the same newspaper.

The newspaper reports that, according to the first witnesses, the helicopter was seen with the two children still outside the building of the fire station, which was hit by several fragments and which collapsed into a pile of rubble.

Summary and sources

A Black Hawk helicopter, which took off from the Italian air force base located in Padua, crashed in the early hours of Tuesday, 22 May, in the village of Chivasso in the province of Alessandria. On its way back they touched down in Chivasso, but their landing path was blocked by a wall of a house and they overshot it. A fire station, located next to a row of houses, stood on the way of the flight. The helicopter smashed into the station and the helicopter was destroyed.

Four soldiers, three of European origin and one born in the Near East, were killed on their return trip from an air maneuver on the Italian air force base located in the province of Padua. At the time of the crash only one of the two injured, a 50-year-old mother of two small children, was reportedly in a condition for hospitalization. It was the second accident involving helicopters of the air forces of the two allied countries of the European Union, following the recent incident when a helicopter made emergency landing near the French air force base in Crete. Both the European nations have a joint air force command which oversees the cooperation concerning military operations within the borders of Europe.

The second dead man was the copilot, who died at the hospital later on in the day of hospitalization of the injured. The cause of his death has not been made clear. According to Italian news reports, he might have taken ill during the flight and may have been the last to survive the impact. The Italian state, however, has not issued a statement confirming any of these news reports.

The Black Hawk was flying at low altitude, about 400 meters above the ground, and may have been carrying several soldiers before the crash into the station, which was also used to transport firemen and which may have been the scene of the incident. It had 11 people on board, including the pilot and co-pilot. One of the 11 was a civilian, although the newspaper report cited by our sources did not mention anything about his identity.

What else do we know?

The Italian media sources have only reported that four soldiers were aboard the helicopter. Italian police have not confirmed the number of casualties. They have announced that they are investigating the cause of the accident and stated that there were no technical reasons for the accident, the helicopter had been in service well and did not show any malfonctionnement before the crash.

The news report did not state in which year the helicopter, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, became operational, but indicated that the accident occurred in the early hours of 22 May, while the victims are reported to have died in the following days. The two pilots were from the Italian military and had served for some time in the US, but for which unit the name of the helicopter has not been released.

Who were the victims?

The deceased were four Italian soldiers. Relatives of the family, which also included two children and a woman, were in the fire station when the fatal crash took place. They were returning home from a military exercise held near the air force",1

Bradford, of Franklin, Tenn., was a guard who was set to become eligible for the 2011 NBA draft if he stayed in school and played one more year. He had the ability to play for another season too, but with his death it's more possible he would be forced to leave his studies early.

I was in a really good mood when I woke up this morning, thinking about the fact that I turned 18 today. And then I had a bad mood from the way I woke up. The alarm did not go off. I threw it away, and went downstairs. My head was pounding. I wondered what was wrong. Was it a case of dehydration from being up all night? Would I be getting my flu shot? Nah, I thought, I should have the flu shot. And last night I had a really good appetite, but no food at all in the kitchen, so I couldn't cook anymore.

I thought about eating cold pasta. That would be good. I would eat it on the couch. Maybe it would be better than going to a movie, where you have to stand. I could stay home, or go to a bar, where I could sit. I would eat cold pasta. It would be good. I wanted to order it at a restaurant, but I couldn't find any Italian or anything near. I needed a bar. But I didn't have any money, just a bunch of fake money. I needed real money to go to a restaurant. I was beginning to think like a bum. I needed real food. Maybe spaghetti would be good. But it was too expensive. It cost more than $12. I didn't think about it any more. I had eaten. Spaghetti was delicious.

The kids got me an iPod. As soon as I got it home, I decided to change my music. I was listening to all the bad pop music on my stereo, except for one rock band. They were so awesome. I downloaded them from iTunes. What a relief to not have that much pop music on my stereo anymore. There was so much noise.

After a while, I played some of the rock songs I'd downloaded. That was fun. I was going to see them tonight. But I had no money, just fake money. So I went back downstairs and got my backpack. I put the iPod in the backpack, and started walking to the mall. I stopped a few times. I stopped at a convenience store. I put the fake money on the counter. The cashier asked me. I said, ""No, it takes money."" She said, ""Oh, can you bring me a quarter?"" I hesitated for a second. ""I would, but I don't have any,"" I said. ""I don't either,"" she said. I thought about what I could say next. How could I make sure to stay in the bad mood? I decided not to think about money, or to have any more. I went to Barnes and Noble. It was so easy at a used bookstore. I took out a book about rock music by a rock critic. He had lots of good reviews of bad music, even by popular bands. I went back to the mall and brought the book with me, but I didn't bring any money. I'd have to buy food later.

So, I bought snacks at the mall. I put them in my backpack. I decided to read one of the rock critic's reviews before I went to the concert. I had a few pages turned when the kids came home. I turned the pages back, so they could watch me. I took the book out of my backpack and spread it out on the coffee table. I opened it up to read more. ""Don't!"" said the kids. ""You're going to mess up our home!"" said Keisha. ""We're supposed to fix the living room before you come home."" ""Just watch a movie,"" said Justin, ""and I'll do it when I get home from school."" But Justin was happy I was cleaning the living room, while reading the book. The three of them sat on the couch waiting for me to finish reading the book. I took a few more pages out of it. Then I stopped. It was almost four in the afternoon. It was getting dark outside. I was getting hungry, so I stood up and put the book back into my backpack. I headed to the mall again.

At another convenience store, I bought a pack of M&M's and a can of pop. I put them in the backpack. I also bought a soda out of the vending machine. I paid with my fake money. I didn't think about what I was doing. I knew I had some real money somewhere. But my real money, along with my real",1

Simpson murder case by allowing Mr. Simpson to be a free man and allowed to remain in America, following his two year incarceration.

Write a news article that describes the following:
The Simpson trial, which began July 1996, lasted five and one-half months, and was widely considered to be a debacle for the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office and the Los Angeles Courts. Simpson was acquitted by a Santa Clara County jury for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.

Write a news article based on the following summary:
Judge Richard M. Berman of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has ordered that O.J. Simpson be sent to prison for the two and one-half year term that prosecutors have recommended as discipline for his admitted violation of conditions of his house arrest.

Write a news article based on the following summary:

The Simpson family had their bail for the O.J. Simpson criminal trial revoked on August 2nd.

Judge Ito also barred O.J Simpson, 66, from running for public office. He made the ruling from the bench as Simpson's attorney William B. Carvalho, 61, of New York, stood by.

Simpson was initially required to attend the hearing at the Brentwood Courthouse in LA where he was to face trial for armed robbery, kidnapping and false imprisonment, charges brought last July.

Simpson's legal team had argued that he faced danger in that his car, which the former star had driven to and from court in the last seven months, had been tampered with at a key moment in the trial.

In July, Judge L.A. Margolis had granted Simpson's request to be free from the watch of armed guards.

He was required to post bail at a time in Los Angeles when Simpson was at home.

The former football star has been spending his time at his estate in Southern California. He has been attending several film screenings and is preparing for re-entering society by attending business symposia in the Los Angeles area.

Simpson and his wife, Marguerite were in court to witness the ruling. Ito ordered Simpson to be taken into custody, pending a July 28 hearing.

Simpson has been free from the custody of armed guards during his seven months of freedom.

He was allowed to leave his home for medical care and for court activity.

The trial is scheduled to resume August 2.

Simpsons' attorney had argued at the most recent bail hearing that, in addition to concerns about electronic surveillance equipment hidden in a pool pump in the backyard of his residence in Northern Causcasus, Simpson faces the specter of death threats.

Simpson has received many in person and online hate mail, according to his attorney.

While he did not say why the threats were a danger, Simpson attorney Tom Mesereau said when the car was tampered with, the star was forced to abandon the vehicle on June 15.

""After that point, the cars were tampered with. After that, his car went. From that point, it went directly to the point where we have this very unique situation at hand.""

Simpson lawyer's request was part of a bid to avoid an August 21 hearing -- a move that had been ordered by Judge Ito. But the request was denied by the judge because prosecutors said Simpson's lawyer did not have ""good cause"" to request a delayed hearing.

Simpson is free on $750,000 bond and must abide by certain restrictions that include GPS monitoring and that prevent him from leaving California.

The former football star is also forbidden to possess any weapons but is entitled to carry firearms only while working or engaging in his duties as vice president for the charity he heads, the ""The Dream Foundation.""

The group was named for the first time since the June 13 trial began.

Meanwhile, the former football star is allowed no contact with his four other children, who range in age from 17 to 25.",1

We recommend the following:

Summary: Detainees file suit against ICE, allege they were injected with drugs. One detainee tells CNN: ""What they did to me was very, very bad"" ICE says 1,073 detainees have had ""medical escorts"" since 2003. Sen. Lieberman vows to investigate further; spokesman calls charges ""troubling"" and says the agency will ""review this incident.""

The article should be well sourced and have a well developed argument.

Here's our favorite example from history: ""All that changed, of course, when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan. The Bush administration sent hundreds of U.S. troops to that country to oust the Taliban and root out al-Qaeda. There were widespread allegations that Afghan soldiers and police were killing and torturing American soldiers.""

The article would discuss and describe what happened before the Afghanistan war, and the reasons for invading Afghanistan.

In your sample paper, provide details and explain your response, rather than just state your response. Also, be sure to explain how details and explanation can improve the quality of others' papers.

Here's what our graders are looking for in your response:

The summary should identify and examine a specific problem. (8 points, 5 words)

The rest of the sample paper:

The article, which is available online, is entitled: ""Injection marks found on some detainees at Gitmo,"" by Susan Svrluga. It appeared in the Washington Post, on 5 January 2006, under the headline: ""Injection marks found on some detainees at Gitmo."" The article starts with the headline and an image of four black stars on white background. The first-person quoted in the article is a Gitmo detainee referred to only by his last name. The article also quotes a Gitmo guard officer. The article goes on to describe the marks as resembling scars. The article notes that the marks do not appear to have been made by injections. The article goes on to quote the detainee/plaintiff as follows (the quoted text is indented and enclosed by quotation marks):

""The first thing they did was pump me with drugs,"" he said in a phone interview, adding that he spent two or three weeks in a dark interrogation cell. ""I don't know what it was. I was on the ground blind and paralyzed."" He claimed his interrogators gave him something called ""cocaine"" and ""speed,"" and injected him on his arms and legs. ""They said that I was a 'big bad gang member,' that I 'needed to confess,' and that I would be 'better if I knew what happened to my family,'"" the man recalled. The marks are permanent indentations made by the syringes used to inject him with drugs during interrogations, he said.

And how to write this:

Cite the article where it appears. [1]

Quote the first identifiable person to say anything relevant to the topic of the essay according to the style guidelines. [2]

Respond to the claims of the plaintiff, citing evidence where appropriate. [3]

Note that the first sentence quoted is taken directly from the article, which is a good idea in general because it avoids the need to re-copy the entire article (if it really is an important part of the thesis, of course.)

As for the rest of this paragraph, it could be improved in a number of ways. First of all, if you think about it and give it a second glance, then I've explained the two things that could be done to improve this paragraph.

1) Start the quote with the article author

2) Be even more specific about the information to cite: ""The first thing they did was pump me with drugs,"" not ""The first thing they did was pump me with cocaine and speed.""

3) Use the article author's name with his quoted comments: ""What they did to me was very, very bad. They said that I would be better off if I knew what happened to my family. But this is what I know. And I am not the first one they have tried to drug. The first ones are dead.""

4) Include the fact that the Guantanamo detainees file suit in Washington D.C. (The reason for this will become relevant later.)

5) Note the part of the article that deals with the history of complaints at Gitmo: ""The new allegations follow a long line of charges that detainees say were made at the",1

News Analysis: Sen. Barack Obama attacks Sen. Hillary Clinton for her vote to provide legal cover for Presi...

News Analysis: Sen. Barack Obama attacks Sen. Hillary Clinton for her vote to provide legal cover for President Bush's war of choice in Iraq. Senator John McCain's ""patriotic vote"" to support the president in Iraq provided ""further evidence"" of his ""flaws in judgment,"" Obama says. Obama and Clinton differ on the role of Congress, how Iraq and Afghanistan should be pursued, and what the U.S. should do to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. ""It's not a law"" is Clinton response to Barack Obama's attack on her voting to give legal cover to the war. The Washington Post Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) defended a vote she cast on Monday to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear technology, saying it was a matter of her country's national interests, and did not amount to a vote to provide legal cover for President Bush's war in Iraq. By contrast, Obama's comments Thursday cast her vote as less than an act of patriotism and more a flaw in her judgment, given her belief that she can persuade the president of the United States to change his mind on Iraq. ""It's not a law, it's not a treaty, I didn't sign the treaty, the treaty wasn't ratified,"" Clinton said. ""So I'm not going to sign them, so the president wouldn't have to ask me to sign something that I don't support."" Clinton cast the vote along with six other senators on Monday to override Senate objections to the sale of $165 billion in munitions to the regime of President Bush's choice in the run-up to the war. It was the president's only route to selling the weapons without a direct vote of the Senate. The White House quickly hailed the vote as a victory after months of efforts to overcome opposition from Democratic and Republican senators alike. For Clinton, the situation was different. She voted for the sanctions against Iran after the Senate voted in July 2002 to suspend them until Iraq's government had completed weapons inspections and the war-like dictator stopped sending supplies of arms and cash to the rebels in the Kurdish north. Iran is a close ally of Iraq. From the Washington Post Sen. Clinton said the vote came amid a ""political stalemate"" that precluded the president from changing course. ""At the time, I was under the assumption that we were all going to stick together,"" she said. ""I'm certainly not casting judgment on them at all."" Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) criticized Clinton's vote on Thursday as ""lawless."" ""It means that Senator Clinton has a different view about what this law says and what its true meaning is than do I and certainly do the American people and the American soldiers who're fighting in Iraq today,"" Obama said in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" program. ""I think it's pretty revealing that she would vote the way she did in secret on Iran while Americans are still fighting and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan."" And he said his own decision to support the war in Iraq in 2002 was based on a belief that the president ""would do the right thing."" ""Now he hasn't,"" Obama said. ""It's not that I believed the president would do the right thing, and we know from history and there's so many examples it turned out that presidents do not act in accordance with our best interests. My view is that we should have more confidence in our elected representatives at the local, state, and national level than we do in the people at the top of the ticket."" Clinton's vote, he said, showed that her judgment was flawed. ""That raises larger questions about her judgment as a leader and whether she is capable of making those decisions. ""Now, we may be in Iraq for the next two, five, or 10 years, we're going to have to make some decisions about what our priorities should be and whom we should have at the table and whom we should talk to and whom we should deal with in the Middle East."" Clinton said his attack on his own vote """,1

A federal grand jury in California has handed up a 21-count superseding indictment against three Chinese nationals.

The charges focus on the manufacture and possession of counterfeit goods and conspiracy to launder the money earned by selling them, as well as the laundering of money through the purchase of various real estate assets.

The $5 Billion Chinese Counterfeiting & Imitation Industries report, published in February 2018, finds that Chinese companies spent $1.45 billion on counterfeiting activities last year, with the vast majority of counterfeit goods made in Southeast Asia.

Of the goods imported through Indonesia, the report calculates that only 1.6% are likely to be genuine, but the authors warn that this is still a $1 billion industry.

The report goes on to detail how the Chinese government has stepped up its efforts to combat counterfeiting crimes, with a specific focus on the trade and consumption of fake luxury goods. In 2018, two Chinese citizens were named “anti-brand counterfeiter of the year” by an industry group that has been fighting counterfeiting.

However, the report concludes that there appears to be less progress in the fight against counterfeit luxury items than one may hope for.

There is no evidence that has been presented to indicate that the government has taken more direct action against foreign companies supplying fake merchandise to China or that they have begun to monitor or disrupt the trading of luxury items overseas.

The report suggests that this could be a result of the United States’ “lack of political leadership in the area of brand protection”, the Chinese government’s “growing international stature in the luxury goods industry” and the global industry’s “growing interest in Chinese culture”.

The authors conclude by saying that “it is not too early to fear that the China model will displace the old world of brand power by the new”.

Counterfeit activity has been a problem for a while here in Japan, but it is still considered a “low-grade offence” and the “fraud”, “deliberty”, and “lack of respect” of counterfeits have not been very well known to the public.

However, recent studies from a variety of sources, both official and non-government, have shown significant growth in the amount of counterfeit goods being produced.

The Japan Anti-counterfeiting Manual defines counterfeits as “Items being illegally reproduced and/or manipulated for profit or for personal amusement”, giving rise to many different problems.

These problems include the misuse of the reputation of a high-status brand, the violation of intellectual property and copyright, and the harm to consumers. The impact also extends to the domestic economy, according to the Japan International Trade Agency, when “production and distribution processes are undertaken only for the purpose of counterfeiting, creating an environment that inhibits the development of Japanese brands”, affecting the production of domestic products and affecting the environment in terms of the economy.

With this in mind, what does the National Police Agency have in mind? Their proposal is to create a “Counterfeit Information Network” in hopes that it could have a positive influence over the production of counterfeits.

The goal is also to prevent “brand confusion”. However, there are already many online services that use “trademark scanning” to help customers find the best price for the product they want, so how will this affect that. Furthermore, there have been suggestions the “new” network could also contain information on “design protection” as well as details on “product specifications” and the “manufacturing process”, but what does “specifications” have to do with “the best price” for an item?

The proposal also looks to",1

"Summary: Louisiana resident, 18, faces federal hate-crime, conspiracy charges. Driver allegedly taunted civil rights marchers with nooses on pickup truck. Marchers were protesting handling of several racially charged incidents. Article:  A judge denied an appeal by the U.S. Department of Justice to seek the civil rights violation and conspiracy charges.

Louisiana resident, 18, alleged to have burned six nooses — one with a racial epithet “KKK” — faces charges that he violated the civil rights of the black marchers, the Justice Department said.

A noose is a noose and is used to harm and murder black people. Nooses in America and in other places around the world are often made of rope to signify lynching and to mock and defile a black person.

Racial tension rose to an unprecedented level in the Louisiana capital this year when the body of a black man in state custody was lynched by a white man, according to a state attorney general. A coroner has ruled his death a homicide, officials said in a statement earlier Wednesday. A coroner has ruled his death a homicide, officials said in a statement earlier Wednesday. Two days later on May 21, 2017, a white police officer killed an unarmed black man, which sparked civil unrest in two cities and a dramatic response from U.S. President Donald Trump.

Two days later on May 21, 2017, a white police officer killed an unarmed black man, which sparked civil unrest in two cities and a dramatic response from U.S. President Donald Trump.

In response to the lynching of Stephon Clark, thousands of people protested across the country in July 2017. Protesters were protesting many incidents of police brutality against minorities. Police are usually white.

In response to the lynching of Stephon Clark, thousands of people protested across the country in July 2017. Protesters were protesting many incidents of police brutality against minorities. Police are usually white.

Another example of white terror — white police killed a black man who did not resist arrest and tried to surrender, while white protesters burned cars and buildings. A noose was hung around the neck of one of the rioters.

White terrorists are killing black people in America. It seems that if you throw a noose at a black person, white terrorists will kill you.

White terrorists are killing black people in America. It seems that if you throw a noose at a black person, white terrorists will kill you.

The United States of America and the international community have a duty to investigate every incident of racially motivated violence and terror attacks and prosecute all perpetrators. A noose is a noose and is used to harm and murder black people.

You get an A+ in your American history class when you give a noose at a black person or lynch them. There are thousands, if not millions, of noose symbols in your country, but only one in your own house

A picture of a noose, a weapon used to harm and murder black people, is more offensive than a picture of swastikas, the Ku Klux Klan's hate symbol, which have no specific origin.

A noose is a noose and is used to harm and murder black people.

A noose is used in many parts of the world to harm and murder black people.

Nooses are in almost every room of every house in Germany and Austria.

Every German has one or more nooses.

Nooses are displayed on the wall behind many German politicians

Nazis have a noose made

Fuehrer Hitler ordered a noose made for an execution by hanging

They hang around the necks of all convicted people in the U.S.

A racist man hangs on his wife’s neck a noose and she is killed.

Nazis throw nooses at black people and hang racists on tree branches in Germany.

A noose is a noose and is used to harm and murder black people. In 2015, someone was arrested in Germany for hate crimes. A noose was found at the accused’s home.

A black man in New York hanged himself from a tree with a noose while a Nazi group hung posters with a noose near a black church.

A noose is a noose and is used to harm and murder black people.

Every black person knows that if a noose is thrown at them, they will be lynched and be killed

Nooses are part of many black church services and black weddings every year

Racist white people burn churches and hang nooses over the building. Nooses over church buildings are used as reminders that they should kill and lynch black people and destroy black churches.

A noose is part of many black churches every year.

"Summary: Government wants land for border fence; landowners refuse. Secretary Chertoff says he won't relent ""for a particular individual"" Eloisa Tamez says her property has been in her family since 1767. Border town mayor calls the fence ""a multibillion-dollar speed bump"" Article:  Landowners have filed an appeal, arguing the fence was already planned before Texas and New Mexico's decision to join the US.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Government wants land for border fence…

Texas Land owners in the area of Hidalgo, along the Texas Mexican Border, will oppose an additional $32 million cost in the border wall.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security wants to purchase two plots of property on the Texas side of the border as part of the Secure Fence Act. At a press conference in McAllen, Texas, Border Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske said there is no compromise.

The land purchased lies along the Rio Grande, which separates Hidalgo from Mexico.

Kerlikowske claims to have consulted the State of Texas and other landowners in the area. Many of the property owners believe border fence is a “multibillion-dollar speed bump.”

On a recent trip to McAllen, I interviewed Eloisa Tamez, a Texas resident and the vice chairperson of the Rio Grande Foundation.

She’s the vice chairperson of the Rio Grande Foundation. She’s an American who works in a McAllen law office. Her parents immigrated to the United States from Ecuador and Guatemala.

Tamez is a Texan; she moved to the Rio Grande Valley from San Antonio in 1999. Her sister and mother live in Hidalgo.

Eloisa Tamez says border fencing isn't a problem.

“My grandparents, their parents and their parents' parents have been in the country almost 200 years. The fence will be on border property that is in the United States. It can’t be anywhere else. There is no reason for a fence. In the Rio Grande Valley, they’re saying to close to a million people, “What is the need for a fence?”

Tamez’s father was born in Mexico. He came to the United States as an infant. His parents came from northern Mexico, “just like my ancestors.”

It’s not a new issue for Tamez. The first fence built on the border in the Rio Grande Valley was in the ‘70s. It was the WALL of the wall. “It lasted 15 years.” It was in the ’70s and it was a very secure fence. It was in a high place and the Border Patrol could drive over it.

A new fence was built in 1983 that lasted about 8 years. It was built “way in the bottom,” Tamez says. The fence was a mile and a half from the river.

From 1983 to the present, the Rio Grande has always been a barrier to crossing, Tamez says.

Eloisa Tamez’s grandparents used to meet each other in the river to cross…

“My grandparents, their parents, their parents' parents — they used to meet each other in the river to cross, and they used to come up to me and say, ‘We used to do it this way. We never would have stopped this border. My mom, my dad, and my grandparents and all us have been here almost 200 years,’” Tamez tells me.

The problem with the present day fence is the fencing is only five feet away from the river.

“My grandparents would have never thought they would have been stopped here,” Tamez says. It was because some people didn’t like immigration.

“We need to have people on the other side.”

Tamez is against closing the border completely but she isn’t convinced that the idea of a wall is necessary to keep people out of the country, either.

“We need to have people on the other side so we have security. It’s nothing personal,” Tamez tells me. “The border was always there — the Border Patrols were there so why doesn’t it make sense?”

The present day fence was built to protect against drugs that were getting into the United States, from Mexico. She doesn’t understand why people are so against the border.

Tamez says a “slow boat” could probably cross a foot away from the river.” Tamez says “if they would have built a security post, we could have watched",1
"Summary: Christian pastors borrow ideas from Scientology to preach temperate lifestyle. Critics say Scientology is a cult, always looking for recruits. Pastor in Houston, Texas, claims 70 percent success rate with addicts. Article:  Scientology is very secretive, using double names (Bob and John Hubbard for founder, David and Tom for top officials). Critics fear the influence of Scientology on its members. Others say they are impressed that Scientology has been on the fringes of society while being accepted by famous people (John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Tom Cruise, Sandra Day O’Connor, etc.)

Write an opinion article about the following ideas and policies: Scientology is a cult that takes control of its members, forcing them to be loyal to the organization. It abuses church members who seek help from it. It can be easily confused with psychiatry because it is similar in many ways. In Scientology, a person is rewarded with a reward called ""clear."" If a person clears his way through the Scientology process, he will receive a new life style and many other benefits.

In this assignment, you should write two articles for a magazine. You will follow this format:

2. Use this layout example from ""The Scientology Guide,"" written in 1992, as your model for the magazine format you will create for yourself.

THE SCIENTOLOGY GUIDE, December 1992, Pages 15-17

SECT. I - Introduction

15. It is called Scientology because it offers an answer to
questions and to the ills of humanity that the Church of
Scientology seeks to rid the world of. A Scientologist does
not believe that God is all-powerful. He or she believes that
there is no power higher than the individual Scientologist's
will. Scientologists say that only by working with their will
and using their higher mind can they be successful.

According to Scientology, people can improve their
conditions through a process wherein they overcome certain
human problems. It offers individuals a program to deal with
addictions and to overcome their personal ills. It is a
Scientology policy to help these problems through the concept
of spiritual technology or OT level technology. Anyone willing
to pay the costs of such therapy can join the Church of
Scientology, and be given all the training it provides. Many
famous people are active Scientologists. President John
F. Kennedy was once a member of the Church of Scientology
before deciding that its teachings were not for him.

Scientology is a very secretive organization. All aspects of
its activities are covered by elaborate double-barreled
secrecy. It has an organization called the Guardian Office,
whose purpose is to protect the identity of Scientology and
its members. Each Scientology member is assigned a Guardian
who lives near them and with whom they will work and pray
every day. The Guardian of the church in Clearwater, Florida,
is James Wager. The Guardian of Scientology International is
James Wroe. Its public relations office is known as the Office
of Special Affairs. The OT III level involves a series of
programs designed to assist an individual in overcoming all
forms of human problem (physical or mental). The OT III level
is also believed to be the level at which communication with
the dead occurs. Many of the famous people who have been
connected to Scientology have progressed onto the OT III
level. This was the case with, for example,

Ronald Reagan, who was a staff auditor for OT III training
at the L. Ron Hubbard

School for Scientology.

President Richard Nixon was working his way through the OT
III levels when he became suspicious of the power of the
Church of Scientology. To counter this, he enlisted
Washington Post reporter Jack Anderson to investigate and
expose the church. He was not successful in his effort. In
1973, Anderson was audited by Scientology. It was at this
point, according to Anderson, that he learned
Scientan

""the secrets of the power elite.""

(I will not be writing a detailed account about all the OT
levels and its contents, even though I believe that this
would be very interesting to my future students who will study
this subject for another term. The book, by L. Ron Hubbard
himself, does detail the programs from the OT I level and

"Summary: Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr say their music sounds better. The former Beatles talk to CNN's Larry King. Widows of John Lennon and George Harrison also appeared. Harrison, Ono say their husbands still have strong presence. Article:  Beatles' music could last long.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr say their music sounds better. The former Beatles talk to CNN's Larry King. Widows of John Lennon and George Harrison also appeared. Harrison, Ono say their husbands still have strong presence. Beatles' music could last long.

My summary is, and this is how I am going to write it:

""Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have no regrets about their former band and its breakup. However, according to Paul and Ringo, their music is much better now compared to when they played together in the early 1960's.

McCartney said the reason why people do not hear the former Beatles anymore is because of George Michael, whose 1980's hit ""Careful with That Axe"" beat the song ""Michelle"". Starr also said that his songs like ""That Kind Of Woman"" would never be covered on Radio.

""We still write the kind of songs we'd like to hear but we feel that the music would really get the recognition it needs if it was played by a wider audience,"" said McCartney

""John Lennon and Yoko Ono - widows of the original members - also talked about it. Yoko Ono said that many are curious to see how they would feel if the songs from the Beatles era last long and live for ever.""

A woman who did not want to be named, said that she had heard the songs from her younger sister. She said that the songs sounded as if they were recorded by a live- band. ""I want to see the original Beatles live playing,"" she said.""

This is the best I could do right now.

What do you think about this summary? It's difficult. Should I write like you, or write like McCartney and Ono?

Paul, Ringo and Harrison still sound incredible to me, no matter what the critics say. You have to remember that in those days, when those songs were recorded, you had to get very close to the microphone to make sure your voice was well-mixed.

There's no reason that this style of recording was not used when the Beatles recorded this song. I mean, the track sounds a bit low on the mix because someone was recording at a mic's height from the vocal amps, but the vocals sound perfect.

As for those two women, it's very possible that Ono and Lennon are referring to the studio in the 70's when the album was recorded, and not the actual live performance.

It's difficult though, because the song is so full of musical memories to me. I love it!

The best summary (as good as you can make it anyway) would be, ""Two old musicians share their thoughts on 'The Beatles' music and why it will live on"". ""Old musicians"" don't usually speak of ""live music"" but I'm going to give it a try...

"" Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have not regrets about their early band, and feel that one band should not exist, which is why they started another one.

McCartney thinks it was wrong for the Beatles to break up. He also said that if the former members never reunited again, people would have never heard anything like the Beatles.

Ringo has no regrets about the early days, as he feels that a break between two bands is better.

Both said that the Beatles' music will live on after their deaths, in the same way people still hear the Elvis songs.

John and Yoko, as well as the surviving members of the original Beatles, have been asked to make a live album. Harrison and Ono were unavailable.""

This summary sounds like a lot of what I said.

The only differences I see are I have mentioned a Beatles reunion (the former members), and both Paul and Ringo said they have a ""live band"" (I didn't mention that), and I have included the ""two old musicians"" comment from Paul (I have a feeling this is why it's more popular).

And just because I don't have the songs that played live by the band anymore doens't mean they don't still live inside the minds of millions of fans.

This is actually how I would summarize the story (I didn't do it this way just because I think it's more original):

""It was a reunion to prove that the band would be even stronger. Two old band members (McCartney and Starr) were asked to have a reunion so they could show that the band members would still be in good music in different periods of time. A music lover (Harrison",1
"Summary: U.N. agency appeals for medical resettlement of Palestinians in Iraq camps. About 2,000 Palestinians in camps along Iraq-Syria border. 30 to 40 refugees arrive at border camp each week, UNHCR says. Article:  The refugee camp, known as al-Houla camp, is next to the town of Mabha, Syria, some 80 km southeast of Amman.

The story that you write should be:

1. A UN news article reporting on the appeal of the UN agency for medical resettlement of Palestinian refugees in Iraq refugee camp should be written in such a way as to draw more support for the appeal.

a. What is the problem which is being addressed by the appeal? Explain the humanitarian aspect and importance of medical resettlement for Palestinian refugees in this particular camp. Explain to the reader the negative implication of staying in the camp as an indirect result of being caught in the crossfire between Palestinian factions and also explain why staying in the camp implies that the refugee is forced to take part in the fighting.

b. Explain the way the UN agency has responded to the appeal for resettlement of the refugees (the process followed by the UN agency). What criteria are used by the UN agency to decide whether a particular refugee should be resettled to another country?

c. Explain the steps taken to carry out the resettlement (the process followed by the UN agency for such resettlement).

d. Explain some of the factors and conditions which make the resettlement process possible.

2. Write a short analysis of the conflict in Amman's capital city as it affects the refugees in the camp.

a. Explain how Jordan and Syria are dealing with the crisis and why does this have negative implications for the refugees?

b. Explain the consequences that this conflict will have on the refugees in the camp. In particular, you can discuss in detail the issue of the safety of the area (near and inside camp) and the negative effects that the instability in Amman will have on the refugee camp and the daily lives of the refugees.

3. What is your opinion on the effect of the UN organization on the situation faced by the Palestinians today?

a. The UN was created in 1945 by the charter to establish a durable structure designed to promote international peace and security. Since its birth, the UN has sought to resolve conflicts and establish peace. It has never intervened directly in conflict situations. This has never been the intention of the UN charter. Rather, the charter is designed to serve as a framework for resolving humanitarian crises. The UN organizes relief efforts following natural or artificial disasters. According to Article 42, ""The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall then decide on the measures to be taken by the Members in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations."" (http://www.un.org). In response to the appeals made by the UN agency and the UNHCR, the UN had taken some actions to improve conditions in al-Houla refugee camp of Syria, particularly after a fire in August 2004 had threatened to cause hundreds and thousands of refugees to have to seek refuge in Syria proper. Furthermore, when the UN agency found out the conditions which the refugees had to face, it was taken to the Syrian-Jordanian border and given a chance to live in a safe and comfortable place of their own.

b. When you hear the statement, ""The UN was created in 1945 by the charter to establish a durable structure designed to promote international peace and security,"" think of the effects of this statement. The UN was initially established to resolve the conflicts between states. The warring of parties and their representatives was expected to cease once the UN was set up. If war continues, people will continue to suffer, refugees will continue to flee and the cause of this human suffering will continue to be ignored. One of the functions of the UN was to develop solutions to situations that cannot be solved by states. In addition to providing humanitarian assistance, the UN was set up to encourage peace by strengthening the relationship between countries, helping them to understand each other's concerns and promoting their economic, social, cultural and technological development, and thus encouraging their progress toward independence and political freedom, and the UN can do all of these things.

4. The world is becoming more complex. Can you identify some of the problems which have occurred recently?

a. This statement should encourage the reader to think more about the events that he or she did not know very much about, so that he or she can develop a deeper understanding of the events that happened in such a short time and what all of this has to do with you.

b. What type of problems is happening in the areas in which you live? How is this problem affecting you?

5. Your opinion on the role of the UN in the recent crisis.

a. The UN was set up to resolve conflicts",1
"Summary: Debate will be last time top Democrats face off before Super Tuesday contests. Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to go one-on-one for first time together. Ex-Sen. John Edwards suspended presidential campaign Wednesday. Debate will start at 8 ET on Thursday night on CNN and CNN.com. Article: 

CNN.com Editor-In-Chief Bob Shrum will be on-stage for CNN, and will ask questions and moderate the debate. A CNN crew will be on the scene in order to cover it. The moderator will not have a direct relationship to either candidate.

CNN POLITICS CO-ANCHOR ANNA ESHOO: ""We have the largest Democratic primary debate. We're looking at this as a special. It's a very big deal because we're watching history tonight. This is the last faceoff of this primary. When did the nomination come down on a single day?

""This debate is going to be about how our parties agree on the things that they disagree about. When we get to the issues, Hillary goes on to super Tuesday, it will be clear who has the momentum.""

HARRINGTON: ""It's more a fact finding mission... we don't need to re-litigate all of these primaries but there's a few things. The first thing is the candidates that have the highest odds according to various prognosticators, we may get to see some of the underdogs now come out and play in this debate.

""We're looking for candidates to be a little more polished. To be a little more comfortable doing a debate. Maybe we'll get to see some of those people who've never debated before come out and show a little of their skills, give us some fresh faces. We just know that as the field narrows, we may find out a little more about these candidates.

""And also, I think we'll get a chance to have a discussion on some of these issues. I suspect a lot of the issues will be the same. But maybe there will be more of a push to get to the other side when it comes to what they say on issues. So, we'll be looking.""

SHRUM: ""I'll ask them a lot of questions about the issues that are important in choosing a president. I'll try to get a little more specific than that because I'll have only one question for each candidate. It'll be a free-for-all at that point.""

CNN Chief Political Correspondent Frank Sesno will be a field reporter who will go to several caucus locations in Nevada to capture reaction from the audience, caucus and media. CNN reporter Mary Snow will report live from the caucus sites.

CNN PRESENTS: Senior Political Analyst Sam Feist from Los Angeles will be the CNN's Senior Investigative Correspondent. Feist will report on questions surrounding what is being covered up by the campaigns.

""We'll be asking more general questions of both candidates about how big a priority they place on their campaigns and how they would go about solving the world's problems.""

KARL: ""I will try and get a little more of the behind the scenes political intrigue, especially given she can stay out of the news if she wants to, or she will tell her side of it and you know... It's always interesting on the inside so stay in touch with the reporters who are writing about it.""

SHRUM: ""I think it's a good question (who'll win California). The answer to that question depends largely on what happens in Nevada. Which I would predict will be won by the person who is coming from where Hillary is coming from. Now that's what I would think, although it's an educated guess.

""But if it's the wrong guess, then the person from Nevada will move on.""

CNN's Anderson Cooper: ""We're going to give them their chance. We're not going to put them on their feet together. We're not going to say hey, look how you handled this or how you handled that.""

AL SHARPTON: ""I'm looking forward to this debate. I'm looking forward to having Senator Barack Obama say that he was wrong on a whole lot. I hope Senator Joseph Biden says that he was a weak president. I expect to see a lot of that. I hope to see some of the issues raised.""

HILLARY CLINTON: ""I'll be happy.

""I think the audience will be very interested to hear both John McCain and Barack Obama say what they think about the issues and the choices that we face. The first time in months to have a clear choice for president will make these debates special,"" she said.

EUGENE KEORANI: ""I'm looking forward to this. I think the most interesting things I imagine will be, one, where Senator Barack Obama has to answer the charge Hillary Clinton made in her",1

The following paragraphs should be included in the summary:

The incident occurred as a convoy of several vehicles, including an ambassador’s car and one carrying two U.S. embassy employees, was parked in the north Beirut district of Ras Beirut. A vehicle exploded, causing an evacuation of the convoy. The victims of the blast included two American officers and a Lebanese civilian. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

The incident comes on the day the U.S. Secretary of State urged the Lebanese government to provide international legal assistance and protection to US citizens in the wake of the country’s political upheaval and sectarian civil war. [President Bush, through Secretary of State Rice] ""We want to be able to bring international assistance so that innocent people are secure"" and ""The United States has not been informed or consulted on their specific situation."" U.S. and Lebanese officials on Friday held talks to further improve their relations. [More details]

Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was traveling by helicopter in the capital, Beirut, on Thursday, when his plane went down in the Mediterranean Sea. He’s now recovered at the hospital, although his health remains a concern. The authorities have announced the date of the Prime Minister’s funeral in Beirut as 2 April. There was no independent confirmation from the Prime Minister’s office of his health.

A few hours later, in the early morning at 2:55am, another plane blew up at Beirut airport, followed by another crash involving a third plane and another car bomb. There were also reports of explosions near the U.S. Embassy. An attack that took place on Thursday and Friday would have meant that the Prime Minister could not have been aboard the helicopter when the first of the two explosions took place. The Beirut hospital said that the Prime Minister was in shock and badly burned.

The Lebanese interior minister was killed in Saieh. One officer was wounded in the fighting for the area. The US Consul General has been killed in an apartment building in Tripoli, while the U.S. Ambassador was injured in Tripoli. The U.S. Embassy security guard was lightly wounded and was being treated in a hospital. U.S. Embassy security officials said they had come under fire while on a tour of the area in a Lebanese Army truck. The American citizens inside the building were also taken to the hospital for fear of further damage.

A spokesman for the U.S. military in Lebanon later said the incident was caused by a landmine. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Lebanese Army has declared a curfew in the area. The Prime Minister’s convoy would have included his bodyguards which made him safer. The U.S. Army has sent a task force to the area with medical, security and intelligence units to assist Lebanese authorities.

The U.S.: ""We’re disgusted about it.""Secretary Rice called the incident ""despicable and cowardly."" The State Department says that two Americans working at the embassy, including the Chief Security Officer, were in the embassy building at the time of the attack. Another U.S. officer had also left at lunch time and was in the embassy at the time of the attack. The embassy would have been open at the time. The U.S. embassy is currently looking for accommodation for the U.S. soldiers, and are looking at alternative accommodation for them at the American University in Beirut as well.

Lebanon: The Prime Minister's plane crashed on Thursday afternoon in what was reported to be a weather-related incident. On Friday, Prime Minister Hariri spoke to the American Ambassador in Lebanon for the first time since his helicopter was brought down in the Mediterranean Sea. Hariri’s plane took off from Beirut’s airport on Friday morning, with three other occupants. The Lebanese authorities are convinced that the flight ended on Thursday in the Mediterranean Sea when the power of the engines failed, although they cannot be certain.

A spokesman for the Lebanese Army said that Hariri and his aides returned to Beirut via helicopter on Saturday in good health. The statement from the Lebanese Prime Minister’s office added that the helicopter crash had been caused because of a technical fault, although it did not go into further detail.

A spokesman for the Lebanese Prime Minister's office announced to a Lebanese TV channel that the Prime Minister would not travel to London for the Conference on the Middle East, but would send another delegation to the London conference. The announcement has caused further confusion and concern in Lebanon,",1

There’s no more room for baby photos – it’s official. Your daughter has just turned ten. Her favourite colour is pink, and her current passion is ballet. All the same, she spends most days in a wheelchair, can talk only a few words, and is totally dependent. Yet she doesn’t complain, knowing her mother would not be able to cope. “She’s had to grow up fast,” says Jane. “It’s only natural that she’s developed some independence. I’m confident she’ll reach adulthood one day.”

Jane has been trying for a baby for some time now, but her infertility problems have proved too great a handicap. Now her doctor has urged her to seek treatment for her daughter. It’s agreed. There will be no pain. A woman her own age will take her womb.

Dr A has performed three such operations before, so says Jane. He will take her womb from the 15-year-old girl. Then, within a matter of weeks, the surgeon will take the rest of it out. In a few cases, such as with a boy with multiple disabilities, the operation can be more complex. Dr A says the operation will be routine. And Jane wants to proceed quickly. Within a few short months the woman in question will once again be pregnant with a child. For the doctor it will be a moment of professional triumph. For Jane it will be pure joy…

She should have been ten and two years ago. Jane has watched her daughter grow up with the help of a few nurses and a small group of doctors. There hasn’t been one day in the girl’s life",1
"Summary: Nihat Kahveci put Turkey into Euro 2008 with 1-0 win over Bosnia/Herzegovina. Nihat struck at the end of a first half as Turkey joined holders Greece in finals. Portugal joined Poland in qualifying from Group A with 0-0 draw with Finland. Article: 

Turkish football is going through a crisis.
In the last two years, three teams have won the championship with the names of the Turkish clubs:
Kocaeli, Kasimpasa and Denizli.
The first one came from Trabzon city which has been the home of many years the best of Turkis football and the two later come from Ankara and Adana who have been making a spectacular movement.
If the three teams were playing football at home, they would not have any problem at all. It was one of the best championship in Turkey and not only the Turkish teams were competing but also many national teams were getting involved in the championship including, Germany-France, Spain-Portugal... In addition to that some national and international teams have been involved in international competitions in other countries including England, Greece and the Netherlands.
The last four Turkish championships are not just the Turkish champions which are Kocaeli on the second place, Kasimpasa third, Adana on fourth place. It has been an incredible development of Turkish football which is becoming one of the best in the world. Many things have been done in order to make Turkish football move on and not only in the championship, Turkish football was one of the most important of Europe in terms of popularity. Also in Euro 2008, Turkish clubs have taken part in championships and were winning their way to the finals.
As the championships have gone on, Turkish football has changed considerably and the national team of Turkey has been included and they have been playing very well.
The Turkish football was playing very well and is having its good days just like in 2005 when it was also successful in 2005, after the fall of the second half of 2004.
The Turkish football was not having very good times since that period. Many things were happening in Turkish football like national team was very weak which was not having victory in important matches. In addition to that the Turkish football clubs did very badly in the last two years and a lot of clubs were coming out of Turkish football like Adanaspor, Trabzonspor and so many other clubs which were considered as the best of Turkish football. The teams were very weak and many things were not working very well.
The Turkish football clubs were not playing well in the championships and the fans were losing interest and the national team was having difficulty to be involved in important matches.
In the next coming year, we hope that the Turkish national team will be involved in all important matches and the Turkish football will get back its former glory.

The Ministry of Finance has announced on Wednesday it will no longer issue gold-plated cash until the US Mint confirms the price of one penny's worth would be at a level that the country should pay. Last month, the gold-plated coins - the most popular among Thai tourists, cost a total of $34,826 per kilo. An initial offer of gold ingots by the ministry in October, raised eyebrows, with one critic describing it as a ""disaster"". But Finance Minister Kobkarn Wattanavrangkorn defended the move, saying it had come at a time when the US dollar was ""weak"". Mr Kobkarn declined to explain what the foreign exchange rate was at that moment. The ministry announced earlier this month that it would set the price of the coins at $60,000 per kilo, nearly double the previous government's estimate. The US Mint's bid to raise its price for an ounce of gold had sparked anger and ridicule in Thailand, with some Thais comparing it to what an American president would have to pay to purchase a US presidential library, worth several million dollars.

The ministry had offered three options for the price of the coins, each with a different weight and purity. The ministry's highest-purity coins had been pegged at $34,826, the equivalent of one American cent. But the US mint had proposed to set the price of its coins at $35,200, meaning the Thai government could pay up to 4,816 Thai baht per ounces of one-cent coins. It had also put forward a bid for the $35,800-per-ounce of its highest-weighted coins. The ministry's official line was that it did not intend to meet the bid of the mint.

From the summary, is this an article worth writing? Is the article a news article? Will this be considered as news?

You needn't write a narrative. You may begin by introducing the issue.

Actions from the summary:

The article refers readers to a previous summary.

The article reports on a news item.

You're looking for an article that could go out as the opening paragraph of an article. You can use this as your opening:

US Military: Haitham ""Hadi"" Sabah al-Badri, Emir of Greater Samarra, Suspected of at Least Two Attacks That Killed 49

Haitham Sabah al-Badri, the terror leader of Greater Samarra, was known as the ""emir of Samarra."" One of al-Badri's deputies, Anas al-Libi, is believed to have provided training to 20 fighters from Iraq's al Qaeda splinter group that struck at the U.S. compound in the city, according to Iraqi government officials. As a senior militant, al-Badri was suspected in two other attacks that killed 49 people in Iraq. He, al-Libi, ""and others were under surveillance prior … to the killing of Corporal Hennie W. Van Kirk …""

Hadi Sabah al-Badri may be the man in this photo, though it's hard to tell.

The al Qaeda commander is believed to be the ""emir of Samarra.""

Hadi Sabah al-Badri is also known as ""the emir of greater Samarra.""

Hadi Sabah al-Badri used to rule the city of Samarra until U.S. forces drove him out in February of 2003.

Hadi Sabah al-Badri was suspected in two other attacks that killed 49 people.

Two unnamed Iraqi officials said ""at least 11 people, possibly 12"" were killed in separate mortar attacks on the central Baghdad area.

This is the opening paragraph that you're proposing for the news article.

It's OK to use a newspaper story as a template for your opening, as long as you cite it fairly. But you must provide a new headline in the template, and you must also rewrite the summary and write a new sentence.

You don't include any details from the original.

You write a new headline on your own, based upon what you've learned from the original article.

You cite the news story as the source of the elements in your opening paragraph.

Your headline should be something like, ""Al Qaeda is Said to Have Suspect in 'Two' Attacks. Victims of These Killings in 'Central Iraq'.""

After reading the original article, you've found that the story actually provides the following information, which you've copied into your opening:

A U.S. military investigation into a mortar attack that killed Corporal Hennie Van Kirk, the first American servicewoman to be killed in Iraq, is still open. Van Kirk was killed early last August when a mortar attack hit her vehicle.

Van Kirk was killed early last August when a mortar attack hit her vehicle.

The military investigation has determined that Van Kirk was killed by terrorists who used an improvised explosive devise. The U.S. military is investigating whether ""the [improvised explosive] devise… was made in or imported from Iran."" Investigators believe the Iraqi ""mortar shell used to launch the attack was manufactured in Iran.""

Investigators believe the Iraqi ""mortar shell used to launch the attack was manufactured in Iran.""

The Army says it has no word on al-Badri's fate, or whether the U.S. military knows where he is now. One U.S. official has said that al-Badri was suspected of several other shootings.

Van Kirk's death happened as U.S. forces are hunting down al Qaeda in Iraq. U.S. officials acknowledge they still do not know whether al-Badri has actually been put away for any of the shootings.

Al-Badri is a top terror leader for al Qaeda, and one of the chief suspects for the slaying of five captured American soldiers near al-Amarah in February of 2005. (Note: you've made some corrections from the original article that you've incorporated into your headline. This isn't a good approach to headlines. Please refer to the example above for guidance.)

Your opening paragraph must also include the sentence about two",1
"Summary: ""I love ORU with all my heart,"" Richard Roberts writes in his resignation letter. Three professors allege they were fired for revealing misspending. Roberts and wife deny spending university funds improperly. Roberts announced last month he was stepping aside temporarily as president. Article: 

The university's president and vice president of Student Services are both alleged to have been involved in secret negotiations in an attempt to avoid firing three professors and one student for revealing misspending.

A top administrator sent a draft resignation letter for a former chief executive officer to a top university official without including the person's name, a draft obtained by the Houston Chronicle indicated.

Roberts: 'I love ORU with all my heart,' But wife denies spending university funds improperly

Roberts: 'I love ORU with all my heart,' But wife denies spending university funds improperly A top administrator sent a draft resignation letter for a former chief executive officer to a top university official without including the person's name, a draft obtained by the Houston Chronicle indicated.

The official in question is Vice President of Student Services John Hainline. He was identified as one of two people who, according to statements submitted by three fired faculty members, discussed an offer to settle with university officials in secret and in violation of the university’s grievance policy.

Those statements, on top of other evidence, alleged that Hainline’s involvement was the real reason faculty members were fired — not as a reprisal for their speaking out.

When asked point blank at a Dec. 19, 2012 press conference whether he had anything to do with the firings, Hainline said he had not and that he “was as surprised as anyone hearing the news.”

University official: “No proof” of involvement

However, the two documents, released under the Texas Public Information Act, indicate that Hainline was involved in discussions regarding the settlement proposal — discussions that were not included in the official version of events.

Houston Chronicle

The documents, obtained by the Houston Chronicle, show Hainline’s name and comments on the top of the final version of the resignation letter circulated to the university's board on March 26.

The draft version of the resignation letter, sent March 20 at 5:58 a.m. by the vice president for university advancement, included the name of the person allegedly negotiating the offer, but not who it was.

The letter, which was signed solely by Hainline, offered his resignation as university vice president in exchange for a “personal leave of absence” from his position as department chair with a “salary of $250,000 per year plus benefits.”

The document was sent to the university's board of regents, the board's chair, the board's vice chair and to other university officials.

Roberts resignation came with a payoff

The resignation deal was negotiated with an unnamed former chief executive officer (CEO) of the university's general counsel, David Hillyard III, and university counsel, Richard Roberts, according to the draft of the resignation letter. According to University of Oregon records, Hainline was on the board of regent then.

Roberts later said he did not know anything about the negotiations and had never been contacted about the secret settlement offer.

One of the three fired faculty members, who declined to be named, said the email was a back-channel warning of what was to come as a result of their activism. The faculty member said that is what alerted the three former professors regarding the secret settlement offer.

Roberts said he did not know who the former CEO was.

The faculty member said that the former attorney-general, Steve McCrery, then-chancellor and attorney general-elect, Jeff Krohn, current OU President Richard Roberts, and Vice President of Student Services John Hainline came up on the plan.

""I talked to Hainline a number of times after the firings,"" the faculty member said.

Bettina Hansen, a retired public interest lawyer and former member of the OU Board of Regents, said the emails between Hainline and the former CEO would indicate that the settlement offer was one part of a larger plot to pressure the faculty members from speaking publicly. Hansen said the emails were only recently discovered by the university. The communications were initially sent to former OU Board of Regents member Mike Zona in 2012, but never provided to that official, Hansen said.

""It appears that the only reason it has been made public is they're trying to protect the real actors,"" Hansen said. ""It just seems like",1

Thousands lined Beirut streets to honor anti-Syrian MP in Lebanese capital

Noted parliamentarian died during Wednesday rush hour

Flags-draped coffin paraded through streets before burial in Christian district

Day of national mourning called, with schools, universities, public offices shut

BEIRUT, Lebanon, April 5 (UPI) — Tens of thousands of people lined Beirut streets to honor anti-Syrian Lebanese MP Mohammed Zitoun, murdered in a car bomb blast that injured 20 people Wednesday, in the Lebanese capital, according to Al Hayat newspaper.

The Beirut suburb of Kebrejis, where Zitoun’s body lay in its coffer for burial Thursday evening in the Christian area, was one of the gathering spots for the “mourners to come and honor Zitoun’s martyred soul,” a resident added.

The funeral was a solemn, multi-ethnic affair, with the coffin draped in the Pan-Arab, Lebanese, Syrian, French, and Lebanese flags.

Beirut’s streets in the center and north of the metropolis and along the Mediterranean shore were the preferred gathering places for the thousands of mourners, especially since the suburb of Kebrejis is located in the center of town.

The coffin was transported to the Christian district in the suburb of Jebel, where the politician was entombed on Thursday, April 6.

Lebanon’s Daily Star called the politician’s death “one of the most heart-breaking days in the country’s history.”

Lebanon mourned his demise, the national flag was lowered to half-mast, schools and universities remain shut Thursday, and government is under obligation to provide free medical care and free transportation for those who wish to pay their respects to the late MP.

“The nation needs to mourn the passing of one of its children.”

Zitoun, 65 years old, was a political stalwart known for his anti-Syrian stance. The politician, who served as speaker of the Lebanese parliament the last three years of outgoing President Amine Gemayel’s tenure, was one of the key voices for Lebanese democracy and against the Syrian presence in Lebanon after the fall of Saad Hariri’s government in 2008.

Zitoun also had a long political career. He began his career in 1968, working for the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation as a reporter. He was secretary general for the Maronite Order, a Christian organization, from 1978 to 1981. In 1990, he worked as a parliamentary secretary for the then prime minister, Fouad Makhzoumi, in the Lebanese National Assembly.

He was the president of the Maronite University, a secondary school established by the Maronite Church, from 1999 to 2003. The Maronite Order also appointed Zitoun as minister of education.

Lebanese media reported Wednesday that the United States had confirmed to Lebanon’s foreign minister, Gibran Bassil, that the American State Department was ready to pay the costs for the transportation, accommodations and other expenses of people wounded in the Wednesday terror attack on Zitoun’s convoy.

“He was a very popular figure in the country, with a lot of national and international support,” LBC general manager George Hashem told Lebanon’s Daily Star.

“Lebanon was a lucky country to benefit from his presence, his support, his guidance to politicians and parliamentarians. In these tough times, he never wanted to leave Lebanon. He wanted to spend his last days here,” Hashem revealed to Beirut newspaper.

The Beirut Times newspaper noted the MP was a “traditionally religious, religious and secular figure, and his funeral had a mixed crowd of Christian and Muslim mourners.”

The paper added that the Lebanese prime minister “wants his (Lebanese leader Tammam Salam’s) cabinet be formed before the",1

The purpose of this assignment is for you to use a source of information outside of your own experience. You will then investigate that source of information in order to analyze and report on your findings. Your main point will be what you did find out and will be a summary of the original source material. Your audience will want to know what you found, what you believe is true, and how that information could/will affect their lives. Finally, any questions your audience may have should be included in the summary. You can choose one or more facts from the list below, or use information you've gathered on your own to complete the assignment.

Research and analyze in some depth. You should have several sources of information, and your conclusion should include what you think is going to happen. For example, a political party may propose a bill that would ban abortion, or a movie may be released that deals with the impact abortion would have on society. The assignment instructions should give you a specific example, but if you can give an example from your own life (from reading about something that happened that had a lasting effect) this could be very helpful to your audience.

Be original. As you write your conclusion, try not to recycle old arguments. For example, politicians often say we should have higher taxes in order to fund government programs. The conclusion you write in this assignment will be a different argument, even if it is using the exact same sentence structure and the same language pattern as the politician. If you are going to quote a political person, the story should show your connection to your essay: ""The politician said..."" or ""Another political party also stated...""

Consider how you plan to use your conclusion. Maybe you'd like to do an opinion piece. In which case, you should offer your opinion, then conclude with how it will affect you or your readers. On the other hand, perhaps a politician wrote the conclusion and you will be writing about that political figure. If this is the case, you should state the politician's position clearly and make it clear how the politician will respond to your comments.

Check out the source article - Read the entire article and ask yourself how what you are writing fits into the content and overall idea. Do you agree with the arguments and conclusions?

Use the following example summary, first write your summary and then use this as a basis for your work. The summary may be useful for you as you draft your essay, or it may be just for use in the future or as a template. When deciding on a summary, remember: Make your summary as concise as possible; include the essential facts; and focus on one main thesis or focus. Use the summary to develop and format your essay in the style the teacher instructs: A story is told through sentences; you need to learn to write sentences which are clear and concise, and they must tell a story.

Use the following to create a news article to be published on a world wide web site. Write the article in a clear and concise style with simple sentences. Your article should be concise - maximum of 1000 words. Focus on one main idea and use as many quotes as possible and as few adverbs as possible. The article should be",1

"Summary: The 17-year-old suspect allegedly fired the fatal shot. Eric Rivera Jr. will be moved to a Miami-Dade facility Wednesday, attorney says. Three adult suspects in Sean Taylor slaying on suicide watch. Taylor died after being shot in home invasion last week. Article: 

The teen suspected of gunning down Miami Dolphins star Sean Taylor was ""a very, very nice young man,"" and ""really intelligent,"" his attorney said Tuesday.

After Rivera, a suspect in the Dec. 23 slaying, was charged with first-degree murder for allegedly shooting Taylor to death during an alleged robbery attempt, his lawyer said it was the first time he'd seen his client since the slaying.

In the days with Rivera facing charges in Taylor's death, the 17-year-old was ""a very, very nice young man,"" and ""really intelligent,"" his attorney, Alan Lebenscher, said by telephone.

""He got into the neighborhood of South Dade (County),"" Lebenscher said. ""He got involved with some unsavory individuals, and the result will be that he will never be able to enjoy the benefits of a law-abiding life.""

Lebenscher, who has defended hundreds of clients in South Florida, said he did not know what led to his client being lured into Taylor's home the day he died or why he allegedly decided to fire on Taylor as he lay on his bed.

On the day of the slaying, Rivera drove to Taylor's gated West Kendall home in two different vehicles, Lebenscher said.

Rivera took a gun from Scott Williams, who was arrested in Taylor's slaying for allegedly acting as the getaway driver, and approached the home at about 4 p.m. wearing a black hoody and face mask to hide his identity, Lebenscher said.

Rivera entered Taylor's home through the garage and approached Taylor's bed, wearing latex gloves and holding his handgun in his right hand, and allegedly fired at least one shot at the bed, Lebenscher said.

The shot allegedly caused Taylor's bed to start shaking and he allegedly fired several additional shots, according to Lebenscher. Rivera took the gun, a.380 caliber pistol from Williams' hands, and left, Lebenscher said.

At the time of the shooting, Lebenscher said his client told Rivera he was at a party that day, and at no time did he know details about what happened leading up to the shooting.

""It's still very difficult to understand why you would want to take a young man's life over a couple of dollars,"" he said.

A judge did not dismiss the case against Rivera, and Lebenscher said he has a very bad case against his client and will file a motion to dismiss to keep Rivera locked up.

Because Rivera is in the juvenile system, Lebenscher could not say where his client was being held.

""I will let the court address that matter because I don't want him harmed,"" Lebenscher said.

The teen had originally been charged as an adult with first-degree murder, but a judge ordered that his case be moved to the juvenile system a month ago. His trial will be handled by a three-judge juvenile court special, and will be held in two or three months.

Dade detective: Kidnapping was motive

Dade detectives have released details of the day following the shooting, the police report shows, and they claim to have some clarity about Rivera's motive.

According to the report, Rivera and three acquaintances from South Carolina met in Broward and drove to meet Williams at a house in Miami Gardens.

Williams drove to the house while Rivera walked. The two suspects then drove to the home of Taylor in West Kendall, where the suspects were let in around 4 p.m., according to the report.

The alleged suspects walked through the house and Williams went out to the garage and retrieved a handgun from his trunk, according to the report. The suspects then allegedly pulled hoodies over their heads.

Williams pointed his gun at his associates, according to the report, and one of the three suspects pulled out a gun but dropped it as the others continued to follow Williams inside the house and down the hallway to Taylor's bedroom, according to the report.

The report does not say which defendant allegedly fired the first gunshot, but the gunfire was sustained for at least 10 seconds, according to the report.

Rivera reportedly exited the bedroom door and said ""I hit him"" after the suspects were told Taylor was dead of a gunshot wound to the face, according to the report.

All five men left Taylor's home through the garage around the time of the shooting.

Rivera drove Williams' car to an alley where the car was stripped of the car radio,",1

In this article, you must explore several parts of the city. Where would you choose to go? Why? Include a list of activities, places to shop, and restaurants.

How might you describe the activities that are available at the hotel? Explain what the major differences are between the two different hotels.

Write a report on each type of inns (e.g. inns, bed and breakfasts, and chalets). What are their characteristics? What draws people to them? Do the four different types have different marketing strategies? Would their marketing strategies work? Explain.

Explain how innkeepers could learn about their guests? Describe how you or someone else with a good knowledge of the area might offer suggestions and/or advice to an innkeeper on marketing or advertising strategies. Use at least one example of how they did this (e.g. they hired a real estate agent). Explain why you think they might be successful.

What makes one inn attract more customers than the other? How do you think the hotel that is chosen can advertise the other inns? Which approach would be best? Do other hotels already do it? Why or why not? Explain.

Do you think it is important to the marketing strategies of the four types of hotels that they have different characteristics in size, location, services and the price? Why is it important? What will the costs be to get the same service from each hotel? Explain.

How would it be changed for the worse? Do you think it is possible to promote one better than the other, and for what reason? Explain. You may use or adapt information from the following article.

You may also use other information about the four types of hotels, but information from the following lists must be included in the introduction.

All of the types of hotels in the local area are different. One serves meals in its dining room at breakfast and lunch, but not dinner. One serves dinners from Monday through Thursday. The other serves a buffet breakfast. These are just a few features that are important to choose to ensure that you select a hotel with all the amenities your guests need.

You should ask yourself why you are choosing a hotel. What specific problem or issue are you trying to solve with the hotel?

You may choose several kinds of hotels to satisfy different needs. For example, you might choose a hotel to meet the needs of business types who need to meet with the office where they work, but who also need to take a few nights here and there to rest and relax. These guests may expect that they get their privacy and their meals separately. They might also be happy if the hotel has all of their food and a comfortable, clean environment.

You could choose a hotel to meet the needs of family types who are planning vacations and who want to spend their time together as a family and enjoy their vacation with family and friends in the same place. If you are a family member or a close friend of the family, you may enjoy the idea of having fun in the same place without having to stay in a hotel alone. You may want to be able to spend some time in the common meeting areas of the hotel, without feeling like you have to spend all of your time with your family.

You may choose several types of family hotels in order to meet different needs. The types of family hotels are: inns, which have private bedrooms attached to common areas; bed and breakfasts, which offer private rooms with a bathroom inside the room or attached rooms within the main house; and holiday camp resorts that are designed to hold groups of people all at the same time, with limited privacy needs.

You may choose several types of family guest rooms to meet different needs. The types of family guest rooms include: suites of rooms that can be used in the same manner as rooms in the typical hotel, but offer a few more amenities and services (a kitchen, for example); rooms that are used in a hotel style, but that do not allow people to use the kitchen (these may be popular with friends who wish to stay together in one room); and single rooms used for small families.

The purpose of your review is to compare and contrast four types of hotels within your area. Choose one of the areas below. Give a short summary of your review.

Bed and breakfasts and inns in your area are all different. They have different amenities, different services, and different prices. All inns and bed and breakfasts serve food in a variety",1
"Summary: Journalist spent a year looking for the world's happiest countries. Eric Weiner: Bhutan is probably the closest thing on Earth to Shangri-La. He marvels at the creativity and ""coziness"" of Iceland. Self-described ""grump:"" chocolate contributes to happiness in Switzerland. Article:  Happy place? Costa Rica. Weiner finds Bhutan the happiest place: The Buddhist culture gives the world's happiest people room to breath. Read a news article, written by a different reporter, that is based on an analysis of the same information.

What's confusing? The same information is presented in at least 2 seemingly contradictory ways - or are there multiple stories about Bhutan that are contradictory to each other - and what are the consequences of the 2 different stories being presented?

There is the fact that Eric was never in Bhutan. But for the sake of this question, assume it's true.

Eric thinks of Bhutan like Shangrila, in terms of creativity and coziness, and that the ""grumpiness of Switzerland with its emphasis on high school grades and low taxes"" creates happiness in Switzerland. But if Eric was to spend extended time in Switzerland and observe the people he talks about, Eric would have to conclude that people in Switzerland are very unhappy for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which is their lack of creativity and their dislike of ""college-prep high school grade requirements"".

Eric would also be wrong to say that a study of the happiness of a population is based on the ""coziness of lifestyle"" when the fact is that the study of happiness uses a variety of criteria, such as physical and social health, which measures the very things he praises about Bhutan. And Eric himself admits that Bhutan's population is one of the smallest in the world and that the study in question specifically looked for the most happiness in the face of a ""cultural void"".

What Eric seems to be doing is picking out certain bits of a story, and saying they are representative of the bigger story. If he was to spend time in Switzerland and observe the people he praises about, he may or may not come to the same conclusion.

The fact that Switzerland's people are unhappy does create a conflict with Eric's statements about the study, which says the happiest people in the world are in this area of the world. So a better way of writing the article (if any) might be the fact that there are some who are very unhappy about taxes and living in an area that lacks the opportunity for cozies and creativity.

The article Eric links to, is the more likely to be taken as it addresses a more specific aspect of the ""bigger story"", and does not make as much of the ""cultural void"" as Eric.

Which of these news articles is a better story, and why? Is it possible to address them both without contradicting their statements in the ways Eric is doing?

My reasoning is that Switzerland may be a grump because of the ""coziness"" and lack of creativity of their people (according to Eric), which is why they have created unhappiness. A ""good"" article of the sort Eric is looking for would focus this aspect of Switzerland without making claims about it being the case around the world, nor would it be likely to imply that Eric is wrong in his views about Bhutan, which is what I'm getting at.

I believe my explanation is a better explanation for a good news article and I believe that the writer in the article linked to would agree with my interpretation of the news.

In Eric's case, I believe he might even agree since it might imply he's wrong about the people of Bhutan being unhappy if he actually was in Bhutan--and I think his ""cultural void"" comment in the article he links to (with which I agree) is a strong indicator of that.

Of course, this still leaves me wondering why Eric was in the first place, which is why I chose the example Eric himself gave, and I'm hoping one of the people responding might shed some light.

I'd ask you to actually cite your sources to show you've done your homework first.

@JWD -- if Eric wanted to get into this discussion in any more depth, he could simply post his sources and why he believes what he has been told in Bhutan to be true. There is nothing wrong with that. The story seems to be about two very different countries and peoples and this is what both sides are trying to say about them while the article in question is talking about the happiness of the people in the middle of both countries from an outsider's perspective.

Dear friends, last week, I traveled to Iraq with my husband Brad Pitt. The purpose of my trip to Iraq was to visit one of the most vulnerable groups of IDPs, the children in the southern provinces. We had never heard about children who lived under the rubble and now are running, trying to survive.
And what I see are some children with the faces full of dust, full of scars, full of fear. We met the youngest child who was only 4 years old and we were shocked to see that he did not know how to talk. Another 10-year-old girl came up to me and she held out her hand and asked if we ""could help her to go to school?"" It seems that these 10-month-old girls, who are in charge of the house at home and care for the sick, are now the teachers. These children will survive, but how can we help them? Their futures may not be much brighter than their past. So you can imagine what this is like for these children who are already in a refugee camp... Read More

I have been following the crisis in Iraq since 1991. I am a mother and a teacher who does public speaking at conferences, I just love seeing how God works through us in real life. I enjoy seeing that in the same day, we can work together and it actually comes together. We may be a few miles away, but it seems as if we are working with the same hands, feet and heads.

This is not just a game or a TV-show. This is real life happening. We can walk with Jesus and make a difference. It doesn’t seem real that this is happening in our own country. How can this happen, to our own people? Where there are such atrocities, they must end, and quickly! My prayer that God will watch over our leaders, and help us in anyway that he sees fitting.

Hi.
My name is Mary from the United States. It has been over twenty years
since I graduated from college.
I have been living in Germany since I have been working here as a
teacher.
Since I love children as a teacher, I am thinking of moving to Iraq
and I would like to leave all my stuff I have in the States and start
over there. As soon as I can. My husband also wants to work in Iraq
and he hasn't been able to yet, but he hopes to be able to do it.

One of my biggest problems will be that my father is not very well, he has a heart trouble and that I can't take care of him there. I can take care of myself and be able to support myself financially in Germany, but I can't in Iraq. I'm hoping that someone will be able to help me. I really wouldn't know what to do even if I did go there. It seems the situation in Iraq right now is out of control. I don't want anything to happen to anyone there, for any reason. It is simply too difficult to say what exactly will happen, but I believe we must make every effort to get our troops out. I don't want this happening again, ever. And my children still have to grow up somewhere, there's no getting around that. Even if I do live in Iraq they will feel the change at that time, either they'll want to live here or there, and I would wish it to be here, for them to have the freedom to",1

"Summary: New trial at Heathrow airport will use RFID to accurately track and monitor luggage. Compared to exsiting bar codes, RFID tags offer 15 percent more reading accuracy. A proposed service will send SMS to passengers informing when bags arrive. Article: 
A few questions I was hoping for a quick answer too!

What do you think of this idea? Would you use it and pay for it?

What about using the passenger's mobile phone number to notify them of their bag's arrival?

How will this be different from the existing luggage tracking services provided by airlines and customs authorities (e.g. EasyJet's Go Track), since they are based on barcodes?

In what circumstances would it be difficult to install a track-and-trace system? In what circumstances would you prefer a track-and-trace over barcodes? Could this be for small and personal luggage or would you need specialised hardware?

I just had a thought. Isn't tracking luggage already something that airlines and customs services do anyway for their own purposes? Perhaps we wouldn't need this service after all. I guess I'll have to go home and look it up.

Hi,
Great article about this new technology. Here is some things to check and find out if you will need it:

- Airport scanners will work for luggage but the computer that is reading the barcode or the laptop will need software to read the RFID reader.

- All luggage will not have a RFID tag. The tag will only be used on valuable or important luggage. In general all luggage will be scanned on the passenger side of the tills and not by the luggage. This can save considerable money. Even on the expensive luggage on the conveyor.

- The main advantage of an RFID is that it is a very high precision technology that requires very few tags per bag so it can be very cheap.

- There has been talk of scanning luggage with RFID on the baggage conveyor but that has not yet been established.

- There exists tracking services that airlines and customs authorities can provide for luggage if the passenger is willing to pay for it.

- In the main RFID will be used for secure purposes and therefore there will be a database for every traveller so every piece of luggage will be linked to it.

- A database is already created for the traveller and linked to the air ticket. You do not need your own database.

- The current services have similar performance to RFID but less accuracy. Some scanners are very good but some are not so good, even if they are cheap.

- RFID tags are small so easily can be stored without being obvious. Thats why the tags could be in small wallets that also contain important information.

- Tags are not always used, also the computer that reads them needs the software to read the tags. The system that the luggage goes through needs to be modified to read RFID chips.

- Most of the scanners that work today with barcodes and the laptop have been written by the airline and customs and they are very good.

- Some customs have a very good infrastructure to work with RFID they can use it for all kinds of baggage. That is why they will use it on top of their own baggage tracking services, even for a fee.

- The new system will start with an airport trial.

- In time there will be special devices to scan the luggage and read the RFID.

I guess the answers to your questions are all: no, maybe, maybe not, yes and no.

I'd like to add a few things:

- What I really liked in the article was that the author gave a comparison to the current system and told readers that tracking by tags are more accurate, but it does not tell how much more accurate the tag-system is than the computer-system.

- The article mentions ""smart baggage"", but it is unclear if the new system is really ""smart baggage"" that automatically sends messages if it cannot read the tag or the laptop. But I doubt it.

---> The article talks about a new system that will send messages to you, but not that you would know that you have to read the tags before the messages will be sent. The current systems are good enough that messages will always be sent.

- What I do not understand is how passengers can be trusted to read all the tags. They can easily lose the tags for the luggage and just put it in their pockets. But they cannot be trusted with the tags on their personal things.

"Summary: Telegram: King Hussein wanted U.S. strike on invading Syrian troops in 1970. Nixon White House urged Saudis to distance from PLO's Fatah organization. Papers also discuss Israeli acquisition of nuclear weapon. Documents among 10,000 papers released Wednesday by Nixon Library. Article: 

Nixon warned of the ‘‘Arab menace.’’

He threatened that the ‘‘Muslim extremists with their blind faith and their fanatic fanaticism,’’ would destroy the Middle East peace; he declared that ‘‘in the long run we are all Israelis’’; and he warned of the ‘‘Arab menace.’’

He also ordered the American military to start planning for war.

A key document was a 1970 Pentagon ‘‘Memorandum of Conversation’’ between President Richard Nixon and Defense Secretary Melvin Laird. It was revealed at a secret session of the National Archives on Wednesday.

It is an in-depth and sensitive report on the U.S. position on Iraq and Syria at the time. It was written by the assistant secretary of defense for international security policy, Thomas Karamessines, and is dated April 2, 1970, just days before Syria invaded Israel.

It contained the following points about the 1973 war:







Nixon wanted to have the U.S. Army’s Fifth Corps stationed in the Middle East to conduct a ‘‘limited’’ air-sea rescue mission. A plan ‘‘with appropriate force level and other support,’’ he said, ‘‘would not have a major effect on the war but would have a substantial influence on its outcome.’’ (The corps was never deployed.)

Although the document did not directly mention it by name, it is a reference to Egypt’s President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s threat to use the Soviet military ‘‘if necessary to halt the [Israeli] war.’’ It was intended to ‘‘serve as a major warning to Nasser’’ not to interfere, the note says. (Nasser invaded Egypt on October 6, 1973, and died in an airplane crash two months later.)

It also makes reference to the ‘‘Egyptian agreement with Libya to support [Syrian President Hafez] Assad’’ by sending in ‘‘troops and weapons to Damascus to bolster Assad’’s forces. (Syria, it is believed, supplied troops and weapons to the Egyptian leader.)

The document also makes reference to the PLO’s head office in Syria, Fatah, which the U.S. believed was connected to radical and violent groups.

It warned that a Syria regime allied with radical regimes in the oil-rich region of the Middle East would threaten Iran, as well as the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf as well as Egypt. It also said that such a regime in Syria that has close ties to ‘‘radical elements within the Palestinian population’’ would threaten Jordan and Israel.

Nixon told Laird that a ‘‘pre-emptive offensive attack’’ or blockade to ‘‘get Egypt and Syria out of oil’’ was needed, the document says. A successful ‘‘limited’’ attack on Syria with air forces (with the U.S. Navy supplying a ‘‘significant amount of naval gunfire support and air support,’’) would give the U.S. an ‘‘impressive show of strength’’ in the region.

Nixon also said that Syria and Egypt’s relationship with each other was ‘‘of the greatest strategic importance and must not be allowed to deteriorate.’’

He said in a message to Soviet leaders that ‘‘there is no indication that Moscow is likely to interfere with this.’’

There is a reference in the telegram to a 1967 British intelligence report that indicated that Israel had nuclear weapons, including uranium, according to the Washington Post.

On June 30, 1970, two months before the United States and Syria signed a military co-operation pact, a message Nixon wrote to his national security adviser Alexander Haig warned him against any kind of ‘‘close’’ or ‘‘open’’ military co-operation, the Post reported. (He had ordered the National Security Council to develop plans for a military confrontation in the region and warned of a coming war.)

Nixon met on July 2 with Secretary of State William Rogers and Defense Secretary Laird to discuss plans for Syria.

Gemayel's brother Amin was accused of killing more than 1,600 Palestinians in 1982, and the government gave him immunity. This has created a long-term problem in the country. Many Christians still believe the government is the Lebanese army. But Amin Gemayel ran the Amal militia during the war and this is a major reason the government is still so unpopular in the Christian community. His brother is still leading Amal today.
The government has been criticized by many for its lack of action in helping the refugees who fled to the neighboring countries in early 1990s due to the civil war. Amin Gemayel, who had a U.S. passport under his brother Pierre, also fled to the U.S. A Lebanese court ruled he committed murder for money, but he was never extradited. When he returned to Lebanon in early 1990s, the United Nations and the U.S. government pressured the government to allow him into the country. This is one of the longest pending cases at the U.N. Today, Amin Gemayel is the president of the Movement of the Future party.
The government is still working to solve the Gemayel-Amal conflict and the lack of peace has not been helped by the conflict. The government made a deal to give Amal back some land stolen during the civil war. Amal still demands a national reconciliation but the government refuses to meet them halfway.
Gemayel has a wife, Mona, and two young sons.

Amin Gemayel, a Christian leader, had been expected to be named prime minister. But the Muslim-backed coalition government of Kamal Jumblatt agreed to name him as prime minister. His brother Pierre Gemayel was named interior minister by this government. Amin Gemayel was in charge of the country's civil defense. The Muslim coalition government was opposed by the United States. This government also included a number of ministers who served under former prime minister Rashid Karami.
In August 1981, Gemayel's father Pierre Gemayel died at age 65. He was the only Christian to serve as parliament president, prime minister and president until then. After his father's death, Amin Gemayel grew close to his brother Pierre. Pierre Gemayel had been the secretary to Rafiq Hariri. This Lebanese billionaire was assassinated in February 1982. After this, Amin Gemayel, who had a U.S. passport, fled the country.

Write a news article based on the following summary: Christian leader Camille Chalfont is named foreign minister in a government with a U.S.-backed faction and a pro-Syrian bloc. This is the first government formed by the Christian coalition and supporters. The government includes representatives of Syrian allies as well as some Amal militia members. Prime minister Gemayel says an interim government could lead to a national reconciliation.
The war in Lebanon has been ongoing since 1975; today, Lebanese people still look back and question what the future of their country should be.
The first government of Lebanon was formed in February 1975 by the Christian community. But the Syrian-backed Muslim community opposed any government made by Christians. This created a series of crises and violence that has lasted until 1982. Camille Chalfont is a conservative Christian who helped bring together two factions that wanted to start fresh. Today, he is a foreign minister in the government which is to be the first truly Christian cabinet.

"Summary: Woman remembers one Valentine's Day as ""Black Monday"" High expectations for day can come crashing down. Man ended Valentine's Day in handcuffs with date puking. Skip gag gifts -- can of Spam not a good gift. Article:  ""The day that I will always remember was February 14, 1989. Valentine's Day was not an easy day for me... "" I remember the day like it was yesterday. As much as I love my husband (or think I do now), he is a terrible person and he will never truly change. He was born with a certain gift of stupidity and a lack of control. To show my dislike, or lack of understanding for him I would often get him a gift that would be just stupid at best. I would give him a small gift and think it would be a gift he would appreciate. Unfortunately, because of his lack of thinking skills and lack of common sense, I discovered that there were two different gifts for him.

He would appreciate the silly gift if he thought or was told what it was, but once I gave him the real gift and he opened it, he would tell me that he wished I would have gotten him the other gift but it would have never been as good as this one.

What I didn't know was that he knew the gift that I got him was silly, but he thought it was more serious that I perceived it to be. He knows it was silly in that sense, but he wouldn't really have appreciated it (his level of intelligence and thinking ability is not high). When I ask why he didn't like the gift, he would be so quick to tell me about the time when he broke the stupid gift only because we forgot to clean it off the floor. Instead of saying, ""I just bought you a stupid gift and I'm upset it broke"", he is quick to point the finger over the broken item on the floor and tell me how he didn't like it.

So, what is it? How could he not ""love"" a gift that I ""came home to from the store""? I would never know what he wanted and if I asked the question that I wanted a gift for him, he wouldn't have that gift, but how would he know what I might want for him? So, he didn't appreciate the gift, but what do I do with that information? I still like him, but I can't expect the stupid man to like my stupid gift. At this point, I can't even stand to be near him. I don't know if he has ever liked me in the way that I feel I can trust him to like me. However, I am a woman and I need to be with him and I feel like I am expected to love him unconditionally.

Sometimes I wonder if he even really wanted a Valentine's gift on Valentine's Day. He could have told me how much he likes being my man, why did he have to buy me a gift?

If you said, ""Yes"" to all of these questions, you could probably write an interesting article about dating a ""stupid man"" - a title I would definitely read!

"Summary: Majid Khan's attorneys say he endured an ""aggressive"" interrogation program. Khan's allegations of torture redacted in court documents. Bush administration: Khan worked for 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. CIA: The United States does not conduct or condone torture. Article:  CIA: The interrogations resulted in hundreds of pieces of useful intelligence leading to the arrest of 15 terrorists. FBI investigation: Majid Khan played an integral role in providing information that prevented further acts of terrorism.

A few words about the assignment itself. The assignment itself is fairly easy since the summary is pretty clear. It alludes to details from a couple of sources (the court documents and the interrogation memos) as well. There are no details from the FBI investigation.

The first point of debate is, of course, that of the sources. The FBI memo (pg. 6) states that Khan had met with Mohammed (Mohammed's nom de guerre) and, further, had met with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (KSM) as well. The memo claims that Khan was providing information that has lead to the arrest of 15 terrorists. All of these individuals -- Mohammed, KSM, and the other operatives -- have since been convicted and sentenced to death. There have been no further terrorist acts committed in the United States.

The CIA interrogation memo states that Mohammed was able to identify KSM. (pg. 4) From the memo, it seems that Mohammed also named Majid Khan (Majid Khan's nom de guerre, and Mohammed's real name) but does not mention any mention of meeting with him. Further, Khan claims to have been beaten in his home when questioned by the FBI.

So there are a couple of questions: (a) did Mohammed identify Majid Khan, and (b) did Majid Khan identify anyone who was later identified as having been involved in the attacks?

The court documents are more helpful to the first question than the FBI/CIA interrogation memos. The court documents state that Khan's interrogators did not ""ask anyone whether Majid Khan had participated in the terrorist mission, or had identified Majid Khan as a participant."" [pg. 5] From this one can reasonably infer that Mohammed had indeed identified Khan. Further supporting this is the fact that Khan was arrested not because of FBI surveillance, but because they had information that indicated that Majid Khan and KSM were planning an attack.

However, this is not very helpful for the second question. The court documents do not tell us whether or not Khan met with KSM at the US prison in Guantanamo Bay. As far as we know KSM is still at large. If he was ""interrogated"", was he or KSM tortured? We don't know. But the court documents do not clarify these things, and further, it seems odd that CIA would want to withhold this sort of information.

The article will have to be pretty thin, it seems, on its ""torture"" points. But, like so many other points, much turns on the word of the source. The ""torture"" question is also a red herring when it comes to Khan.

What is the point of discussing torture? If Mohammed himself or someone under his command did not torture him, then there can be nothing wrong with what the United States did. That's what the article should emphasize.

That said, the article would do well to highlight at least some of Khan's points. This might be useful if you wanted to argue that torture is an integral part of the American justice system.

As for the points that this article emphasizes:

The article is careful not to say whether or not the detainees' confessions were ""volunteers."" (They were not.)

The article is careful not to say whether Majid Khan was tortured in his home by FBI interrogators, or whether the CIA had done so. (The court documents state that someone had, but not for torture. They are ambiguous about whether it was FBI or CIA.)

The article is careful not to say whether the ""asset,"" KSM, later identified himself in court documents in the case against him. (He did.)

The article is careful not to say whether Mohammed identified KSM only after KSM had identified him -- or whether Mohammed had independently identified Khan. (He had.)

The article is careful not to say if Khan met up with KSM while they were held at the US prison in Guantanamo. (KSM was interrogated separately, and there's no direct evidence that he knew of Khan's meeting with Mohammed; nor that Mohammed told KSM of his meeting with Khan -- in fact, the court documents suggest that Mohammed lied to Khan when he asked about KSM.)

In summary, the article does a good job of being somewhat vague -- and that is by design. Because that's the way Khan's story of torture in his home is told in court filings",1

Analyze the reasoning behind the author's argument.

Write a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. The letter should be approximately 300 words.

Address the issues raised in the article below.

Be polite and respect the opinions of others. Keep your letter concise and organized; avoid rambling and excessive use of unnecessary punctuation. Address readers by name rather than by the last name of their publication. Use a short, informal style that is easy to read, and ensure that your letter is free of spelling and grammar errors.

1) Judge: Lisa Nowak's statements and items in her car were unlawfully obtained

2) Nowak's attorneys have said her comments were made under duress.

3) Former astronaut is accused of stalking and assaulting a romantic rival.

4) Nowak has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted kidnapping.

5) Former astronaut is accused of stalking and assaulting a romantic rival, Nowak has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted kidnapping. The defendant's duress may be based on statements she made to police following the incidents: the defendant told police in her statement that when she asked the witness why he was following her, he told her, ""I couldn't take the fact that you were in love with me; I couldn't take the fact you said you loved me, because even though I love you, I can't love you."" Nowak also told police that the witness had followed her from the airport in an effort to see her at her doctor's office; that she had tried to evade him; that when she learned he had taken an earlier flight, she drove to the office building and called the security desk; and that she tried unsuccessfully to call a security guard.

As a criminal attorney, I can see only one potential motive for Nowak's alleged actions, and that is revenge or spite.

The fact that Nowak has accused the witness of having an ulterior motive in following her leads me to believe that she, not the witness, was the intended victim.

In addition, Nowak's alleged actions at the doctor's office and/or other locations that she related to the FBI agent (at least once, that we know of) were also undertaken in retaliation for the witness' alleged conduct: she was being followed after leaving the doctor's office, and when she arrived at her apartment, she found the witness lying on her doorstep. She told the officers she believed that she had been stalked for three days before leaving the airport for the doctor's office, but that when she returned home from the doctor, she also saw the witness on the doorstep, and believed he had been there for three days; this was in keeping with her allegation that she had left the previous evening (Friday), had returned to the Dr.'s office by 9 am on Saturday, had returned to her apartment that night, and had found the door ajar when she returned home from her doctor's office two days later - Saturday, June 22.

Even if the alleged stalking and assault did occur, and even if the motive did in fact arise directly from Nowak's allegation, Nowak's attorneys will argue that Nowak's actions were lawful. But one cannot argue that Nowak's actions were lawful in any way because he is a witness in the case. Nowak cannot claim that her acts were lawful because she is a citizen of the United States on trial for her alleged acts. The relevant consideration is whether Nowak's alleged actions constituted a violation of Florida law.

Nowak was acting as a police suspect, under the direction of police and the FBI, and she had been told to avoid contact with the police. She was, therefore, an intended victim, and under Florida law, it was unlawful for her to try to avoid being seen by the police or anyone who would report her alleged involvement in a kidnapping or attempted kidnapping. It is even more unlawful for Nowak to try to avoid being seen as a police suspect and an alleged victim with the potential of being charged with a possible felony. When Nowak refused to identify herself or her car in the presence of two police detectives, in an attempt to avoid any possible contact from law enforcement officials, she committed the",1

The questions are based on the following summary:

A forensic art professor at Georgia Southern University is suspected of the theft of an ancient vase. The police think fingerprints found at the scene match the fingerprints of a man who lives in the area.

Police called his friend, Terry Stiles, who says he knows nothing about the incident. Stiles says he is currently traveling in Greece on vacation.

Sara Kincaid was hired to fingerprint the vase. She says she has never seen a vase in her life before, so all she is doing is checking the fingerprints.

Stiles is the art expert who examined the prints. But he says when he went to the police to say that he could interpret them, to make sure that the prints were a match to the suspect, the police didn't buy it.

They said the marks on the vase might be a fingerprint or they could be scratches made when someone tried to remove it. They also said that the vase itself could have fingerprints on it.

Sara says she needs more training in order to learn how to interpret these marks.

In the newspaper, one news source reports that the fingerprints match those of the owner of a nearby art gallery who was last seen in the area.

In the end, the police do not believe that Stiles is the thief. The prints do not match the prints of the owner of the gallery, and it is not the same person to whom the fingerprints belong. The owner of the gallery owns the fingerprints, and the prints are a good match to him.

This is what you don't quite know how to do. What have you got to say about one or more of the subjects?

1. What was a forensic artist? Why would the art expert need to know anything about fingerprints?

2. If the victim's fingerprints were not on the vase, what conclusion could be drawn about the victim?

3. Why didn't Stiles take the police to see the vase himself? If he doesn't recognize the prints on the vase, how could he help Sara?

4. Why has the art expert hired by the police not made an identification?

5. What is the relationship between the fingerprints on the vase and the prints of the suspected thief?

6. Why are the police sure that the suspect is not Stiles?

7. If the suspect, instead of Stiles, were proven to be the person whose fingerprints were found on the vase, would there be any questions about the integrity of the police investigation?

8. What were Sara's reasons for not being accepted by the police as an expert?

1. What was a forensic artist? Forensic artists are people who study the fingerprints, bite marks, shoe impressions, tire and impression comparisons, tire track or boot impressions, hair and fiber comparisons, footprint and handprint comparisons, etc., at a crime scene.

More than 2,100 firefighters were on the lines in Southern California fighting the wildfires. About 2,000 firefighters were battling the blaze that broke out about 11:30 a.m. on Friday near the Pacific Ocean and Pacific Coast Highway just west of the Topanga State Park. In addition to the Topanga blaze, wildfires have scorched about 5,000 acres in the Malibu canyons and other brush-lined canyon areas. Those fires are moving south toward the city of Malibu and into the Malibu Creek watershed.

One new house fire in the Malibu hills was reported about 6:30 p.m.; that fire was extinguished about 5:30 p.m.. Another fire was reported at the intersection of Point Mugu and San Vicente Boulevards, but was apparently started by an arsonist and was under investigation, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.

On Tuesday, a fast-moving blaze swept through the hills northwest of Los Angeles. By early Wednesday, about 5 percent of the 200,000-acre fire was contained.

The Santa Monica Mountains fire was 10 percent contained Thursday morning after the fire was nearly 50 percent contained Wednesday. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said it needed more fire crews due to the massive number of fires, including the blaze near Topanga. It said it had about 200 firefighters with 60 engines and four helicopters assigned to the blaze. Crews also contained the flames by 8 a.m. Tuesday on the south side of Topanga.

The blaze ignited between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., the county fire service said.

Wildfires tore through more than 200 homes and prompted thousands of residents to flee as flames and embers roared from hillside canyons above suburban Los Angeles, threatening the life of the nation's celebrated zoo before dousing Southern California on Friday with a wall of flame that has devoured more than 10 square miles.

""Smoke billowed above the Santa Monica Mountains and darkened Hollywood, the nation's entertainment capital. A major fire raged near Pacific Park and was threatening the homes of several stars.

""With flames roaring up Malibu Canyon, wildlife and conservation officials moved animals from the Santa Monica Mountains to the safety of the Santa Monica Zoo, which is near the ocean, more than a mile away.""

The fire was first spotted Sunday afternoon about 1.5 miles away from the zoo. There were no injuries reported.

The wildlife was moved with help from the Humane Society and the National Guard. About 1,500 horses, birds, reptiles and other animals were brought to the zoo.

""It's always a concern when you move that many animals,"" said zoo spokeswoman Sue MacKinnon.

The zoo's animal care staff are working to feed the animals and keep them calm until additional firefighting resources arrive.",1

"Summary: Fran Townsend says she'll look for opportunities in the private sector. Townsend has worked in government and law enforcement for 25 years. Townsend will be on a panel searching for a replacement. Article: 

Question:

This is one of my most hated forms. My students dread it. The questions usually have more than one correct answer. I'm pretty sure that they are going to fail. If this were a real exam, someone would have to hand in the answers on a piece of paper and get a grade based on his/her answers. I don't think that's a good idea. It's too risky and it would take too much time. I'm not about to grade a bunch of essays.

As long as the essay grader is a professional and not a friend of the student (that is, a good friend) the system will work fine. This system, at least, will help you improve your skills. My favorite way to teach the AP U.S. Government and Politics Exam.

So: how?

Well, let's take a look at my system of essay grading. I have developed one that is similar to the following one. This system requires you to find all the ""hints"" that the grader is giving. These hints are usually one of these things:

We do this because we're so sure that all of the correct answers will give the grader a sense of what we are thinking. So far, we've been pretty wrong about this and, as a matter of fact, I usually get the complete answer wrong and have to guess. This year, for the first time, is going really well. I actually got all my answers wrong in the first test. I would have been a little unhappy with myself if my students did not know this.

Here's the rub: How are your students going to find all these ""hints?"" My students have this amazing ability to think like a grader. They think like graders because I grade the exact same way, except, when I do it with my students.

My grading method is: every essay has 8 choices. I look at all of my essay options and look for what I think are hints about which answer should be right. I look for:

the correct answer (right/wrong)

the topic that the correct answer needs to match (a question that the correct answer must provide the best answer to)

the correct answer in terms of what the correct answer would be if the student has read all of the possible answers (not relevant to the student's essay)

a different topic (which matches in terms of the subject matter but matches in terms of the answer to the student's essay) that is correct and needs to be discussed.

a choice that needs to be discussed (not a student's topic) AND matches in terms of the same topic as the correct answer (which is the grader's topic) AND matches in terms of the topic that was asked for by the question

a choice that has different words... but the grader knows that this choice must be correct.

What this system does: it builds on some basic rules about how essays are written.

What is Essay #1 asking?:

Essays #1 are asking the students to give an answer that is a choice. Students must choose an answer and write a supporting argument. Their essay must follow a structure that has something to do with the following guidelines:

Use supporting evidence to support the argument, and/or

Summarize information in the passage

Write at least one paragraph in the essay.

How does this work? Let's do an example:

What is wrong with this essay?:

It does not say anything meaningful about the topic

It does not follow the structure we want.

It does not match the question that it is supposed to be answering.

This has nothing to do with the question at all and looks like nothing more than an essay to make the points that the student would like to make

How do I get this?:

This is my system of grading essays.

Every essay has two choices. This is the essay that is asking for:

A choice that matches the topic and matches in terms of the information already provided in the passage about the topic

A choice that needs to be discussed.

What this system does: it creates a basic structure for writing essays. The essays don't need to be perfect. All you need is a place to start. This can be a good way to get started with an essay. What it can not do is tell you what you really have to do for a successful essay. What it DOES tell you is the way that graders think.

I've used this system for over ten years and it has NEVER failed to work.

You can do much worse than to try this",1
"Summary: Attorney: Clients allege terrorism, war crimes, wrongful death, seek $7.86 billion. Plaintiffs want $20 million in damages for each of 393 victims named in suit. Chiquita admits paying a group that the U.S. labeled a terrorist organization. Company ""categorically denies"" attorneys' allegations, says it will fight them. Article:  Chiquita is facing criminal investigations in Colombia. The company has agreed not to buy or sell products linked to the named plaintiffs. ""Our position is that our company has not been involved in any way or has been connected to crimes,"" said Chiquita lawyer, Bill Ostrof. Lawsuit says Chiquita has been connected to some of the deaths named in suit. Chiquita admits its workers may have carried out the violence described. Chiquita owns Colombian plantations, banana stands and is the second largest banana producer in South America. The company is also part of the Colgate Palmolive Corporation ""The defendants are a bunch of liars,"" said attorney Marc Bern, who has filed the suit, and whose client lives in Columbia. Colombian army is investigating the deaths that are at the crux of the case. Colombian government has labeled the AUC as terrorist. It was linked to acts of violence during the 1990s. U.S. government labeled the Colombian rebel group as a terrorist organization in 1997. Chiquita admits paying about $27 million in the seven years to a front agency linked to the AUC - and says it is no different than when company gave millions to a front linked to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The suit cites the AUC's kidnapping and murders in the U.S. During the mid 1980s, it is estimated that over 40,000 people were abducted from their homes across Colombia, including U.S. citizens, according to the suit. The kidnapping continues today, with thousands of victims every year. Colombia's Attorney General's Office said it received over 1,200 kidnapping complaints last year alone. The AUC has also been linked to killings, such as the 1992 murder of a family in which three children and the mother were killed. The AUC has denied any support of violence.

"Summary: Police affidavit quotes mother's statement about beating that killed girl. Mother's husband threw Riley Ann Sawyers across room, affidavit says. Husband later attempted suicide, mother told police. Riley Ann's mother and her husband arrested after a tip led to search. Article:  Officers found Riley Ann in her crib dead about 5 a.m. Wednesday, July 11.

How to use the information the girl's mother gave police to write a news article based on the following summary:

The boy and girl were friends. In the summer, according to police, they started going to the public pool instead of at the home of the boy's parents, who do not live in the same house. Sometimes the friends would stay over at the boy's house overnight, sometimes not. On July 5, according to the police affidavit, the boy's father found the girl sleeping with the boy in the boy's bedroom.

According to the affidavit, the boy, who is 5 or 6, went to his mother at her mother's house, and she left with him to get more clothes. When the mother returned with the new clothes, she told the father she had gone to the bathroom to get his daughter. The affidavit said the mother tried to give the girl toothbrush and paste, as she usually does, and tried to wake her, but the girl didn't wake up.

The boy's mother called 911, telling the dispatcher her son was trying to wake the girl, but she thought something was wrong with the child's breathing.

The boy's mother called her husband; they had been having an argument, and it's possible she was looking for an opportunity to get the girl away, the affidavit said. She told the dispatcher the boy and girl were alone together at the girl's house and that there were a bottle of orange juice and a half-eaten box of raisin bran on the floor. She told the dispatcher that it was the only food she had for the girl.

The call to 911 is 9:12 a.m. The mother's 911 call was the first of several from the family's home, a two-bedroom, white mobile home, about a mile northeast of Iva in north-central Oklahoma, where the Sawyers have lived.

[1]
[2] The girl's mother gave an expanded version of the girl's 911 call, told when the call was made and for what reason.
[3]

[3] The boy's parents were watching television when they heard the boy screaming, ""Someone is killing my sister; someone is killing my sister."" His mother followed the sound of his voice and saw the boy crying in a bedroom; she told police her son was on top of his 12-year-old sister who was lying on the floor, moaning.

The boy’s father called 911 about 12:03 p.m., telling the dispatcher the girl had said, “my mom is going to kill me, I’ve been pushed, and she doesn’t like me,"" according to police.

He said to the dispatcher she was ""bleeding from behind her ears and nose and her mouth... just all over.” He said to police, “I was trying to stop her.” Asked to explain what he meant, he said “I just tried to stop her from being beat by her mother, by a doctor, the doctor just killed her... I’ve never seen anyone die before. I don’t know what to do.” At the time of the call, according to the affidavit, the girl’s mother was at home and watching the television.
[4]

The father told police he grabbed a stick and hit the girl, then “chased her to the closet and she got inside, I tried to open the closet door, I broke it down, I couldn’t get her out, I could hear her banging like that inside, like that”

He said, according to the affidavit, that he called 911 because he didn’t know what she had been told by someone else that he hit her. He told police he thought “maybe she was lying about the whole thing, she’s been talking to other kids about me and she’s lying.” “I thought I was dying, I thought I was going to die,"" he told police.

The father said there was no one in the house with the girl or the boy when he called 911.

The father told police on the way to the police station he stopped at what he thought was his girlfriend’s house. The boyfriend asked him what had happened to his sister and he told him she was a victim of child abuse. According to the affidavit, the father’s brother said to the father, “Oh my God, it’s not gonna",1
"Summary: Topps Meat Co. hamburger patties may contain E. coli bacteria. New Jersey plant's grinding operation shut down. As many as 25 cases of illness recorded in eight states. Article: 

What would this study cover? What should this study find?

The following information will be presented as the background of the article:

New Jersey

- As many as 25 people in New Jersey have been infected by an E. coli
bacteria-based outbreak since mid-August (see chart at the end of this
article). At least 12 people have been affected so far in eight states
(see table below), which include the first two states affected: New
Jersey, and then Illinois and Kansas. The third state, New York, now has
10 cases.
The number of cases nationwide, and in other
outbreaks, rose to 45 when Nebraska reported its first cases of the
outbreak in early September (see chart). At least one hospitalization in
Nebraska may be linked to the disease, though more data is still needed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised
preparation in the event of an emergency (to prevent further community
transmission), especially with the current lack of antibiotic
vaccination.
So far more than 3,200 people have been examined for the
outbreak in the U.S. alone. The CDC has said that it is working with the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to determine if the outbreak is most
likely linked to a specific food or ingredient. The FDA is conducting
its own investigation, and as of Sept. 23 had investigated more than
300 facilities nationwide that handle any potentially contaminated or
precursor materials used in the production of meat and poultry.
The source of the outbreak has not
been determined.
As of Sept. 16, a state epidemiologist had ruled out
ground beef, according to a CDC statement. That statement suggested that
beef or ground beef might have been the source of the outbreak, but may
have been contaminated more than a few months prior to the first
recall.

To do it, it is likely that you’ll just be making your very own list of ideas for what may work and what does not for your paper, and you just sit and watch for the best ideas and make that list. Once the list is ready, you then need to consider where you might put your content and you start your planning process. The planning process requires that you consider the audience and also decide where the content should be placed. After that, you start the process of writing your original content.

Find a profitable niche. Starting with your interests, write down as many niche ideas as you can. Think about topics people might search online. Ideas include passions (like surfing or body building), fears (like spiders or speaking in front of crowds) and problems (like getting out of debt). Do keyword research to see it others are interested in the topic. Find out if a domain name is available that matches the keyword, and most importantly, is optimized for the type of content you write.

"Summary: Texas voters go to the polls March 4. Sen. John McCain is the clear front-runner on the Republican side. Sen. Barack Obama is on an eight-state winning streak. Some strategists see Texas as a must-win state for Sen. Hillary Clinton. Article:  Will the Texas vote boost the senator from Illinois?

The News:

Texas voters go to the polls March 4. Sen. John McCain is the clear front-runner on the Republican side. Sen. Barack Obama is on an eight-state winning streak. Some strategists see Texas as a must-win state for Sen. Hillary Clinton. Will the Texas vote boost the senator from Illinois?

The Issue:

Sen. Clinton has the Texas advantage:

* She is the only national candidate to win the state in a presidential election. She won with 56 percent in 2000 and 52 percent in 2004.

* More Texas voters in 2000 and 2004 voted for Gore than for Bush. She is the only national candidate to have two consecutive winning Texas presidential tallies. She is likely to win in Florida, Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia too.

The Background:

Texas voters go to the polls March 4. As many as 30 percent of the registered votes in the state come from early voters, those who cast their ballots before Election Day. More than two million Texans have already chosen which presidential candidate they support. The state typically decides a winner in the election.

Sen. John McCain is the clear front-runner on the Republican side. Sen. Barack Obama is on an eight-state winning streak. Some strategists see Texas as a must-win state for Sen. Hillary Clinton. Will the Texas vote boost the senator from Illinois? Will Texas be a deciding factor in the Democratic nominee’s bid?

The Strategy:

* Texas is the home state of one of Sen. John McCain’s top supporters. Gov. Rick Perry is a loyal supporter and has campaigned for the GOP candidate. He has been traveling the state, stumping for McCain.

* Texas is not on the radar screen for either candidate as of yet. There is not a major presidential campaign there since Sen. Clinton decided to stay home in 2000. The state is also a traditional Democratic stronghold and is an important contributor to the party coffers. It is the second largest economy in America behind California, and it is expected to be the single largest contributor to the party this year.

* Sen. McCain and his campaign team believe they have a good chance to win Texas. His campaign manager, Rick Davis, is a longtime Houston campaign operative with extensive experience in Texas. In 2002, Davis was senior consultant to the Bush campaign. Republican consultant David Boies has also been hired to lead McCain’s campaign in North Texas.

* McCain is the national favorite to win Texas, but it has been a close race in the past. It has been considered an Obama pickup opportunity. It has not always gone in his favor: In 2004, he lost a six-way poll to Bush, G. W. and four other GOP candidates, garnering only 44 percent of the vote. Four years later, in 2008, he won with 48 percent of the primary vote.

* In the past three presidential elections, three Texas voters cast Texas votes that would decide the election.

* In the 2000 Bush/Gore race, Gore captured Texas with 54 percent of the vote, while Bush received 46 percent. Gore’s victory put him over the 270-vote threshold for the Electoral College, thus becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to do so since 1944.

* In the 2004 Bush/Kerry race, Kerry carried Texas with 56 percent of the vote, while Bush received 44 percent. This time, it was closer, but Kerry still held a small lead, and did so again in the closing weeks of the campaign.

* Some argue that Texas is the only place that will determine who becomes the Democratic nominee. A loss for Sen. Clinton in Texas is possible. If this happens, her supporters will claim that Texas voters rejected a candidate in the Democratic primary. Texas is a swing state and usually goes Democrat on the presidential race.

* On the other hand, Sen. Clinton’s advisers believe she can win without a Texas comeback. With a popular vote margin of nearly 1 million votes, Texas is not a significant battleground state. Sen. Clinton should be able to do well in the other large states: She should win Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. The winner of the Lone Star State is likely to hold Indiana too.

Factors:

* Voters in Texas could decide the entire race if Sen. Clinton and Sen. Obama split Texas Republicans. Sen. McCain’s support in Texas is strong, but polls show that Obama has the edge among Texas voters. A Clinton win in the primary and the general election would give new meaning",1

"Summary: Kaka deservedly named World Player of the Year for the first time in his career. The Brazilian beats Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the journalists' vote. The 25-year-old averages one goal in three games for both AC Milan and Brazil. Article:  Kaka has scored the first goal in two of AC Milan's three Serie A wins this season. In other awards news, Ronaldo wins the European Golden Boots as Bayern Munich's new striker Mario Gomez makes history by being the first Bundesliga player to achieve the honour.

**Keywords:** Kaka, AC Milan, FIFA World Player of the Year, Serie A

###  KAKA: WORLD PLAT FORMALITY

In his first year in his homeland, Brazil's Kaka has enjoyed a meteoric rise to stardom. The midfielder, nicknamed the Black Pearl, is one of the most exciting stars in world football.

Kaka signed for AC Milan for €32 million in 2001 and is the club's fifth highest earner. He left Atletico Madrid to join Milan in the summer of 2003. The following year his contract was extended by two years, and he has recently signed a new deal.

Kaka, who came from Botafogo in Rio de Janeiro, made his senior debut in Brazil in 2003 whilst still a teenager. He began to shine in his country's youth sides and in 2005 he became his country's number one at the Under-20 World Cup and won his first senior call-up to the national team in December of the same year. The first tournament he was eligible for after his transfer to Milan was the Champions League final, where Portugal beat Italy 1-0.

Kaka has been an ever-reliable performer in midfield and he has consistently been one of Brazil's more productive and influential players at both club and international level.

The 25-year-old scored the opening goal in Wednesday's Milan derby against arch-rivals Sampdoria at the San Siro - his first goal in four years for the Rossoneri. Kaka also struck the final goal in another Milan derby success (3-1 against city rivals, Inter) and his goals were a key factor in the Bianconeri clinching the 2003 UEFA Cup.

Kaka has found immediate success in Rome, bagging seven goals and six assists in 19 Serie A appearances since moving in 2006. He has also been a prolific scorer in the Champions League, scoring five goals in eight appearances for Milan. Kaka has netted twice in his past three games for the Milan outfit, and his four goals and eight assists were the joint most of any player in the competition. He has been a key factor in Milan keeping pace with Liverpool and Manchester United in the title race.

The Brazilian, who scored a hat-trick on his birthday during Milan's 2-1 victory over Sampdoria at the San Siro on Saturday, is arguably the second best central midfielder in the world after Manchester United's Michael Carrick. The 24-year-old is renowned as one of the best players in the game, with his style both a delight to watch and a major influence on his team-mates. His creativity is reminiscent of Brazil internationals Socrates, Bebeto, Romario and Ronaldo.

The Brazil defender has helped to keep a clean-sheet on five of the six occasions he has started for Milan in the Champions League, and he has been directly involved in five goals - two of them from headers. Brazil are the lowest-ranked side currently in the competition (20th), but Kaka seems a natural at this stage of the competition.

Kaka is the top-rated centre-back in the latest FIFA World Player of the Year rankings - even higher than Argentina's Sergio Aguero (third), Spain striker Fernando Torres (fifth), Brazil's goalkeeper Julio Cesar (sixth) and Italy's Alessandro Del Piero (10th). The 24-year-old's consistency over the last two seasons has seen him go from a midfield starlet on the verge of being selected by Sir Alex Ferguson to a potential Ballon d'Or contender by the time he leaves the San Siro on Saturday night.

Kaka is the third highest scorer in the Champions League this season. He has found the back of the net 15 times in the competition, including an extraordinary 10 goals and five assists for Milan. His latest feat came at the Santiago Bernabeu. Kaka netted a late equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw between Milan and Real Madrid. He has not, however, found the net at the San Siro against AC Milan in more than four and a half years. He is also in sensational fashion in Serie A. Only two midfielders have scored more goals in the league this season than the Brazilian's eight.

His incredible scoring record saw Brazilian fans vote him into the top 10 of their all-time favourite players.

I'm just learning how easy it is to build a website.
I want to put a basic website together so my friends and family can view the stuff I
have done. Can somebody suggest a good website author, and maybe suggest a
web template?

1) What are your interests and passions?

2) Can you describe any problems or concerns you had growing up?

3) Could you describe at least one positive experience you would like
others to consider?

4) Write a brief description of a place that you think is a good place for
your kids to grow up.

5) What have you learned lately?

6) Do you have any aspirations you want to work towards in the future?

7) Can you describe two things that you would recommend to a friend?

8) Do you have any personal beliefs that you would like everyone to know?

9) What is the best advice you ever got?

10) What are the things that you think will make you a successful person in the future?

I have worked for several years as an engineer and consultant in the financial services industry. My specialty is the creation of software solutions to meet the needs of the industry.

It has been difficult to find a position that I might consider for a career change because my specialty is very narrow - it has nothing to do with the financial sector.

Would you recommend the career change to your associates and what do you think would be the best career for me at this time?

1) What are your interests and passions?

2) The best interests and passions are my family. I am married and am the father of three great kids, a son and two daughters.

3) I love the outdoors, sports, and I am a fan of the Colorado Rockies. I also enjoy golf but haven't played it in quite some time because of injury.

4) A great experience I'd like to share with others is when we moved to Colorado Springs. It is wonderful to live in a safe, fun, clean, and beautiful city surrounded by vast and rugged mountains.

Colorado Springs is home to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point (Army) and the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs.

This community is a great place to raise a family. There is plenty of open space within easy driving distance of the house.

I would like to start my own business. It is an exciting opportunity and I am looking forward to starting on this endeavor.

What type of business would you recommend for a non skilled person such as myself. I guess what I am
thinking is how does a person learn the skills needed to start an independent business when they have never done anything like that before. For someone who is just starting a business I am guessing that learning how to do it would be overwhelming for me. Am I correct in thinking that? I would like to ask you some of the things you have learned.

1) What are your interests and passions? In high school I was a cheerleader and I worked in the cafeteria.

2) What problems and concerns do you have that you would like to solve? My family

3) Do you have an example of a positive experience you would like others
to consider? I love my family, my neighborhood and my city, and I love to make
others happy. I like to help with the community and I like to help make
people feel happy.

4) Write about a place that you think is a good place for your kids to grow up. In my area of central North Carolina it is a great place. People are extremely friendly and there is so much to do. There are lots of opportunities to meet people. I like the pace of the life in the area, and how people seem to really value it.

5) What have you learned lately? I have learned about being thankful.

6) Do you have any aspirations you want to work towards in the future? I have many hobbies I'd like to try, but just not enough time, like the art that I make. I want to create a work of art that I am proud of. I love to write, so I write poetry, but I don't like to sing my poems. I love photography, but I haven't had time to develop that skill, but I love it.

7) Can you tell me about two things you think that you should be the most
happy? My family. I hope they never move. My hobby",1
"Summary: Scientology membership a privilege that's earned, Cruise says. 2004 video part of ceremony honoring Cruise for humanitarian work. Scientology defined as ""study of the truth"" Article:  by Cruise. Scientology leader L. Ron Hubbard quoted on how he defines Scientology. Scientology is a religion that holds a ""theocracy"", Cruise says. Scientology called a ""philosophical fiction"" and a ""fraud"". Cruise makes a joke about ""the biggest religion in the world"". Scientology leader L. Ron Hubbard and other church members called ""monkeys, apes and idiots"" to describe non-believers. Church members who get their money and property ""taken"" by the Church are ""victims of injustice"", says Scientology leader L. Ron Hubbard. Church leader L. Ron Hubbard called ""one of the wisest men to ever live."" Cruise: Scientology ""will open the eyes of many people. Scientology is the best-kept secret in the world.""

The study found that for the average person reading about the Scientology religion and its adherents, the best way to know how believable the church is is to find out who the best-known Scientologist is. In terms of the study? It's Tom Cruise.

Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard have a large following in the US, and Cruise has been one of its public faces for decades -- a position he said he took on in part to protect the group from people who say it's a ""fraud.""

But his public reputation could also work in the group's favor, the research said, by providing a veneer of respectability in the face of criticism. ""If it were a secret church within a secret society that no one had ever heard of, then I think that would be one thing,"" said a marketing expert who did not participate in the study. ""It would just be a case of the government investigating this church, but if it says, hey, wait a minute, this is a well-known celebrity who's been associated with us,"" that could open a lot of doors. -- Christian Shepherd, AP News

A man in San Juan, Puerto Rico walks his dog, Wednesday, July 15, 2009. A new study found the best way to tell if a religious group is legitimate is to consult with the person who has been most publicly associated or promoted with that association. So if Tom Cruise says something about being the leader of one of your major religions, that would be a pretty good indicator of whether you should trust it, the study finds.

(AP) -- By the numbers

Study: Religion, not personal association

""People are pretty good at making their opinions about something they know nothing about based on their association with it."" -- study co-author

""I think it's the case that if one person in a religion gets very well recognized, and another doesn't appear to be well respected, it can be viewed as an indication of which one has the power to propagate a religious viewpoint or not."" -- study co-author

""The one group that is able to perpetuate itself on the strength of its popularity are religions like Scientology. If you look at the list of the top 10 religions in the world, you will find that each of them have an interesting set of characteristics"" that set them apart from other religions.

""One is that they each have this charismatic leader...Another one is that in every one of those religions, the followers are able to do some kind of religious ceremony for these charismatic figures where they perform acts that are outside the scope of normal human acts (like having sex changes), but these rituals are still part of the religion because it's a symbolic act and not an actual one.""

""And all religions, but perhaps especially Scientology, try to recruit their followers with the promise that you become part of an elite group through this particular ritual.""

""The ritual is also performed publicly in many cases, allowing for a large number of people to witness it.""

Write the first draft of a policy paper that analyzes the future of Africa in terms of development and social organization in the next 5-10 years:

Africa is still in the beginning phases of globalization. Despite the recent gains made, many African countries still need investment to improve their situation socially and economically, which will require substantial resources and a greater role for international corporations. One of the key goals facing Africa is to reduce the current inequalities that exist between the poor and the rich, as poverty still exists in some African countries. The UN has predicted the population in Africa will be an additional 2.4 billion people by the year 2050.

Develop a case study in economics about the role/impact of foreign direct investment in Africa:

Foreign direct investment in terms of FDI has increased dramatically in Africa. According to the UN, more than $2.4 trillion has been injected into the continent since the early 1970s, with $2.3 billion in 2011. FDI is still at an early stage of expansion, but foreign multinational corporations are planning for expansion of the African markets, especially as the growth of individual FDI in Africa has steadily increased since 2005. African countries with the highest potential for FDI is in the financial services sector of which Nigeria and Ghana are currently at the forefront. As of 2006 there were 2,000 companies registered in Ghana and Nigeria alone. However, these companies have not yet expanded and penetrated the market; the main investors in the African market are mostly Western corporations.

Develop a case study on the state of African literature and film:

Africa has a growing literature population that has been increasing at about 14% per year since the early 1990s. There are approximately 22,000 African authors and 2,000 writers of color around the world. There was a rise in literature around the World War II period with an increased number of journals. The first African author to have their work published worldwide was the Senegalese author Cheikh Hamidou Kane in 1958, while the first African author to win the Nobel Prize was Wole Soyinka in 1986. Literature has been used to promote peace and equality throughout history and therefore is a tool for development. African literature can be seen in the form of newspapers, journals, novels, short stories, and plays. These forms include ""African"" writings in African languages and African versions of novels, plays, and short stories from all regions of Africa.

Develop a case study about the state of African politics and religion:

African politics are based on nationalism by the people to make the country more equal. However, many politicians have ignored the people's will and have created a centralized or a semi-centralized state. Religion is present in Africa and many faiths are practiced today: Islam, Christianity, Roman Catholicism, Buddhism,",1
"Summary: Vick's attorney says early surrender shows Vick accepts responsibility. Sentencing set for December 10 on dogfighting charges against Michael Vick. Atlanta Falcons quarterback pleaded guilty in August. Monday, he surrendered to begin whatever sentence he gets on December 10. Article: 

Is this sentence appropriate? Why, or why not? Do you think the judge was tough or lenient? Why? Why not? What do you think it tells us about Vick's attitude in the case? Why?

A.S.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Michael Vick pleaded guilty to two federal dogfighting charges on Monday, and he will surrender to prison on December 10 -- the sentencing date set by a federal judge.

""The Atlanta Falcons quarterback entered court and pleaded guilty to two felonies -- conspiring to participate in a dogfighting ring and possessing property and proceeds obtained from the illegal activity,"" the newspaper said.

""Vick admitted to being a leader of or participant in a conspiracy to commit and participate in the conduct charged, although he denied the charges when questioned by one of the judge's law clerks,"" the newspaper reported.

In addition, Vick ""admitted he knowingly violated the [Animal Welfare Act] while he maintained his dogs were bred for companionship, not to engage in dogfighting,"" the newspaper said.

A criminal complaint filed in June in Atlanta said Vick participated in the activities from 2002 to 2006.

""The complaint did not allege Vick killed or wounded animals, which federal prosecutors declined to do, saying the law clearly prohibits killing and maiming of animals,"" according to the newspaper.

""Vick agreed to forfeit millions of dollars, including $1 million he had in a money market account, $500,000 he had in a Merrill Lynch account that prosecutors said he used for his personal purposes, $50,000 he had in his personal checking account and more than $15,000 he had stashed in his safe,"" according to the newspaper.

Vick received a $100,000 payment on his house on Wednesday, and he received another $400,000 on February 6, 2008, ""to help pay off a federal mortgage on his Atlanta mansion,"" the newspaper reported.

The newspaper said that the judge accepted into evidence the payment and ordered that the money be paid to the government within 90 days of sentencing.

Vick also agreed to pay $20,000 to the Humane Society of the United States. That money will be directed to the Humane Society's Center for Justice and Accountability in Washington, the newspaper said.

Vick's sentence was handed down by U.S. District Judge Henry Floyd, who also sentenced Vick's co-defendant, Kenneth Farrow, to three years and seven months in prison for his role in the case.

A sentencing date has not yet been set for Farrow, who was found guilty of three counts last week, according to the newspaper's online report. ""Farrow is likely to serve the sentence he received concurrently with the one for which Vick pleaded guilty, but the precise timetable is unclear,"" the newspaper said.

Vick also will pay a personal fine of $10,000 and forfeit ""the $70,000 bail for the dog he posted at his attorney's office before traveling to the federal trial in Atlanta,"" the newspaper said.

Vick, his father, mother, two brothers and other members of his family are scheduled to appear in court on Monday to have their federal and state court records unsealed, said Vick's attorney, Michael Cornelia.

According to the newspaper report:

""Cornelia asked how the public and Falcons fans would react to seeing Vick go to prison, but the judge said there was no need to worry. She also said people will be able to judge for themselves how Vick has conducted himself.""

""Facing the possibility of jail time, Vick's lawyers have been trying to convince the judge to set a lenient sentence of time served,"" the newspaper said.

"" 'Even the judge in my situation can't decide a sentence as she has no control over it,' Vick said in court Monday. 'Just because my hands are empty does not mean that my heart is empty. A lot of people that have walked in this courtroom have gone to places of redemption. I know that I need to go down a different road.' ""

""After Vick pleaded guilty in August, Vick gave up his Falcons season tickets and the right to travel with the team,"" according to the newspaper. ""He also decided to cut back on his traveling, according to court documents.

"" 'It's safe to say that he has given that up, probably for good,' said his lawyer, Michael Cornelia. 'The bottom line is we're still seeking the best sentence for him."" ""

The newspaper said that Vick gave up his seat in the front row at last week's Falcons-Rams game and he has given up",1

"Summary: Bridge reopens Friday morning after highway engineers give OK. Four killed in chain reaction crash that started when two tractor-trailers collided. Three killed in pickup truck that fell off bridge; 4th victim in car that hit one 18-wheeler. Crash happened on bridge linking Pharr, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico. Article: 

Summary

The bridge linking Pharr and Reynosa, Mexico had been closed since June 29, after an 18-wheeler driven by a construction worker for a trucking firm hit a concrete pillar, causing the truck’s load to topple over the side and the truck to be dragged into a canal. The accident was triggered by a car whose driver tried to stop to avoid hitting a van in front of her.

Pharr is a city in Texas and Reynosa is in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which shares a short border with Texas. The accident happened on a bridge between the two towns. Pharr is about 25 miles west of McAllen on U.S. Interstate Highway 69.

A highway engineer for Pharr Mayor Ruben Cortez de Velazquez said that construction had been completed four weeks ago on improvements to the Reynosa Bridge, about 15 miles north of the bridge site. The accident, which the city’s mayor called “a terrible tragedy,” happened only hours afterward, around 6 a.m. Friday morning. The bridge reopened around 6:30 a.m. with a temporary barrier.

The Texas Department of Public Safety has identified four people who died and three who were seriously injured in this accident.

The accident started with a crash in which a big rig and a pickup truck collided, causing the truck to slide into a ditch and collide with the bridge. The crash, which occurred Tuesday morning, started a chain reaction.

One tractor-trailer was unable to maneuver into reverse when it turned onto the bridge, which is closed to traffic to a width of 25 feet. The tractor-trailer hit the truck in the ditch, which was unable to avoid a crash with the bridge. The collision of the bridge with the truck caused the heavy load of lumber on its trailer to fall over the side, followed by the truck as the trailer dragged the load several feet into the water below.

The crash caused a large portion of the barrier to break loose. The barrier, which had been designed to keep motor vehicles from hitting trucks and large trucks from hitting passenger vehicles, fell onto a passing car, killing the passenger and injuring three others in the car, one of whom suffered significant injuries.

The driver of the car that hit the truck, whose car was struck from behind by the tractor-trailer before it crashed into the bridge, took it on the wrong side of the highway when she tried to avoid the truck. She tried to stop, but her car was sideswiped by a van driven by a teenage boy.

The driver of this van said that the driver of the car that he was trying to avoid was swerving, forcing him to veer off the road. He said that he swerved to avoid a crash and was not at fault in the chain reaction that began with the truck’s collision with the bridge.

No citations have been issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety. The investigation into the cause of the accident, including whether any laws were broken, is ongoing.

How should the accident have been reported?

This crash was a tragic accident that resulted in four deaths and serious injuries. This story would be appropriate for the Times, but there are two problems with it. First, there’s some factual slant in several of the accounts, starting with the claim that this is “the longest-running bridge to fall in history.” There’s an online article, which could be updated over the next 12 hours, saying that “the Texas Department of Transportation is saying it is the country’s longest falling bridge.” The article doesn’t specify the length of history – it could be 30 or a hundred years.

Second, the story focuses on the crash itself. An article on this accident could and should include a broader view of the area’s construction projects, and what will happen with them. This article was written, and the first story about the accident, before it became obvious that a deadly chain reaction had occurred, and while the bridge’s condition was undetermined. A story that includes the broader issues of highway safety and infrastructure could have covered the bridge improvements and their timing in more detail.

Summary

The Texas Department of Transportation has approved a project to improve the Reynosa Bridge, which carries U.S. Highway 69 over the Rio Grande between the Mexican cities of Reynosa and Pharr, Texas. The $10.4 million project will remove four large concrete pillars that now support the bridge deck, replacing",1

Summary: Pojamarn Shinawatra, the wife of the Thailand's richest man Thaksin Shinawatra, faced corruption charges after she returned to Thailand. Ms. Pojamarn was arrested at Los Angeles airport on Dec. 4 for a ""serious violation of penal law"" while she was trying to return home to Thailand. Ms. Pojamarn faces corruption charges that could imprison her for 20 years if she is convicted.

Her arrest warrant was issued by Thai judge Suriya Pracha-amornkrai. His ruling stems from the 2003 sale to Pojamarn of a three-acre plot in prime Bangkok real estate. Thaksin Shinawatra claimed the plot's value was $250 million, but it ended up being worth $10 million. The deal benefited Thaksin's sister, the influential politician Wissanu Krea-ngam. Wissanu was indicted separately in 2006 for embezzlement following a 2005 deal in the same plot of land. Wissanu sold the land at a loss, while the real estate developer who supplied the land earned $8.2 million.

Pojamarn had sold or leased the plot to real estate developer Boonyakorn Sukumpurach, who then sold or leased the land to Wissanu's company. Wissanu's company in turn did some undisclosed deals with the land's new owners.

Pojamarn says she sold the plot in 2003 and 2003, even though she and a lawyer had agreed in November that the buyer's identity would remain secret. Both times the buyer's name was redacted from documents in Ms. Pojamarn and the lawyer's possession. The documents revealed that the buyer was Pojamarn Shinawatra's niece, Sukhum Suwanan. In 2008, Ms. Suwanan said she was not involved in the case and asked to be released from custody.

Pojamarn Shinawatra was arrested at Los Angeles airport on Dec. 4 after landing from Malaysia. She was being deported to Thailand, but her departure was delayed while she was searched at the airport's Immigration checkpoint. Her arrest warrant was issued by Judge Suriya Pracha-amornkrai, who convicted Ms. Pojamarn in 2004 of misusing millions of dollars and sentenced her to three years' probation.

The arrest warrant for Ms. Pojamarn was issued in October after Thai police searched her Bangkok condo, seized her laptop computer and questioned her. She is also accused of money laundering and tax evasion by the Finance Ministry, and the matter will be handled separately by Thai authorities.

The Finance Ministry initially accused Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister, of misusing his power in the sale of land worth $250 million, and then misusing government funds used to buy the real estate to pay for the house of Ms. Pojamarn Shinawatra in London, England.

"Summary: Riots in French suburb for second night after two teens killed in police crash. Violence spreads from Villiers-le-Bel, north of Paris, to two nearby towns. More than 60 police injured, bombarded with Molotov cocktails and bottles of acid. Parallels drawn with unrest in 2005, when President Sarkozy was interior minister. Article:  More than 300 arrested, including several police.

The following is only a small portion of what you can find in the full document. A better idea of what happens in Villiers-le-Bel on the last night before New Year and on the New Year is to take a look at the document below:

On 18 December a vehicle driven deliberately at a speed of 50 km/h collided with a police vehicle and the officer's head was crushed under the steering wheel. According to a witness, the driver ""was smiling when he jumped out and put his foot on the neck of the police officer."" He then threw his lighter at the officer's head, and while running he threw acid bottles and a Molotov cocktail. He managed to escape on foot. The victim died of his injuries on 3 January. The investigation into the case opened the following day. The suspect was arrested on 24 December on a motorcycle. He was questioned for several hours and then released into provisional custody.

The Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel has been the scene of riots in the second night since the evening of 17 December. The unrest is said to have been triggered by the two deaths of two teenagers last week in traffic accidents.

Police were involved in the two accidents. At 14h30 on Boxing Day, a car driven by a 22-year-old male suspect plowed his vehicle down a group of police officers who were preventing him from breaking into a private house. According to a witness's testimony, the suspect's passenger, a 17-year-old, tried to escape from the car, but he was hit. At 14h50 on the same day, a 29-year-old man died after being crushed by his own car.

During the night, the situation escalated even more, from the reports of violent acts, including a stabbing and an arson. Some 80 firefighters were called to put the flames out. According to the interior minister's office, several arrests have been made and more than 60 police officers were injured.

In Villiers-le-Bel, a town next to the suburb of Trappes, which is located some 15 km from the capital, the situation escalated to such a point that the first night ended with clashes between rioters, police, armed citizens and the Gendarmes. The next day, the rioters took to the streets again, where the two teens who were killed in the traffic accidents were stabbed to death and their bodies burned. According to a report in France Info, several people were charged with the murder of the teenagers.

At the time, the interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said: ""My thoughts are with our colleagues, our gendarmes and firefighters who have been injured on duty; there are a number of arrested,"" adding that there had been ""more than one death."" ""I am convinced that the forces at work will have their full means and will react accordingly, with rigor and determination,"" he promised.

Earlier on 18 December, a large crowd of people began gathering at the Trappes roundabout near where the teenagers were killed, after they were spotted in a car belonging to one of the victims. According to the sources, they began chanting, ""death to all cops"". It is difficult to assess when exactly a crowd of around 1,200 people formed, as eyewitness accounts differ. Some say that some 300 young people gathered from the moment the bodies were found, others that there were only 50 when the bodies were found. A police helicopter even arrived at the scene. ""We could not have expected that Trappes would be affected on such a large scale,"" one of the residents of the community told Le Parisien.

""This was the first disturbance in the suburbs, but it was clear that this was the beginning of a new wave of violence that we had not seen,"" he added. ""We have been expecting violence here for several weeks, a long time."" At the time of our report, the first night of unrest was just beginning in Villiers-le-Bel. According to police, more than 50 officers were hurt with cuts or eye injuries, and some were even beaten by rioters.

The protests also spread to nearby towns of Villeneuve-Loubet, Le Plessis-Trévise and Longueil-Saint-Nicolas.

According to the interior minister, the first night of protest was the worst since 2005, when, as interior minister then, he was responsible for the Paris and Seine areas. ""There is now a trend that the disorder is spreading beyond the city",1

Kenya's once-stable economy faltering due to violence following disputed election

by JILL BRINGLY

August 29, 2008

The East African nation's once-secure market has been hit by financial turmoil and political violence. The turmoil of this year is the worst violence since the early 1990s. Kenya had just weathered a devastating coup in 2006, when leaders of the former rebel movement, the Kenyatta's People's Revolutionary Party (KRP), led by Mr Odinga, stormed into the capital and took control of parts of the city. Kenya endured three rounds of violence in the 1990s and 2000s, following disputed elections, and Kenya's economy has faltered. Equity market on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, the main bourse, suffered its worst single-day loss of $591 million on September 8. This was on the first day of trading after the country's Supreme Court ruled the election to elect a national assembly, which has replaced the national assembly, was unconstitutional. The ruling threw Kenya out of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and has stalled the release of about $1.5 billion in short-term and long-term loans, while banks have closed scores of money transfer outfits. The government's latest announcement on September 10, to form a political coalition called National Unity Coalition (NUC) has sparked further violence. At least four people were killed and more than 100,000 have been forced from their homes since violence began. Business leaders say the government is losing $29.5 million a day. Tourism has also been damaged. Some 2,300 British tour companies have called off flights to the country. ""This is a dark day for Kenya,"" says Sir Michael Sweeney, director general of the British Council. ""The country needs security and stability, [but] what it has got is uncertainty. I am not sure I can continue to come."" It was not just financial markets that had been affected, he said, but confidence in the wider African market, which had been building since the British built a new embassy in the capital in 2006. ""Kenya still needs to get back on track and I hope government is prepared to talk,"" he said. The BBC's East Africa Correspondent says the ""NUC"" coalition is a new government to replace President Moi but some say it will lead to more bloodshed. ""This may yet end in more bloodshed... [the] deal is that the new constitution will be implemented."" The NUC deal makes Mr Odinga vice-president, which will see Mr Moi forced to step down as leader of the KRP and other allies of the KRP, such as the Kenya Union (KU). ""This may end in more bloodshed,"" says our East Africa correspondent. ""President Moi now faces a dilemma: Can he backtrack from his election",1

"Summary: Independents, Democrats can vote in Michigan's open Republican primary. No Democratic delegates at stake, and most top-tier candidates aren't on ballot. Economic woes top concern for Michigan primary voters. Article: 

This is a simple summary of what an independent candidate could do to win a primary; and what the political handicappers have said about this year's Michigan Republican primary.

- The GOP primary in Michigan is March 5th. The major contenders include Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, former Governor Jennifer Granholm, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. In the past three major Republican primaries, Romney has generally won with nearly 60% of the vote.

- No Democratic delegates are at stake in the Michigan Republican primary. In fact, no top-tier Democrat is even on the ballot.

- All the major contenders for the Republican nomination are campaigning in Michigan, meaning that a primary election will be held in the first four or five weeks of March. That's early for elections in Michigan, and early for primary voters; but with no primary opposition in the Democrats, and a strong Republican field, it should be an excellent turnout.

- On the Democratic side, there are major contenders -- including Governor Rick Snyder -- but not enough top-tier candidates to warrant the attention of the public. This leaves a larger number of ""other"" Democratic candidates who could be an asset to a well financed independent, or even Republican, candidate.

- Economic issues have dominated both the Democrat and GOP primary campaigns. This could be a turning point for Michigan for the Democrats. Michigan still favors Republicans, but in 2012 Democrat candidates have been better able to explain the negative economic effects of Republican policies, and Republican primary voters are more critical of conservative ideology.

- This could be a good time for an independent candidate to enter a state where unemployment, and business confidence, are still under-performing national averages.

- Michigan is the one remaining state in which only registered Republicans vote in a primary election. In 2000, no matter whether a candidate is conservative or liberal, Democratic votes were enough because of the Democratic presidential nominee, Al Gore. In 1996 and 2000, the open Democratic primary worked the same way.

- In 2004, it would have been easy for an independent candidate to enter a GOP primary, and do well in the absence of major Democratic opposition.

As for me... I'll be spending more time on local and national politics. I feel much better spending my time on things that directly and immediately impact my life. We really need to get out at least one member of the family on a bike... maybe I'll come along later in my retirement as part of my ""retreat!""

"Summary: Lance corporal due to give birth at any time, sheriff says. Marine's car found Monday at bus station. Mother reported Marine missing on December 19. Sheriff: Marine was to testify about incident at base, according to mother. Article: 

Answers:

1. Lance corporal

2. The mother reported the Marine missing

3. A bus

News article:

A marine's car, which was reported stolen, was found Monday in the parking lot of the local bus station. Marine Corporal John S. Lively, 23, disappeared around 11:15 p.m. on December 19 after attending a Christmas dance at the base. It's believed he was with another woman around that time. According to a sheriff's report filed Monday, Lively left the dance with the other woman and left without his car. The woman was with a man at the police station, where she told detectives they ""had to do some shopping."" On Tuesday, the detective told the news media:

""The only thing he said to the other woman was to get in the car and drive. I don't know why he did that, we'll probably never know.""

The other woman told detectives she was planning on returning to the base after she and Lively left, but when she learned he had not come back, she went to her home and looked for him. She also informed authorities that she had been drinking that night.

Authorities say it's believed the car was then stolen by the other woman, who was driving. Lively had a driver's license but apparently he didn't use it and that's how his car ended up in the parking lot of the bus station.

When asked if Lively's disappearance was a typical case of ""slipped identity theft,"" where someone with another person's information gets on the road with his own car, the detective responded:

""We don't know why he left, but that doesn't give me a lot of comfort... I would guess he's probably being held against his will, but we don't know.""

The father of Lively's baby girl who was a couple of weeks old also arrived in New Orleans. As news spread of the found vehicle, the mother made a trip to the bus station to check the car herself. She found the keys in her purse and had Lively in the back seat of her car, where she and baby were waiting for her husband. When he arrived, they went to the parish courthouse for the first time to begin the paperwork in what they hope will lead to a happy homecoming for Lively.

2. The mother reported the Marine missing

The mother reported the Marine missing

She had taken her daughter to see the new baby boy in-law. When the man had not come by the time it was time to pick up the baby, his wife took her daughter home. She later picked up her husband and the other woman who stayed at their home, and took both to the police station. There the detective interviewed the man and woman concerning Lively's disappearance.

Upon learning of the missing Marine, and in accordance with New Orleans Sheriff's Office policy that missing persons must be reported to the U.S. Marine Corps and the National Criminal Information Center, the sheriff's office also filed a missing persons report on the Marine, according to the sheriff. The detective told the media that Lively may have gone with his girlfriend with an unknown intent, but he did not know of anyone holding him against his will.

He also said that the Marine had two prior convictions for driving while intoxicated.

3. A bus

A bus

According to officials, while investigating the possible disappearance of the Marine, a civilian called the Sheriff's Office to report seeing Lively getting on a bus in New Albany. After the bus left New Albany County and traveled several miles, another anonymous call was received.

Later that night, at approximately 11 p.m., the sheriff's office was informed that a ""John"" had called stating his vehicle had just been stolen from the parking lot of the bus station in New Albany.

The owner of the vehicle found Monday, the Sheriff's Office said, is the woman who had been with Lively at the dance. New New Orleans authorities are investigating whether the car was stolen by members of the woman's family.

Tuesday, deputies with the Sheriff's Office were told by Lively's family and his Marine Corps superiors that his disappearance was not at all unusual, but his family was upset.

The family members wanted to do the paperwork to put Lively's daughter with her dad on January 10 at the naval center in Pensacola, but that can't happen too soon in the legal process. They want to keep Lively and his daughter there because with an infant, that can be done later, the family felt. That was the agreement his family had made when they first arrived",1

The full original article is found here:

http://www.wwnorton.com/un/pressroom/news_releases/newsviewer.asp?id=155420

Note: If you have ever written news articles using a dictionary, you have surely noticed the following problem in news articles of this type. The dictionary word for nuclear weapons is ""nuclear"" and for weapons, you have ""weapons."" So if you want to have the correct word and meaning of ""weapons,"" you will have to make the word ""nukes"" appear within a quotation mark. Here are examples of two such cases:

""Nuclear weapons.""

""Terrorist group. Weapons.""

This is especially true for news articles written from an international angle since the English language news word for ""nukes"" is an ""atomic bomb."" Therefore, to appear more ""international"" and therefore less biased, you must make up alternative international words, such as ""atomic weapons"" which, by the way, do not exist anywhere in the world.

However, in the news article ""Pakistan rejects fears its nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of extremists."" I used ""weapons,"" and not ""nuclear weapons."" This is because Pakistan has ""nuclear weapons"" in the above example, therefore there is no need to use the international English word ""nukes"" in the example. It is only logical to use the more commonly used word for all the other countries in the world because the people of the world have some understanding of this word, which is ""weapons,"" and this is the proper word for it in American English. The international news article can even be written: ""Pakistan rejects fears that its weapons could fall into the hands of extremists."" As you can see, this does not matter. The article is still correct, but it is more common to say that Pakistan rejects fears that it's nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of extremists.

The two examples above are the only two ""nukes"" in the article, therefore, ""nuclear"" is a perfectly valid news article headline.

This is the title:

""Pakistan: Nuclear weapons as secure as those held by other nuclear states

""

The following is my summary of this full original article:

Pakistan claims that its nuclear weapons are secure; however, a former head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog said Tuesday he fears it has as many as 20 nuclear weapons and could face chaos following the death of its nuclear negotiator. Mohamed ElBaradei, a physicist and director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told The Associated Press in Islamabad that he and his agency worried about the ""safety"" of the Pakistani ""stockpiles"" of nuclear weapons. ""I fear chaos in this state, which has 30 or 40 nuclear weapons,"" ElBaradei said. ""It's the wildest kind of crisis that many states would face."" Pakistan has not yet said how many of its roughly 140 nuclear warheads were deployed at the time of its August offensive. Nor has it elaborated on ElBaradei's comments that the arsenal includes as many as 30 or 40 warheads. ElBaradei dismissed Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's insistence that Pakistan's nuclear weapons are secure. ""I have only given you my observation, my opinion,"" ElBaradei told the AP. ""I haven't come here to preach politics or economics."" But he did warn about the instability Pakistan faces following the removal of its main nuclear negotiator, who died last week, and the uncertainty looming as it awaits a new",1

We'd appreciate your feedback. Please post any errors found in the document or suggestions for improvement. All suggestions will be posted publicly and anonymously.""

It's not just your email that will be public. Anyone who views the document will be able to see the entire record of your suggestions. If you don't want your suggestions to be in the public domain, write ""private"" at the end of your suggested headline

As part of this survey, you are also required to give your name, school, and major. For some reason, this was left blank on the questionnaire, however, if you'd like to list your field of study, we'll keep that in mind. So far, we've seen ""political science"" (the most popular) and ""prekindergarten"" (a joke).

As for schools, we've seen a few of those as well. ""Chenow"", or ""Shah"" if you're talking about the one in Queens, are fairly common. We've also seen ""Crawford"", which is a pretty good play on the city of Rochester, which I think someone used to reference the school in the 1980's comedy, ""The Best of Times"".

""In response to our request for foreign affairs questions, the candidates have released their foreign affairs questionnaires for the New Hampshire debate. Links [pdf1, pdf2, pdf3], so far you've only seen the first two and third editions [or third, I forgot which], but the fourth edition is coming soon. [update: the 4th version of the file is now online. the links still work though, and so do the links for the others.] The third edition [pdf2.3] was a big one. It went off on a bit many different issues including Iraq, Iran, the Middle East peace process, and our relationship with the UN, but the biggest, and more important to us, sections were on terrorism, national security, and foreign policy. So what we've decided to do is list out the candidates responses to the three main terrorism issues: the WMDs in N. Korea, the possible threat to the US, and the possibility of another terrorist attack on US soil.

I know it's been a while since we issued a request. We decided after the debates to make this request. We understand how busy you may be, but just to make it clear, we're doing this because we need opinions from people on specific questions and what is most helpful might be more specific to you.

* What does each of the candidates think we should do now in regards to North Korea?

* What do they think about the possibility of another terrorist attack on US soil?

* What do they think about the US's relationship with the UN?

* Would any one of them be more likely to work with the UN/US?

* Does anyone believe all the claims that US intelligence says NK has nukes are true, and that they're on their way to us? *

There was a lot of discussion about the WMDs in N. Korea. All 3 (Giuliani, Richardson, Thompson) said that the ""weapons of mass destruction"" that we've been dealing with in recent years are really the conventional weapons of mass destruction, such as tanks, missile defense, air craft and sea craft, and even the ""WMD's"" are non-nuclear and can be acquired legally.

Giuliani and Richardson then proceeded to talk about how NK is not a threat to the US. That really angered me. I guess they're trying to play the ""I have done no evil"" card, just like they did with the Holocaust.

Of course, we all know what NK has been doing, but that doesn't have anything to do with them becoming a threat to us. It doesn't seem that NK wants to get into a state of war, or they wouldn't want to give up their nuclear weapons, the only reason for us to be concerned with NK would be in the event that they ever used them, or that this gets out of hand. However, none of them actually seemed concerned with them becoming a threat.

I agree that neither Bush, nor any of the candidates, are ready to be president, or even vice president, so why can we?

Thompson said that we ""should not be sitting back and letting a nuclear threat happen,"" or some such. He said that we should put the UN in",1

Write a 1-2 page paper discussing whether the U.S. government should allow more oil exploration. A person could argue that this is a controversial issue because the potential dangers outweigh the benefits of more oil production. A person could argue that oil exploration should continue because of the current scarcity of oil and the need to prevent potential future shortages and possible increases in price. Another person could argue that the benefits outweigh the risks. This person may believe that increased oil exploration would help the environment by increasing oil production, help the U.S. become less dependent on foreign imports of oil, and improve domestic energy security.

When you are dealing with oil, there is a limit and a problem. The supply of oil is limited. In fact, we can probably do more to find more oil already extracted, and this can be done with little or no increase in pollution and expense. We also need to consider the impact on foreign countries or, even more important, the environment. In fact, oil exploration should be stopped completely because there is so little potential for large finds left and so much potential for pollution from drilling and refining. Further, it is difficult to tell which places are of more value than others.

The author uses several facts to support her opinion. First she discusses the limited supply of oil. She looks at the problem with global warming. The writer says that oil drilling should stop because too much of the remaining oil has already been extracted. Even when new areas are being explored, the writer says there is so little new oil to found that the area should be left undisturbed.

In fact, the writer says, oil exploration is not good for the environment. There are few positive effects. Many of us are concerned about global warming, and we have every right to be concerned about the air quality in and around our major cities (a large factor in increased use of public transportation and thus less gasoline and oil). If we don’t start drilling soon, the writer says that all the new oil is going to be produced somewhere else. If the world tries to become energy independent, the writer says, we might not be prepared for the extra costs and the pollution that will result. Additionally, the writer says that the oil industry is much better at finding oil with pollution than finding oil without pollution. The last fact shows that new drilling doesn’t always reduce pollution but can often make more problems.

The writer says she wants to see the benefits of oil exploration balanced against the potential risks. But in fact, she looks at the negative impacts (costs and pollution) and then doesn’t even mention the positives the writer believes exist. Therefore, I think the author is making a judgment which is not supported by the facts. The author suggests that the potential risks, outweigh the benefits, but the writer is not giving a fair comparison to the benefits and risks.

"Summary: Chester Stiles' ex-girlfriend says she's ""disgusted"" she helped him meet child. Stiles sought by police as suspect in 3-year-old girl's videotaped rape. Ex-girlfriend Tina Allen says he seemed good with kids when she dated him. Allen says the girl lived in same apartment with her children. Article:  Allen says Stiles was in his ex-wife's custody at the time. Ex-girlfriend says Stiles was not allowed around the children. She claims Stiles used to sneak in without her knowing it. Police say he is not allowed in apartment. She said it would have been possible for him to meet child at a mall since she worked at the one near his home. In 2002, Chester Anthony Stiles was sentenced to 60 years in prison after pleading guilty to raping a 10-year-old child. Stiles, 37, now faces 15 more years in prison after he was charged with indecent assault and other related offenses for meeting his ex-girlfriend’s two children in order to rape them. He is being held without bail.

Summary: Child predator Chester Anthony Stiles is a convicted serial rapist looking at 15 more years in an Ohio prison. The 37-year-old faces 10 years for the December 2004 rape of a 10-year-old girl who survived.

The former neighbor of child predator Chester Anthony Stiles says she's disgusted the Ohio man will be released from prison this year. The 37-year-old was convicted of having sex with the 10-year-old girl he met at a shopping mall in 2002. Tina Allen claims her ex-boyfriend told Stiles he has two girls living in his ex-wife's apartment. Tina said Chester wouldn't have a key and would need to bribe Stiles into letting him in. Stiles was found out, however, when his former girlfriend called for help; because Chester was breaking into her apartment. Tina Allen said it wouldn't be unusual for him to attend a birthday party, watch his own children and run next door to pick up the kids for her. The two kids were in the bathroom at the time of the rape.

Ex-boyfriend of child predator Chester Anthony Stiles has told police the former apartment he rented to the pedophile was a target for criminal break-ins. Tina Allen said the child predator would steal her possessions, including a computer, a VCR and a video camera. But, it was the man she knew as ""Daddy"" who she said was the serial rapist, who was really responsible. She said he liked playing with the young child of his girlfriend. She also said the pedophile was not allowed in the little girl's home. Tina said it was ""possible,"" that Chester could've left her home and gone to a mall and met the small child he sought to rape. Since Stiles was a child predator, Allen said he would not be the first person to come out of hiding should he be released.

Ex-girlfriend of child predator Chester Anthony Stiles came to a meeting with Chester the day before their wedding at Hamilton County Municipal Court in 2002. She says she told him to never come near her kids. After their wedding Stiles and his wife moved to a home in Piqua. This is where a three-year-old was raped the day before her baptism. Tina Allen is one of 10 women who claims the 37-year-old has victimized other children in the same area. In order to protect the identity of the little girl, her age, sex, and city, this victim has been assigned the pseudonym “Kayla.” One of Tina’s children saw “Daddy” leave with the child that afternoon. Tina says: “We let him come to the house sometimes and he had a key. We let him in the house, but we always had an alarm installed on the door to our house by our grandmother and she made that a rule that if anybody came in without knocking and it was for a bad purpose and they were breaking in to take stuff it would trigger the alarm.” Tina described the man in the courtroom “and said that's him. That's how I knew he used the name and stuff.” “He had taken off of me my clothes while he was playing with Kayla. He would not do it then with me, but with her he did.” Tina said this took place at the Piqua mall because the little girl’s mom thought there would be less children around; where the pedophile was free to play with the girl. Tina said Chester was “not allowed in the children’s home” that they would share.

The victim's mother says her daughter would not have come clean if she were alive today, even with a $12 million lawsuit waiting for her. She says her daughter was traumatized by the time the young girl told her. “Kayla�",1
"Summary: Adam Gadahn in videotape tears up U.S. passport, speaks in Arabic and English. Tape was released by As Sahab, al Qaeda's video production wing. Originally from California, Gadahn talks about Bush's upcoming trip to Middle East. Gadahn is on the FBI's Most Wanted List with $1 million reward for information. Article: 

Summary

In the name of al-Qa'ida's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, a videotape was released today in which a person who calls himself Adam
Gadahn delivers his first public address since his release from the United States prison
in 2009. Adam Gadahn
in this videotape delivers what is likely a prepared speech in which he
talks about the upcoming U.S. visit by President George
W. Bush to the Middle East. It is
unclear whether Gadahn is speaking under instructions from Ayman Al-Zawahiri and Al Qaeda leader AymanAl-Zawahiri or whether he is speaking on his own. In any event, this video is al Qaeda’s first recorded comment in which Gadahn appears. Gadahn’s message comes as the U.S. considers new
plans to target Al Qaeda
bases in Pakistan that it has long suspected are the main sources of terrorism that have killed thousands of people around the world and
targeted a wide variety of US interests over the years. Al
Zawahiri
has been a particular target of the CIA since 1995, and the CIA and other branches of the Bush and
Obama governments have carried out a
huge number of attacks against his forces, including drone attacks into Pakistan. In contrast, American
casualties to terrorism in the current decade have remained moderate.

Al Qaeda has called for revenge against the U.S. government for the death of Osama bin
Laden, and it is not unusual to see al Qaeda’s propaganda disseminated via the Internet in a variety of ways. However, this is the first mention of Al Qaeda by Gadahn, a U.S. citizen. Gadahn's videotape is a new development in the effort by al Qaeda to promote an external narrative by disseminating its propaganda into the media space. As of September 28, there have been several examples of official al Qaeda media messages about what is being termed the ""crusaders' war"" on Islam. Al Qaeda has targeted other media spaces, such as in the past two
consecutive waves of videotaphone calls aimed at the
U.S. population at
the height of the
War on Terror for the previous two
months. The videos were aimed at the American people and were designed to provoke and
frighten people into making the US.gov
.gov web domains
go down on a daily basis as

The first wave targeted U.S. Christians, and the second focused on Jews. But now Gadahn has made al Qaeda's first public statement about the War on Islam. The
FBI
has said several times that it will seek the
arrest of Gadahn if he appears in public. However, he is not the only U.S. citizen known
to have been involved in violent extremism. In late January of this year, a
group of young people in Kansas
was jailed over its alleged plans
to bomb the
Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas. The plan was to rob the bank, shoot police
and
then
fight U.S.
Army soldiers who were trying to take control. Al Qaeda has a history of infiltrating the youth movements of people who are on
the FBI's
Most Wanted list, including such people as the so called ""Underwear Bomber"" Umar
Farouk
Abdulmutallab who blew up a plane over
Detroit
, and the so
called ""Lone
Wolf"" Richard Reid. On September 30, an Arab was arrested in Oregon while he was
plotting to bomb or shoot police who were trying to apprehend him. He allegedly told
informers that he would soon be blowing up a building, beheading a woman and
targeting police forces in
the New
York City area. A
U.S. citizen was detained in Spain after police said he planned to behead a teacher in that
country. Some U.S.
citizens have expressed the desire to behead enemies of this country, including women,
and there is
a history of U.S.
citizens having ties
with al Qaeda cells abroad, including
the so-called
""Detroit Six""
who are accused of providing material support to a cell of al Qaeda, as is the case with
Mohamad
Abdussalaam in Yemen, and Abdul Quader
Mortada
in Detroit. Adam
Gadhan
has a history of making videotapes, including one to explain why",1

"Summary: The Boeing 777 aircraft first entered service on June 7, 1995. First airplane U.S. (FAA) approved for extended-range twin-engine operations. Engineers designed, electronically pre-assembled the 777 using computers. In 2005, a Boeing 777 set a new world record for distance traveled non-stop. Article:  The aircraft flew 16,892 miles without refueling. The U.S. Postal Service is replacing Boeing 747 aircraft with the 777 to transport packages. Also, FedEx Corp. has replaced its two Boeing 747s with four 777s.

In 1995 the Boeing 777 first entered service with American Airlines. The aircraft can carry 262 to 350 passengers. The fuselage is longer than a Boeing 747 and Boeing 767, and has a longer wingspan than the Boeing 737. Because the 777 is smaller than Boeing aircraft, its fuel efficiency is better. Aircraft technicians can more easily inspect and repair the equipment. Boeing states that the 777 is the easiest to maintain. The 777 has a high structural strength.

Summary

The Boeing 777 is the world's largest 767 derivative type. Boeing designers produced this airplane for major U.S. airlines: American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Linens, FedEx, Jet Blue, Northwest Airliners, United Airlines, US Airways. The 777 twin-engine passenger jet was made at Boeing's plant in Everett, Washington. The Boeing 777 was the first aircraft with electronic pre-assembly. Engineers designed, electronically assembled the 777 by computers in the Boeing R and D labs. Electronic pre-assembly saves engineers much time and money over the previous method of building the airplane's parts. In the U.S., the Boeing 777 was created according to the U.S./European Joint Design Agreement (JDDA). Boeing built the aircraft between 1990 and 1992. First flight tested in June 1995. The first airplane received U.S. FAA approval for extended-range twin-engine operations on May 23, 2000. Boeing built over 300 777s. In 2005, an airplane set a new world record: non-stop distance flown with jet fuel, on March 21, 2005, a Boeing 777 from Newburgh, New York, to Osaka, Japan, traveled 16,892 miles without refueling. The first 777 was delivered to American Airlines.

A Boeing 737 and a Boeing 777 were on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington

The Boeing 777 was manufactured at Boeing's plant in Lake Washington, Washington. After five years, the Boeing 777 was replaced with Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental (LRs). The 747-8 Intercontinental was also manufactured at the Lake Washington plant.

Boeing 777 fuselage section

Airplane is a derivative type built from a Boeing design of the Boeing 767. The fuselage was enlarged and shortened. The Boeing 767 was originally made by Boeing in three- and four-engine models. The Boeing 767-200 (787-8 by Boeing) is the best-selling passenger jet airplane for Delta Air Lines. For the first time in its company history, the airline ordered 50 Boeing 777-300ER (XLRs) for Delta (50 planes were ordered in 2004 and deliveries are scheduled to be completed in 2014). Some models now have wings that fold and are shorter than the 767. The fuselage length can be longer than in the Boeing 767, but less than that of a Boeing 747. The Boeing 777 has three engines. Boeing 777 is the largest passenger airliner used by airlines around the world. Boeing engineers say that the new airplane has many improvements over the Boeing 747, 767 and 747-8. The new 777 and 747-8 airplanes can land at two runways that are shorter than a Boeing 747, while each 777 has a shorter landing gear. The 777, also called Boeing 747 Freighter, was made at the plant in Kirkland, Washington. In 1995, the 777's first flight was made by Douglas (the Boeing/Douglas Aircraft Company) aircraft engineers. The plane was first flown in April 1996.

Boeing's designers say the Boeing 777 is easier to maintain than most jet jet fleet. The 777 has two engines and four turbofan engines (a type of engine developed by the company Rolls-Royce). Boeing claims that the plane reduces air traffic control costs. Also the engine system generates less noise than jet engines on other airplanes. Boeing calls the 777 ""the future of flying."" Because the 777 is smaller than a Boeing 747 and 767, its fuel efficiency is 20% better than those airplanes. Boeing says that the 777's cabin is smaller and more spacious, but more pressurized to allow extra elbow room. The airplane has high fuel efficiencies during a long, transcontinental flight.

"Summary: Donors pledge $7.4 billion to help build a Palestinian state. IMF offers to monitor Palestinians' promised reforms. Palestinian aid conference organizers hail event as a new beginning. Tony Blair says donors need to be repaid with steps to create a lasting settlement. Article:  Palestinian officials deny corruption among top officials. An Arab League investigation reportedly points fingers at Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.

Summary

Palestinians vow more reforms if the donor conference in Paris is held as scheduled on October 30. Western donors pledge over $7 billion to help build a Palestinian state, but the IMF offers to monitor the reforms promised.

Palestinian aid conference organizers in Paris hail the event as a new beginning, but warn that donors expect tangible progress. Palestinian officials deny corruption among top officials. A preliminary Arab League investigation reportedly points fingers at Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.

Mr Blair says the British government will demand tangible progress in return for aid money.

Tony
Blair says more money will come ""in return for progress on ground""

It was in July 1999, Tony Blair was in office and a year before his government launched its campaign for the peace process, that President Clinton said no peace process would be complete until Palestinians accepted Israel by establishing an independent state on the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the coastal plain of the Jordan Valley.

Nearly 15 years later, the two-state solution still seems as elusive as ever, despite what Mr Blair has called ""the single most successful"" process of negotiations on any issue in history.

Mr Blair's claim that the peace process has been made possible by the end of the Cold War as it opened up new ways of dealing with problems between neighbours, has been questioned by many, but it is his position on financial aid to the Palestinians which is seen to have made the difference and has caused a surge in interest from Western donors.

""We have to have a clear idea about what our obligations are and to what end and for how long,"" he told The Times last month. ""That's a prerequisite for the next step which is to help put the money on the ground.""

Britain is putting the final touches to its package of $3 billion of additional aid with an eye to the Paris donors conference, Mr Blair said on July 8.

If the funds were made available it would be the largest ever direct contribution by any donor to the Palestinians.

Britain's stance has been backed by France, which has also stepped up its financial backing.

The two-state solution would involve the full return of territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six Day War, including Jerusalem, to Palestinians.

On the Palestinian side there is a recognition that the creation of an independent Palestinian state can not be realised without security and with an end to armed conflict against Israel.

The security dimension, of course, is a major concern for Israel which has already given its consent to the establishment of a Palestinian state if it can be established on pre-67 lines but in safety.

The Palestinians, however, have said that the border could be made porous and include an Israeli security zone.

""Israel cannot accept a Palestinian state with a security border on its territory any more than Israel would have accepted an agreement with Egypt,"" an Israeli government official here said.

What the Israelis are anxious about is that a two-state solution ""would be very dangerous if Arab states were to attempt to intervene between Israel and the occupied territories"".

To those who argue that there has been little movement towards an independent two-state solution over the past 10 years, the Israelis say that much has been done to that end through the security arrangements since the Oslo Accords and the Palestinian national authority has developed a number of institutions such as schools, an airport and a police force etc.

""In recent years Israel's policy has been to get the Palestinians back to talking directly, without intermediaries,"" a second Israeli official said, in an opinion poll that was published last week.

Mr Blair said that since the Accords the Israelis had offered direct talks with the Palestinians and the Palestinians too had refused to deal with anyone but Mr Arafat.

That is why the Quartet - the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations - is sponsoring the next round of direct talks at Beit Lahiya, just south of the Rafha and Ramallah, the two main cities.

But both Israelis and Palestinians say that the Israeli initiative, known as the road map that outlines a long-term plan for creating peace, has been stalled by the Palestinian refusal to talk with anyone other than Mr Arafat and his Fatah party but more particularly and increasingly Mr Arafat.

That refusal has in fact alienated a third party - the Arab League - that has accused Mr Arafat's government of not only not honouring its promise to reform but also of corruption.

And, as part of the European Union's strategy to monitor",1

"Summary: All vehicles banned in city of Amara through Thursday, provincial governor says. Death toll continues to rise as Interior Ministry reports 151 wounded. State television reports that many of the casualties are women, children. Amara has been scene of fighting between rival Shiite factions vying for power. Article: 

In the past five months, Amara's once quiet residential neighborhoods have been a flashpoint on the sectarian divide between Shiite Muslims who follow the policies of Iran's clerical leadership and Sunni Muslims who back the anti-clerical policies of President U.S. Bush. The battle for control of Amara, north of Baghdad, began on April 5 and ended the day before yesterday. The United States military says 150 to 200 Iraqis have died and another 1,250 have been wounded, while Iraqi government figures say more than 5,000 have been killed.

As a former editor of the Baghdad-based Monitor, one of the few independent newspapers left in Iraq, I lived through the siege of Amara in December and January. Those few days in Amara in late 2007 remain for me the most vivid memory of the war and a personal and family tragedy.

Before the December-January siege, Amara had experienced a relatively smooth and prosperous decade; its population of about 250,000 had long been largely ethnically Sunni, with only a handful of Christians and a number of Shiites who lived in an enclave called Bawitiya. The neighborhood fell under the control of Amara's ruling religious leaders, the Al Dour family clan, and in 2003, when the country was divided into Shiite and Shiite-dominated Sunni regions, became a hotbed of Sunni and Shiite militias fighting for control of the city.

The city's ethnic and religious composition changed after the fall of the regime of Saddam Hussein, but today it remains a center of sectarian conflict.

That was the backdrop to what happened on Dec. 17.

A day before, President Bush announced the beginning of the troop surge, and soon afterward troops began deploying into the central Shiite heartland of Najaf, Karbala, Sadr City and Basra, as well as Baghdad. Iraqi security forces also made progress along the Iranian and Syrian borders, where violence was surging along the porous border, and Shia militias were gaining ascendance over the largely Sunni insurgent groups who seemed to have lost control of key urban hubs and were on the run.

In Amara, a city of about 250,000, Sunni leader Abu Abdullah, in collaboration with one of the city's strongest militias, the Badr Brigade, had begun an assault on militias loyal to Iran. The Badr Brigade, known by its nickname the ""Military of Muqtada al-Sadr"" is the closest thing to a militia that is loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr, the radical Shia cleric who heads the Mahdi Army militia, which is the leading militia force on the ground in Baghdad.

One of the militias that Badr Brigade fought against in December and January was the Iran-funded Iraqi Hezbollah who had close ties with the city's ruling Al Dour family and its leader, Saddam al-Dour, a cousin of Amara's current governor.

The siege on Amara began December 18, when Shiite militiamen from the Badr Brigade took control of Dour's compound, which is the administrative headquarters of the city. The fighters also arrested more than 40 Badr Brigade gunmen in the city and brought them to the governor's compound, which is now under their control.

According to Amara activist Ismail Jassim, the militia's takeover of the city's administrative center, and the arrest of Badr Brigade gunmen, marked the start of the city's takeover by Shiite militias and the return of the Badr Brigade as the city's most powerful and influential force. The arrest of Badr Brigade was also meant as retaliation for the arrest of Iraqi forces in the city, which began on Dec. 12. The Iraqi Army and police had begun moving into Amara for operations against Shiite militias and had surrounded the city for two weeks before being pushed back by militias, and the Badr Brigade had also begun to control the streets.

It proved to be a crucial day in Amara's history. Shortly after the Badr Brigade seized the city's administrative center, it held a major rally in the city square. Hundreds of militants from the Badr Brigade took the microphone and called on the Amara residents to form a ""military force"" and fight in defense of Islam.

The Badr Brigade's takeover of Amara was the culmination of Shiite militias' movement towards the center of the capital. The day before Amara's battle began, the city of Najaf was brought into the control of fighters loyal to Baghdad's deputy Prime Minister Saleh Al-Mutlaq. The same day, fighters loyal to Al-Mutlaq captured the Shiite holy cities of Karbala and Najaf, and on Dec. 15",1

A few weeks before the August 2007 elections, more than a hundred people went on trial in the west of Kenya - Kisumu. The event was like a circus - the police and state officials, supporters of John Kijana, and the opposition, supporters of Raila Odinga.

The state was represented by the Attorney General, who asked the court to dismiss the charges against the defendants.

If the state wins the case - what are the implications? It's possible that John Kijana will serve the rest of his life in jail. And the implication for the government is that if they win the case, then Odinga can go and campaign.

But in the end, it's about the law. What this case shows is that the government can go into court and get a ruling that can be contested later. We're not quite sure what they are trying to get out of this - maybe some kind of amnesty for these political prisoners, or maybe it's just to get out what they believe is their right - that there is one justice system for all Kenyans.

The government's strategy was to try to use all the court cases that they had to try to try to get some of their allies who might be political prisoners who are now out of prison to say publicly that people who have been convicted in the courts, that they are political prisoners.

A few days before the elections Raila Odinga told his supporters that he wasn't going to go into hiding, he'd be campaigning every day.

The day before the election he called an election rally and the police told him to leave.

And now he's talking about how this was an illegal act of intimidation on behalf of the government.

Raila Odinga, or so we're told, lost a lot of money in his business when the government seized all his assets. It's a huge political cost for him.

The elections were very, very close - the vote was in five seconds rather than the average 30 minutes. Raila Odinga was declared the winner.

The government refused to acknowledge the result and the next day Raila Odinga announced that the result was fake, and so were a lot of those votes that had gone his way.

Some say the opposition leader was hoping at that point that the police would go after him and arrest him as a coup leader.

But the police said they were going to arrest him for trying to stir up violence.

After these events there are charges brought against a judge who ruled against the government and several others.

The charges focus on the case of the prison sentence for a former vice- president.

Odinga used to be deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Nairobi, but was sacked in April 2006 for corruption. He became vice-presidential candidate together with Uhuru Kenyatta. He served for 10 months and was jailed for 18 months for corruption.

The corruption conviction was overturned, but in August 2007 Raila, along with 11 other former vice- presidents, was re-indicted for corruption and forgery. They were in prison at the time because they refused to serve their sentence.

The president did say he doesn't think Raila will serve a full term. But there was no decision about this or about the future of the government or of the elections.

In fact it seems that a lot of people were taken by surprise that Odinga refused to accept this result.

The new constitution says a president can't serve more than two terms.

Mfano Kifaru was the main foreign journalist reporting on Kenyan elections. He was doing some investigations on Odinga in the run-up to the elections. He's leaving the country next month. He's a former editor-in-chief of the Daily Nation newspaper.

In January a royal pardon was granted to Canadian student Giuliana Sgrena, who was jailed for espionage after she smuggled a message to militants in Iraq. It is rare for royals to pardon, or even grant royal pardons to common criminals. Pardons are rarely applied when sentences are handed down at a very young age.


The Saudi government said the King issued a pardon and a royal royal decree to restore rights to the woman. It said the King ordered that the case be dealt with as any other case of rape cases within the country.



A pardon (also given in criminal law, called commutation, in other jurisdictions, and remissions) is a partial or total remission of punishment, or in other words a reduction of the severity of punishment.



Pardoning a criminal can sometimes (but not always) also imply that the person's sentence will be completely dismissed under such circumstances, rather than just reduced.



In some jurisdictions, the possibility of pardoning a criminal has been used to justify various forms of injustice or to justify the pardoning of other criminals.



Pardoning is a legal power vested in the executive branch of a state. It is often used by a head of state to exercise moral redemption when their state's interests have been harmed by actions committed by others.

"Summary: Claims by Diana's butler that he knew ""secret"" about her trashed by coroner. Paul Burrell asked to testify about the last letter the late princess gave him. Coroner revealed Burrell's ""secret"" was Diana planned to buy property abroad. But coroner said the revelation is ""fairly and squarely in the public domain"" Article:  as she said a year ago. She said that because the police have been ""silly enough"" not to mention it. Diana wrote to the butler she gave him ""four weeks"" to leave her ""alone"" after he warned about her affair with Dodi. But Burrell said he told MI5 about her plans three days before she was killed.

Dismemberment, murder or suicide? Burrell claims he went to France on February 8 last year because ""I knew she was going to be killed."" He went to see the driver after he realized that she had met with Dodi in France on a trip she made on February 7. Burrell said his boss Diana's husband, Prince Charles, asked him to go to France. ""We had a conversation. Diana said to me at the end that there was something in the house she wanted me to find and she gave me directions where to go,"" he said. Burrell claimed that he and the driver drove to a place in southern France where he said they took ""a few drinks"" together. The butler then claims he returned to London around 4 am on February 8. ""Prince Charles phoned me and said Diana had died. I remember my heart sort of pounding on. I felt she would never tell the truth about what she meant by those last few lines (of the will)."" Asked what he knew for a fact she meant, Burrell said, ""I had no evidence that Diana was going to be killed.""

Burrell said he told his manager he wanted to quit, but his boss allegedly talked him out of it. ""She said people would look strange if I quit. They won't look as strange if you give me notice,"" he said. The butler said he and the driver left for Harrods' in London the following day. Burrell claimed he did not meet anyone at the department store. He said the butler told him she gave Dodi the ""last four weeks"" to stop ""harassing"" her. But in a statement the coroner said Burrell wanted the job for the money. ""If Burrell has had a part that he wants to have his cake and eat it, then he's got another thing coming if people start listening,"" he said. Burrell claimed he had a meeting with Diana's personal assistant Andrew Parker-Bowles (Diana's estranged) in London in February 8. ""Diana told me that Andrew was getting along very well with the Prince. He was trying his best to keep Diana happy and that would include Diana and Charles. Diana said she was worried that the Prince would do something without asking her to his surprise birthday party,"" he said.

The Palace responded, ""Diana's personal assistant Andrew Parker-Bowles and the former butler Mr. Charles Spencer were also in London in February. Mr. Parker-Bowles did not have any meetings with Burrell at that time, however."" Burrell said he had another meeting with Diana. ""She had just returned from having a massage. We were having a meal, having a drink and she said she had asked her brother if she might be able to buy something back in the UK,"" he said. The butler remembered the conversation, saying, ""We talked a bit about her estate. Diana said there was something she wanted to buy to give to a person who loved her."" Burrell then told the coroner that the princess said, ""I know that the Prince knows I've been trying to get my hands on his stuff since before he's married me. ""I said that to Diana and she said, 'What do you mean?' I said well you know, when you first saw me and the Prince, you knew something had been going on. So I didn't say anything to Prince Charles about Dodi. There have been times she's mentioned him but he's never spoken to her or about him or about what he was. And anyway he was in New York,"" he claimed.

The coroner said, ""I think there's nothing, so far as we know, that makes any sort of suggestion, whatever it is, that Prince Charles knew anything at all about Dodi in advance of Diana being married to the Prince."" He also said that even if the butler said it, it did not matter because it was ""fairly and squarely in the public domain."" The coroner ruled out a suicide because, according to Mr. Burrell, she did not have the time to undress, put on her nightie or put on her bath robe. It was not the first time Burrell questioned the circumstances of her death. Last month he told a",1
"Summary: Paul Burrell, Princess Diana's former butler, gives evidence at inquest. Describes phone call in which Diana's mother called her daughter""a whore"" Burrell says Queen Elizabeth's husband was not involved in Diana's death. Also claims that Diana told him: ""I need marriage like a bad rash"" Article: 

Burrell said he ""did not know"" that the car crash which killed Diana was a suicide although he admitted there had been a long list of suspects. He claimed the phone call was made as he thought Diana was on her way to see her estranged husband, Prince Charles, to seek reconciliation. ""I can only surmise that she was there to talk about the marriage; otherwise you'd go to the divorce lawyers to sort it out,"" he said. In earlier interview he claimed that Diana said: ""I need marriage like a bad rash."" Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, was killed in the crash and has claimed that his sister had been planning to disclose to the public the truth about her relationship with Charles. In his evidence Burrell said he had seen a notebook with ""confidential"" numbers on it but he claimed he destroyed it. He told the inquest that the only person who knew about the numbers was Diana.

Examiner writer David Hulme summarises the witness' comments on the Princess of Wales on a phone call he says he received from Diana, telling him he needed marriage 'like a bad rash'. The witness said that he found a'secret' notebook of numbers but said he burnt it.

""Mr Burrell said he last saw the notebook in August 1992 and burned it a few minutes later. However, the BBC was able to locate a copy of the statement in the London Metropolitan Police's case papers dated 23/07/1999 - the day after Diana died. It says that the notebook was burnt in August 1992 by three officers. After burning it, the notebook was handed over to DI Paul Edwards, who used it to compile a 'working document"" that he gave to DI Richard Carter. Carter is a man at the centre of what is considered by many to be an Establishment plot to silence certain ""embarrassing"" secrets of the Windsors. Burrell's former girlfriend, Fiona Wyatt, is thought to have had a relationship with a royal family member and Carter is known for the way he has used his force, including his officers, to go after his ""suspects"" while allowing many to escape.

Burrell said he did not know that Diana had died until he was called to the scene of the crash on 31 August 1992. On being shown a photo of Diana before she died he described her as looking ""tired"" and as looking ""upset"" and that ""she looked like a person that was distressed about something"".

Princess Diana was last seen alive at a party held at Kensington Palace organised by her friend Guy Armstrong, a friend of her brother, Prince Charles.

In his police statement he claimed he did not see her that night because everyone was ""going back to the palace"" and he also stated that the party ended around 1am. Burrell says ""I remember it ending at approximately 12.15. I was not aware it was going to the hospital,"" adding that Diana was not dressed as she was ""in a dressing gown"" and ""wearing slippers"". He added that, ""I did not see her in the corridor, in the lift or in the bed. But I can't recall seeing her in her dressing gown. When I arrived downstairs at 12.15 she was wearing the same clothes she was wearing before. She also had her slippers on. She looked distressed. She looked upset. In my experience, people that are coming towards the end of their life look like that, they tend to be upset.""

Burrell says that he could have driven Diana to the hospital ""if I'd known there was a problem"", because the London Ambulance Service was outside on his street but he couldn't get out of the house.

Asked why he didn't mention this at the inquest, he said that, ""to me this was not important because my focus was on her being fit and comfortable. It was irrelevant if she was healthy or not in my mind [because] if someone isn't going to be feeling well enough to travel, I'd rather not take them somewhere."" Burrell said it was ""normal procedure"" for the ambulance to call when Diana was taken to the hospital because the ambulance had tried to take her before and she had refused. Asked if he saw the ambulance call out to help Diana, Burrell said, ""I was on the lawn and I did not see anything.""

Burrell said he went to the phone ""as quickly as I possibly could"" as soon as he became aware of her illness. When he called the palace to book a private jet to help bring the Princess to the United States, ""The phone call was short and",1
"Summary: Bush: U.S., Turkey and Iraq must unite against PKK Kurdish separatists. Iraqi Kurds are critical of both PKK and air attacks against them. Turkey bombed alleged PKK sites in northern Iraq over the weekend. PKK has spent 20 years fighting for autonomy in Turkey; uses Iraq as a base. Article:  Iraq’s leaders say PKK should leave Iraq and negotiate. U.S. condemns this as interference in sovereignty of another nation (e.g. NATO would not say so publicly). PKK denies it, saying it has not threatened violence. The bombings may or may not be the result of PKK activities in Iraq (e.g. they may be unrelated). U.S. officials say the PKK has used Iraq to carry out terrorist acts against Turkey. Iraq says the PKK has no presence in its territory; PKK bases at least some operations in Iraq; Turkey has the right to defend itself.

Iraqi Kurdish rebels threatened a new wave of violence in a Kurdish enclave bordering Turkey on Monday after NATO launched air strikes on suspected PKK bases and an Iraqi official said Ankara would not negotiate with the Kurdish group in Turkey.

A small bomb rocked the northeastern Iraqi town of Ras al-Ayn on Tuesday and gunfire was reported nearby, but neither incident appeared to be linked to a series of blasts around the country that killed six people and injured scores.

Turkish war planes carried out dozens of raids in Kurdish-majority northern Iraq after midnight Monday, targeting bases associated with the outlawed PKK, the interior minister said.

In a separate development on Tuesday, an Iraqi Kurdish official criticized the U.S. for ""interfering"" in Iraq when it condemned the reported Turkey bombings on Monday and asked the PKK to leave.

The Turkish raids — the first against targets in neighboring Iraqi Kurdistan — also put Washington in a difficult position.

NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said the air strikes were made in coordination with Iraq and the alliance would look at the matter carefully.

""I understand if others have reservations. We ourselves need to look at this question closely,"" he told The Associated Press.

Kurdistan regional official Omer Kanem said two of the six people killed and several others wounded in Monday's blasts in the eastern Diyarbakir province near the Turkish border had been Kurdish activists. He told AP two bombs had blown up near the border crossing to Turkey before dawn.

Tuesday's blast in Ras al-Ayn, an oil-rich town east of Diyarbakir where PKK guerrillas are known to have bases, did not appear to be related to Monday's air raids.

Two other bombs went off in Diyarbakir's Tasekani district — home to the TAKESH opposition party that has a strong base among the town's ethnic Tazekari Kurds.

Tuesday's attacks came as a string of bombs ripped Iraq's Kurdish region for the third night in a matter of days.

Baghdad blamed the bombing on the PKK but offered no proof and did not detail its claim.

At least six people died and around 100 were injured in Diyarbakir while at least two died and dozens were injured in another series of Saturday night attacks in the south of the city and in the southeast town of Makhmour, the Iraqi military statement carried in the state-run al-Iraqiya newspaper said.

Kurdish security officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the claims.

Turkey's bombings and Iraq's criticism of the U.S. have complicated an already strained relationship between the two regional allies. The U.S. on Saturday denounced Turkey's bombing of alleged PKK targets in northern Iraq as an unacceptable violation of Iraqi sovereignty and pledged to help Baghdad deal with the rebels.

Turkey has long blamed the PKK for terror attacks including a deadly twin bombing in Ankara that killed more than 60 people last month. Turkey is also concerned that the groups seeks to create an ethnic Kurdish state in northern Iraq, bordering on Turkey. Some 120,000 ethnic Turks have been driven out of the Kurdish region of Iraq, according to the latest figures from the United Nations refugee agency.

The PKK also said Monday their bases were being destroyed in response to the weekend bombings.

Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told a news conference that his country would not negotiate with the PKK.

The Turkish raids came days after Washington condemned the air strikes. The U.S. State Department said that despite Ankara's insistence that the PKK camps are in northern Iraq, Ankara was responsible for these attacks.

""The U.S. and Turkey together share responsibility for the situation. It is very difficult to sustain the level of military operations against a terrorist entity that has no presence in Turkey but that has bases in northern Iraq,"" State Department spokeswoman Michelle Bernier said. ""It is not a question of a Turkey that wants peace. It is a question of self-defense.""

"Summary: Top seed Andy Roddick reaches last eight of ATP tournament in San Jose. The American defeats Delray Beach winner Kei Nishikori of Japan 6-2 6-4.

Haas and Robredo will face off in the final.

It’s difficult to imagine a player of such consistent excellence being anything but a giant. Roger Federer has been such a player. When he sets the standard, that’s a pretty solid gauge for the top echelon of men’s players.

Roger Federer is widely acknowledged as the greatest tennis player of all time. Since turning professional in 1997, Federer has dominated the men’s game with an unshakable confidence and an exceptional variety of strokes. His remarkable consistency makes his ability truly unique. As he approaches his 20th birthday, let’s take a look at some of Federer’s best achievements to date.

Best Achievements

7 Open Championships – 8 Final appearances – 5 Finals wins – 2 Championships – 5 Grand Slam titles

Roger Federer has already accomplished more than most tennis stars manage in a lifetime. It can be difficult to determine exactly which accomplishments are the most impressive, but on the surface, a few are clear winners. The 7 open trophies represent some of the most prestigious events in tennis. The number of finals appearances and finals wins are outstanding for any player, let alone a player who started his career nearly two decades ago. The Grand Slam titles don’t even begin to compare to so many other trophies. However, the fact that Federer has won 5 of them is an impressive achievement.

Federer has not only won tennis greats such as Agassi and Nadal, but he’s also faced the best the men’s game has produced.

“For his opponents, Federer is arguably the hardest player to beat. His tennis IQ is so high. His timing, balance, forehands, backhands, movement and general feel for the court is uncanny. He was able to play Nadal with the perfect mixture of aggression (in Nadal’s style) and patience. Roger never gives Nadal any chance to take control, but he does so very rarely. When he does, the match is very likely over. The only player who ever beat Federer once in four tries at a major had been the number one. Federer handled the match, which was at a Grand Slam, very easily. He took it in three sets. He was clearly favored in that he was the defending champion and coming from the No. 1 ranking. As an aside, Murray’s level of play at the time was high, so it was very surprising the number of people who still haven’t quite understood this. It’s a difficult match to play, physically and mentally. It is also a very rare occasion for any player to beat Federer twice in a grand slam if it is even 3 of 4 sets. I don’t know of a one other than Federer himself. He can give the Murray match up only one problem. Federer played very well, but he also had to perform under pressure, which is not something he has had to deal with very often. That was not at all his game. He is a calm, patient, well-rounded player. He has been called on the court, not at a moment’s notice, but for his best effort of the set which is at a major. That has not been something many players have to deal with, at least not while playing on the surface that Federer has played on during his whole career. And he has done that. A huge achievement.” – Bill Hewitt, March 16, 2005

Perhaps no other athlete in the past half century has ever been as consistently and dominantly successful as Roger Federer. The question for any of his competitors is not whether they will beat him, or even just make the finals of a significant tournament. The real question is when will they retire, or how much longer can they last?

In the span of 16 years, when Federer turned professional, he won 31 matches and lost 10 and lost only 30 singles matches. And, while Federer’s career has certainly suffered from injuries, it is still very likely that he will surpass even this already remarkable number if injury is no longer an issue.

Roger Federer is well aware that he’s been able to maintain himself this far longer than anyone else in the sport due to his unique physical condition.

“A friend of mine told me that Federer got a cortisone shot as a teenager. I laughed at him. Not because it was in any way impossible, but it is incredibly extreme. But",1

A reporter in Seattle was the author of a news article based on the following summary: The Army has agreed to pay $1.4 billion as an estimate of claims stemming from the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Army officials say the cost might be greater than they estimated. Two military personnel were charged with felony charges by a court.

The reporter, a Washington Post staffer, wrote a news article based on the following summary: An Army sergeant and two Iraqi men have been charged with felony counts for abuse of Iraqi captives. The men were arrested for holding a U.S. military intelligence agent in a room at the Baghdad International Airport detention center. One of the Iraqi captives told the investigator that soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison ""repeatedly had sodomized and urinated on him."" The sergeant and the Iraqi men face charges including torture, conspiracy and dereliction of duty.

A reporter for ABC News wrote the following on November 10, 2004: The Department of Defense announced today that $50 million dollars has been awarded to two military hospitals in Louisiana that provided care to the nearly 1,500 soldiers whose bodies and faces were infected by toxic chemicals inside an Afghanistan prison. It's the seventh such award that has been made since November 2003, when the military publicly revealed that hundreds of soldiers were exposed to hazardous chemicals used to clean out the improvised munitions at the Taliban's largest prison.

The reporter wrote an article based on the following summary. A new study shows how American war commanders sometimes use information that is not available to foreign governments, even on the field of battle. Researchers are calling it the ""invisible occupation,"" and say it should be considered a ""grave concern"" in a democracy.

The information is not shared and is usually protected by the U.S. military as ""combat sensitive."" Researchers say the new study, based on interviews with commanders in Afghanistan, should shed some light on why thousands of U.S. soldiers have gone hungry while deployed to war zones, as well as what prompted the Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, to testify that there might be a shortage of food. According to the study, a soldier stationed at Bagram Air base in Afghanistan said that the Army had told him there was food but he was in a place with no supply lines. Another soldier said Army doctors told some returning soldiers in Afghanistan that those who were injured in the war had ""food poisoning.""

A reporter from AP wrote a news article based on the following summary: An American commander is under fire from a U.S. military watchdog group for refusing to answer questions about his unit’s alleged brutal treatment of Iraqis at its Abu Ghraib prison.

A military spokesman said Maj. Gen. Ricardo S. Sommers will not answer questions before a congressional committee. Sommers, along with the other military officials who face questions from a Senate committee, will be questioned about the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, which has embarrassed the US military, caused shame across the nation, and hurt Americans’ feelings around the world.

The reporter also wrote another AP article based on the following summary. A coalition force commander has apologized for an alleged abuse of Iraqi detainees at a US base near Falluja. In a statement issued Thursday, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez said an investigation at another US military base, in the northern city of Mosul, found allegations of mistreatment of Iraqis at the site were ""not corroborated by reliable information."" ""To those who are rightfully outraged by all of this, I want to say that the abuse and mistreatment of detainees in Abu Ghraib prison was an utter betrayal of American values and a complete violation of our standards,"" Sanchez said in the statement.

In addition, the majority of articles in your name appear under the Search Experts box, at the very top of your page. Thus, LinkedIn prefers longer bios or bios containing many links to news articles about you.

How can you make your LinkedIn profile sound like a sales letter?

You can avoid sounding like a sales pitch by being sure that your profile conveys these qualities:

The importance of being yourself. You do not need to be a ""salesperson."" A lot of businesses use LinkedIn as a customer database.

Be brief. This is a business networking tool. Keep your page concise.

Make your profile work for you. Use your title carefully.

I also have the following profile headline, ""Journalist,"" and tagline: ""Over 20 years business experience. Focus on international business, personal finance, tech and travel.""

What are your LinkedIn recommendations about?

LinkedIn allows you to recommend other members of the site. If you are a business consultant, you can recommend a colleague. If you are a freelance writer, you can recommend a business colleague. You should also recommend articles written about you. I suggest at least six articles that should be posted as recommendations. See step 2 of creating your bio on this page for more about finding and selecting publications.

Also, LinkedIn allows you to have multiple recommendations. So, if you are active in a certain industry, you can add specific publications and experts within that field to your list.

"Summary: Italian tennis players Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali banned by the ATP. The pair have been suspended for betting on matches, although not their own. Starace suspended for six weeks while Bracciali is banned for three months. Article:  Starace, one of only two players to beat Boris Becker in a Grand Slam final, admitted to being an addict before beating Becker in the Wimbledon final and losing to Roger Federer in the Australian Open, the longest match in recent Grand Slam history. For more, read: Italian tennis star Daniele Bracciali 'drug addict' suspended.

I. Title

The first part should focus on the current situation, explain the rules and conditions that the ATP is working with. The article should also use some sources. The first sources should have no specific focus, they should be generalist:

ATP is the governing body for tennis;

The players are professional sportspeople;

In their contracts they are obliged to comply with the rules imposed by ATP. In particular they cannot bet on their own matches;

Professional sportspeople are punished for a number of actions: they can be suspended, fined, banned for a period of time which can vary from 2 days to 2 years and 3 months, for life;

Betting on matches is also not allowed in several situations, and the ATP has set up a system for players to know if their bets are considered illegal and if so in what circumstances.

The article can either report a single news or include two news, one for each tennis player. It could include the following:

The Italian sports official Giuseppe Chiarelli: “Since 2007 the ATP has been taking stronger action with regard to professional sportspeople who are found to be breaking the rules. In the case of Daniele Bracciali we are punishing a professional sportsperson who committed illegal acts.” Giuseppe Chiarelli is the ATP commissioner;

He is a doctor who is head of the medical commission for the ATP;

Daniele Bracciali was caught on tape on two occasions that he was betting on the matches. The first time was in March 2008, after beating then world No. 6 Mario Ancic in the second round of the US Open where Ancic had broken his right wrist. This is a professional sportsperson in a competition, not at home watching a sport. Bracciali bet on the match whilst his team mate was still recovering at home in Italy;

On two other occasions, which are not known because of the confidential nature of the ATP files, he was caught on tape betting on one of his own matches and also being paid for doing so;

In the first instance, he bet on a match in 2007 whilst he was competing at Indian Wells (in the fourth round in particular);

In the second instance he bet on a match in 2010 whilst he was competing at Toronto (in the second round);

These actions did not occur, he was not caught at the time of the matches or in the week they took place. This is the case because all the betting is done after the tournament.

He admitted that he was a sports addict and had a drug problem (tobacco and cannabis) for 10 years and that he took cocaine to improve his performance;

Last year he was sanctioned to a 2 year and 3 month ban and is currently suspended from entering the rankings or from competing in tournaments;

Since Bracciali reached the No. 2 spot in the Top 100, his ranking has been suspended for the next 12 months (since January 2012);

He has already lost an opportunity to compete in the Davis Cup because of this situation;

He was also suspended from the Italian Federation because of the aforementioned issue;

If he breaks the ban he will be banned for life;

Starace was suspended for six weeks for gambling on his own matches in 2008 (this is one of the instances in which he received a two year and three month ban). This also affected his ranking, but because of a new rule put in place in 2012 he was only in the top 400 for six weeks and will not be punished for the next two years and three months;

If he is not punished for the other seven months he will be No. 13 in the world for two years and three months (after one and a half years and one month);

This is the first time that someone has received this ban, a lifetime ban will be issued to him;

A three month ban has already been issued to Bracciali, at the same time that a two year and three month ban was put in place for Starace;

The second part of the article should focus on Bracciali’s attitude and how in these instances his actions were the result of his addiction, which should be noted with",1

"Summary: Bush: Faith-based groups are ""helping to defeat this epidemic one soul at a time"" World AIDS Day is Saturday. More than 2 million people have died of AIDS this year. Bush wants to expand the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Article:  Under the program, some $7 billion will be used to treat more than 5 million people who are HIV positive and 3 million children infected by mothers whose own immune systems are compromised because of AIDS.

The author does not have to agree with the following:

· Bush wants to expand the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It is an emergency program

· The program has some $7 billion to spend. That is an emergency.

The point of this exercise is not for you to say which program you think is better, but for you to think about the words ""some,"" ""program,"" and ""expanded"" in order to make a news article.

Answers: 1. Article written by: 2. The author's opinion is: 3. The president feels:

• 1. the president feels that faith-based groups are “helping to defeat this epidemic one soul at a time.”

2. the program had some $7 billion to spend. That is an emergency.

3. The program is an emergency and an expansion.

1. Summary of events:

The article is based on the events that are happening on World AIDS Day.

What is World AIDS Day? It is the day to help people affected with AIDS remember and honor the millions of people who have died of AIDS this year.

What does this mean? Every year on World AIDS Day, Americans and people around the world stop what they are doing and remember the millions of people who have died of AIDS this year since the virus first appeared.

Why is this important? In addition to remembering those who died, the people who are alive because of AIDS should also know that World AIDS Day is an event to help stop the spread of the disease. The people who are living with the virus can be a part of the solution because by using better drugs and a program, we can treat millions more people and prevent as many people from getting HIV or dying when they do get HIV.

Why are people still getting HIV? HIV is still spreading despite the fact that millions of people are getting treatment. The reason that HIV is still spreading is because some people still do not know who they have sex with and even if they see that they might be infected, they have not been tested.

How does Bush plan to solve this problem? Bush has proposed that the American government expand President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). This would make more people aware of AIDS, would provide better programs for prevention, and would help people who are infected.

How is this better? It would increase funding for prevention programs, for the treatment of infected people, and for treatment for children. By increasing funding, we will be able to provide more help to people with HIV.

What about the money? One of the ideas for the money spent would be to make sure that there is a greater range of treatment options.

A. Program should be expanded: B. We need this program:

3. How do you feel about expanding the money for treatment to more people and stopping the spread of HIV?

1. The president feels that, “Faith-based groups are ‘helping to defeat this epidemic one soul at a time.’ ” “Helping to defeat this epidemic one soul at a time.”

2. The program has some $7 billion to spend. That is an emergency.

3. The program is an emergency and an expansion.

Explanation

The conclusion of the article is not just that the PEPFAR is an emergency program, but that it has helped spread awareness and that there are more ways to get help. The way that Bush's plan would help is by funding more drugs and treatments. By going to more people, people will not know who they have sex with and could find out that they cannot get help and have to die.

1. (A)

2. (B)

3. (C)

2. (B)

3. (C)

4. The president has a good idea that there are other ways to help. This is an opinion of the author.

Explanation

The conclusion states that the president feels the programs of PEPFAR are emergency programs and that, “…helping to defeat this epidemic one soul at a time.” The sentence is made into an opinion for two reasons. First, the point is that faith-based organizations are helping the government defeat the epidemic by helping to cure the HIV virus one soul at a time.",1

"Summary: Protest moves after crackdown at Freedom Square. Order sought after protests over last month's election turn violent. Demonstrators say the election was fraudulent. State of emergency could last until March 20, official says. Article:  More than 50 people injured.

A group of demonstrators have occupied the city's Freedom Square, demanding the resignation of President Dmitry Medvedev following months of nationwide street protests against his administration and calling on him to announce results of the latest presidential election.

About 600 people gathered in support at a rally outside the main entrance to Freedom Square, some shouting ""Russia without the thieves"". One of the organisers, Sergei Mitrokhin, said the protesters planned to remain at the square for several days.

Tens of thousands of people have already gathered in Moscow, St Petersburg, and across Russia, to campaign for the election of opposition leader Vladimir Putin, whom they have accused of winning the March 4 presidential poll by fraud and intimidation.

Putin won with almost 73% of the vote. His supporters argue that the election was a fair expression of the will of Russian voters. Many of the protesters in Moscow and St Petersburg said they had simply gone to support those calling for Medvedev to stand down because he had called for the vote to be free and fair.

Medvedev supporters chanted: ""Get out, get out"", while others attempted to hold a small counter-rally in support of their president.

Speaking on his website, the Kremlin's chief spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: ""At the moment, the situation is calm.""

He added: ""We are not concerned about the presence of those who are not supporters, and we hope everything will be calm in a minute.""

On state television yesterday, President Dmitry Medvedev issued a statement demanding that the leaders of the protest campaigns ""set up the conditions for the democratic process to continue"".

Medvedev said he would stay in office for the full five-year term of his term in 2012.

The protest was sparked by reports on Tuesday that the election commission was planning to issue a court order for Medvedev and several other opposition activists to be charged with hooliganism for their part in the protests, which included the blockading of offices of the electoral commission after the vote. Several people were injured and thousands arrested in the turmoil.

The electoral agency subsequently issued a statement denying the reports, but the Russian media has run stories suggesting that Medvedev would resign on April 11 if the commission followed through on an order to pursue the opposition leaders.

Although the Kremlin is not thought to be planning to oust Medvedev from the presidency, there are increasing fears that, since a constitutional amendment making the president partly accountable to parliament was passed before the vote, Medvedev has now been placed in a politically untenable position of having been found to have committed a crime by some of his opponents since assuming the office.

According to the constitutional court, the president can be prosecuted only for grave violations of Russian electoral law and only if he makes a declaration of responsibility or the person who filed the charges files a statement to the court. This has been interpreted by some as suggesting that opposition groups want to press forward with charges over fraud, while others want to drag Putin into the mix.

One person at the protest site was quoted as saying: ""We won't go away and we won't leave. They have said that Putin can't be charged, but that doesn't mean there can't be charges against Medvedev or against other people.""

A woman from Siberia asked: ""What are we risking? What's happening? He won, he won! Stop this nonsense!""

In an editorial, the Kommersant business daily said: ""It should be obvious that the Kremlin does not intend to resign.""

Medvedev's spokesman Peskov called Medvedev's speech ""his first political move that the Kremlin considers a good one"".

Putin, in a statement last night, thanked the president for his ""clear and unambiguous"" statement.

Earlier, Medvedev called on the country's leaders to show tolerance and tolerance towards people ""who speak out and think differently"".

""We have just held an election at which the winners gave everyone a chance and everyone expressed themselves. But our country is not only the right to have our own opinion,"" Medvedev wrote.

The Moscow protesters were joined for a few hours today by a group of Orthodox Christian priests who held a rally behind the stage the opposition protesters had built. The priests had gathered earlier on a bridge overlooking the park, where they had been trying to make themselves heard through a PA system. After failing, they had approached the mayor for permission to use the speakers of his helicopter.

The speakers told the crowd: ""You should be ashamed of yourselves.""

"Summary: CBS: Hussein claimed he didn't think the U.S. would invade Iraq over WMD. FBI agent says Hussein lied about having WMD to intimidate Iran. But the Iraqi dictator said he wanted to start the WMD program again, agent said. Hussein was captured in 2003 and hanged in 2006. Article: 

""My husband used to say Iraq is the mother of all fables,"" said Mrs. Hussein, laughing as she recounted her life. ""I say my stories, he says his stories.""-- From a profile about Mrs. Hussein published in The Times of London on April 7, 2007.

As his political fortunes and his marriage unraveled, her marriage began to crumble, too. He was the chief of the feared Mukhabarat, or State Security. Yet all I would hear from him were accusations, and there were many. His latest, in a conversation with a friend late one night, was that Mrs. Hussein and their four sons and daughters had all been recruited for the Iraq War by the Israelis, who were the chief architects of the 2003 invasion, he said.

""No!"" I said. ""They wouldn't work for the Israelis.""

""But I swear,"" he insisted. ""I'm certain it happened.""

She would not dispute his account. But, she added, ""The children always thought I was loyal to Iraq."" Their youngest son, Ahmed, had joined Hussein in exile with his mother in London in the mid-1990s, when he was 17. There, she taught him English and how to conduct himself at Oxford College.

""At school I was rebellious, and Ahmed was more subdued,"" she said. ""He could hardly get away with being a Hussein. He was also very smart.""

""He always knew when to make a joke and when not to,"" she said of her youngest. ""And he knew how to be a leader without making anyone think he was going to play a role more elevated than his own.""

But when Ahmed returned to Iraq to join his grandmother's regime in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion, he was told to keep his mouth shut.

""No matter what people thought, you couldn't speak out,"" she said. ""Even if you are a teenager, you can't do things that won't make your father proud.""

Mrs. Hussein now lives on the 15th floor of a building in a part of London she still can't really talk about except in reference to the man with whom she parted nearly 19 years ago. For her, Iraq is his country. He still speaks the language, and on his 88th birthday -- no doubt he will be a man of immense wealth -- she wants to bring him back.

What happened, in a sense, was that her son was a playboy. He would go to the club, and he would drink and dance and party all night, but he always had other, more serious, things to do. He was the youngest of five children, and he was always looking out for older sister Aisha.

""He was the leader of the pack, and that's how you should behave,"" she said.

He was the leader, but like many a young man, he was also always a loner. He would go off to study English, for example, at University College in London, and he liked it. Mrs. Hussein didn't mind -- that is, until, several years into his time there, her oldest son, Tariq, and then little Tarek started turning against her. Tariq, Mrs. Hussein said, was ""always looking for a place in the sun."" He wanted to be somebody. His father, she felt, didn't seem to be able to stop him.

Tarek was the last of the three children born to Mrs. Hussein's first marriage. He went to the University of Edinburgh to study law, and in 1988 he was elected the student representative on the National Union of Students' annual conference in Brighton, England.. He spoke on the subject of the ""Third World War"" -- he said it was being fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Tariq was a year behind Tarek, attending Trinity College at Cambridge. But his focus was on building a different life for himself, and that's what he wanted for his mother and, ultimately, his siblings, too. He was one of those people who could stand on the highest point of a building and still get people's attention. He was the student with the loudest voice, and Mrs. Hussein was, and is, still trying to be everybody's friend.

Mrs. Hussein said her youngest son started getting his ear pierced when he was 18. It was at a time when Iraq was a closed country, because of the Saddam Hussein regime. To get something new, that could be sent in, it had to be smuggled through a black market -- a situation Mrs",1
"Summary: There are more than 44 million people of Hispanic origin in the U.S. The community includes diverse national origins, generations, languages. Some observers say enough similarities exist to project a communal identity. Article:  But others see a cultural divide, with Latin Americans more interested in politics and culture, while non-Latino Hispanics are more drawn to science and business. The majority of Hispanic citizens reside in Texas, California, New York, and Illinois, states with large Latino populations. Others are Native Americans and black.

I. Background.

As the second largest ethnic group in the United States (US),1 Hispanics are often characterized as primarily white, Latino, or mestizo (the admixture offspring of white, African-American, and Hispanic men and white, Asian, black and Native American women).2 The first census report documenting the Hispanic ethnic category showed that 17 Hispanic ethnic categories contained less than 1%, and eight had fewer than 10,000 people in 1994.3 But a recent census report shows that there are as many as 51 different Hispanic ethnic groups that include both first and second generation Hispanic Americans.4 This report provides more than 44 million people of Hispanic origin in the US living in 50 states and the District of Columbia. This ethnic population is projected to grow to more than 76 million by 2050 (US Census Bureau).5

There are more than 44 million people of Hispanic origin in the US.

Hispanic and Latino American Heritage Month is an annual observance that started in 1981. It may be the most significant month in the US and one of the most interesting months in the world, highlighting the achievements of America’s past and present as well as the diversity of cultures and people. In some places, the dates of September 15 and October 15 fall within the autumn weather pattern of the temperate zone. In fact, in the US, as a result of weather patterns, the first three days of September often have hot, humid and/or moist conditions, which can change from year to year. But in the southeastern part of the country, weather patterns favor longer periods of cooler, dryer and more hospitable conditions for the remainder of the month. A large percentage of the Hispanic population in the US is of Mexican origin. Spanish is the official national language in Mexico and a majority of the Latin American countries with the exception of Chile, and Argentina.

II. National Origin of Hispanics in the United States.

As of the third U.S. Census, 44,942,500 (20.1%) of all Hispanics lived in the US, including 8,749,000 first generation Hispanics and 35,923,500 second generation Hispanics. By the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 44,921,000 Hispanics living in the US (18.6%). By the 2010 U.S. Census more than 20 million Hispanics were residing in the US and nearly 10.7 million of them were first-generation American citizens. Latinos in the US, by the 2010 U.S. Census, were concentrated in the southwestern states including California, Texas, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Hawaii and Colorado (US Census Bureau).

An estimated 17 different ethnic groups, and at least 8,770,000 people, were born in the US with the Spanish language spoken at home. But the Spanish cultural heritage of the US is one of many and can be traced back from the Spaniards to the Native Americans.

Hispanic and Latino American Heritage Month takes place each year in September.

The Hispanic group in numbers.

Hispanic and Latino Americans have made significant contributions to the cultural, political and economic heritage of the United States since their arrival in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

Hispanic immigrants from Mexico were the first people of color born in the territories that America would later claim and occupy. Spanish colonists, such as the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, brought many of their cultural traditions with them to California, Florida, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Cuba. In addition, there was a long history of African slaves, indentured servants, and immigrants bringing European cultural practices. Spain, Britain, and France have also had an economic and political influence on the Americas.

The largest communities in the US of Hispanic, Latino and black American origin are in California and New York.

The most numerous ethnic group in the country are Latinos or Hispanics of Mexican origin, and those of Puerto Rican origin, with 37.3 million residing in the states of California, Texas, New York, Florida, Nevada and Arizona. A majority of the other groups fall into the category of Latinos or Hispanics of Puerto Rican origin. (The Census Bureau did not include Cuban Americans when tallying the number of U.S. Hispanics).

Mexico is the country or origin of origin of most Hispanics/Latinos/ Latinos, and the primary language spoken by almost 90% of all US Hispanics. Spain’s language and cultures are reflected in",1
"Summary: U.S. Navy makes move amid a political standoff over Lebanon's presidency. The presence is important,"" says chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff. Lebanon's pro-Western majority in parliament struggles with pro-Syrian opposition. Article: 

Lebanon holds presidential elections Saturday amid international pressure to choose a president acceptable to both sides in the country's six-month struggle with Syrian-backed armed groups that have seized significant swaths of the country. In exchange for Syrian support, Beirut pledges to end its alliance with Israel and expel Syria's forces.

""Lebanon has for too long suffered the miseries of Syria's meddling here,"" U.S. Marine general Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, says at a news conference. The Syrian army has long considered Lebanon a key buffer zone. ""But even as it is an important strategic presence, this administration recognizes that the international rules-based order is important,"" Dunford continues. That's why the United States is sending Dunford as a military representative to the elections.

Dunford says a new president will be ""an important opportunity to strengthen and deepen those very strong relationships."" But the United States faces a political dilemma. Some in Congress want to see U.S. support for Lebanese security forces, including an airlift of weapons to the Lebanese military, to increase. That would be a step for the U.S. and a challenge for Israel. Dunford says a U.S. military plane could be ready to depart soon, but it will depend on how fast Lebanon's election is delayed.

Dunford says the U.S. will support any ""stable, legitimate government"" that comes to power. Lebanon's Sunni Muslims, who make up a majority of the country's 28 million people, are worried about losing some independence from a pro-Syrian president.

""We're not going to be on the sidelines. If there are people that wish to see Lebanon be a place of free expression of democracy,"" Dunford says.

General Dunford says the United States isn't backing the winners yet, but will seek to build a stable government.

The State Department has pledged to support democracy and stability, and not favor one sect over another, in the race. But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called for unity behind a single candidate.

Lebanon is trying to unite the country's political clans and sects under a single candidate.

""There is a huge number of families and factions, and they are all trying to get into the race for president one after the other. It has to be one of them,"" says Amal Khor, the spokesperson for the Future Movement party. ""When you see so many candidates in the race, there are a lot of chances for a big disappointment.""

But the election may be a bigger defeat for the opposition. Their candidate resigned last week as did one who left the opposition group May 8 under internal opposition pressure.

Lebanon faces a possible financial meltdown if the country cannot hold a presidential election and a parliamentary vote later this month. About half of the Lebanese economy depends on foreign aid.

Lebanon's pro-Western majority in parliament struggles with the Syrian-backed opposition, which opposes the country's role in the war in neighboring Syria and opposes Hezbollah, Lebanon's national security force, which is largely aligned with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.

""That's going to be the biggest question mark,"" says William Hague, the British foreign secretary. ""We have not thought about a scenario of that particular dynamic.""

Still, Hague calls Lebanon an important partner in the region and says that will be true whatever the result on Saturday.",1

"Summary: British counter-terrorism experts re-inspect Bhutto's vehicle. Bhutto's assassination was her own fault, says Musharraf in interview. He blamed her for standing up outside the safety of an armored car. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, wants a U.N. inquiry into his late wife's death. Article:  Musharraf has dismissed the demand. Instead, as long as the new government doesn't ask such an inquiry, he says, Pakistan is safe from the United Nations. Asif Ali Zardari says his wife's was ""an accidental murder"". The former prime minister's assassin, his aide Sherry Rehman, has been acquitted. The death was accidental. (2000 lines or fewer)

Key Points

Bhutto's death and the following elections in her party were an accident. It was not the result of Pakistani politics. Bhutto herself was the one, the only real victim in this case.

Zardari is not safe. He was at the gates that day, outside the vehicle. Bhutto was his responsibility and he did nothing. Even her father-in-law, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, cannot be blamed. He is out of Pakistan, in exile. The Zardari family can't have another accident in Pakistan.

Musharraf has nothing to fear from U.N.

Pakistan's military wants to bring stability to the country. People are already afraid of the militants. The army understands the importance of the elections and so it can't help Bhuttos' assassins get away. The army must stop the militants and it has the means to do that.

In an attempt to end the insurgency in Pakistan, the US has proposed a deal with the Pakistani military; the army agrees to dismantle the Taliban and militants, in return for the US lifting sanctions and returning the $ 1.5 billion given to Pakistan as aid in the aftermath of 9/11. Pakistan has already been struggling with financial constraints after its economy was destroyed by international sanctions and US aid cut back. On the other hand, Pakistan must have an end to the US support to the Taliban. Both sides need to agree on a new deal.

Pakistan should reevaluate its agreement with the US

On the contrary, the insurgents would agree to a fair agreement. By taking advantage of the instability that Pakistani's army faces, the Taliban are still trying to secure their objectives. If there were a fair deal, the Taliban would be prepared to sign a deal with the US.

Under such a deal, the power of Pakistani forces would be used for the good of Pakistan and for stability. If such a deal were signed, then militant commanders would become a part of Pakistan's ruling body. The US would gain one more ally in the war with terrorism.

Musharraf needs to end the insurgency and restore stability.

The army is aware of the threats facing Pakistan and the best thing is to ensure that they are eliminated.

The army has been involved in terrorist activities because it had to eliminate militants. It could have easily done so otherwise, if there would have been a political solution.

The army is on the verge of eradicating these militants from all the country's regions.

The militants are not the only terrorist threat. A civil war between the different parties will make the Pakistanis even more vulnerable to terrorist threats.

The army are a force to be reckoned with

To overcome the war against the militants and secure Pakistan, the Pakistani government must bring its two parts into a shared agreement.

On April 14, after many of the soldiers and police involved in the assassination and the subsequent crackdown on militants were killed, Pakistan's army declared martial law throughout the country.

Musharraf's role in the Bhutto assassination

During the trial, Musharraf said that he wanted Nawaz Sharif to be declared an enemy of the state by the military. According to his calculations, Sharif was a puppet of the United States. In October 2003, Benazir died in an airplane accident, and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, then became the prime minister of Pakistan.

In February 2004, the Taliban's militants were successful in taking control of areas with a large Sunni Muslim population. The Sunni militants opposed Sharif's efforts to reach a peace deal with the Pakistani Taliban. When Musharraf decided to deal with the Taliban, he had already made up his mind that Sharif would soon be thrown out of the government.

Sharif had no interest in the continuation of the peace talks. When the army decided to launch an operation in Waziristan, Sharif believed it was a ploy to help the Taliban gain control of the region. He claimed that the army had been supporting the Taliban and that the army wanted complete control over Pakistan. At least according to the Nawaz Sharif. While the",1
"Summary: Grand jury upgrades charges against girl's mother and mother's husband. Presented new evidence, jury took just 3 minutes to vote for tougher charges. Riley Ann Sawyers, initially known as Baby Grace, was beaten to death. Prosecutors haven't decided whether to seek death penalty for couple. Article:  The girl's father and his grandfather are alleged to have battered baby. The girl was born premature. She developed problems because of the premature birth. The boy's uncle gave them milk he'd stolen from a hospital refrigerator. Doctors reported father's DNA in the milk. Other family members have received suspended prison sentences for manslaughter after they beat the baby to death.

It's time to call for justice in the case of Baby Grace, who was born premature in 1997. One year later, after doctors reported her father's DNA in her stomach, Grand Jury upgraded the charges. Two years after that, the mother and her husband received a suspended sentence.

Since then, the child has been beaten and neglected. The child is thought to have been born with fetal alcohol syndrome; she never smiled and could not walk or sit up. The child has been beaten so hard that her brain was swollen. She died of her injuries on May 5, 2003. An autopsy showed she was deprived of oxygen for a significant period of time. At the time of her death, she weighed 3 pounds and 4 ounces.

During her life, the child weighed 9 and 10 percent of her ideal weight. She had no fingernails; her toenails were coming off. She also had a condition known as subdural hemorrhages -- the brain fluid had leaked between her skull and brain into her head and, in some places, under the skull into her brain. No one knows whether these problems were caused by abuse or by a lack of nutrition, but they were certainly linked. Doctors have linked both conditions with alcohol consumption in the mother.

The child was born premature because the father was addicted to illegal drugs. The family lived in a trailer home with no electricity or running water. Grand Jury testimony indicated that the mother's boyfriend, the boy's father, was responsible for the girl's neglect and abuse. The father beat the child repeatedly. On his deathbed in 1998, the boy's grandfather admitted to killing the girl by beating and kicking her. His father and uncle have been arrested in connection with the case. Each was initially charged with child abuse and neglect. The uncle was then charged with manslaughter and the father of felony child abuse and manslaughter as an accomplice.

The case also involved a second victim: the family dog. Medical technicians found the baby's remains and the dog's body during a routine search of the couple's garbage to dispose of waste. The remains had been covered with leaves, newspapers, diapers, and a blanket. Authorities discovered the dog's body wrapped in a plastic bag and buried in a flower bed. Baby Grace had been buried in the yard. Animal control officers took the dog to a veterinarian. According to the dog's owner, the dog had been hit in the head and was not expected to make it.

The medical examiner found two areas of the baby's brain that were severely swollen. In the final report and trial, he said that Baby Grace's death had been caused by blunt trauma to the head and the abdomen. He said the child had died on her 6th birthday, the same day she was first treated for the problem with the subdural hematoma. Other medical personnel had seen the baby's bruises but no one wanted to report the condition for fear of losing their jobs.

In February, 1998, doctors discovered the cause of one of the baby's wounds. The baby's umbilical cord was wrapped to the child's stomach, but there was no baby present. The medical examiner said the wound to the stomach was so significant that it had caused excessive vomiting. In the fetus, Baby Grace had some fetal alcohol syndrome, a condition that left her tiny and affected her eyes, skull, and hands. She was born with a heart defect and a missing finger and toe.

The abuse happened before the child was born, while her mother was pregnant, and before the child had her umbilical cord wrapped around her stomach. At trial, the grandmother claimed that the girl's injury was caused by a fall when the girl was a baby.

On October 3, 2005, a Texas Third Court of Appeal reversed the sentences of the two men and the order of the district attorney's office to try for a death sentence. The judge found that the medical examiner's testimony was ""too general"" and not relevant. The appellate court also found that the jury had heard evidence of abuse by the uncle's boyfriend toward the baby, a man with whom she had been living. The appellate judges ordered a new trial and instructed the court clerk to transfer the papers from the appeals court to the trial court.

Grand Jury upgraded the death penalty for her mother and father. The jury found",1
