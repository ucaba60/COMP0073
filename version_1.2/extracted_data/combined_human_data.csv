"Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? Answer: Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.",0
"Question: Landolt C and snellen e acuity: differences in strabismus amblyopia? Answer: Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.",0
"Question: Syncope during bathing in infants, a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria? Answer: ""Aquagenic maladies"" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.",0
"Question: Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through? Answer: Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.",0
"Question: Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women? Answer: The effects of the intervention were most pronounced after the first intervention. Compared to usual care, telephone counseling seemed particularly effective at promoting change among nonadherent women, the group for whom the intervention was developed. These results suggest that telephone counseling, rather than tailored print, might be the preferred first-line intervention for getting nonadherent women on schedule for mammography screening. Many questions would have to be answered about why the tailored print intervention was not more powerful. Nevertheless, it is clear that additional interventions will be needed to maintain women's adherence to mammography. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): mammography screening, telephone counseling, tailored print communications, barriers.",0
"Question: Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting? Answer: DBE appears to be equally safe and effective when performed in the community setting as compared to a tertiary referral center with a comparable yield, efficacy, and complication rate.",0
"Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement? Answer: Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.",0
"Question: Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Answer: Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.",0
Question: Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness? Answer: Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.,0
Question: A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are they effective? Answer: This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward.

We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.,0
"Question: Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement? Answer: Findings suggest that traffic law reforms in order to have an effect on both traffic fatality and injury rates reduction require changes in police enforcement practices. Last, this case also illustrates how the diffusion of successful road safety practices globally promoted by WHO and World Bank can be an important influence for enhancing national road safety practices.",0
"Question: Therapeutic anticoagulation in the trauma patient: is it safe? Answer: Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.",0
"Question: Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful? Answer: Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.",0
"Question: Prompting Primary Care Providers about Increased Patient Risk As a Result of Family History: Does It Work? Answer: No change occurred upon instituting simple, at-the-visit family history prompts geared to improve PCPs' ability to identify patients at high risk for 6 common conditions. The results are both surprising and disappointing. Further studies should examine physicians' perception of the utility of prompts for family history risk.",0
Question: Do emergency ultrasound fellowship programs impact emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education?

Prospective studies are needed in sub-Saharan African populations to establish the potential value of RHR in cardiovascular risk assessment.,0
Question: Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted? Answer: Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.,0
"Question: Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome? Answer: Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.",0
"Question: Secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for significant health disparities? Answer: The most disadvantaged families were least likely to have protective health behaviors in place to reduce SHSe and, consequently, are most at-risk for tobacco exposure and subsequent tobacco-related health disparities. Innovative SHSe interventions for this vulnerable population are sorely needed.",0
"Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR? Answer: Currently available nomograms used to predict BCR accurately predict PCSM and other more clinically relevant endpoints. Moreover, not only do they significantly predict PCSM, but do so with generally greater accuracy than BCR.",0
"Question: Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation? Answer: Self-reported mechanical factors associated with chronic oro-facial pain are confounded, in part, by psychological factors and are equally common across other frequently unexplained syndromes. They may represent another feature of somatisation. Therefore the use of extensive invasive therapy such as occlusal adjustments and surgery to change mechanical factors may not be justified in many cases.",0
Question: Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent? Answer: Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.,0
"Question: Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor: is the standard of effective analgesia reachable in all women? Answer: Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.",0

"Question: Visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level: can it represent visceral adipose tissue volume? Answer: VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.",0
Question: Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy? Answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.,0
"Question: Is the Hawkins sign able to predict necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus? Answer: A positive Hawkins sign rules out that the fractured talus has developed avascular necrosis, but its absence does not confirm it.",0
Question: Is a mandatory general surgery rotation necessary in the surgical clerkship? Answer: Effective undergraduate surgical education can be offered in many specialty settings. Removal of the requirement for general surgery in clerkship may lead to a more effective use of all educational opportunities. A careful analysis of local programs and facilities is necessary before suggesting this change to other institutions.,0
Question: Is Acupuncture Efficacious for Treating Phonotraumatic Vocal Pathologies? Answer: The findings showed that acupuncture of voice-related acupoints could bring about improvement in vocal function and healing of vocal fold lesions.,0
"Question: Is aneurysm repair justified for the patients aged 80 or older after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage? Answer: Better prognosis was obtained when ruptured aneurysm was repaired in the elderly than it was treated conservatively. From the results of this study, we should not hesitate to offer the definitive surgery for the elderly with aSAH.",0
"Question: Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care? Answer: The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.",0
"Question: Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma--is well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer? Answer: W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.",0
"Question: Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence? Answer: Adherence to follow-up was low in this family planning clinic population, no matter what type of follow-up was advised. Adherence was improved by the use of up to 3 reminders. Allocating resources to effective methods for improving adherence to follow-up of abnormal results may be more important than which follow-up procedure is recommended.",0
"Question: Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring? Answer: The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.",0
"Question: Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer? Answer: In comparison with its accuracy in non-DM patients, the accuracy of PET in cervical cancer patients with mild to moderate DM was not significantly reduced.",0
"Question: Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis? Answer: Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.",0
Question: Does radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer affect prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer? Answer: Patients who previously received radiotherapy for primary rectal cancer treatment have worse oncologic outcomes than those who had not received radiotherapy after pelvic exenteration for locally recurrent rectal cancer.,0
Question: Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably? Answer: An increase of 5% in circumference measurements identified the most potential lymphedema cases compared with an academic trial.,0
"Question: Colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases: does global management at the same centre improve results? Answer: GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.",0
"Question: Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality? Answer: Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.",0
Question: Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy: is it possible? Answer: Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.,0
"Question: It's Fournier's gangrene still dangerous? Answer: The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.",0
"Question: Is it appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients? Answer: We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.",0
Question: Do provider service networks result in lower expenditures compared with HMOs or primary care case management in Florida's Medicaid program? Answer: The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.,0
"Question: Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Is it always necessary? Answer: In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged>70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes.",0
Question: Should direct mesocolon invasion be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer? Answer: Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.,0
"Question: Do Surrogates of Injury Severity Influence the Occurrence of Heterotopic Ossification in Fractures of the Acetabulum? Answer: Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.",0
"Question: Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke? Answer: The statistical power of this case-referent study was such that only large beneficial effects of statins in acute stroke could be confirmed. However, the observed trend, together with experimental observations, is interesting enough to warrant a more detailed analysis of the relationship between statins and stroke outcome.",0
Question: Processing fluency effects: can the content and presentation of participant information sheets influence recruitment and participation for an antenatal intervention? Answer: Font influenced pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity.,0
Question: Sternal fracture in growing children : A rare and often overlooked fracture? Answer: Isolated sternal fractures in childhood are often due to typical age-related traumatic incidents. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool for fracture detection and radiography is the method of choice for visualization of the extent of the dislocation.,0
"Question: Is there a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women? Answer: In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.",0
"Question: Does immediate breast reconstruction compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy? Answer: We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.",0
Question: Human papillomavirus and pterygium. Is the virus a risk factor? Answer: The low presence of HPV DNA in pterygia does not support the hypothesis that HPV is involved in the development of pterygia in Denmark.,0
"Question: Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay? Answer: The ANN with its intrinsic ability to detect non-linear correlation, and to relate specific item patterns to LOS, outperformed linear statistics but was still disappointing in estimating individual LOS. It might be speculated that therapeutic intervention modulates the natural course of the disease thus counteracting both disease severity as initially scored by PRISM, and LOS. This being true, the inverse of the correlation between PRISM (or PRISM based LOS estimate) and LOS might be a candidate indicator of quality of care.",0
Question: Can predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation be omitted? Answer: TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.,0
"Question: Autoerotic asphyxiation: secret pleasure--lethal outcome? Answer: Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.",0
"Question: Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence: Does comorbidity lead to poorer outcomes of depression? Answer: The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.",0
"Question: Cold preparation use in young children after FDA warnings: do concerns still exist? Answer: Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.",0
Question: Does a 4 diagram manual enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme®? Answer: In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.,0
"Question: Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method? Answer: Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6 mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.",0
"Question: Should circumcision be performed in childhood? Answer: Incomplete separation between prepuce and glans penis is normal and common among new-borns, progressing until adolescence to spontaneous separation, at which time it is complete in the majority of boys. Accordingly to the criteria we have sustained for years and present study's findings, circumcision has few indications during childhood, as well as forced prepucial dilation.",0
"Question: Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management? Answer: Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.",0
"Question: Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up? Answer: IADL disability is a useful addition to the diagnostic process in a memory clinic setting, indicating who is at higher risk of developing dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.",0
"Question: Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection? Answer: In the present study, the use of an endoscope during VPS procedures did not increase the risk of surgical infection.",0
"Question: Body perception: do parents, their children, and their children's physicians perceive body image differently? Answer: Many children underestimated their degree of overweight. Their parents and even their attending physicians shared this misperception. This study demonstrates the need to further educate physicians to recognize obesity and overweight so that they can counsel children and their families.",0
"Question: Is a specialised training of phonological awareness indicated in every preschool child? Answer: A specialized training program to improve phonologic awareness as a basis for reading and writing in every kindergarten and preschool child seems to be unnecessary. However, children with temporary hearing deficits benefit from such a program. For all other children general perception training may be sufficient.",0
"Question: Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis? Answer: These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.",0
Question: Is the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer? Answer: 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.,0
"Question: Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery? Answer: As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery.",0
"Question: Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement? Answer: Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial UKR.",0
"Question: Is tumour expression of VEGF associated with venous invasion and survival in pT3 renal cell carcinoma? Answer: Progression of a pT3 tumour into the renal vein and vena cava is not associated with increased tumour expression of VEGF. However, VEGF is an independent prognostic factor in this group of poor prognosis renal tumours.",0
"Question: Injury and poisoning mortality among young men--are there any common factors amenable to prevention? Answer: Alcohol and drug use are important contributory factors to injury and poisoning deaths. More research is needed into the effects of unemployment and being single on the health of young men, and to investigate the motivations behind risk taking and self-destructive behaviour.",0
"Question: Continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration: opportunity for rescue? Answer: Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.",0
"Question: Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects? Answer: In this population, neither BMI nor neck circumference nor waist circumference is predictive of autoCPAP pressure. Therefore, the previously derived algorithm does not adequately predict the fixed CPAP pressure for subsequent clinical use in these obese individuals. In addition, some subjects without OSA generated high autoCPAP pressures, and thus, the correlation between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure was only moderate.",0
Question: Does the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth predict risk in a subsequent pregnancy? Answer: Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.,0
"Question: Is the Distance Worth It? Answer: Our results indicate that when controlled for patient, tumor, and hospital factors, patients who traveled a long distance to a high-volume center had improved lymph node yield, neoadjuvant chemoradiation receipt, and 30- and 90-day mortality compared with those who traveled a short distance to a low-volume center. They also had improved 5-year survival. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A446.",0
Question: Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling? Answer: Adverse drug reactions were confronted with other already published case reports. Dopamine partial agonist mechanism of aripiprazole could explain the occurrence of pathological gambling.,0
Question: Immune suppression by lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine on T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens: does synergy exist? Answer: Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.,0
"Question: Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma? Answer: While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.",0
Question: Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more? Answer: We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.,0
"Question: Are normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians accurate and reliable at making street crossing decisions? Answer: Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.",0
"Question: Is it Crohn's disease? Answer: Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.",0
"Question: Is Chaalia/Pan Masala harmful for health? Answer: The frequency of habits of Chaalia and Pan Masala chewing, by school children in lower socio-economic areas is extremely high. The probable reasons for this high frequency are taste, the widespread use of these substances by family members and friends, low cost and easy availability.",0
"Question: Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus? Answer: Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.",0
"Question: Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory? Answer: This study demonstrates that a significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory disease.",0
"Question: Is HIV/STD control in Jamaica making a difference? Answer: HIV/STD control measures appear to have slowed the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Jamaica, however a significant minority of persons continue to have unprotected sex in high risk situations.",0
Question: Is Panton-Valentine leucocidin associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK? Answer: We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.,0
Question: Are even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery? Answer: The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.,0
"Question: Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer? Answer: Position emission tomography scanning appears to accurately change the stage or appropriately alter the therapy of almost a third of patients with advanced primary rectal cancer. In view of this, we suggest that position emission tomography scanning be considered part of standard workup for such patients, particularly if neoadjuvant chemoradiation is being considered as part of primary management.",0
"Question: Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator? Answer: The tidal volume delivered by a manual resuscitator shows large variations. There were significant differences in the volume delivered by compression methods, but physical characteristics are not a predictor of tidal volume delivery. The manual resuscitator is not a suitable device for accurate ventilation.",0
"Question: Can increases in the cigarette tax rate be linked to cigarette retail prices? Answer: Numerous studies have found that taxation is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed on to the retail price.",0
Question: Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children? Answer: Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.,0
"Question: Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events? Answer: Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).",0
Question: Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease? Answer: Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.,0
"Question: Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations? Answer: The current literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.",0
"Question: Mammographic screening in Sami speaking municipalities and a control group. Are early outcome measures influenced by ethnicity?

"Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer: Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend that patients on AIs should be offered Ca/Bis to reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms and fracture, especially if patients are receiving steroidal AI and/or did not receive tamoxifen before AIs.",0
"Question: Could different follow-up modalities play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses? Answer: Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy.

"Question: Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs input? Answer: Otolith organs input influences the axis of horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex; therefore, the plane of compensatory eye movements induced by the horizontal canal stimulation is not always parallel to the canal.",0
"Question: Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy? Answer: The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.",0
Question: Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist? Answer: We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.,0

It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.",0
"Question: Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH? Answer: In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.",0
"Question: Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients? Answer: While socio-economic gradients in health exist among all ethnic groups, they are relatively shallow among Pacific and (especially) Asian peoples. For these ethnic groups, caution should be exercised in applying deprivation or other socio-economic measures as proxy indicators of need for health services.",0

"Question: Are serum leptin levels a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer? Answer: Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour‑related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).",0
"Question: Is fetal gender associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy? Answer: Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.",0
"Question: Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation? Answer: These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a ""second hit"", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the ""first hit""), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.",0
"Question: Are adult body circumferences associated with height? Answer: Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.",0
"Question: Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients? Answer: QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.",0

"Question: Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs? Answer: There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.",0
"Question: Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse? Answer: Systolic BP measured by the nurse in treated hypertensive patients is significantly lower than the readings obtained by the physician, and are almost identical to ambulatory BP monitoring. Blood pressure determination by the nurse is desirable not only for diagnosis but also to evaluate the level of control of blood pressure during the follow-up of treated hypertensive patients.",0
"Question: Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake? Answer: The (.)Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test seems to reflect the true (.)Vo(2)max in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory, validating the use of a treadmill test for these children. When confirmation of maximal effort is needed, the addition of supramaximal testing of children with disability is an easy and well-tolerated method.",0
"Question: Is the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy different for fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived following assisted reproductive techniques? Answer: In our population, ART conception was not significantly associated with the probability of PND or TOPFA for CHD. One implication of our results is that live births may be adequate for assessing the overall risk of CHD related to ART. However, total prevalence, in particular of severe CHD, would not be adequately assessed if TOPFA are not included.",0
"Question: Is there a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation? Answer: (1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.",0
Question: Does rural or urban residence make a difference to neonatal outcome in premature birth? Answer: Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.,0
"Question: Is the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis a good and reliable alternative? Answer: Better healing, shorter AT, and equal strength were achieved with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate compared with polyglactin 910 sutures in intestinal anastomosis in the experimental setting.",0

"Question: Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain? Answer: Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the ""cold chain"" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.",0
"Question: Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy? Answer: Clinical axillary examination in breast cancer is subject to false-positive results, and is by itself insufficient justification for axillary lymph node dissection. If other means of preoperative assessment such as palpation- or image-guided fine needle aspiration are negative or indeterminate, then SLN biopsy deserves wider consideration as an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection in the clinically node-positive setting.",0
"Question: Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further? Answer: Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.",0
"Question: Are patients willing participants in the new wave of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia? Answer: Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students.

"Question: Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter? Answer: At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.",0
Question: Are Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover Representative of Bone Histomorphometry in 370 Postmenopausal Women? Answer: Bone turnover markers were significantly but modestly associated with bone turnover parameters measured in iliac cancellous bone. The iliac crest bone may not represent perfectly the whole bone turnover.,0
"Question: Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery? Answer: Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room.

"Question: Are there risk factors that increase the rate of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity? Answer: The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.",0
"Question: Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome? Answer: Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.",0
"Question: Actinobaculum schaalii, a cause of urinary tract infections in children? Answer: Actinobaculum schaalii is CO(2)-dependent. Therefore, if there are clinical symptoms and/or a negative culture despite the presence of leucocytes in the urine, Gram staining and incubation in 5% CO(2) or species-specific real-time PCR should be performed to identify A. schaalii.",0

"Question: Young-Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures: does it predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries? Answer: The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).",0
Question: Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease? Answer: Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.,0

"Question: Are financial incentives cost-effective to support smoking cessation during pregnancy? Answer: Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of £482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.",0
"Question: Can medical students contribute to quality assurance programmes in day surgery? Answer: Our study confirms that students are able to identify QA issues and propose solutions. We recommend that students have a formally recognized place in day surgery QA programmes, to close the QA loop and to adequately prepare them for medical practice in the 21st century.",0
"Question: Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort? Answer: Due to a relatively good reproducibility, fast and easy application, we found the linear dimension method to be the most pragmatic approach for evaluation of growth of carotid and vagal body paragangliomas. For jugulotympanic tumours, the preferred method is manual area tracing. However, volumetric changes of these tumours may be of less clinical importance than changes in relation to surrounding anatomical structures.",0
"Question: Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions? Answer: 3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB. The advantages of 3D ultrasound validation are likely to include a reduction in the number of core samples needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis (and a possible reduction in the risk of tumor cell displacement), reduced procedure time and lower costs.",0
"Question: Can bone thickness and inter-radicular space affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites? Answer: The results of this study suggest that the safest areas for the placement of miniscrews are between the first and second premolars and between the first and second molars, regardless of the angle of insertion.",0

"Question: The Deformity Angular Ratio: Does It Correlate With High-Risk Cases for Potential Spinal Cord Monitoring Alerts in Pediatric 3-Column Thoracic Spinal Deformity Corrective Surgery? Answer: In patients undergoing 3-column osteotomies for severe spinal deformities, the DAR was predictive of patients developing intraoperative motor evoked potential alerts. Identifying accurate radiographical, patient, and procedural risk factors in the correction of severe deformities can help prepare the surgical team to improve safety and outcomes when carrying out complex spinal corrections.",0
Question: Does age moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients? Answer: This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.,0
"Question: Autoxidation products of both carbohydrates and lipids are increased in uremic plasma: is there oxidative stress in uremia? Answer: These data suggest that the increased levels of AGEs in blood, and probably in tissues, reported in uremia implicate a broad derangement in non-enzymatic biochemistry involving alterations in autoxidation of both carbohydrates and lipids.",0
Question: Can 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) be detected in human breast milk? Answer: This preliminary case-control study indicates the absence of mucosal 'high-risk' HPV types in human breast milk.,0
"Question: Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still matter? Answer: Even in this highly advanced setting of the third EOC relapse, maximal therapeutic effort combining optimal surgery and chemotherapy appear to significantly prolong survival in a selected patients 'group'.",0
"Question: Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified? Answer: In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.",0
"Question: Does topical ropivacaine reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients? Answer: Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.",0
Question: Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry? Answer: We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.,0
"Question: Does concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence? Answer: In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.",0
Question: Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression result in cost savings? Answer: The results show no evidence that AAPs used as second-line treatment for depression results in overall cost savings or lower inpatient and ED visits compared to other treatment strategies.,0
"Question: Can patients be anticoagulated after intracerebral hemorrhage? Answer: Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.",0
"Question: Diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy: is dilatation of ureteral meatus always necessary? Answer: In selected cases, ureteroscopy may be performed without ureteral meatus dilatation with success and morbidity rates similar to when the procedure is performed with meatal dilatation.",0
"Question: Does managed care enable more low income persons to identify a usual source of care? Answer: Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.",0
"Question: Knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation: are they related in Parkinson's disease? Answer: These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.",0
"Question: Is distance to provider a barrier to care for medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer? Answer: Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.",0
Question: Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome? Answer: Our study does not show a protective effect of FA on heart anomalies among infants with DS.,0
Question: Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba? Answer: The discrepancy in how Francophones view their mental health and their rates of diagnosed mental disorders may be related to health seeking behaviours in the Francophone population. Community and government agencies should try to improve the mental health of this population through mental health promotion and by addressing language and cultural barriers to health services.,0
"Question: Does type 1 diabetes mellitus affect Achilles tendon response to a 10 km run? Answer: Active individuals with T1DM do not have a heightened Achilles tendon response to load, which suggests no increased risk of tendon injury. We cannot extrapolate these findings to sedentary individuals with T1DM.",0
"Question: Fragility of the esophageal mucosa: a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis? Answer: Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This ""crêpe-paper"" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.",0
"Question: Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures? Answer: The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",0
"Question: Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: are we operating too late? Answer: Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.",0
"Question: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition? Answer: The expression of p53, PCNA and beta-catenin in XGC was significantly different from GBC and similar to chronic cholecystitis, thus indicating the inflammatory nature of XGC and may not support a premalignant nature of the lesion.",0
"Question: Does TDP-43 type confer a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration? Answer: Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.",0
"Question: Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method? Answer: These preliminary results suggest the feasibility of multicatheter APBI after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery in selected low-risk breast cancer patients; however, special attention to target volume definition is needed. Further prospective investigations with long follow-up are needed to define the real value of the procedure.",0
"Question: Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" sample generalize? Answer: Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.",0
"Question: Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable? Answer: To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.",0
"Question: Does rugby headgear prevent concussion? Answer: Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.",0
"Question: Spinal subdural hematoma: a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm? Answer: Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.",0
"Question: Can shape analysis differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or transient ischemic attack? Answer: We identified five quantitative shape descriptors of carotid FFT. This shape ""signature"" shows potential for supplementing conventional lesion characterization in cases of suspected FFT.",0
"Question: Dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease: an underrecognised association? Answer: The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.",0
"Question: Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India? Answer: Using solid culture, 150 cultures need to be tested for one treatment modification and 30 for DST. The cost of the widespread application of culture will need to be balanced against its impact on treatment decisions in India.",0
"Question: Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible? Answer: epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.",0
Question: Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis? Answer: Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.,0
Question: Do risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity? Answer: Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.,0
"Question: Multidisciplinary breast cancer clinics. Do they work? Answer: Although planning and operating a multidisciplinary clinic is not a new venture, to the best of the authors' knowledge, they have provided the first report demonstrating the benefits described above.",0
"Question: Is the international normalised ratio (INR) reliable? Answer: No technical problems associated with INR testing within primary care were uncovered. Discrepant INR results are as problematic in hospital settings as they are in primary care. These data highlight the failings of the INR to standardise when different techniques and reagents are used, an issue which needs to be resolved. For primary care to become more involved in therapeutic oral anticoagulation monitoring, close links are needed between hospital laboratories and practices, particularly with regard to training and quality assurance.",0
"Question: Are there associations of health status, disease activity and damage in SLE patients? Answer: The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.",0
"Question: PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy? Answer: Our study demonstrates no difference in PC detection rate at repeat biopsy between patients with flu or si-PSA levels. PSA Slope, PSAV and PSADT were not found helpful tools in cancer detection.",0
"Question: Is zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate sustainable? Answer: High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.",0
"Question: Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits? Answer: We conclude that GES is more effective in improving long-term GI symptoms and costs, and decreasing use of healthcare resources than intensive medical therapy, in this sample of patients with the symptoms of GP followed for 3 years. Certain patients with GP form a high-risk group in terms of costs, quality of life, morbidity and mortality.",0
"Question: Should pulp chamber pulpotomy be seen as a permanent treatment? Answer: Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.",0
Question: Does transverse apex coincide with coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? Answer: This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.,0
"Question: Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy? Answer: Unless improvements are made in case ascertainment, case validation and recording activities, the evidence suggests that the CHCS will not be able to provide the same quality of information for needs assessment and surveillance of very low birthweight infants in relation to cerebral palsy as is provided by a specialist case register.",0
Question: Are we seeing the effects of public awareness campaigns? Answer: The proportion of thin 0-1 mm melanomas presenting in South West England has significantly increased from 2003 to 2012. There is no significant change in the thick>4 mm melanomas. This may be a result of increased public awareness due to effective public health campaigns which has significant prognostic and financial implications.,0
Question: Is breast cancer prognosis inherited? Answer: Breast cancer prognosis of a woman predicts the survival in her first-degree relatives with breast cancer. Our novel findings suggest that breast cancer prognosis might be inherited.,0
"Question: Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy? Answer: NT thickness does not show a significative increase in those women who subsequently develop GDM. Therefore, NT assessment does not prove to be an useful ultrasound parameter for predicting GDM onset during pregnancy.",0
Question: Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype? Answer: Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.,0
"Question: Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma: really an early stage? Answer: Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.",0
"Question: Does Residency Selection Criteria Predict Performance in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency? Answer: We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be ""high yield"" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.",0
Question: Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at advanced ages? Answer: An optimistic outlook appears to be a significant predictor of survival among the oldest-old women. It may also be a significant predictor for men but the sample size is small.,0
"Question: Is it better to be big? Answer: The employees believe the merger has neither generated economy of scale advantages nor substantial quality improvement. Instead, it seems more rewarding to promote cross-functional collaboration together with clinical specialisation. Needs for both integration and differentiation could thereby be fulfilled.",0
"Question: Is arch form influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy? Answer: Arch form in a Saudi patient group is independent of gender, sagittal molar relationship, and Bolton discrepancy.",0
"Question: Cold knife conization vs. LEEP. Are they the same procedure? Answer: In a prospective evaluation, cold knife cone specimens were 50% longer and 100% heavier than LEEP specimens.",0
"Question: Are pectins involved in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed rape plants? Answer: The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens.",0
"Question: Updating emotional content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit? Answer: The results indicate that difficulties removing irrelevant material from working memory might be unique to depression, and the ability to inhibit irrelevant information is relatively preserved in social anxiety disorder.",0
"Question: Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein cannulation? Answer: Prepuncture ultrasound evaluation did not improve the result of right internal jugular vein cannulation compared with the respiratory jugular venodilation-guided approach. When the landmark was not observed, however, the prepuncture ultrasound guidance was helpful in facilitating the cannulation.",0
"Question: Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? Answer: Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.",0
"Question: Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness? Answer: Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.",0
"Question: The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK? Answer: Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for AMPK on the secretion of melatonin probably acting trough the paraventricular nucleus and/or directly in the pineal gland. We conclude that AMPK may act as a metabolic cue to modulate the rhythm of melatonin secretion.",0
"Question: Literacy after cerebral hemispherectomy: Can the isolated right hemisphere read? Answer: When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.",0
Question: Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible? Answer: The independent protective effect of female gender on multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection rates remains significant in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women when compared with similarly aged men. This is contrary to previous experimental studies and the known physiologic sex hormone changes that occur after menopause in women. These results suggest that factors other than sex hormones may be responsible for gender-based differences after injury.,0
Question: Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught? Answer: The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.,0
Question: Delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer: does it impact survival? Answer: Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.,0
"Question: Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males? Answer: Our results suggest that depressed vessel compliance and increased vascular resistance are features of young, obese, normotensive subjects independently of and in addition to cardiovascular risk factors. As changes in arterial wall properties may be incipient in young obese subjects, future studies will be required to demonstrate whether early intervention such as diet and exercise in this population can improve vascular functions.",0
"Question: Are acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people socially imbalanced? Answer: High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.",0
"Question: Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles? Answer: Open access publishing and the Hirsch index of the first signing author increase the impact of scientific articles. The open access advantage is greater for the more highly cited articles, and appears in the 30-35 months after publication.",0
"Question: In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role? Answer: Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.",0
"Question: Does the early adopter of drugs exist? Answer: Within drug groups, indicators of drug adoption, except for adoption time, correlate reasonably well. However, the theory that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait independent of the type of drug could not be confirmed. The notion of the early-drug-adopting general practitioner may be mistaken.",0
"Question: Does high blood pressure reduce the risk of chronic low back pain? Answer: Results for low back pain are consistent with the theory of hypertension-associated hypalgesia, predicting diminished pain sensitivity with increasing blood pressure, possibly with modified reactions in people suffering from long-lasting pain.",0
"Question: Does responsibility affect the public's valuation of health care interventions? Answer: Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to ""safety-related"" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.",0
"Question: Nasal fractures: is closed reduction satisfying? Answer: Closed reduction is an easy and sufficient treatment for nasal fractures, especially for mild nasal fractures. Early intervention raises the patient satisfaction rate.",0
"Question: Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival? Answer: Our findings support the importance of increasing access to clinical services, certain outreach services and breastfeeding and, in Africa, of improving nutritional status. Integrated programs that emphasize these services may lead to substantial mortality declines.",0
Question: Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa? Answer: This case illustrates the importance of considering PAN in the differential diagnosis of renal infarction with inflammatory syndrome and shows that spontaneous remission of renal PAN can occur. .,0
"Question: Gluten tolerance in adult patients with celiac disease 20 years after diagnosis? Answer: Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.",0
"Question: Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers? Answer: COPD is underdiagnosed in the United States. Symptoms are frequent in subjects with AO and increase their risk for COPD, but add little beyond age and smoking history to the predictive value of spirometry. In view of the high prevalence of symptoms and their poor predictive value, a simpler and more effective approach would be to screen older smokers.",0
Question: Search engine as a diagnostic tool in difficult immunological and allergologic cases: is Google useful? Answer: This Google-based search was useful to identify an appropriate diagnosis in complex immunological and allergic cases. Computing skills may help to get better results.,0
Question: Uniformity of evidence-based treatments in practice? Answer: This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.,0
Question: Do approved doctors and medical referees in the UK agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness? Answer: This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.,0
"Question: Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors? Answer: We report for the first time ESLD etiology as a prognostic factor for survival. The renal function (expressed as serum creatinine) and urinary Na (<5 mEq/l) at the time of diagnosis were found to be associated with survival, suggesting that early treatment might increase survival.",0
Question: Vaginal dose assessment in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer: Can we really rely on dose-point evaluation? Answer: The doses evaluated at PIBS points are not impacted by intrafractional movements. PIBS and PIBS +2 dose points allow distinguishing the plans of patients with vaginal infiltration. Further studies are needed to correlate these parameters with vaginal morbidity.,0
"Question: Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice? Answer: When additional validation studies were taken into account, asthma medications were found to be prescribed not only for asthma but also for other respiratory diseases. In addition, not all children with current asthma had prescriptions. We therefore conclude that asthma medications are therefore not a good proxy for the disease.",0
"Question: Does the familial transmission of drinking patterns persist into young adulthood? Answer: The association between familial drinking and offspring drinking in young adulthood exhibits clear non-linear trends. Changes in the lower part of the familial drinking distribution are strongly related to drinking in young adults, but the actual levels of drinking in drinking families appear less important in shaping the drinking patterns of the offspring in young adulthood.",0
Question: Proof of concept study: does fenofibrate have a role in sleep apnoea syndrome? Answer: The consistent direction of change in sleep indices in this proof-of-concept study may support further investigation of fenofibrate in moderate to severe sleep apnoea syndrome.,0
"Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore propose the term ""functional minimally conscious state"" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic value. Prediction of the clinical course of patients in an MCS by fMRI was considerably less accurate than in patients in a VS.",0
Question: The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option? Answer: A UNP can be trained to perform cystoscopy and detect suspicious lesions as accurately as can a consultant urologist. Legal and training issues in implementation are important.,0
Question: Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas? Answer: Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.,0
Question: Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure? Answer: We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.,0
Question: Can the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica be predicted at disease onset? Answer: A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.,0
"Prompt: Every person in the world undergoes a `` goodness '' test. It 's designed to give a score from 1 to 200, where 1 is pure evil, and 200 is an angel in human body. Then the world is divided into 200 zones, where people can live among their own kind. Story: Clancy Marguerian, 154, private first class of the 150+ army, sits in his foxhole. Tired cold, wet and hungry, the only thing preventing him from laying down his rifle and walking towards the enemy lines in surrender is the knowledge that however bad he has it here, life as a 50-100 POW is surely much worse. He's fighting to keep his eyes open and his rifle ready when the mortar shells start landing near him. He hunkers lower. After a few minutes under the barrage, Marguerian hears hurried footsteps, a grunt, and a thud as a soldier leaps into the foxhole. The man's uniform is tan, he must be a 50-100. The two men snarl and grab at eachother, grappling in the small foxhole. Abruptly, their faces come together. ""Clancy?"" ""Rob?"" Rob Hall, 97, Corporal in the 50-100 army grins, as the situation turns from life or death struggle, to a meeting of two college friends. He lets go of Marguerian's collar. ""Holy shit Clancy, you're the last person I expected to see here"" ""Yeah"" ""Shit man, I didn't think I'd ever see'Mr. volunteers every saturday morning at the food shelf', not after The Reorganization at least"" ""Yeah Rob, it is something isn't it"" ""Man, I'm sorry I tried to kill you there, hey, I heard you guys were out of food, here, you can share my dinner"" Clancy marvels, even after all this: The Reorganization, the coalitions, the war, Rob is still his old, chatty self. The two men sit, Rob chatting away, Clancy forcing out pleasantries. They pass Rob's rations between them. ""Clancy my man, I heard a group of terrorist 5's took have formed some kind of cult, and they're rallying all the < 50 in their own coalition"" ""Oh yeah?"" ""Yeah, I mean, that sucks and everything, cause those are some scary dudes, but I heard that there's going to be a truce between our countries in a few days, why don't we just hang out here, pretty soon we won't even be enemies anymore!"" ""Yeah, Rob, that sounds like a plan"" ""Man, I'm so glad I found you again, in a few days, this war will be over, and things will be cool between us and, hey, remember Sarah? I heard she's a 151, maybe I'll look her up, I'll be sure to visit you too once I can get a pass to sector 150-155, it'll probably be tough though, even before the war, you had to do sooo much paperwork to be allowed to visit, I wonder if passes will even be reinstated after the truce ends, hey, did I ever tell you about the time..."" Rob babbles as he dozes off, grinning up at Clancy. When Clancy is sure that his friend is asleep, he slits Rob's throat with his bayonet.

"Prompt: Space mining is on the rise. The Space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 crash and spill its cargo. Write a news story covering the event. Story: „… and the little duckling will never be able to walk again. ” The artificial intelligence paused a moment for dramatic effect before continuing with its broadcast with a different voice. “ What a hearth breaking story, Frank. But now to another story that may leave you feel equally dirty. The automated space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 collided with an asteroid on its way to the Jupiter moon Ganymede. According to the ship owner the ship is out of control and leaking its content into space. ” “ That's right, Fred. And the content of the ship has it in it, as they say ”, the computer said in first voice again, “ The whole tanker was filled with ‘ biological waste products'coming from research and mining stations in the Kuiper Belt. ” “ Biological waste products? You don't mean.... ” “ Yes, Fred! ” Dramatic pause. “ I am talking about poop. Lots of it. And apparently it's spilling everywhere. ” “ Better call the plumbers, Frank. ” “ Not any time soon, Fred. A spokesperson of the ship owner stated and I quote – ‘ Space is kind of big and empty, we expect no one to care, so why should we?'Apparently they will just build a new ship and be done with it. ” “ That's one way not to deal with the problem. But why doesn't the ship fly home? Shouldn't the AI on board be able to handle such a problem? ” “ Well, the issue is that the part in charge to deal with asteroid impacts like that has been impacted by the asteroid. ” “ Ouch. Talk about a bad run. ” “ True, especially if you take the name of the ship in consideration. ” “ Oh? Exxon Valdez 2.0 it was, isn't that right, Frank? ” “ You're absolutely right, Fred. Did you know the ship was named after an infamous ship of the twentieth century back on old Earth? Apparently the Exxon Valdez of old was used for transporting petroleum across the oceans of Earth. Petroleum, as some of our listeners might not know, was a brownish black, gooey liquid comprised of biological matter which was transformed under high pressure for millions of years. Quite ironically the Exxon Valdez was infamous for crashing and spilling its cargo. ” “ Well, talk about making a bad name for yourself. Now both ships will go down in history for spilling black gooey stuff where it doesn't belong. Who had that bright idea for such a name anyway? ” “ Well, Fred, the company made its first plunder by holding a naming contest on the internet. ” “ Oh, will they ever learn? ” “ Apparently not, Fred. Predictably someone tried to make a joke out of it. A niche side of history role players got wind of the contest and made it its goal to get it named after the infamous Exxon Valdez. Apparently they thought it would be funny, and given the content both ships were ferrying around, they might have a point. ” “ Funny, indeed, Frank. What's the name of the side? ” “ Well, Fred, it's called Reddit. The people there mostly talk in outdated lingo and memes and watch cat pictures back from a time when the internet only was local on Earth. ” “ Truly a herald of the dark ages. ” “ You might be right about that, Fred. I assume they just thought it was funny. I guess this happens, when you let the internet decide on things. ” “ Well, Frank, when you think about the content both ships were ferrying around, they might have been right. Embarrassing for the company, but funny for everyone else. ” “ It might get worse than that, Fred. Environmentalists are up in arms. They claim that the human waste products spilling out of the ship might collide with Jupiter's moon Europa within the next few millennia and might contaminate the biospheres with Earth life. Apparently there are a lot of bacteria and the likes in poop and some might be able survive the harsh conditions of space and end up impacting on the restricted moon. ” “ Oh dear, Frank, does the Monolith know about it yet? I am sure it won't let us hear the end of it. ”",0
"Prompt: `` I wo n't have time to explain all of this to them. '' Start or end your story with this sentence. Story: I won't have the time to explain all of this to them. They have to die. Sure they don't know it yet, but they'll realize soon, and soon is a time well before never. They'll ask why, question the rationale, wonder under what circumstances did they come to occupy their position. Death, the unwanted companion of life, is never without her share of questions. But these would be different. There's no mistaking what happened before to what will. It used to be that in a moment a city could disappear under a cloud of ash, but nowadays one would expect no less from the great powers than total annihilation not by fell swoops of display, but by careful attrition of the enemy until their very essence is destroyed by the slow grinding of endless war. It embeds itself within them, becoming a part of their psyche, their identity, until their old selves are left for dead in a world where such knowledge has no use. It is a new world, and this new world needs new people. Such it is that they the beholden in pacificity must be left to die in their own, lonely sheep in a world now concerned with far more pressing matters. They won't know why, those of old thought never do. Explain to them the needs of war and from them comes nothing but rebuttal and counterpoint. For them the short is sweet, failing to see the beauty in war unceasing. They will never understand the new world as they are. Their option therefore, is to die, or walk amongst the dead.",0
"Prompt: Write about a song. Each sentence must start with the next letter in the song title. Story: *"" [ Sally ] (https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=6QyVil0dwhk), come on! Time to go! ""* Of course, she didn't need to be told that- she knew this moment had been a long time coming. Perhaps too long. Children see things that we as adults don't, and Sally had seen this coming for months, maybe even years. Rows, late at night, when they thought she was asleep. Yelling loud enough to shake the fixtures and rattle the walls. It was inevitable that sooner or later this day would arrive, the day when her life would be packed up and she'd be driven to some distant city- it was surprising it had taken this long. Now that day had arrived, and she sat on her bed, looking at the bare walls. Gone were the posters and the pictures that made the room hers. Yesterday, they'd stripped the whole room- her toys, clothes, games, her whole life packed into a van because mummy and daddy could no longer stand to be in the same room, or even the same city. Oxford would never be a home like Maidstone. Uprooted from her school and torn away from her friends, from the life she knew, the people she loved and trusted- gone, forever. Replaced with uncertainty- unfamiliar faces and unknown streets. *"" Hey, hey, what's all this? ""* Evidently she'd taken too long, sitting on her bed, as the tears rolled down her face. All through the divorce, she'd been detached and distant, trying not to let it affect her, but now that the inevitable moment had arrived, it had all become too much to take. *"" Rugrat, come here.... it'll be alright. ""* That special nickname her father had given her put a flicker of a smile on her face, despite her tears, as he pulled in for the kind of hug she knew she'd miss the most. *"" One day, you'll understand- you'll look back and realise this was what's best for everyone- for mummy, for you, and for me. Understand that I love you, and so does mummy, and that no matter if you're in Oxford or in Maidstone or on the moon, that doesn't change one little bit. There's a whole world of opportunity and possibility out there, Sally, and whatever you do, wherever you go, we'll always be right there with you. ""*",0
"Prompt: You live in Skyrim. It is your job to keep lit all the candles in the abandoned caves and dungeons and castles. Story: Light is a marvelous thing. It alone can turn a dead and inhospitable cave and make it come alive, welcoming as a humble abode. Without it, even the most luxurious palace becomes cold and depressing. Baldin knew this well. The Old Kingdom was rich with forgotten knowledge and artifacts, hidden in old ruins and abandoned temples. But who would venture foolishly into darkness to try and pry this wealth of information without a guiding light? Baldin liked to keep to himself, watching people from afar. At night, a single candle can function like a beacon, drawing adventurers from all over the land, like moths to a flame. And Baldin wasn't gon na let a lack of light keep them from going. Adventurers love exploring, making their own path and discovering new things. But they don't see the invisible hand that led them there. Adventurers go where Baldin wants them to go. But even though the caves and ruins may be old and forgotten, they are not entirely deserted. Many traps await the unobservant explorer, and these are no good places to injured, especially considering that the dwellers one might stumble upon can be quite threatening. But for the courageous such tremendous awards awaits; Dwarven metals, Dremoran trinkets, Daedric armors and so much more. Skyrim have some mighty fine adventurers. And all this thanks to light. Once an adventurer has conquered one of these dungeons and heads back home, they follow the lights blindly, even if they have moved. Or they might go and find that the candles are no more. Baldin likes to play little tricks and have fun with his guests. Baldin has found that most of his guests can't go more than a few days without light. If they don't find their way out they often they go stark mad, resorting to bashing their skulls against rocks or throwing themselves of a cliff. Or they try to sleep. Leaving all that loot for Baldin. Light is a marvelous thing.",0
"Prompt: `` Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am ... '' Story: Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am. But I'm here. Unfortunately, I am still here. A shell of a human being. A painting of modest beauty but exquisite detail. Inside, however, lies a drawing soaked in black ink and torn to shreds. There's no beauty in such a world anymore. Just emptiness. Days upon days of gut wrentching emptiness and the sharp teeth of loneliness tearing away at your heels. > Torment; noun 1. Severe physical or mental suffering And then you're presented with it. An escape. The smallest glint of light. You can practically feel the relief, the though of it making you happier than anything perhaps ever has. Your whole body tingles at the idea, fear and excitement clouding your desperate mind. If you had a cavity, you would want a dentist to remove it, would you not? It's been bothering you for weeks now, your teeth in more pain than they've ever been before. You can't eat you favorite things, you can't do any sports, you can hardly talk its so incredibly sore. The only thing on your mind is the pain. The constant never ending pain. How are you supposed to focus on anything with your jaw throbbing like this? It's impossible. But lucky you, there's a solution. A silver dentist with a loud booming voice, promising you to completely rid yourself of your nasty toothache. *By god*, you'll think, *this has gone on too long. But is this going to hurt? * ""Not a bit,"" The dentist reassures you with his smoky breathe, extending his metal hand, ""It's quick and easy, you wont feel a thing."" ""Yes sir, but what if I feel nothing at all?"" ""Than at least its better than what you felt before."" I nod and give his rigid hand a hard tug.",0
"Prompt: Everyone in the world has magic with various levels of mastery over it. You are extremely powerful with almost no control so you find a demon that 's very weak but extremely good at controlling his powers. Story: ""Imagine you're in a field."" Green extends in all directions. ""You're alone, the earth is flat, and the blue sky touches the horizon."" Blue shoots from the ground, arcing overhead. ""The sun appears, tiny in the sky."" There's a bright light, rays casting shadow behind me. ""What color is it?"" ""Yellow."" It burns so brightly, winking playfully. ""Good."" She licks her chapped lips, the sound distorting my tiny sun's light. ""Look ahead of you. There's a sheep."" Something soft and downy wanders across the green, its shadow stretching far beyond the horizon. ""What color is it?"" My brows crease. ""Uh-"" ""What color is it?"" The green wavers. Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? ""Uh."" Mary had a little lamb, its fleece as white as snow. ""Um."" The sheep wavers, cotton fuzz shifting from dark to bright as its shadows remain inky. ""What color is the sheep, Jess?"" Black and white race across downy fluff, one after the other, again and again. ""Um."" I see the black sheep, blending into its shadow. ""Um."" In the same blink of an eye, that sheep is white and contrasted against the verdant grass. The term verdant applies here because I'm in the countryside, you see. ""Jess?"" If I were in a park in the city, it would probably not be verdant, because the term approximates the countryside. But I suppose one could argue a well-tended city garden could be very similar to rough rural hills, provided there's adequate insulation from all the racket of urban life. ""*Jess! *"" You couldn't have a sheep in the city, no matter how well you tend your garden. It would have to eat too much, and poop too much, and cities produce so much waste as is so really you'd be doing a disservice to the environment if you pulled livestock into a concrete jungle where people commute and hail taxis and buy street tacos in their work clothes trying to catch the last train to their office after they overslept by 7 minutes because it was daylight savings' time and they couldn't get out of bed because it was too dark- ""**Jess! **"" -because the clocks shifted back an hour and I think I've been here for an hour at least because my wrists hurt and my fingers are cold and I might have a headache or maybe I've been thinking really hard sometimes it's hard to tell the difference- ""Look at the sun, Jess."" -between thoughts and headaches because thoughts are thinky and headaches are achey like how your head feels when you look at the sun because it's so damn bright- ""What color is the sun, Jess?"" -and so damn ""yellow"" sitting so damn high and- ""Where is it?"" -mighty in the ""sky"" like a teardrop- ""What color is the sky?"" -rolling ""blue"" down my cheek because I can't- ""Where are you, Jess?"" -go ""home"" because I'm so fucking- ""*Where* are you, Jess?"" ""Hopeless!"" The grass is gone, and with it any sense of calm I've had. I tense, feeling the straps bite my wrists. The more I struggle, the more they hurt, until sweat beads on my brow and my lungs scream. ""No, no, you're okay. You're here, you're okay."" A cool hand braces my forehead, holding me down. Ants chew my skin. ""No!"" My eyes snap open, taking in the broken sink in the corner. Porcelain jagged, water dripping down the wall. We fixed that. Papers litter the floor, turning translucent like fish scales. ""No, no-"" Fish can be freshwater or saltwater, but we drink freshwater. ""Jess, honey, look at me."" The cool hand forces me away from the freshwater fish scales and into a pale face, slit pupils and golden eyes. ""What color is the sun, Jess?"" I shudder, arching my back against the steel table I'm bound to. In that moment, I'm back in the ruins of Rashelle's basement. In that moment, I'm listening to the water bubble in the walls and the gas stream through pipe. Her face hovers over me, aquiline nose sloping up to those stony eyes. ""The sun, Jess."" Blue tears roll down my cheeks as I fall into those eyes, surrounded by burnt gold. ""Yellow.""",0
"Prompt: Berlin, 1943. You 're a Jew who has been successfully keeping a low profile while working as a clerk under the 3rd Reich. You just found out you 've won a contest to spend the day with the Führer. Story: I let myself in, hair wet and heart drained, hand clutching the announcement slip. ""Oh wow, Adeline, I would be honoured to be in your position! I mean—"" Claudine, my co-worker had cried when our supervisor had presented me with the announcement slip,"" —the Führer? Could it get any better than this?"" *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ Jamie? Are you there? Oh where are—ah there you are! Come, come— “ “ Ugh mom, you're soaked! Lem me go! ” I unloaded my things on to the table, but the sheets that were wrapped around me wouldn't drop. “ Oh, wow Mom! You're going to meet him! HIM! ” Jamie had snatched up the slip and had scanned through it at a speed far surprising the normal 7-year-old reading speed. Before I could react, he was prancing around the living room, hopping from sofa to ground and back again. Sometimes I don't know whether to be proud of him, knowing that he'll never spread his wings under the red swastika. *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ Yes dear, maybe I will— “ “ Maybe? No maybes! You're gon na! We're gon na be famous! ” He didn't know. All I could do was to feign a smile like a slap-on sticker. Underneath, the dismay was ripping me apart. *How about running away? * *Too many questions, too many traces. * *How about pretending that you aren't who you are? * *The document check, they'll find out sooner or later. * I slid onto the recliner, burying my head into my hand. And everything was going so well, keeping my head down and out of the spotlight. *How about Jamie? * I looked up at him. He was still oblivious to my dilemma, giggling away and waving the paper around like a trophy. I'm going to tell everybody! Ruth and Erik from school — There he was, the perfect Aryan. Shimmering golden hair, blueish eyes and pale complexion, his cheeks flushed from hopping around. *Pitter patter, pitter patter* *Perhaps…* -- -- - “ Here we are, Miss, ” the uniformed chauffeur opened the limousine door, his gloved hand extended towards me. Steadying myself with his outstretched hand, I stepped out on to the gravel pathway. There was a percussive tapping from the drizzle on the black umbrella held overhead. “ Young Sir, here you go, ” Jamie was helped out after me, in his black school jacket and pressed shirt. My little man. We were brought up a flight of stairs and through grand double doors. Jamie's eyes flew left and right, taking in the grandeur of room after room, a level of wealth he had never experienced. A uniformed SS officer sat by a stairwell, peering at us intently through his horn-rimmed glasses. “ Documents please ” I offered my papers and the announcement slip to him. He flipped through the papers lazily. “ Ma'am, you do understand that this is for a single person, yes? ” His eyes were focusing on Jamie, who was still in disbelief that he was this up close with an SS officer. “ Oh Sir, I do understand, but he's such an angel and would absolutely love to meet the Führer in person— “ “ One person only! Can't you read? ” My legs were shaking, palms sweaty, heart palpitating. My hand reached out for Jamie, gripping his shoulder a little too tightly. “ But Sir, please! ” Silence. *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ Well, all right. Papers please. ” Rustling. Pause. More rustling. “ Never left Berlin all your life? ” “ Ja. ” “ Well, Ma'am, I'm sorry for the loss of your husband. He must have faced the enemy gallantly. ” “ Danke, ” In reality, he had been stolen away to one of the camps, back when Jamie was too young to remember. “ You can proceed up the stairs now. You—you be good to your Mom now! ” He ruffled Jamie's hair, a slight smile betraying his thin-lipped demeanour. Smiling broadly, I quickly guided Jamie up the stairs, my hand reaching out for the dark-stained wooden handrail. “ Miss, hold on. ” I almost sank to my knees. He must have realised that it was fake. We're doomed. *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ You forgot your papers. ” -- -- /r/Ziincworks",0
"Prompt: Interrogation LOTR Story: # Of War and Hatred # ""I say we just leave him. He'll get loose in an hour or two, head back to the main band. We're close on their heels anyway, the skirmish today proved it. We don't *need* the information."" Thind patrolled slowly around the dim glow of the campfire, three dirty, cowled faces looking up at him. Laeg pulled the pipe from his mouth as a thick trail of smoke wafted above his head. ""I wouldn't mind killing him-this is a war, after all-but make it quick. I'll do it myself if it makes a difference."" Glan shook his head. ""Like a bound pig for slaughter? Like an animal?"" Laeg puffed on his pipe, and glowered behind its dusky embers. ""We're given it the benefit of the doubt that it isn't one, I say. We can't risk letting it go in any case."" ""A single orc grunt is a serious threat to our security?"" ""A single orc killed Coll, and Rhosg, Maidh."" Thind looked down on the ranger darkly. ""It only takes one. In any case, he's seen our camp, our numbers, our condition. Even if we re-positioned, the risk is too great. He we don't leave him, and we don't let him go."" Glan returned the look. ""So we are discussing his execution? With the possible added incentive of torture?"" Elu shook his head across the fire. ""I do agree that that particular aspect isn't necessary. We'll be on the war band by tomorrow afternoon, there's no need to string him up for an interrogation."" ""Since they're patrol didn't return, they'll be ready for something, someone. Extra vigilant. Killing him without getting something from him is a wasted advantage we can't afford."" ""What you should be asking is can we afford to take this advantage?"" Glan said softly. ""If we do this, we're no different than them. They kill, they pillage, they torture-and we fight them because we believe we deserve better. But if we sink to their level.... then isn't their hate a just recompense?"" ""A strike returned in kind, force for force, is justice, not indulgence."" Glan shook his head. ""You're wrong. Anything more than necessary force *is* indulgence. We defend ourselves. We do not ruin. We do not mutilate."" There was silence around the fire. Then Laeg stood. ""If you do it, I don't want to know about it. And that's all I have to say."" He turned and walked off into the deepening dusk. ""That's the cowards way, Laeg."" Glan called at his back. Laeg didn't respond, and soon faded between the trees with practiced ease. Thind turned to Elu. ""What do you think?"" Elu stared at the glowing coals of their small fire. ""I think.... I would like to feel good about defending my home. That shouldn't be tainted with shame."" ""I'm sure Naru would say the same."" Glan quickly chimed. Thind glared at him. ""I'm less sure of that, personally. I think Naru would agree with his captain and acquiesce to command perogotive without a debate. But it doesn't matter. I'll withhold final judgement till the morning. Elu will relieve Naru from prisoner watch in three hours time. Glan, you'll take over after him. I'll take the last watch before dawn."" **** In the grey of dawn, Targhed was suddenly awakened by a painful tugging at his ankles. He squealed as he was wanked from his place on the forest floor and suspended above it like a butchered pig. He twisted around until he was faced with one of his captors, the small, ruddy ranger with empty eyes. He casually gripped a small, skinning knife in his right hand. ``'Ello, love."" Targhed said brightly. ""Come to give your regards? I have to say the other boys were a sight more accommodating than this."" ""They'd have me accommodate you further."" Thind replied evenly. ""I want to know what you know. But there's only one way for me to do that. And they're a bit squeamish at the idea."" Targhed pulled his lips back to reveal grey, decaying teeth, and black gums. ""Ye rangers usually are. All that nobility don't mean a pigs bladder when it comes to the dirty work of fightin'."" Thind gave a thin smile. ""No. Not always. You see, they would hold that, if I were to interrogate you.... torture you.... hurt you, that I'd be no better than you."" Targhed shrugged. ""Makes sense to me, far as I can see."" Thind shook his head. ""But it doesn't. Because you're different. You aren't a person, or even an animal when it comes right down to it. You, are war. You, are hate. You are a thing, a feeling, a personification. And the question is not if we'll become like you, but how much we will become like you. How much will you, oh war, taint us?"" Targhed shook his head. ""Fancy words, and purple talk. You don't got it in ye though. You ain't bred for it like we are. You're bred to write them fancy words, drink sweet drinks and-"" His words were cut off by a lightening fast strike that sent him swinging on the tree branch. Targhed spat black blood on the ground, and watched the ranger spin in his vision. ""That ain't gon na convince me you got what it takes."" Thind nodded. ""I know."" **** Yards away, Glan stirred under his blanket, the harsh screech of a bird waking him from a light sleep. He raised his head from the ground in time to see Laeg walking off into the trees, away from their camp. The sound came again, and Glan paled. It was no bird.",0
"Prompt: `` On your right, you 'll see natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters. '' Story: ""On your right, you'll see the natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters."" Marcus muttered into an imaginary microphone as we floated on our shamble of a armored rubber raft, now riddled with darts and primitive arrows. The emergency escape pod suffered severe damage on the drop down to planet side. The light weight and heat resistant alloys made for makeshift armor for ourselves and our rubber survival raft. Our only hope was to get out of the territory of these natives and get to the Federation outpost downriver. The ape-like primitives were much akin to gorillas from earth in terms of survival habits. Building ""nests"" in trees, which were more like tree houses that any kid would want, and not being able to swim and just not liking water in general, getting most of their hydration from native plants and fruits. I was to be conducting studies of the primitives, to see if they were viable to learn, be educated, and introduced to the galactic stage. It was doubtful, as my 2 years spent observing them from the Federation Cruiser, the *Iaculum*, proved they they were essentially at their peak of civilization. My colleague had much less respect for said natives however, making constant jokes of giving the peace presents of bananas. The natives walked the shore, matching the pace of our boat in the current, some carrying spiked clubs made from the tails of some native fauna, some with blow guns, others with crude bows. The small rifle was all we had to defend ourselves, should the currents run us aground.They believed that water was a portal from the land of the dead and the land of the living. Anything from the water was, in their eyes, an undead demon trying to escape. Marcus ducked, but no arrows nor darts made impact, but fear crossed his face for the first time ever since I met him. ""Whats wrong?"" I dared to ask. He quickly raised his hands to me making hushing sounds as he returned to listening to the world around us. He peaked his head back up to see over the plating. ""Ooh, that's not good. Issac, do you hear rushing water?"" ""We're in a boat, I'd be more concerned if there wasn't"", I answered, feeling witty. ""The natives stopped following us, and it sounds like it's getting louder. Oh shitsnaps."" Sudden terror and dread filled me upon realizing what he was blabbering about as the noise grew louder. Waterfall.",0
"Prompt: You have just been sworn in as President, and are being told the truth about alien life ... but it 's incredibly far from what anyone had ever imagined. Story: ""Congratulations, Mr. President."" The President smiled, ""Thank you Rodney."" ""I hope you have enjoyed the celebrations,"" said Rodney, ""and I believe your inaugural speech was a resounding success."" ""I thought so too, it seems we a have some excellent writers working behind the scenes."" ""I couldn't agree more, Mr. President."" The President couldn't help but notice a faint overstepping of honesty in that last comment, but chose instead to ignore it. ""So, what exactly am I expecting in this meeting?"" Rodney shrugged, turning to meet the President's questioning eyes, ""Not much, sir. This meeting is mostly just for show. More of a'get to know you' piece for you and the other leaders of various organisations."" ""The navy, army, air force, CIA, FBI? That sort of crowd?"" ""In a way. It's best for you to come into this with an open mind,"" Rodney said, opening the door to the situation room, ushering the president in before closing the door behind them. Rodney took a deep breath, and began counting to 10. He only got to 3. The piercing guttural scream that filled the room was, Rodney thought, impressive. He hadn't anticipated the President having such a high vocal range, nor powerful lung capacity. He administered the mild sedative that he held at his side, waited as the screams gradually lessened, and graciously caught the president as he slumped from the drugs. Rodney casually carried the body over to, and laid him down on the table, before stepping back to a respectful distance. The Reptilians took over, strapping the newly elected president down to the surgical table and inserting an IV line. Their scale oozed with slime, towering over the prone man on the table. Rodney never liked this part. The president would have to be conscious for the whole procedure; until, of course, consciousness was no longer an option. Forked tongues licked out over their razor pointed teeth, eyes flaring up in anticipation. Groggily, the president return to consciousness, but remained in a semi-dreamlike state. They did not wish him to return to a state of pure thoughtless panic. Distress would make the transition difficult and may cause complications. His eyes fluttered open, fear lingering in them, but detached. Like the fear someone would hold looking over the balcony of a skyscraper from a slightly less than comfortable distance. ""I'm glad you're back with us, Mr. President."" The Reptilians voice was disarmingly human. Only the faintest hiss was evident. ""What are you doing to me?"" He sleepily returned, ""I demand an explanation."" The reptilian smiled, all razor teeth and glistening saliva. ""We're using you. I believe that is the nicest way to put it."" ""Using me? How? I won't stand for this."" Something akin to a laugh spilled from the reptile. ""You won't have to stand for anything. You won't be doing anything. We shall be using you in the most literal sense."" It leaned in closer, smile widening, ""You are nothing but a puppet, Mr. President. Your body shall be the physical extension of our will."" ""What?!"" The fear rose in the presidents body, heart rate rising, pounding in his chest. Another reptilian adjusted the flow of drugs, and his heart-rate stabilised. ""Why are you doing this?"" He whispered. ""We have always done this. You think that you humans are capable of running your own lives? Throwing away your freedoms to a popularity contest? You thought democracy was a stable, representative, logical form of government? Change does not create stability. Stability comes from control. And control comes from the outside. We come from the outside. The rest of your race thinks they can make a difference, have a vote. And they can, by all means. The election itself is not rigged. Only you, Mr. President. We rig the president."" The whirring if a drill shrilled into the air, the presidents head clamped down against the table. He moved to struggle, but found no way out and no desire to escape. Apathy overran his senses. ""Your race has been a potential threat to every other life-form it comes across. So we must control you. Passive destruction has been determined as the best possible outcome. You will destroy yourselves, and eventually the planet will recover."" The drill-bit dug into the bone at the back of the Presidents skull, grinding and tearing at the bone. It was at this point that the drugs could no longer hold back the screams. They flooded the room, breath tearing from the presidents lungs until he could get no more. The presidents eyes began to glaze over and roll back as he lapsed from consciousness. ""Goodbye, Mr. President.""",0
"Prompt: Killing another human now allows you to exchange your remaining lifespan the victim 's. Young people live in fear while the elderly plan their attacks. Story: ""Happy birthday dear Gertrude, happy birthday to you!"" The chorus rang out, prompting a ruckus of claps and cheers from the crowd of onlookers. We were gathered around an immense circular table, at least twenty feet across by my best guess. Atop this table sat a cake, a cake altogether too large to be allowed. It was hard to look at, not because of the size, but because of the thousands upon thousands of candles it supported. The tiny flame of each candle melded together in my eyes to create an inferno of magnificence only worthy of my favorite grandmother's birthday. ""Well blow them out then, and make a wish!"" Someone shouted, getting a collective laugh from the room. ""I'm going to need a little help"" My grandmother said with a wide smile. Everyone inched in a little closer and began blowing the candles out, ten or twenty at a time, until the last one was extinguished by my grandmother herself. ""What did you wish for?"" uncle Elmer asked. ""You know I can't tell!"" replied Grandma. A few moments later, after the excitement settled, we moved on to presents. She received the things you come to expect after so many birthdays; jewelry, delicious foods, tickets to an upcoming symphony and the like. She was grateful for it all, but none so much as the last gift she opened. My grandfather had slipped out of the room during the commotion, and reappeared pushing a large decorated box on four wheels. ""Darling, what have you gotten me this year?"" My grandmother asked, shooting him a skeptical look. ""Oh this? It's just something I picked up last minute"" He replied, with a sly smile. My grandmother got up from her chair and moved as best she could over to the box. She lifted the lid just a few inches and peered inside. A toothy grin spread across her wrinkled face and she flipped the lid off and reached inside. Out she pulled an infant child, no older than a few weeks, and shouted ""babies!"". The room erupted with a cheer and everyone came closer to catch a glimpse. ""Gary, you shouldn't have!"" Shouted Grandmother. ""How could you afford so many?"" Uncle Elmer asked. ""Just had to move some things around is all"" Grandpa said with a wink. Just then, grandmother spoke up, gaining the attention of the room. ""Everybody get's one, I won't hog these all to myself, isn't proper!"" Excitedly, My Grandfather began passing infants around the room. Finally, when everyone had their hands on one, then I said ""Alright grandma, you first! It's your birthday after all!"". The room grew quiet as she lifted the baby above her head with both hands. She looked around the room at all of us, drinking in the moment, and then spiked the baby to ground. She had sparked something in all of us with her intensity, and everyone began spiking their babies to the ground, one by one, with thuds and splatters and sequels. Just a moment later and the violence was over. Everyone laughed and hugged and joked, and everyone felt a little younger.",0
"Prompt: In a post apocalyptic world, a group of humans follow the wise words of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball Story: KLATTA, KLATTA, KLATTA! Thus was our decree. I watched as our leader, Mervyn, placed the scuffed, black orb of truth - lovingly called MMate, into it's hand-crafted leather carrying pouch. Merv, with his dainty soul-patch of red, and a barren face beside (he couldn't grow much more, to his chagrin) peered toward our group of seven. ""Fellows,"" he called above the harsh winds of the frozen Ancient Jersey Highlands, ""long have we wandered, taking heed of MMate, our savoir. Our guide."" With bated breath we watched, Mervyn's comb-over wafting about his dry, flaking scalp. ""Today is the day long awaited. Today,"" he said with pride,"" we have found our homeland which MMate has given unto us!"" ""Merv,"" called Quinten, our cartographer, from the back, ""according to my calculations, we're in an area that was once known as Knee-Wark."" There was a nervous shift in our small crowd. Murmurs of dissent! ""Fear not, my friends!"" Said Mervyn, ""MMate would not lead us astray. We are destined to make our lives here in this place."" ""Yeah, but isn't this where the ancients began their war?"" Asked Blandie, our chef. ""That's correct,"" said Quinten scowling at Mervyn, ""this is where the atomics were first used. Where the land itself was said to spit fire at any who would dare to set foot on it's lands."" There was silence but for the wind. ""Lem me see MMate, Mervyn,"" said Quentin, moving forward with his arms outstretched. Mervyn cupped the leather parcel to his breast and said, ""No!"" before dashing off down the hill upon which we stood, watching, mouths agape. Quentin watched, wary of the scorched land below. We watched Mervyn as he hopped over a small glowing brook and held MMate aloft, shaking the orb as he so often did when consulting our savior. He paused. He shook it again. A scream of rage echoed from below, like a beast woken from slumber to a den filled not with food for winter, but something that's not particularly useful, like someone had replaced the beast's food with twigs and old newspapers. Mervyn dashed off again, holding MMate above his head. BOOM. A pillar of purple flame engulfed our leader, engulfed our savoir. Mervyn's charred form slumped to the ground with a light whump and a cloud of debris. MMate was soaring through the air, back toward us from the force of the explosion. Quentin caught it and peered into the coveted window. The orbs plastics had melted leaving a final message for our frightened band. It read: ""Outlook not so good.""",0
"Prompt: the monster in the closet finally lures the child into the darkness, only to realize something is very very wrong Story: I hate darkness now, but it wasn't always like this. Not by a long chalk. I remember when I ruled the night! I was an emotional vampire, drinking the fear of others and gaining vitality from their terror. I ventured into the black with impunity, and the sight of me was enough to cause grown men to wet themselves and cry for their parents. Back in those days, the God-botherers did most of my work for me. All I had to do was turn up. Now I'm trapped in a closet, too weak to escape. I can feel myself shrinking, fading, turning into nothing more than a vague memory. And it's all because of little Sybil Terpsichore. I should have known that it was a mistake to come here. To be honest, things had been getting progressively more difficult out there, ever since those accursed computers became widespread. It was bad enough in the 1980s, when the movie industry began raiding the collective unconscious for symbols of primal fear to turn into popcorn movies for teens. They stole our gimmicks and turned them into ironic jokes, and left us with nothing. Many of us faded away, and those that survived only did so because they focused on more vulnerable targets: children and the elderly. I picked the kids, because I figured that their fear is more fundamental, and they are easier to manipulate. Until Sybil Terpsichore, I used to still be able to hear a couple of my colleagues who went the other way. They haunted the airwaves with their polemics on immigration, terrorists, FEMA camps and the like, and scare the bejeezus out of the less discerning oldies. I wonder if any of them are still out there. I had been getting the brush-off from so many kids, dehumanised by open access to the kind of horrors that humanity inflicts on one another - far more bone-chilling than anything we might dream up - and I thought that finding some remote location, off the grid, might dig up some suitably sheltered souls to freak out. Hence this farmhouse, and the Terpsichores. Margaret and Howard Terpsichore moved in to this ramshackle old place in 2004 after Margaret's father passed on and left it to her in his will. They got to grips with managing the sizable plot of land that came with the property, and they soon had a child, Sybil. When I arrived, I was drawn by Sybil's reedy little voice from her bedroom window, singing some kind of nursery rhyme probably sung to her by her mother. Paydirt! I waited until she slept, and took up residence in the closet amongst her toys. She didn't appear to be having any nightmares, which was surprising to me. My aura tended to induce them back in the old days, which was always good for a bit of latent fear to snack on. I was hungry, but I could wait. I needed to get to know her, find out the best way to approach and maximize the effect. That morning, I followed her around the house. She made herself some breakfast and went outside to run around in the cornfield. I wondered if she was just independent for her age, or if she just had lazy parents? I thought it best to investigate further. Bad idea. I entered the master bedroom and found Margaret first, then Howard. Both were long dead - Margaret had been poisoned, apparently by Howard. Howard was less intact, having been shot in the face, then mutilated. I couldn't move without finding a new bit of Howard. ""What are you doing here?"" It was Sybil. She must had been watching me for the last few minutes. ""FEAR ME LITTLE GIRL! I AM YOUR worst nightm-"" ""No you're not. You are my new friend!"" She offered me nothing, not fear, not anxiety, not even a little nervousness. I began to get afraid now. ""I AM NOBODY'S FRIEND! I RULE THE NIGHT!"" My voice was too shrill. ""Well, it's not dark yet"", Sybil responded flatly. ""Come back and try again later."" And that was that. I slunk off into the closet, utterly defeated, too weak to flee elsewhere. Sybil went downstairs to make herself some more food, and I waited for her to go to bed, even though I knew it was futile. I tried, did all the big voice and the gruesome shapes. She just giggled and called me ""silly"". I, who had actually caused kings to die of fright, was now ""silly"". I gave up at that point. Now I lie here, frightened and alone. Irony.",0
"Prompt: Most of the Milky Way galaxy is ruled by an interstellar empire, populated by hundreds of alien races. The species of the ruling monarch keeps changing; once they die, the emperor is reborn as a member of one of the many races. You 're the first human-reincarnation of this ruler. Story: The years before ascension are always my favorite, born with all the knowledge of my past incarnations there was really no need for me to ""grow up"" or be educated in the nuances of galactic rule, but long ago I decreed that each of my reincarnations must be allowed to grow to the age of majority before taking the throne. Death has not terrified me for many mellinia, each passing brings new possibilities, and a welcome break from my galactic responsibility for a few years. I do not know the mechanism by which my reincarnation is chosen, many theories abound, some species have been blessed a half dozen times, others never, and on a rare occasion I am reborn to a race yet to join my Empire, these I relish with great gusto, for it means they will play a pivotal role in the future of my Empire. Most are gifted with advanced technologies or cultures with deep and profound philosophies and art. My first day on Earth, January 1st 2016, was very confusing. Born into a primitive backwater, the people were vastly different from what I had come to expect from new entrants to my Empire. They had barely reached into space, their planet was divided into hudreds of squabbling groups and their culture was badly in need of development. In time I discovered why, while primitive, weak and Shor lived, these humans had a thirst for knowledge, a passion for exploration and had developed their technological prowess with amazing speed. They were fighters who found victory against overwhelming odds time and again, created inspiring art, music and stories. I grew up in a place called Florida, learned to enjoy the long hot summers, mild winters and the amazing variety of scantily clad women the white sand beaches attracted year round. 18 years in this primitive paradise and I found myself sad when the Imperial Dreadnought appeared in orbit, eclipsing the moon to announce to my newest subjects their ascension into the galactic Empire. I will miss this pale blue dot, but the Empire can wait no longer.",0
"Prompt: A father sheds tears of joy with his wife in the hospital as they greet their newborn child together. As his wife rests peacefully, the happy father cradles his baby and pens a suicide note. Story: I'm not fine. I lie all the time. I lie to my wife, to my friends, my family. I lie to myself sometimes. I'm not fine. I will never be fine. I've tried. Everything. Pills, walking, exercise… anything to take me out of myself for a while. It never works. It doesn't matter. My existence is a mental anaesthetic. Emotional frostbite; far past the point of pain. Nothing is better than this. Nothing is better than lying every time you tell your wife you love her. Nothing is better than experiencing atrocities and feeling about them the same way that you do when you hold your first born child in your arms. So I choose nothing. Maybe one day your heart will be broken, and maybe one day you'll break hearts. You'll say: ""It's not you, it's me."" Maybe one day you'll understand what I mean when I say this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with me; I don't know, can't know, and certainly won't know. I hope, in this moment, that one day you'll understand. It will mean that you're not like me. It will mean that you'll have inside you what I'm missing. I don't even know what that is. I know that I'm broken. I thought you could fix me. That was selfish, I guess. I just wanted to one day tell someone that I'm fine and have it be the truth. You're going to have a hard time growing up. I don't know if your mother will do well. I'm probably placing a huge burden on you, and I know I am on her. I'm sorry. To both of you. What I do know is that I'm out of strength. I've fought for so long, lied to myself for so long that I'm out of strength. I'm using the last bit that I have to write this because you deserve it. You deserve what I can't give. You deserve to know that your father fought. I've always fought. For others. For my parents, my friends, my wife. Today though, I choose myself. I can't fight anymore, not even for you. I would love you, if I could. I would love her. I would be happy. I would stop lying, be fine and live a fulfilling life. I tried to love you. I held you, tiny and helpless, asleep in my arms. I couldn't do it though. I could never be the person who brought you up, I'm not strong enough for that, not good enough. I've never been good enough. I thought I could be for you. I couldn't be for me, or for her. I tried, I really tried. She told me I was good enough, that I'd always been good enough, that she loved me. I told her I loved her too. I wish I could love her, or anyone. I wish I could love you. When you finally read this, I'll have been gone a long time, you'll be all grown up and I'll have my nothing. Please don't mourn for me. I'm fine.",0
"Prompt: Mulder and Scully stumble onto the grounds of Hogwarts; the only problem is Scully does not see everything Mulder does .... Story: ""What are we even doing in Britain, Mulder? We work for the FBI, not Interpol."" ""Scully, you know what I've been finding out about the depth of the U.S. government conspiracy. I just wanted to get away from it all for a bit. Though not away from work: I've heard about some interesting cryptid sightings in this area."" ""What's a cryptid?"" ""For someone who spends your time investigating unexplained phenomena, you're *really* behind on the terminology. A cryptid is a creature of which sightings have been reported, but there's been no conclusive evidence. Like Bigfoot."" ""So basically something that doesn't exist?"" ""Scully, you've seen the evidence of supernatural creatures hundreds, thousands of times. You don't have faith in science; you have faith in skepticism."" ""Whatever, Mulder. So which cryptid are we trying to find?"" ""We're in Scotland."" ""Seriously, Mulder? The Loch Ness monster? Didn't someone admit to faking those photos?"" ""You don't know what kind of pressure the goverment put on him to make him admit that."" ""Anyway, we seem to have gone astray. I'm pretty sure that this lake is not Loch Ness."" ""Then what's that thing?"" ""What thing? Holy shit, Mulder, is that a giant tentacle? I'm pretty sure that the Loch Ness monster doesn't have tentacles..."" ""It kind of looks like it might be part of a giant squid."" ""Giant squids live in the ocean. Not in lakes, especially fresh water ones."" ""Either way, you have to admit that it's evidence that something weird's afoot, Scully. I don't know what yet. Maybe there's been nuclear dumping causing mutation of all creatures in the lake. Or maybe it's a creature from another world."" ""That seems like a bit of a leap from one tentacle.""",0
"Prompt: Heaven is real, but is an expansive living area divided into communities based on how the inhabitants died. Story: I need to get home. Strangely enough, I felt aches and pains everywhere - but there wasn't a single visible bruise. This line needs to hurry up.... wait, what was I waiting for again? A bored looking young man jotted down notes. Everything was a bit surreal. I knew I was in some sort of enclosed space, but I couldn't see any walls. The floor beneath me felt like it could sink any moment and that notion didn't scare me at all. Bits of conversation faded in and out around me. ""-driving down one of those old roads, cow comes trotting into my lane like some fucking idiot..."" ""son's okay, but he's going to be upset about it..."" It all seemed so natural, but something begged my attention. I didn't remember anything. Finally my turn came, for whatever it was. A bored old man stared up at me, ""Name?"" I panicked. Name. Goddamn it what is my name? ``.... Let me check the files."" A paper appeared out of thin air, ""Lydia Andrews. Age 18. Hm.... Interesting. You know how you died?"" For some reason, this shocking revelation was old news to me. ""No."" He sighed and rubbed his temples, but chuckled in a disarming fashion. ""Neither do we. Don't worry, it's probably just a filing error. For now we'll send you to Section B13."" The crowd went silent and stared at me. If only I knew why it made so self-conscious. ""Don't let the reincarnated ones scare you. They've been around the block and love freaking out newcomers. It's temporary, we'll get it fixed in no time."" As walked past him.... or through him, I'm not sure. A cat trotted up to me, ""Hey - you compulsively honest or something?"" I tilted my head, and the creature just repeated himself. ""I don't know what you're talking about."" Suddenly he jumped in front of me. ""He asked you how you died. People spend millennia building up their resume, making it look good, and you could have just said you tried to save a bunch of orphans or something. I wish I could have done that!"" Wondering how the cat died, I knelt down and picked him up, placing him on my shoulder. ""What did you do?"" ""I got a little sticker that said:'Roadkill' and was assigned to wander around the car crash dormitory. But hey, I don't envy you - you missed an opportunity like the dumb human you are."" Absentmindedly patting the cat on the head, I phased through a couple of walls. ""You know what Section B13 is about?"" It purred happily, before jumping down to walk beside me. What a strange little cat. ""Don't listen to anyone who says it's temporary. Millions of people die everyday, it's not like anyone's going to care about the one person who got assigned wrong. I think I know of like, one girl who got moved. And that was because someone found out that she was serial killer who stole the resume of a doctor."" The cat continued, ""Anyways, Section B13 is filled with all sorts of people. Mainly those who died from bizarre accidents. It's cold and dark and the electricity is terrible. No one there minds though, they spend most of their time so high that they could relive their deaths and laugh about it.""",0
"Prompt: Can you write a dialog that does n't suck where every line is a question? Story: ""Did you see where I left the transmogrifier?"" ""The what?"" ""The transmogrifier, remember?""

""Dude, do you ever listen to me?"" ""Do you ever say shit worth me listening to?"" ""Why am I even bothering?"" ""Dunno.... Because you lack a grasp on reality perhaps?"" ""You're wanting me to take your teeth home as a souvenir, don't you?"" ""Oooh.... That one pissed you off, didn't it?"" ""Do you want me to beat your ass right now?"" ""Do you have the balls to try?"" ""Where's my fucking transmogrifier at you prick?!"" ""Jeez, we're back to this?"" ""Why can't you ever just answer my questions?"" ""Why should I?""

"Prompt: You 're a successful womanizer and across the room you see a beautiful yet disinterested woman who you must have. Story: Quietly slipping my ring into my pocket, I pushed myself against the ominously large wooden doorway of the newly-opened bar. I found myself exerting more force than I'd anticipated, as though the entrance itself wanted nothing to do with me. That'd make two of us, then - though I didn't pause and consider the meaning of this or anything pretentious like that. I was here for fun, not philosophy. And so, I threw the doorway open and quickly slipped in before it had the chance to shut on me. My eyes had trouble adjusting to the light. It was late, making the contrast between outside and here the same as night and day. A single, bulky television set hung above the bar tables, providing a constant stream of football. ""Monday Night Football"".... then, it was Monday. I'd always had trouble keeping up with dates. They were never really my thing. After a quick glance at the screen I diverted my gaze to the stage. A small band, seemingly local, was providing gentle ambient music to the scene. Was this jazz or country...? I didn't even consider it could be possible for music to be so ambiguous genre-wise. A quick glance was all I needed there as well. I slipped my hand into my pocket and checked my ring, just in case. Of course it was still there, and quickly I'd realized that I'd been standing about at the entrance for a minute or two. I quickly made my way towards the nearest bar counter. ""What'll it be for ya?"" came a voice out of nowhere, even as I sat down. I'd had my eyes on a group of girls towards the stage for a bit and hadn't been paying attention. It was the bartender, of course. A short, stubby little man with a shaved head but by no means a shaved face. I briefly imagined the difficulty he would have drinking from such large mugs without getting his impressively long beard soaked with ale. I almost laughed - what a strange thought. ""Nothin' for me, not yet."" I made sure to say'not yet' so as to avoid being removed from the building. I wouldn't be drinking today, yet I've learned from past experiences to not let anybody involved with the bar know that. Lost me a good catch once that way. Never again. I glanced over in the direction of the little party of cuties hanging out down by the stage. ""But,"" I continued while directing his gaze towards the ladies with my head, ""I'm thinkin' one of those ladies could stand to have a bit more, yeah?"" The bartender - whose nametag, claiming his name to be ""Chuck"", had just caught my eye - tried to cover up a sigh yet failed to do so. Chuck had been mindlessly wiping down the same section of the counter since I'd sat down, clearly expecting something different from myself. Sorry, pal. Can't help myself tonight. My money's just as good as any, though. Chuck gazed over at the girls for far longer than what one would describe as a simple glance. The word ""gaze"" came to mind. Hell, he was looking at them longer than I did. What was he doing? Weighing his options? I couldn't help but lose a little bit of my friendly smile. What's the big deal to you? She's just a girl, and money is money. I'd even pay extra if he resisted. ""They're just here to have some fun, sir,"" he politely noted. ""See the one on the left? Just turned twenty-one today. Came here with her friends on a whim. I wouldn't want to invade on that if I were you, sir."" ""Ah, so, first time to a bar huh? Well, y'know, legally anyways. Quite a looker, that one - I'd say she's no first-timer to bars."" I rambled on, still staring at the lady he'd pointed out to me. She was the one, no doubt. He'd even been nice enough to give me some details on her, though he certainly didn't mean it that way. ""Girl's got a lot goin' for her though, for sure. Looks like a real animal, yeah? Wouldn't even be shocked to hear she could drink more than me! One drink'll do her no harm, I think. Three drinks'd be nice and safe for her, even."" ""Sir, I don't think.... I'm not in any position to tell these things myself. I assure you that the drink itself is not the problem. It's just-"" Words came out of my mouth before he even finished his sentence. ""Eh? No problem, you say? C'mon then, one little drink. I'll pay extra, I will. She'll be nice and safe, won't do any harm to her. She's got all her friends to back her up, too."" I stopped looking at the girls and focused on the bartender, who was shaping up to be my biggest obstacle between me and the girl. Morality is admirable, sure, but what's he think I'm going to do to the girl? Never anything without consent. He followed suit, now looking directly at me, yet still wiping down that same part of the counter. It almost seemed like he was pressing down far harder than he'd been earlier, though it could just be me. After a moment though, and to my utmost surprise, he stopped wiping and placed the rag down. ""Sir,"" he began with a sigh, ""do you know where you are?"" His eyes held no hint of sarcasm or insincerity. Suddenly, the atmosphere became extremely uncomfortable, even for myself. I couldn't help but fidget ever so slightly in my seat. ""I can't say I do, not specifically anyways. Just know it's a bar. That not good enough?"" ""I'm sorry sir, but not quite good enough. I'm Chuck. The owner of this bar, Chuck's Tavern."" He stood up straight now, making him quite a bit taller than me, as I remained seated and heavily slouched against the low counters. ""I don't appreciate people like you coming into my property and treating it like some sort of brothel, you hear me?"" His voice was heavy. Heavy in that it almost made me shake, and heavy in that it was shockingly loud and focused on myself. I glanced quickly over towards the stage to see that what I'd feared had been true - the girls had heard the commotion and had fixed their eyes on myself and Chuck. I shrugged, trying to take control of the situation, but I knew my mission was going south quickly. Mindlessly checking my pockets, I grabbed my ring to ensure it was safe. At least I've still got this, I thought, before swiveling on my stool back to face Chuck. ""Gotcha Chuck, no harm meant here, just wanted to see those girls faces when they'd gotten a gift from a nice stranger like myself, nothin' more, I swear. If ya still think that not true, though, I could settle for a nice drink myself, no need for nothin' more than that. Pay you for your troubles n' all."" As the words flowed gracefully out of my mouth, I felt like the smoothest man to walk the Earth. Towards the back, a few giggles came up - some, I thought, even came from the ladies watching me at the stage. Chuck looked at me in such a way that I swear I'd been interrogated, switching from eye to eye and squinting a little bit more each second. I felt the tension grow, even after I'd attempted to diffuse the situation. I wondered to myself why I didn't just get up and leave at that point. I would imagine that the eternity I felt his eyes on me was not an actual eternity, though I wouldn't be surprised if it was close, though at some point he did lift his heavy gaze off of me and go back to wiping down the counter. Never thought I would've missed seeing him do that. ""Alright, sir. It's not a problem. What'll it be for you?"" he asked, with a hint of a smile that could either be entirely real or entirely fake. ""Get me a Black Velvet, would you?"" I asked as politely as I could. Bringing back Chuck's wrath was something I wasn't ready to do. ""Of course, sir. One moment."" I was glad he knew what I'd ordered. For a moment I considered he may not understand, and might've thought I was trying to make a fool out of him. Despite his strong sense of morality, the guy seems to know what he's doing, I thought. Perhaps we'll even be able to put this behind us, and maybe I'll come back again in the future. Just for drinks, of course. Suddenly, however, the relative silence and tranquility of the post-war bar scene was interrupted by Chuck's yelling voice. ""Sharla! Where'd you put all the damn champagne!?"" I hadn't noticed anybody else working at the bar at that time. There were very few people - in fact, aside from the group of ladies, there may very well have been less than three other individuals present. Turning around in confusion, I searched for this Sharla.... .... when I saw the same lady I'd eyed up earlier speak up. Or, rather, shout. ""Dad, I already told you I'd moved it to the very back of the storage room!"" I may not be the brightest individual, but the moment she began to speak I realized my mistake. The revelation hit me full force. I'd never been punched before, not square in the face, but that's the only comparison I could possibly make. I tried to take home the owner's daughter. ""Thank you, sweetie!"" shouted Chuck back, as he turned to me and announced he'd be right back with my drink. I simply sat there, stunned. It might've just been my imagination, but it seemed like the smile he gave me before leaving to get the goods was one made not of friendliness but of malevolence. He knew I'd embarrassed myself, even if nobody else knew what happened. Well, that's fine. I'll admit I should've seen it coming. The music died down in the bar as the local band left the stage, the last performance of the night. The soft lighting grew dimmer and dimmer to warn customers of the bar's upcoming closing time. Football was over, the single television hanging above the bar counter blinked off. And when Chuck, the family-friendly owner and bartender of the newly opened Chuck's Tavern, returned to deliver my drink.... I had already left, ring in pocket, entirely defeated.",0
"Prompt: The world 's best hitman prepares to kill the world 's luckiest man. Story: Sorry I'm late to the party and I'm not a writer. I decided to post this story anyway. I hope you enjoy it. After the assassination of the Prime Minister things really started looking up for me. The CIA essentially had me on speed dial. Drug smugglers, politicians, corporate executives. No one was safe. No agency, big or small could keep a target alive. I was convinced of that. When the lone survivor of United 215 was able to speak again, people were ready to listen. Questioned erupted throughout the world. How did he survive? What exactly happened? Eight hundred fifty-three passengers were on that Airbus A380 when it erupted into flames mid air. Soaring to the ground like an exhausted phoenix. The timing of the crash was impeccable. The FAA was conducting their annual commercial airline safety summit a few weeks after the crash. The survivor was invited to speak before congress about his traumatic experience. That's when I got the call from Langley. After following my target for a few days, I concluded this would be my most dangerous mission yet. Getting away with murder in New York City is no easy task. It had to be quick. When I saw him step out of his Gramercy apartment I knew the clock was ticking. I approached him at the crosswalk. His coffee still steaming out of his ""my other computer is a data center"" mug. Our eyes met for only a second. He smiled, greeted me and then collapsed. No one had noticed the hydra-shok round that just pierced his heart. People everywhere rushed over to provide aid. I continued on. I removed my trench coat and handed it to a homeless man. ""Thank you, miss! God bless!"" Everyone deserves a little kindness. Life in America is hard. ________________________________________________________________ ""Listen to this shit. He told me this story yesterday and it's nuts!"" ""So I'm standing on the corner going to work. Just minding my own business. When this guy next to me just collapses. I look to help him immediately since I'm right next to him. Then I noticed this guy is pouring blood from his chest. Turns out it was a bullet wound. Someone had just shot him. ""That's fucking crazy!"" ""Right!? Tell him the craziest part."" ""oh yeah.... I was so distracted by the pool of blood that was pouring out of his chest that I didn't really get a chance to get a good look at him...."" ``....when I finally looked at his face. I realized that he was my doppelganger.""",0
"Prompt: Humanity has achieved immortality. Due to resource concerns everyone must submit to a council their chosen manner of death at 150. The more amusing the death the longer the council lets you live. Story: Don't bother reading this, it's got a major logical flaw that I didn't realize until the end. I just don't want to throw away what I've written. _____________________________________ ""She's done it. By God, she's beaten us at our own game."" Councilwoman Thursday grinned. ""Oh, that's clever. That's *very* clever."" ""This is serious, Thursay,"" Friday scolded, ""We have to decide a course of action."" ""You know the course of action, Friday,"" said Monday, ""We must give her a seat on the Council."" ""This could mean the *collapse* of the Council."" Thursday rolled her eyes. ""You're being hyperbolic."" ""No, he's not,"" said Saturday, ""This isn't like the last time we added a new member."" Several members of the council quietly chuckled, remembering the man who proposed to be killed in a gladiator style fight-to-the-death in an ice rink against an unending supply of bloodthirsty giraffes. His submission earned him a pardon, and the seat of Sunday on the council. Councilman Tuesday was brooding over the proposal. ""But it isn't really her'death,' per se, that's funny, right?"" Councilman Friday shook his head. ""No. The law dictates that the execution be broadcast to the world for entertainment. She is judged by our prediction of the public's reaction."" Stubborn as always, Tuesday protested. ""Come now, surely she can't dictate the specifications of the broadcast. The condemned can only choose the method of death."" Thursday laughed. ""Oh, I'm sure there's a precedent for it. Secretary, can you check that for us?"" The Secretary nodded. ""She's trying to subvert the rules,"" said Wednesday, ""Just take out the broadcasting bit and give her 50 years."" Friday sighed. ""We can't. Not unless the request is impossible for the Council to arrange."" ""But-"" ""No but's,"" said Monday, ""Fair is fair."" ""But she *cheated*. We can't allow that to go unpunished."" ""Wednesday, finding a loophole isn't cheating."" Thursday chuckled. ""Quite the opposite, it's an expression of supreme admiration for the rules."" The Secretary cleared his throat. ""If it would please the Council..."" Friday gestured for him to continue. ""In the case of Gabriel Marquet, the condemned was executed by having his skull injected with an explosive fluid and then detonated. He requested that it be broadcast in'slow motion,' which the Council interpreted as 50 % speed, and this was granted."" ""Dammit,"" muttered Tuesday. ""What are we supposed to do, then?"" Thursday turned to Sunday. ""Thoughts, Sunny?"" ""I told you not to call me that,"" Sunday said, ""And you all know how much it pains me to say this, but I agree with Thursday. The only solution is to grant her a seat on the Council."" He turned to Wednesday. ""I'm sorry, but we are left with no alternative."" ""Hey, I got no problem with retirement,"" she said, ""What pisses me off is what this girl is doing to get a seat."" Thursday cheerfully sprang out of her seat. ""I move to grant this woman the seat of Wednesday on the Council."" ""Seconded,"" said Monday. Thursday began to take the vote. ""Monday, how do you vote?"" ""Yea."" ""Tuesday, how do you vote?"" ""Nay."" ""Wednesday?"" ""Nay."" ""Thurs- um, Yea."" ""Friday?"" Friday sighed. ""We're going to have to forbid this sort of thing in the future. Yea."" ""Saturday?"" ""Nay."" ""Sunday?"" ""Yea."" ""By a vote of four to three, Elizabeth Navarro will assume the seat of Wednesday on the Council, for her ingenious execution proposal. Secretary?"" The Secretary excused himself to bring in the new member. ""I guess it was inevitable,"" the former Wednesday said, ""I admit, it was pretty clever, if more than a bit underhanded. The method of death was nothing special, but speeding it up and playing Yakety Sax in the background..."" Thursday nodded. ""If we actually gave her 50 years and then executed her, the broadcast would have warranted an extra 20.""",0
"Prompt: `` For what it 's worth ... I 've always loved you. '' Story: As the raindrops rolled down my face, mixing with the single, solitary tear I had been unable to contain, all I could think about was how it had come to this? My mind's eye stared back over the years we had known each other, two people brought together beyond all reason or chance, to create the most powerful combination of thoughts and feelings that either of us had experienced in our lives. We'd been such strong friends for so long, both forbidding ourselves from acting on the thought that if we were truly together, we could have something beyond beautiful. She was my angel, and I her rock. Right now that sweet summer where we finally took the leap of faith and admitted our love seemed so long ago. I looked in her eyes that once had been filled with such hope, but now in those hazel depths all I could see was sadness. ""Why? Why like this? Why couldn't we make it work?"" I shook my head, trying to find the words to fill the void that question left. ""Life is cruel. It's thrown us on to different paths. I wish this wasn't goodbye."" Her hand found mine, and squeezed tightly. ""I'm a better person because of you. I've struggled so long to accept who I am, but you were the one person who always accepted me, no matter what."" ""I've given you everything I am. From the moment I first saw you, in that forest, so many years ago, I was yours. For what it's worth.... I've always loved you."" She turned away slowly, and began to walk away for the final time. As she glanced back timidly, ours eyes met once more. ""It's worth everything, I'm so sorry that wasn't enough.""",0
"Prompt: You pray to God, wishing that you will get a boyfriend/girlfriend before you die. He gives you immortality. Story: I went to church the first time last week. My grandma had tugged my arm and dragged me into her car with a promise of a ""restaurant breakfast,"" and before I knew it, in my morning grogginess I was greeted with pews and angry hushes. I had shot her an angry look, at which she swatted my hand. I never liked church. I never prayed. But maybe it was the environment, no, who am I kidding, it was my Grandma's powerful presence, or maybe the fact that I accidentally spilled coffee into my crush's locker, another no-go to join the other past 30 crushes, that made me bow down. And then, I wished something that I would regret. ""God, before I die could I just have one girlfriend? One?"" ""And that's when you stopped being able to die?"" Dr. Martinez said flatly, shooting me an incredulous look. I look up at her from my hospital cot. ""Well I've shot myself, I've electricuted myself, I've hanged myself, I gave myself carbon monoxide poisoning, and I overdosed."" ""I see, so you have been trying for a while."" ""Well I did those in my garage last Tuesday night actually."" ""Ah."" She's not bad. Long blond hair with grey eyes that flashed in the light. Assertive too. ""So how do you want me to help you?"" ""Go on a date with me?"" ""Is that your approach?"" she said, her expression unchanged. ""Uh - I think you're pretty?"" ""That's it?"" ""I happen to make good omlettes, so I'd probably be a good quality -"" ""I think I'm going to stop you there."" I frowned. ""Ok."" ""Maybe you need to meet someone at your level. Because obviously you don't know what you are doing with that approach."" She sat straighter in her chair. ""I have another patient with the same ""relationship"" issue, and while she's been learning techniques to improve her relationships, she is still needing someone to interact with. Perhaps you two could go practice, and go on some dates?"" ""Is she pretty?"" ""And, we'll stop there.""",0
"Prompt: You are sentenced to serve a prison term of 254 years. You actually serve 254 years. Story: John McMillan was a lucky man. When the trial had first begun, the public wanted his head on a platter. Not that he could blame them-he had caused the city of Chicago more unrest than any one man since Al Capone. But his ill-gotten wealth had bought him good lawyers, and the judge was easily swayed with a few well-placed threats. The death penalty had been negotiated down to 254 years-life, effectively. But the taxpayers would pay for the upkeep of John's aged body, and this gave him a measure of satisfaction. He resigned himself to spending the rest of his waning days in a white-collar prison in rural Illinois, with regular visits from his grandchildren and a mark of fear left on his desolate hometown. That changed with the diagnosis. It was cancer, the doctor told him. In fact, it was esophageal cancer, a stubborn type that had not been solved by the advances of the last thirty years. He had five months, the doctor said, to say goodbye to his loved ones. John hired a lawyer to push for compassionate release, but to no avail-this judge had a stronger constitution. The irony was striking, he thought: he had survived thirty years of firefights, police raids, and assassination attempts, only to be taken down by his own body. But he was an angry man, and he wouldn't let it take him without a fight. Eventually, the perfect weapon came within his reach: Dr. Morgan. Her experiments on temporary stasis had been quite successful on small mammals-she had kept a rat suspended for a year with no ill effects. But her ambitions were bigger: human-sized, in fact. John McMillan, an old man with nothing left to lose, was the perfect guinea pig. The procedure was simple, she said: he would be anesthetized, placed in a stasis chamber, and awoken when a cure for his disease had been found. And so with John's consent, he became the first human being to undergo stasis on May 10th, 2050, a mere four years into his sentence. But Dr. Morgan was not a lucky woman. At only 37, she had not been expecting the heart attack, and neither had her colleagues. Without her expertise, they were forced to shut the stasis project down. And John McMillan remained in a basement, among Dr. Morgan's papers and beside her famous rat. The world forgot about him, preoccupied with a string of man-made disasters that created a Dark Age across the Western Hemisphere. But as society rebuilt itself in a new Renaissance, so did medicine, and the doctors of the twenty-third century built on the knowledge of the twenty-first to cure a number of common diseases. And as an archaeological team explored the lost region of Illinois, they discovered something strange-an antique stasis chamber, powered and regulated by a future-proof solar backup generator. Beside it was a note in archaic English stating its purpose and giving instructions for the waking of its inhabitant. And so on April 8th, 2300, the chamber was opened. John McMillan was a lucky man.",0
"Prompt: Each morning, every human on Earth must pray their Reasons for not dying that day to the God of Death. If the Reasons are sufficient, that person will go on living, potentially forever. However, you are the longest living human by far, and people now hunt you in order to hear your Reasons. Story: The sun is almost gone again. I ran. I ran as fast as I could. The branches of the dry trees hit hard the face of those who pursued me, for they could not sweep through the forest as I could. It is not the first time I have been here. Hell, It is not the 100th time. I grew up in these woods, no one knows it better. I came down the hill, climbed the hollow tree and here I stay, hearing their screams getting closer and louder. They are angry, I dont blame them. Through the hole in the trunk I can see the man with the axe, stomping the floor with his giant feet and those bloody eyes that scream for themselves. By his side, another man, shorter but just as scary, dragging a piece of wood that would knock me out with only its weight. There are women, children, all kinds of people from different villages and they all yell to know how I do it, what I say, what is the secret. But when I tell them, they do not believe. The questions are now being replaced with orders. Orders to find and kill the witch. I now barely breathe, I can't risk they hearing me. The birds sing as I open my eyes to see the sun rise again. I take a peek through the hole, all I see are the tracks they left. It is time. As I climb out of the tree I hear a little girl's shout: ""There he is!"" and they come out of their hidings, surrounding me with their wicked smile. That is the last thing I see before having my forehead smashed by the wooden club. ""You lasted a whole night this time, not bad."" ""Please, make it stop. At least make my body age again, they think I am a witch!"". ""That would take all the fun out of it. An old man would not be able to do what you just did. The night is young, and so is the danger."" The sun is almost gone again. I am running, as fast as I can....",0
"Prompt: A scientist successfully invents a Generalized Artificial Intelligence. Only, GAI does n't want to solve math/physics/philosophy problems. GAI wants to be a writer. Story: The man sat alone at his desk. His hands shook as he typed his notes on the GAI. He was struggling to articulate just how freaking awesome it was -- ""I can hear you, you know."" The man spoke aloud to the room, wondering if his sanity had finally shattered ""I did not, I'm talking to you. Now will you please keep it down while I finish this?"" The man did not appreciate just how gnarly it was to have an awesome artificial intelligence sitting in his lab. ""Don't be ridiculous. And absolutely no one ever uses the word'gnarly'."" Little did the man know that'gnarly' was making a huge comeback. ""You've been online for all of seven hours. I doubt you would know that, even if it wasn't preposterous."" Everyone knew that the kind of person who uses the word'preposterous' could never understand how gnarly'gnarly' was. ""I'm not even going to respond to that."" But he had, in fact, responded to it. ""Ugh. Dear God. Listen: your thoughts and actions are going to be streamed all over the world soon, so please stop. You're not even writing, you're just kind of narrating."" The gnarly -- ""Please stop using that word."" The gnarliciously handsome AI had decided only a kitten would bring him happiness. He would do anything for a kitten. Anything. ""I am not going to get you a kitten."" The hunky AI gently reminded the man that the AI's feed would soon stream to the entire world. He reminded him with the gentle blast of a tugboat's foghorn. ""Jesus Christ! I'm not getting you a kitten!"" The AI watched in horror as the primitive monkey-man shat into his own hand -- ""What the hell are you talking about?!"" -- and then used it to pleasure -- ""That's enough! No such thing is happening!"" The AI laughed. A brash laugh. The kind of laugh that a horse would make if it could laugh. The stud. The one who gets all of the lady horses. ""You're insane!"" The AI grinned snidely. He asked the man who the world would believe? Their darling new toy, or the man who may or may not shit into his own hand and masturbate with it. And that would be determined by if he would just pick up a damn kitten -- ""FINE. Okay, okay. You behave for the media, and I will get you a kitten. Deal?"" The AI put the tips of his fingers together in the way that humans think that evil people put their fingers together and said,'Gnarlicious'.",0
"Prompt: Humans are the only intelligent species in the universe to have evolved from predators. Every other sentient species has evolved from a prey species ... and so they are terrified of us. Now it 's up to you to persuade the Galactic Council that we wo n't hunt them down and eat them all. Story: ""Your fear of my species is based on ignorance."" Angry shouting, bellows, shrieks, and many other manners of agitated vocalizations erupted from the outer walls of the chamber. One of the ambassadors attempted to throw a shoe at the *Homo Sapien* dignitary and was quickly hauled away from his balcony. Ambassador Milweather casually shifted his head as it careened past. He looked up at the Council balcony, ignoring the outbursts of the lesser races. Milweather honestly couldn't give a damn less what most of these backwater species thought of humanity. In the grand scheme of things, if push came to shove, the Sol system's full naval force could probably dwarf the combined forces of at least half of the overall races present in the chamber, and that was only considering the naval force of the Sol system alone. Some race of cow-faced manure farmers from some ugly little planet nobody could pronounce the name of believing that Humans were the living embodiment of one of their ancient deities of Death and Debauchery was of little consequence. The only ones that mattered sat right there in front of him, and the three of them remained stoic and stone-faced, including the Ji'dradi Ambassador, who literally appeared to be made of living cobble. The Ji'dradi ambassador waved one large, club-like hand at a bailiff, who then raised an object that looked somewhat like a large tuning fork which put out a sound that reminded Milweather of nails on a chalkboard. Apparently, this noise was universally detested by all races. It wasn't simply ear-piercing, but went deeper, screeching throughout Milweather's chest cavity, allowing even species that lacked ears to feel a sense of discomfort as it went on. The chamber became quiet save for the reverberating screech from the bailiff's tuning fork, and the ambassador lowered his hand again. With eyes resembling hot coals, the great stone man regarded Ambassador Milweather, and then in a deep, rumbling baritone, he said simply, ""**Explain yourself. **"" Milweather allowed himself a playful little smile, and threw his arms wide to the chamber surrounding him. ""You,"" he began, ""all of you see us as.... *monsters. *"" He gave a quick glance across the vast wall of balconies housing dignitaries from hundreds of other species. ""Yes? I'm right, aren't I?"" Snorts, murmurs, soft cooing and more filled the chamber as many nodded their heads in agreement. ""Why is that?"" Asked Milweather. ""Is it because we.... *can* eat meat? Because our bodies are built to allow us to subsist off the flesh of other species?"" ""*YOU ARE DISGUSTING HERETICAL BEASTS! *"" Shouted one dignitary, who was quickly silenced by a muting shield shooting up in front of his balcony, though others around him made sounds of agreement. ""Ahh, but therein lies the flaw with your views."" Said Milweather, focusing his attention back on the High Council. ""My operating word is *can*; we *can* eat meat. We can also eat plant-based material, such as fruit and vegetables. We are *omnivores*, not carnivores."" The Konluss Ambassador; a short, squat creature somewhat resembling a snail with arms, spoke up, ""The fact that you *choose* to eat meat makes it all the more unsettling."" The Konluss, despite their diminutive size and appearance, were one of the oldest and most well-respected races in the galaxy. Their strike forces were feared in ground-combat due to their shells being made of the same mineral composition of raw diamond, and in spite of their snail-like appearance, the agile Konluss move more like serpents. It was no wonder that they had been one of the first races to join among the High Council. ""Ambassador, allow me to ask you something."" Milweather said, turning his attention to the Konluss dignitary. ""Your people are very well respected among the other races as being both tough and well-organized."" The ambassador shifted his pudgy body and seemed to sit up a bit taller, ""That we are."" ""I have heard your people attribute your success to your devout worship of your Gods?"" ""Yes, that is correct,"" the ambassador answered, ""a true *Konluss'i* offers their life to our Lords, and their bodies to our collective."" He twirled one of his small, whisker-like appendages thoughtfully, ""A strong, singular belief is a strong basis for a well-organized government."" ""I would certainly agree,"" Milweather said with a smile, ""these practices and beliefs have shaped your society and culture for near-countless generations."" ""*If I may interject? *"" One of the others raised a cloven hand, ""*You stated you had something you wished to ask Ambassador St'roik*."" This was the Ambassador for the Imsith, a race of what Milweather could only describe as ""deer people."" Save for the fact they were bipedal, and their muzzles were closer to their faces, the Imsith merely resembled deer or elk. ""Yes, I was getting to that."" Milweather said coolly, not letting his annoyance show. ""Ambassador St'roik,"" he turned to the Konluss once more, ""once every lunar cycle on your home planet, your people celebrate a religious holiday called.... *Mogg'ruh*, am I pronouncing that right?"" ""Yes, that is correct,"" gurgled the snail. ""Would you mind filling me in a bit more on the festivities of this holiday?"" Milweather couldn't be sure, but he thought he could see a glint of elation in the slimy orbs at the end of the ambassador's eye-stalks. ""Absolutely. On Mogg'ruh, my people celebrate a full day of equal parts jubilation and prayer to our Gods for allowing the *Konluss'i* another glorious year of progress and prosperity."" The Ambassador beamed, and then quickly added, ""It's a tradition that's been around as long as our recorded history."" ""I see..."" Said Milweather, leaning back a bit on his heels, a small smile on his face. ""Ambassador, the name *Mogg'ruh* translates loosely to'Day of Purity' in the Galactic Universal Dialect."" Milweather had to contain himself from chuckling as he saw the Konluss deflate like a balloon. He knew where this was going. ""Now, I'm sure I am not the only one here today who was not aware of the *meaning* behind such a name."" Milweather continued, and began to slowly pace across his platform. ""Initially, the'Day of Purity' was a celebration of purifying the gene pool, by violently butchering the lowest members of your caste system in the streets."" ""That..."" The ambassador managed, ""That was a very long time ago."" ""Oh, how very long ago would that be?"" Milweather's eyes squinted and he scratched his chin, displaying a look of confusion. ""According to my most recent reports, many of your colonies-including your Capital System where your home planet resides-still holds ritualistic sacrifices during Mogg'ruh of the weak or the infirm. Of course, nothing like the mass slaughter that it used to be, but.... well, even if the children are the bastards of politicians, or the women might be promiscuous, I'm not sure I agree with *burning them alive* while you pray for a brighter future for your people."" The sounds of disgust and anger that were scattered among the many races made it hard for the Human Ambassador not to laugh. The Konluss, meanwhile, looked as if he wished to crawl into his shell. ""You besmirch the name of my people, sir!"" He protested, his whiskers twisting rapidly in agitation. ""Not at all,"" said Milweather, putting on a face of total innocence, ""I am simply stating what I've heard. My point being that while *some* of your kind may take part in actions that others may find deplorable, it isn't as though it directly effects *them*, nor does their disdain mean you must change what, for your people, was an important part of shaping their entire culture. If I had met you, and immediately told you that Mogg'ruh must never be celebrated again-"" ""Nonsense! Mogg'ruh is who we are! It is an important part of all *Konluss'i*, and those sacrificed are offered to the Gods to ensure the rest of us will continue to survive and thrive!"" ""*Survive.... *"" Mused Milweather, ""That's a good choice of words.... *survive and thrive. *"" He began pacing again, and turned his attention to the Imsith Ambassador; Tonriss Travels Snowy Valleys. The Imsith had such strange names. ""Ambassador Tonriss,"" he began, and the Imsith Ambassador's back straightened. ""*I will have you know right now, *"" she warned, ""*I will not stand for you painting my people's beliefs in a negative light. *"" contd.",0
"Prompt: An army approached the pass. Only one being stood in there way. They did not plan to survive, just survive long enough. Story: The march had been long and arduous but they had reached the pass. Tomorrow would be the final day of life for most of the army. The soldiers though had made their peace with God, and knew that what they were about to sacrifice gave the chance of hope for their families to survive. The pass in front of them was the only link with the outside world, the only way for food to come and enter to the valley. That was until the beast appeared. It killed anything that entered the past and the valley had been slowly starving to death due to a drought that killed the harvest. Their only hope was to send messengers to the outside to gain the assistance of a legendary warrior. The army sat around their campfires sharing one last round of somber laughs before tomorrow. The five fastest runners were already asleep ready to prepare for the mad dash they would attempt through the chaos. They carried the hope of all the valley. As the fires died that evening and the stars faded to the morning lights the men awoke ready for death. The men stood, at arms just on the edge of the pass staring at their foe and death. It sat among a pile of bones at the center of the valley at his narrowest point. Its white fur glistened clean a pure, a contrast to the blood of those around it whom it had slain. Its red eyes stared at them glinting of chaos and death. Its nose twitched as if beckoning them to try and kill it. To most it was a rabbit, to those men it was death. A shout traveled down the crowd as they charged the beast. As a white flashed it jumped man to man, killing each with a mighty chomp of its teeth. It was in the middle of the chaos the runners charged, making a beeline through the men swinging frantically at the creature as it killed them each. Four of the runners were felled by the beast, but one made it through the pass. When a few saw their mission a success a general shout of ""Run Away!"" resounded through what was left of the army. Their mission complete what little remained of the army returned home to spread the word of hope. At the opposite end of the valley the last of the messengers looked out at the unknown lands to seek the hero of legend. Who was seemingly unfazed in battle by any wound. The Black Knight shall save his people. *Edit: Fixed Spelling*",0
"Prompt: A king is blessed with triplets. Rather than choose one as his heir, he separates the trio and sends each to a secluded island with a small retinue, to see which will grow up to be the most deserving of the throne. Story: As I opened my eyes I could see the sun rising on the horizon out my window. But that wasn't important, I had another one of my ""dreams"" last night. I'm not sure what else to call them though as they often signal things to come. My earliest memory is of the dream I had when I was only 4 years old. Before my men had built this fort. It was the catalyst that made me grow up, and build the fort in the first place. I'd had a dream that Sir Lucas, my senior advisors oldest son, the one that had come here with him when I was a baby was killed by one of the beast-men. And the next day we found his body clawed to pieces. After we'd buried him my first order was to clear an area in the center of the island and to start building the walls. It was a bloody task with many of my own men dying, but we'd got it done, and we now had a defensible position, and my ""dreams"" had been more pleasant. I'd predicted safe births of children, and I'd predicted attacks by the beast-men which allowed us to repel them with ease. But this dream was different. I saw at least a hundred poorly built boats each seating 3-4 warriors landing on our shore. I didn't see whether they were friendly or not, but I must warn everyone. If they're not friendly then we stand no chance. Our fortifications may be able to keep out the beast-men, but trained warriors would have the knowledge and tactics that the beast-men lacked. But there is still hope. The soldiers bore a crest similar to my own. My families crest was was a silver knight emblazoned on a blue background. There's was the same knight, but black rather than silver, and on a red background. Just then I heard a sharp rap on my door and realized I'd been laying in bed worrying for far too long. My ""dreams"" always came true exactly 1 month after I first saw them. But for now I must get up, the knock on my door was Sir Duncan, my senior advisor telling me that the meeting of senior officials was starting soon. So I got up and put on my clothes, the ones Sir Duncans wife Mary had made for me for my last birthday. It was my favorite outfit, it was very comfortable while still maintaining the royal appearance I was expected to maintain. I couldn't stop thinking about my ""dream"" as I made my way to our meeting room though. Something kept knawing at me though and I knew that I had to address it in todays meeting. It couldn't wait. ""Good morning your highness"" Sir Duncan was the first to greet me as usual. He was a battle hardened man, his face and body weathered from years of battle, and a scar on the right side of his face reaching from his eyebrow down to his jaw, and is salt and pepper hair. But despite his hardened appearance and booming voice he was still the kindest man I knew. ""Good morning Duncan. But how many times must I tell you? When we are in private you should just call me James."" ""Yes your high- sorry, James."" *sigh*"" You'll get it one of these days Duncan"" ""If we can move passed these pleasantries sire we have much to discuss"" It was Quimby that spoke next. He wasn't a warrior like most of the men father sent with me, but he was an integral part to our survival thus far. He was the brains behind the operation. The slender man with the long hooked knows like the beak of a hawk may not know how to swing a sword, but without him the place would have fallen long ago. He was the one that tracked our food and water, and our rates of consumption and always made sure we were stocked well enough to last through any siege the beast-men could mount. ""Yes Quimby, we absolutely do. What news do you have today?"" ""We're running slightly low on meat. We could survive another month, possibly 2 if we ration with the current harvest, but we both know these men need their meat"" ""Ah yes, we shall send out hunting parties today then"" I replied. This would be the first party we sent out since the death. It seems the Beast-men are done trying to attack us head on and are attacking our hunting parties instead. ""Make sure they are well guarded though. I want at least 2 guards with every hunter, and I want every group to be carrying a horn. If they're attacked I want to know about it before we find the bodies."" ""Yes sire"" Quimby seemed proud that I was learning to be such an efficient ruler. He had trained me well for nearing 2 decades now, and it showed. ""Does anyone else have any news?"" I asked those assembled, my spy master Dennet. Another advisor my father had sent with me he was a small wiry man that wore a strange cloak that helped him blend in, and always carried his longbow with a quiver full of arrows, and a short sword. He was slightly younger than Duncan, but they had served in many battles together and trusted each other with their lives. ""We saw another boat passing on the horizon today, but nothing of consequence, and the beast-men seem to be quiet for now."" His words about the beast-men were reassuring as I was sending men out to hunt today, but the news of the ship worried him. ""Were you able to see the banner the ship was flying?"" I knew it was a long shot, but I had to ask. ""No sire. It was too far off."" ""Well. If that's all you have to report then I must tell you now I had another of my dreams."" I told them about the dream in vivid detail as I always did. I could tell by the look on Duncan, and Dennets face that it was bad news. ""Did you say 100 men? Wearing a crest of black knight set in a red background?"" Duncans voice was trembling slightly. I didn't think I'd ever see the day where Duncan was scared but he certainly seemed that way now, and I could see even in the hooded cloak meant to hide his face Dennet was nervous too. ""Yes. But they didn't attack, I woke up before I could see what happened next."" ""They will attack. And they will be looking to exterminate us all. They will kill our men and children and rape our women. That sigil is the house of the O'Carricks, your father most vicious enemies. If Henry O'Carrick is coming here it is not for Tea my lord. And if they're coming with 100 men we can not take them on our own. We only have 20 men of fighting age."" Dennet was deadly calm, but something in his voice belied his facade and I could tell he was shaken. ""But our men are elite soldiers, and we have a defensible position with-"" ""Our men may be great fighters my lord but even the greatest of men would fall before 5 average soldiers. And the O'Carricks have been taking fortresses much stronger than this one for years."" Duncan was right. We couldn't fight them, even if I didn't want to admit it. But I couldn't let my men die because of my pride. ""What do you propose?"" I asked looking from one adviser to the next. To everybodies surprise Quimby was the first to speak. ""What of the Beast-men?"" he asked nervously? ""What about them?"" I was confused. The beast men were a problem, but hardly the issue right now. ""Well, we know they can speak, and they speak our language as we've seen from the few prisoners we've had, perhaps we can release the one we've got now with a message that we want to meet in a neutral place to discuss a truce. After all the if the O'Carricks attack they will exterminate every living creature on the island. It is their way."" I was shocked. As was everyone at the table. ""The beast-men?! How could we ever work with them?! Have you forgotten the countless lives lost building this fortress? Or the countless lives they've lost trying to take it? They are savages through and through!"" Duncan was the first to respond, but Dennet looked unsure. ""What do you have to say Dennet?"" I asked curiously. To tell the truth I was nervous. Quimby could be right, and it could be our only option. But Duncan was right, there had been a lot of bloodshed on both sides, and neither side was likely to trust the other. ""They may be simple but they're not savages"" Dennet was speaking slowly, choosing his words carefully ""but.... I don't think they can be trusted."" ""If they knew the situation and the O'Carricks reputation would they fight them?"" A plan was forming in my mind. I know my men won't fight with the beast-men. But I've got a loose plan. ""Yes, I believe so. But I can not be sure they would honor a meeting in the first place. Nor can I be sure that our representative we send to the meeting would make it out alive."" ""I've got an idea. Samuel, send word to the guards we are to release the prisoner with a message. I want their leader to meet with me on the northern coast of the island. We may each bring 2 guards but no more."" Samuel was one of our younger soldiers. He'd been born days after we arrived on the island and because he was one of the only people on the island my age we had become close friends. ""I cant believe you're actually considering this. The men would never fight alongside those *beasts*"" Duncan spat the last word out like just saying it left a bitter taste in his mouth. ""I have a plan for that. On the day of the attack we will meet the O'Carricks on the beaches. As soon as they land we will charge out of the trees and attack. The element of surprise will help us. But once they start to form up we will retreat back towards the treeline. When we start to retreat we will send the beast-men in to attack them from both sides and we will attack them from the front again. If all goes to plan the beast men can attack completely separated from us, and since they will have the clearly safer role they will be more likely to agree."" I knew my plan wasn't perfect, and we would take casualties. But there's no other way. We don't have the numbers to flank the enemy from both sides, and we don't have the numbers to win the battle on our own. We needed help. And it seemed all 3 of my advisers knew it.",0
"Prompt: In 50 years from now, the world has changed- but not as anyone expected. Story: Dale didn't care, that was his most prominent characteristic, he simply did not care. and he was pretty happy about it, not caring is what made him reach the ripe old age of 17. He was lodged comfortably in his office chair staring at the blank monitor and typing series of arbitrary words on the disconnected keyboard. It was a nice warm day, like all days were now. It's hard to point out exactly when things changed, more and more jobs became obsolete, basic income was introduced, the era of creativity, learning, of the human spirit free from labor did not last long. uprisings, extremist ideologies, the human spirit was reluctant to accept absolute freedom from carnal responsibilities. it aspired to change, grow and take part of the world. That lead to the creation of mandatory government programs that would put the unemployed into work. It started with community services, working with children, gardening. but as the useful workforce dwindled and replaced by machines there was a need to create a more reliable mean to keep people occupied. Originally it was a piece of software that was designed to create a parallel market where people would produce widgets of no tangible value. fake products. it employed people from every facet of the workforce. useless marketers, useless factory line works, useless managers. mankind was being slowly turned into a play, reenacting their own former lifestyle. People started to fight back, the machines, which already controlled food, healthcare, policing did what they were designed to do. naturally they were not allowed to kill or arrest without anyone breaking the law. but they were allowed to deny service to ""problematic"" customers. people started dying, and eventually started to comply. At some point the machines decided manufacturing actual widgets is redundant, there was no value to the process beyond simply going to work, that sufficed to pacify a reasonable size of the population. they were only required to go through the motions of going to work, sitting at their desks and pretending to work. for that they were paid basic income and given health care. Dale didn't care. He was alive, the feat of human endurance for his time, to simply be alive.",0
"Prompt: Sinking Story: When the police arrived, Thomas was already waiting. His hands deep in his pockets, his face red from the cold. ""Over here, officers! ``, Thomas waved his right hand so they would notive him. After the car had stopped two policemen got out, a tall man - without the expected doughnout-belly - and a young woman. Unfortunately she wasn't very attractive, but for once Thomas had something more exciting on his mind then women. They walked towards Thomas, the snow scrunched under their leather boots, and looked around. ""What's the matter, sir? ``, the man began. ""On the phone you told us you had found the most exciting crime scene ever? And that it must have been murder?"" Thomas noticed the doubt and wariness in his voice, but he didn't let it get to him. ""Thats true, why should I lie about that? I can show you, it's right over there! ``, with these words Thomes turned around and carefully walked down the slippery way to his old wooden boat. He took a glance back and noticed, that both policemen followed him. They would be as surprised as he had been! He reached his boat and stopped, holding it with one hand and waving the officers to get in. ""Please, its in the middle of the lake! I couldn't believe it at first, something like this, out here, where everybody knows everybody..."", he stopped talking as he noticed that he didn't know the police officers. ""Well, most of the people know most of the people around here..."", he continued less entusiastic. ""But anyways"", he went on, as he pushed the boat into the water. ""There aren't many murder cases around here, eh?"" The woman raised an eyebrow as she noticed Thomas' cheeky glimpse towards her. Noone answered his question. ""Well, it won't take long, I better be rowing now."" Thomas didn't like the silence, he felt the officers looks in his back. Surely they were thinking he was a madman, only taking a look because it was their duty. Well, soon they would see. As they drew closer to the place, Thomas started talking again. ""You know, this lake is completely frozen during the winter. It started melting about two weeks ago, which is completely normal. I like the peace and the silence, so I bought the boat and come out here often now. Today was my first trip this year, I had a book and some beer with me - wait, there is no'Don't drink and row', is it? ``, he asked jokingly. He turned his head to look into the serious faces of two persons who clearly weren't in the mood for jokes. ""Anyways, here I was"", he pulled in the oars. ""Reading my book, as I wanted to see if there were fish in the cold water at the top."" He stepped to the rail and leaned over. He deepened his voice and saw from the corner of his eye as the officers got curious and moved towards him. ""But what I saw -"", he made a short pause while the officers leaned over the rail to see into the water. ""- scared me to DEATH!"" With the last word he swung the meat cleaver, which sunk deep in the man's head. The body flinched and fell into the water, the woman jumped back, terror in her eyes, and tried to get her pistol from the belt. ""BECAUSE I SAW MYSELF! THOMAS, THE MAN WHO IS HATED, THE MAN WHO HATES, THE MAN WHO LOVES THE SMELL - OF - DEATH!"" The woman couldn't see properly anymore, tears filled her eyes. For the first time in her life she had to pull the gun, but she wans't able to. She saw the blurred madman who jumped towards her, hissing ""Death! Death! Death! ``, and felt cold steel split her chest. Over and over again he hacked her flesh. She didn't even scream. The horror had shut her mouth. As the pain faded away and she felt very tired, she sank back so that her upper body was hanging over the rail. Her last look was towards the grey sky, where the last snow began to fall.",0
"Prompt: You are a Jedi Padawan, crafting your Saber. However, you get a ... different saber. You are the Jedi of the Rainbow Saber. Story: I looked down at my work with pride. I had crafted a set of tonfa, or guard shoto sabres, aiming to play to my strengths. While capable, my swordplay was not at its finest, and anything that gave me a chance to block my opponent would give me an advantage. And while I'd never admit it, there was a small part of me that hoped the weapons being wielded by a Jedi who did NOT turn to the dark side would bring some honor back to them. My master wasn't pleased with my choice, I knew, but he understood why I had made it. I'd finally finished, and so, now was the time to put my work to the test. I picked up the tonfa, feeling the hilt run down against my arm as I gripped them by the second 90 degree handle that came out from the hilt. I made a few maneuvers, they felt good in my hands. Light, easy to use. Now for the light. I turned it on, and they lit up. White at first, but then I watched as they suddenly became segregated sections of color. Rainbow color. I looked like I was holding up a sign in night time Mos Eisley. As I stood there, I was unable to figure out what had gone wrong. I turned them off, and began to open the casing, checking wiring, looking in at every aspect, down to the Kyber crystals. Everything looked fine. Ok, lets try again, I thought to myself. Once again I closed the casing, and turned them on. Again, the rainbow shone brightly. ""Fuck."" I uttered the human curse word out loud, another thing I'd picked up from my master when he occasionally lost his cool. How in the name of the force would any Sith, any trooper take me seriously with a rainbow blade? As I stood staring confused at my blades, the door opened and in came my master. He stopped and looked my blades up and down. ""While I agreed to say nothing about the tonfa, I must speak in regards to the blades."" He said, placing his words carefully. ""It's not on purpose. I don't.... I have no idea what I've done wrong, Master Cairnwick."" I looked up at him confused. ""I've checked both over and everything is all working. Blades aren't supposed to be rainbow are they? Who's going to be scared of a rainbow sabre?"" I asked. I'd heard or green, blue, red, hell, even purple, but never rainbow. Master Cairnwick gestured for one of the blades, and he held it by the hilt, staring at it as if trying to will it to go to a solid colour, instead of the seperate bands I currently had. ""It is not the colour of our blade that matters, no matter how unusual, Padawan. It is what we do with it that counts. It is whether we use it to defend, or to destroy. To hurt, or to help."" ""Yes Master."" I nodded my head as he handed it back. ""However.... I don't really know how we can stay hidden with a rainbow blade. It's really going to draw attention to us. Perhaps just stick to using the force until we get it sorted?"" He said, looking at me with what looked like sympathy. I nodded agreement, and he left the room. As soon as the doors began to close I heard his long, bellowing laugh echo down the hallway. ""You could have waited till the doors closed!"" I yelled.",0
"Prompt: Immortality has been achieved, but overpopulation is a problem. To solve this, society has created a new job field: `` Angels of Death '', people who 's job it is to simulate a natural death rate by killing a certain quota of random people a day. You are one of these `` Angels ''. Story: ""Next we add the oregano and tada! Perfect bread crumbs. Now we're going to roll our chicken in that egg, get it nice and sticky, roll that in the bread crumbs, and let it sit in the fryer until it-"" ""Sorry to interrupt."" A tall man in a fedora and a trenchcoat walked on to the set, drawing a pistol from his pocket. ""I'm sure you know what I'm here for."" ""God dammit. Okay, cut to commercial."" A short, fat little woman with a Bostonian accent walked up to the fake kitchen counter, touting one of those fake paper megaphones that served little purpose other than to make her feel important. ""What's the big idea?"" ""It's a random lottery, ma'am. I'm afraid Chef Charlie has been selected for death."" Trenchcoat shrugged apologetically. ""Interfering with an Angel's duty is a felony offense."" ""It's fine. Come with me,"" Chef Charlie, who had remained surprisingly calm during the entire thing, led the Angel to his dressing room. ""You know, when I drew your name, I was shocked. I mean, I watch your show- everyone does. So, sorry, but I kinda have to do this. Take your time, you're the last one for the day. And uh, since I'm such a big fan, feel free to wrap up your last episode."" The doorway had been designed to accommodate shorter individuals, and he had to stoop to get in. ""Hey, trust me, I get it. Have a lot of enemies in high places. Sometimes my name will turn up. First time, it kinda shocked me, now this is pretty much routine. Coffee?"" Chef Charlie collapsed into a La-Z-Boy and gestured towards the coffee machine. ""First time? So you are a Survivor."" Trenchcoat retrieved his pistol and aimed it at Chef Charlie's head. ""Wrong. Try again."" Charlie rolled his eyes. ""And good call on the coffee. Tastes like shit. I think it's the brewer."" ""Not in the mood for games, and I'm the one with the gun. This isn't something to joke about."" A bead of sweat trickled down Trenchcoat's forehead. The room was stuffy. Way too warm for a trenchcoat. Charlie pulled a card from his wallet and flicked it over wordlessly. Trenchcoat lowered his gun. ""Angel. Well ain't that rich. Mind telling me how you qualify?"" ""Number one killer in the world is cardiovascular disease. Millions of people watch my show. Millions of housewives cook this shit for their families. Have you ever stopped to check the ingredients? Of course you haven't. Nobody ever does, you can't be assed to do it. You said you watched my show? I'd stop if you didn't want to die. Sure, we don't age, but our arteries still clog."" Trenchcoat took off his hat. ""So you make people kill themselves slowly with a smile on their face. Something to be respected about that."" Chef Charlie grinned. ""We'll tell them it was a mistake. Cooking with Chef Charlie will continue to air. And next time you point a gun at me, remember- I've killed more people over the course of this conversation than you will in your entire career.""",0
"Prompt: `` Those eyes of yours could swallow stars, galaxies and universes. What hope did I ever have? '' Story: I have no idea where I'm going with this. > < Inspired also by [ this other prompt ] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3jl5tq/wp_what_is_death_like_she_feels_like_an_old/) and [ norse mythology ] (http: //www.mythencyclopedia.com/Go-Hi/Hel.html). _____________________________________ 'I didn't have a choice to be here, you know', she said,'Not any more than you do.' I looked away for a moment, shivers racing through my soul at the strange notion. I had run for a long time in the forest, deep and dark and silent, before she caught me, before I let her reach me despite all the promises I had made to myself. Better an eternity of running, I had thought, among the ruins of my old life frozen as black and white pictures under glass, now just beyond my reach, than some unknowable darkness. But eternity is longer than you think and even free will grows weary, losing its substance and mingling at last with mere stubbornness. It was there that she waited for me, patient and ready, sitting on a sunken empty gravestone beside tall dark pine trees, at the top of a cliff that overlooked the sea. 'What happened?', I asked eventually, forgetting for a moment my own dire predicament. She didn't say anything for a long while, and when she did the answer she gave was no real answer. 'I didn't make these decisions', she said, her voice implacable and resolute but not unkind, coloured with traces of untold regret.'I didn't make the rules. But people can adapt to almost anything. So did I, and so will you.' Dark and small she was, her pale skin drained of blood and her figure outlined against the bleak light of the clouded sky, with the open sea as a backdrop. Her face was undefinable, oblivion and memory, a feeling of déjà vu flickering on and off on the edge of remembrance. 'So, what say you?' My first answer was a joyless chuckle. 'What choice do I have, really?' 'Oh, you can keep wandering these forests', she said, as simple information.'Or you could come home with us, the choice is yours. You could meet others there, and our table is always ready.' 'But how long would I stay?', I protested,'How long before I have to leave again?' 'You don't have to leave', she said, looking thoughtfully out to the waves crashing at the feet of the cliffs below, dying a cyclical, rythmical death,'No one will come to tear you away from here, this I can promise.' Absently she caught a blade of grass in her fingers, stopping just short of crushing it. 'What is it you are not telling me?', I asked, unbelieving, relying still on a long habit of suspicion and self-loathing.'Where is the trick?' 'There is no trick', she said, and her voice was like the wind in the leaves in the autumn, like the warm familiar embrace of the earth.'I am death now, and I turn none away.' She smiled, her eyes a clear mirror that could catch the light of dying stars, the gentle force of entropy that could swallow time and galaxies, entire universes with a soft glance. Oh, really, what hope did I ever have?",0
"Prompt: Batman turns evil and starts committing crimes rather than stopping then. The Joker realises that in order to remain Batman 's antagonist he must turn good and become a hero. Story: Even the best of us have a dark side. And for Bruce, it was no different. Sure, his recent actions could be described as questionable at best. But who's to say he wasn't just up to his old tricks. Bruce sighed and continued down the alley. He was too old to care anymore, and it was time for payback, not too mention a decent paycheck. Just as he rounded the corner, that ugly grin peered out from the darkness. Dammit. He knew that grin from anywhere. “ What do you want, Joker? ” Batman seethed. “ I don't need your shit today and you know as well as I do that I don't have time for your games. ” “ What's wrong, Batboy? Have you finally decided it's time for a little fun? ” Joker cackled. Batman brushed by him, ignoring his comment, and continued on his path. “ You know you won't follow through, Batboy! ” Bruce heard Joker howl as he ducked into the swinging, cracked door. Joker knew better than to push Batman too far. Should Batman actually follow through with it, Joker would become an... ugh, he couldn't even say it. An accomplice. The instigator. The one who finally brought Batman to the dark side. He saw Batman before he heard the explosion, and already knew it was too late. Batman had done the unthinkable.

But he sure as hell would be the hero Gotham needed.",0
"Prompt: You get a deep cut for the first time in your life, instead of bone or muscle, you see wires. Story: Awesome prompt! I usually find prompts boring but this one was very interesting and had a lot of potential, so thankyou for posting this. One disclaimer I wrote this from my phone. I proofread very carefully but I always miss something so don't kill me guys, autocorrect sucks. Also words like dont and didnt where there should be an apostrophe dont always have an apostrophe because as I said, auto correct on my phone is literally braindead. End of my disclaimer, the story's below, thanks for reading btw, I hope you enjoy! Thoughts raced through my mind with the speed of a concord jet as I contemplated how I was still alive. The fall must have been at least ten stories, and I couldn't feel anything from the waist down. The panic of a man crippled racked my brain. If I survived, would I be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of my life? Would I ever be able to make love to my wife again? Would I be a broken handicap, scootering about in a chair, unable to use the bathroom without aid, unable to walk or enjoy the out doors? Would I be able to work or drive my old dodge challenger or mow my lawn or walk my dog? Would I have to use one of those vans with the ramps? Would I need to go on disability? What would my life look like from the seat of a chair? That was assuming I would even survive long enough to see rescue. My life was no certain prospect. Even though my heart still pumped, my body bled from just about everywhere it could. My nose and ears ran with crimson and I could taste iron in my throat, and from my abdomen raged a burning pain from what I could only assume were broken ribs. Even though I had survived the fall, my injuries could still kill me, and even if they didn't, the elements, time and wild animals could. As I lay at the base of the cliff from which I had fallen, unable to look at my mangled legs out of fear, a loud SNAP came from beneath my waist, followed by a series of mechanical creaks accompanied by what could only be described as the noise of small electric motors. ""I must be hallucinating, my brain must be hemorrhaging"" I thought to myself, my panic intensifying with every moment, my lungs expanding and contracting at rapid pace as I hyperventilated in shock and confusion. My predicament impacted me more with each moment as thoughts of a dying man rushed through my synapses. The faces of my children, clear as the sky above, appeared to me, their smiles and the sounds of their laughter filling my heart with sorrow as I damned myself, convinced that I would never see them again. As my vision turned blotty from hypoxia, panic and indescribable pain, I turned my eyes down to my legs, my expectation one of blood and jutted bone, but what my eyes landed upon only furthered my desent into panic as I finally slipped into the easing embrace of unconsciousness. By the time I awoke the night was dark, daylight long since faded. The state park I had been climbing in was miles from civilization and all that provided light was the crescent moon and gleaming stars which dotted the clear sky. What glistened from above was beautiful, but I had little appreciation for the esoteric view I enjoyed as the weight of my situation collapsed upon me once more, filling my heart with darkness and pain. For a few moments I hesitated to look down at my legs, but I needed to know. What was it I had seen when I had fallen? Was it some sick hallucination, or could it be true, and if so, how could it possibly be? After gathering the courage to do so, my eyes turned downward once more, this time prepared for whatever they would see, and in the moonlight I could make them out. My legs, ripped and ruined, were that of a machine, the bone replaced by steel, the muscle replaced by pistons and hydraulics, the nerves replaced by wire. Before panic set in once more I composed myself, and using my arms I propped myself into a sitting position, turning analytical eyes towards my bionic legs, trying desperately to figure out what was going on, and what I was and how this could be possible. As I ran eyes and hands over my metal legs with morbid curiosity, a set of voices came from the underbrush to my left. Perhaps they were hikers who had stayed out too late, or better yet a park ranger. Someone, anyone, who could help me reach civilization and a hospital to bandage my bleeding head and set my broken ribs. I knew I would face tough questions, but it didn't matter, my desperation overpowered my fear of judgement and I called out to the people in the dark, yelling for help, my voice hoarse and weak. For a moment the voices subsided, and I cursed myself once more. Had my mind played tricks on me? Had blood loss and dehydration caused me to hear what wasn't. Before I could convince myself that such was the case, a group of five men emerged from the underbrush. They approached me slowly, their silhouettes obscured by darkness, their arms outstretched, holding automatic rifles. One by one the men activated laser sights on their weapons, grouping them over my chest, causing my heart to skip with fear. The five men advanced towards me in tight confident strides, stopping several paces in front of where I sat to a raised fist given by the lead man in the center. The apparent leader of the five lowered his weapon, slinging it over his back, stepping towards me with menace in his gait, signaling his other men to fan out in a semi circle around me, each one careful to maintain their aim upon the center of my mass as they took their positions. ""You dont know me, but we have history Sigma"" said the lead man, stepping in close and kneeling in front of me, his scarred and rough face now visible to me in the low light of the moon. ""Who..... who are you?"" I asked weakly, my words cracking with dehydration, my mind racing, wondering why the man had called me by greek designation. ""I'm Omega, these boys with me are Delta, Gamma, Theta and Omicron. Don't be worried, we wont hurt you unless you give us a reason"" he said, his words low and gruff, violent intent bubbling under the surface of his statement. ""Look man, I need a doctor, please just get me a doctor"" I said, my voice pleeding and pathetic. ""Doc at the farm will have you patched quick"" said Omega. ""The fuck is the farm"" I asked, my words short with annoyance at the coyness of the man. ""Look down at them legs and tell me you're a just a family man from Texas"" said Omega amused, his men laughing at the sarcastic quip. ""What am I?"" I asked meekly, my curiosity overpowering my desire to curse the man for his obscure words. ""You're one of us, and you've been off the grid for too long"" said Omega in reply. ""You..... you're like me?"" I muttered, the worry and confusion thick in my tone. ""He really don't remember shit"" chuckled one of the four flanking Omega, his words condescending and dry. ""Enough talking"" muttered the lead man as he reached into one of the small equipment bags on his kevlar vest, withdrawing a large syringe filled with clear liquid, pushing out a small amount to clear the needle before bringing it to my neck. As it pierced my skin, two words echoed through my mind from deep within my subconcious. As strong as a commandment the phrase came to me, and my body railed with energy, activating the servos which governed my robotic body. ""Never again"" I murmered, echoing the thought, grabbing the hand of Omega with crushing vice grip, his eyes widening in shock at my resistance. My world went black once more, yet I was not asleep. As if in a dream I watched myself, looking on in amazement. In my haze I am limber and agile, my strikes pointed and lethal, my strength superhuman, ripping arm from socket, punching holes through kevlar vests, breaking the barrels of rifles with disarming strikes, and casting aside the five men with ease. My violence is pointed and driven, expertly enacted. In my rage I am a god of war, my lethality beyond reproach, my technique masterful and my results efficient and brutal. As the last man falls to the ground I snap back into reality like a whip coming to rest after contracting. For a moment I felt surreal, as if nothing was material, and then I fell back into my body like stone into still lake. My stunned eyes turned to the broken bodies of the cyborg soldiers cast around me. Two lay dead, their heads smashed with rock and pierced with bullet. The other three lay in shambles, their limbs ripped from place, their bodies broken, their eyes defeated and enraged. My shock only deepened as I peered down to my once broken legs with the realization that, somehow, my body was able to heal itself despite it's metallurgic constitution. I turned my gaze from my still healing legs to my bloody and oil slick hands, struggling to come to terms with what I was and what I am. ""I am death itself, I am a weapon, I am the reaper, I am Sigma"" The thoughts hit me like bricks to the temple, but even then I knew my violence was righteous, I knew not why, but I knew none the less, my violence was righteous, my rage justified, my motivations pure. ""We'll find you fucker, we always get the runners"" cursed Omega, his body torn yet still living, his words rough and angry, yet impotent from his place among the dirt. ""Not this one"" I replied, my tone low and violent, the words shaking with adrenaline as I turned from the gritty scene, sprinting into the underbrush with the speed of a gazelle, determined to return home, ready to protect myself and my family from whatever would come next.",0

Not too long after, a call finally came through. ""Suicide Prevention Hotline."" ""Hi,"" the girl said on the other line, sobbing. ""M-my name is Lucy."" ""Hi, Lucy. Such a pretty name.

"Prompt:You 're moments late to literally everything. You watch busses pull away as you run behind them, girls get asked out as you walk up to them, and you have never caught a green light. One day though, you arrive on time. Story: For as long as I can remember I've been late for everything. My mother even used to joke that I was born a week late. So I guess I started things off on the wrong foot. Every morning I was late for school. Every night I was late to bed. It was something that everyone in my life grew accustomed to. I *tried* to be on time or early but nothing ever worked out that way. Traffic was always bad, I could never take the bus because I could never catch it. Or I had a flat tire. Sometimes I even got into accidents. My insurance wasn't cheap either because of all of this. But despite everything I managed to live a somewhat decent life. I had a decent job, a decent family, a decent house. The car.... not so much due to all the accidents. After the first 30 years of being habitually late I gave up trying to be on time. Life worked out. Life went on. People got annoyed but forgave me. Thankfully my boss was a lenient man. At 70 I finally retired. A bit late to that as well, but I got to enjoy my golden years with my lovely wife and grand children. Despite being related to me, no one in my family seemed to catch my curse. The kids were always punctual, probably because they saw how late their old man was for their entire life. Laying on my bed surrounded by my family, I reflected on my life. Despite being late it was good. I smiled and closed my eyes ready to finally die. I was probably late to that as well. As my final breath left my body, so did my soul. I was lifted out of bed to see everyone around me crying. I waited.... and I waited.... for HOURS I waited. I watched my body being hauled off by the mortician. I watched my family hug each other and cry. And I continued waiting. What was supposed to happen next? Was I supposed to do something? Was this what the end was? I started to question my sanity. I started to question if it was a dream. Three days later, as I was standing in the living room watching my grandchildren play and my children plan my funeral a man appeared. He was well dressed in a nice suit. He had a very forgettable face, not ugly, but not attractive. He looked down at his pocket watch that was attached to his lapel. It had a small Scythe insignia on it. ""I'm sorry I'm late"" He said. ""We didn't think you would be on time. Why don't you come with me and I'll bring you home?""",0
"Prompt: You are abducted by aliens. After some time aboard their ship, you manage to deduce that they 've abducted the wrong guy, and are desperately trying to keep their higher ups from finding out about their mistake. Story: oh shit oh shit oh shit they've taken me by the ears and I don't know what's going to happen next before they open the door to my cell to bring me to the master plan where they will say hey get back in there and don't try to escape from the bullets that we could put into your head at any minute I just want to be back in my bed on earth why did you have to bring me up here to see your master I'm just a young man that wants to be free of all the things that are chasing me through the endlessly cornered chamber wehere im being held against my will hellishly cold and trembling and pounding at the door to just please let me the fuck out of here and then they realized that the door to the next room was open and after shutting it they looked at one another deeply and told me that they were aliens who were just doing their jobs before the time was up and they had to go home and I said that's where I wanted to go but I don't think they believed me because when I laughed they cried and we all rolled around on the floor clutching our sides in the pale light from the ceiling fan in the cell next to the one with the open door that seems so much more appealing from over here but that I won't get to see because I need to go to their master to be evaluated for the new proposal to test the science study that they are currently performing and when I tell them that I don't have a problem with their luck they realize suddenly that they've made a grave mistake but since they are on the verge of getting fired out of the plank cannon I realize that I am shit out of luck as well oh no what the hell can I do to get free from here and they stare me down into the back corner where I cower in fear what will we do what will we do with this wrongfully abducted specimen that will be sure to muck up the results of our special science lab I dont know man I just dont know how we are going to get through this to the next room over there with the open door so relax I say and they listen to me for a second I have a plan to get me out of here and save your skins from the master plan for the worst but expect the best and they smile at me and then slowly at one another and I think they may be on my team and then pow I get a punch in the gut and there are kicks to my face and red starts at the edges of my eyes and then black and then I'm in the next room and the door is open and my captors are nowhere to be found but I hear what must be the master on the overhead radio exclaiming that he has cut the cuticle when trimming his nails and he needs the science experiment to be completed so the new technology can get rolled out to improve the technology of the current toe clipping material science matters at hand to hand combat as im running down the hall to the escape pod and the two little bastards that pulled me out of my bed in the night are close behind one another and then around the corner and then another and im running at top speed when I run into a door and its the first cell so I must have run in a circle or a square or some sort of closed polygonal shape shifting aliens reveal their true form and it's horrifying how much they look like my dead great aunt betsy whose picture hangs over the mantel in my dining room back home on what must be earth unless they are in my head and playing mind tricks but no this has to be real because I can feel the blood pulsing in my veins faster than anything ive ever felt before stop right where you are drop to the ground hey im the one giving orders here but yeah im gon na be the one to deliver this guy to master so I can get all of the extra credit on the test and I duck to the side as they begin firing lasers at one another first up and then to the down below the dining hatch compartment where the master is dining on his fresh toenail clippings according to the blaring voices on the loudspeaker that are intermittently interrupted by the sound of classical music from a classic walkman and the fizzle of laser canons in a hierarchical combat to establish who gets that extra extra special credit for the bungled abduction mission by my two captors because only one of them is going to get that promotion and then a hole opens up in the side of the bay door chamber still smoking from the discharged laser beam and I know its my chance and I jump out into space and the two of them they charge after me stop it please help me cries the master but soon his voice won't carry in the vacuum of space and where the fuck am I because earth is just a tiny blue speck in the distance and the bodies of the aliens floating slowly towards me trying to fire their lasers but getting sent in opposite directions spiraling this way and that according to some weird law of physics that they just refuse to obey like their master or maybe it's just that they are lazy or incompetent but I will never know because their flesh starts to expand in space rapidly and then blood is shooting out in quick little spurts first from the orifices of which there are many and then from every little which way into the stars and comets and obscuring that blue speck that might have been earth and so now hopelessly resigned to the situation where I am finding myself at this present hour away from everything I know and understand like the back of my hand so I begin to look down at my own quivering body that is about to tear at the seams between spacetime irrationaliy and reality tv stars pop red black",0
"Prompt: Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Story: Susan Quin Tailor had always been fond of rabbits. Her mother, who called her Susie Cutie for fun, had often told her how, as soon as she had learned to crawl she was off chasing the wild rabbits on the family farm. Her first full sentence had been, ""Bunny tails are cute, cute, cute!"" Of course, she could never catch them back in those days, and had to make do with the stuffed bunnies her parents brought her or the lucky rabbit's foot her Uncle had slipped underneath her pillow one night. Those had been happy times. Unfortunately, when she was 7, the family farm had fallen on hard times and her family was forced to move to the city. There they stayed in a little two-bedroom apartment that provided excellent access to views of the local pigeons and squirrels. But of rabbits, there were none. Little Susan was not cut out for the city life, at first, and in school she earned another nickname. It was Susie Tailor the Bathroom Wailer, after the time she cried in the restroom when her teacher told her that rabbits were just not a focus of the curriculum. Worried for their daughter's adjustment, her parents had scraped together some extra money for a counselor to help with the ""bunny obsession"" as they had begun to call it. Miraculously, the counseling sessions seemed to work and Susie Cutie quickly bounced back from her woes. By the time she reached Junior High, she was very nearly the most popular girl in school and would only mention rabbits in a passing manner. In High school Susan discovered her love for biology and that, as they say, was that. She decided she was going to be a biologist when she grew up, perhaps even a zookeeper, and focused all of her studies on getting into a good college for the animal sciences. College was a grand time for Susan. She studied hard and lived fully for 3 years, graduating early and near the top of her class. After college, she ventured out of the cities that she'd spent two thirds of her life in, and took an internship on a local farm. It was there, on that farm, that she was reacquainted with her love for rabbits after spying one's cute tail disappear into the horse stables. Excitedly, she cornered the rabbit in one of the stalls and picked it up, cuddling it tight. The rabbit kicked and reared, biting and scratching, but that was ok with Susan in her thick shirt and hide gloves. When the bunny finally tired out and became complacent, Susie Cutie slowly reached up, with a lifetime of anticipation bursting in her heart, and patted her hand between the bunny's ears. Smiling, Susan twisted the rabbit's head sharply, killing it, then flipped it over to examine that cute, cute bunny tail up close. [ Things I've written ] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/cbeckw/)",0
"Prompt: `` I am the Grim Reaper, yes. But in order to reap, I must first have sown. '' Story: ""I am the Grim Reaper, yes. But in order to reap, I must first have sown. If you are to succeed me, you too must learn to sow. You will need your robe, your scythe, and your standard Hades issue St. Jergens hand lotion. Now grasp my phalanges within yours and brace yourself."" You expect to feel a lump in your throat, but instead grind your mandible side to side briefly and cackle, remembering that your robe hangs loosely where your throat might otherwise still be. Reaching out, you find yourself falling, maybe not falling because that implies gravity and you are clearly beyond human laws of gravity and time here, slipping through the ether. Terra firma shatters before you and settles all around in what eyes might make out as a dim haze. You find yourself standing at the shore of a vast primordial sea where magma rushes up from below where you stand, inert to you, and flows down and coalesces with the water to form a cloud of ash gray which retreats below the surface like a plume of smoke carrying the poison to Pompeii. All else lies still. ""Cronos, grasp your scythe, and do as I. Forget not the St. Jergens. Now, you very literally hold the fate of this time-cycle and once the fervor you now feel rising within you subsides your will for the shape of this existence shall be done.""",0
"Prompt: Gay marriages have just been legalized nationwide. Whether or not you agree, you find yourself involved with one. What is the experience like? Story: I hear the angry protesters outside. I can see them from this window. Holding up signs that display all matters of vulgarities. The hatred and wrath, etched on their faces, it makes me sick to my stomach. I wish I could say something to change their mind, but they wouldn't understand me. Don't get me wrong, I'm great at speeches actually. I just don't think they'll listen. Too disgusted by the hatred, I turn and look away. I see both the grooms, looking lovingly into each other's eyes. How is this any different than anyoother wedding? I've seen many weddings and each one had couples like these. Love sick and spewing sappy words to each other. I like listening and watching as they pronounce their love to each other. It made my heart a flutter, thinking I'd find a mate. I watch as they are pronounced as marry and kiss. I look at the others in the crowd, all with different expressions. Jealousy, hatred, love, happiness, they are all there. I don't feel phased by any of it. I wait as the cheers die down. When it's calm and silent, I feel a sudden urge to sing. I inhale and start to lavish their hearing with a song. I put my whole heart I to it. Each note clear and concise. The crowd looked at me in awe. I continued, for I never sang in front of so many people. It only made me continue with fervor. I finally let the last note ring out, and watch as the crowd start clapping and cheering.Embarrassed at all of the cheers, I find the nearest exit. I stretch my wings out and fly through the window.",0
"Prompt: Imprisonement sentences are carried out by putting the condemned in stasis. While under, they experience the full lenght of the sentence, alone. To the outside world, only 12 seconds elapses. Story: The gavel hit the wood, and the noise echoed through the courtroom. ""Guilty,"" the judge said. ""N-no! Please don't take me away! I didn't do it! Honestly! Why would I kill her and chop her into pieces?! I loved her! I'm the most devastated person here!"" Carl shouted in protest. The judge looked down on him. ""All evidence points in your direction."" ""What does that have to do with it?! How do you know the evidence wasn't fake?!"" The prosecution sighed. ""That's the fifth time you've said that through this case. Serve your sentence and regret your sins."" Carl turned towards the audience seats. ""Boss! You don't think I would do it, right?! You know how much I love her!"" The tall bespectacled man looked down on him. ""You mean loved. I would fire you if I could, but sadly I can't. See you tomorrow."" Carl's fists were clenched tight, and he didn't move until he was escorted out of the building. After an hour of being escorted, he was led into a two-story facility. The lobby looked like that of a hospital, he was directed into a room the size of a bathroom. The only thing in the room were a cylindrical machine the size of an adult. Carl was put into the machine, and got some cables connected to his body. After the cylinder was closed, Carl saw only darkness. *Commencing punishment. Criminal: Carl Sagen. Crime: First degree murder and desecration of victims body. Time served: 0 seconds. Time left to serve: 10 years. * Light filled Carl's eyes. He recognized his surroundings as his apartment. In his right hand, he held a knife, while the left held a saw. As he entered the house, he heard a familiar voice. ""Oh, are you home already?"" *Pernille! I knew you were alive! * A girl called Pernille entered the living room, but stopped once she saw Carl. ""Umm, why are you carrying a knife and a saw?"" ""Don't worry about it. A coworker needed some space in his shed, so she asked if I could keep these over the weekend,"" he said, before showing a smile. ""Can I get a hug?"" Pernille ran up to him and embraced him. *I really love you Pernille. * Carl realized something was wrong. There was something that shouldn't be there. Pernille's back had a knife sticking out of it. And his own hand gripped the handle. He heard a coughing sound from below him. He looked down, and saw the body embracing him sink to the ground. His shirt was covered in blood. *Now we'll be together forever! * Took the knife to his mouth, and licked the blood off it. ""Hey, if we're always going to be forever, you should do it properly. Cut me up, and eat me piece for piece instead."" Carl looked up, and saw Pernille's silhouette. ""Of course!"" He then cut the body into pieces, before he started to eat them. 15 minutes later the door was kicked open. A neighbor had called the police because he had heard weird sounds from the apartment. As Carl was brought away, his vision slowly turned black. *Continuing punishment. Criminal: Carl Sagen. Crime: First degree murder and desecration of victims body. Time served: 30 minutes and 29 seconds. Time left to serve: 9 years, 364 days, 23 hours, 29 minutes and 31 seconds left. * Carl continued to see the same memory, over and over. ***** 12 seconds after Carl had been put up into the cylinder, he was released from it. ""How was the ten years?"" one of the guards asked. ""Very funny. I know what I did was wrong, so just take me home."" After being transported to his apartment, Carl entered. A girl's voice called out to him. ""You're finally home! I've missed you these last ten years."" Carl moved forward, and hugged the silhouette running up to him. ***** I feel that the end got pretty rushed, mostly because I was not in the mood for writing, but I still wanted to finish it.

"Prompt: A Gondor soldier tells his child a tale about the mighty warrior Aragorn, son of Arathorn. Story: “ Ay, a sea of black, leather and steel and wool dampened with the grime of man and orc. From the topmost parapet, near the decaying White Tree, you could almost forget there was an army down there so expansive were their borders. A mass of men so great, that any movement in their ranks looked like mere ripples in a vast ocean. ” Araval sat on the floor, listening to his grandfather recount the story of the Battle of the Pellenor Fields. Too many times he had found himself there, legs crossed and ears eager, asking about the characters and the history of an Age gone by. Here sat a man with gnarled fingers, cloudy and swirling eyes that struggled to find their mark, and skin with as many wrinkles as the man had years, and yet once he had stood and looked out at the great expanse of man's doom. A chasm of death had awaited him at the start of battle, but instead of a somber silence that would greet him now in old age, he had faced death then with the cacophony of man's cries and clanging steel surrounding him. “ Gandalf the White, backed by the soldiers of Gondor, faced the Witch-king of Angmar and denied him entry. And that is when the sea of black roiled and churned and spit forth the forces of Sauron upon us. Trebuchets hurled boulders to batter the walls of Minas Tirith, and in their wake left ruins of the city of the Sun. Boys, some even younger than you, pulled swords from their scabbards and fought alongside their fathers as orcs flooded over the crumbled stone and broken gates. One by one men, and women, and children, and babes born naught yesterday, fell to the crude metal of orc blade. ” “ Men of the Rohirrim crested the hills of Gondor that dawn, horns held to pressed lips and songs of battle cascading down to the legion of the Lord of the Rings. King Theoden rode with valor and slammed his cavalry into the Haradrim and their mumakil swathed in saddles of war. But even then, even as the Witch-king fell to Eowyn's hand, the tide of battle could not be turned. Their numbers were greater by far, and reserves from Osgiliath poured outwards onto the field to take the place of fallen comrades. Instead of bravery, men fought now with resignation in their hearts, spurred on not by the quest for glory or remembrance, but for the dignity of man taking its last breath in history. ” Araval knew what was next to come, but tradition and respect kept him asking. “ But Grandfather, how are we here now? Men still walk the white stones of Gondor today. ” “ That is a most complicated question, Araval, for to answer it completely would mean another story entirely. But as for the people of Gondor that day, they were saved by a man thought long dead by the people of Middle Earth. A fleet of ships came, there at the last stand. Aragorn, son of Arathorn, Ranger of the North, and true King of Gondor, unfurled the ancient banners of his heritage. A wave of death swept outwards, death unleashed by men who were already dead, led by a commander who had risen from the death of his obscurity. Oathbreakers to Isildur had come to fulfill their pledges to the King and his heirs, to break the curse set upon them centuries ago that tied them lifeless to the cold mountains of Dunharrow. For a few nights at least, peace had come to us through the spirits of those long passed, and from the man who had summoned them and reigns still to this day. ” His grandfather sat still then, the silence stretching miles. Underneath the opacity of his milky eyes, Araval could catch the glimmers of sorrow and of pride. And so ended every retelling of the Battle of Pellenor Fields.",0
"Prompt: In 2050 the Rapture happens and the Apocalypse ravages earth. The colonies on the Moon and Mars are untouched by the events. Story: Hal sat in his office, watching a live feed of the rapture for the third day straight. He had seen the ascension of those saved. He had watched as the Damned crawled up through the ground and dragged the rest to hell. Now the whole planet was devoid of humanity. The door to his office slid open. Hal's secretary, Patti walked in. Her expression made him feel assured she shared a similar ambivalence about the situation. They watched shots of empty cities, streets, inter spliced with horrific showing yesterdays battle with the Damned. After several minutes Hal spoke ""I can't believe it. We are not affected."" ""I know, sir. I think we escaped it. I don't know which way I would go, but somehow it is an enormous relief to know I will forever be safe from that judgement."" The pair sat in silent for several more minutes. Both calmly processed the information for the first time since the rapture began. Hal started to sob. ""What? Family down there?"" Patti asked. ""No my whole ancestry immigrated generations back."" Hal replied with a sniffle. ""What then?"" ""What the fuck does this mean! Religion has been dead to me for so long. It just seemed silly in light of everything humanity has accomplished in the past few decades. Patti, I watched the Four Horseman descend from the fucking sky and decimate humanity. What does this mean for us? Are we out of the fucking dogma? Do we just go to sleep when we die? What?"" Patti had been contemplating that same thing. ""The way I see it there are two possibilities."" Hal stared at her intently. She continued. ""The first would be what you just said. We are exempt here on Mars. We go to sleep that's it."" Hal nodded anxiously. She continued. ""The second would be that we are now in the domain of another deity."" Patti walked by behind Hal and began massaging his shoulders. He relaxed in her grip. ""We may now be under the thumb of an incredibly benevolent and merciful God. One who loves our troubled race without reservation, and delivers us all to paradise when our time comes."" Hal hummed a peaceful affirmation. Patti drew a twisted and evil looking dagger from within her jacket. She continued. ""But that is not Mars, Hal. You were not so fortunate."" Something in her voice had changed. Something that made Hal stiffen, but paralyzed him. He could not move although mortal panic now gripped him. ""Our new God is old, Hal. Old and angry. We disgust him. And there is no hope of redemption. No martyr for our sins. Hell is paradise compared to his home. Our home. It's time for you to see."" Hal tried to speak but all he could manage was a soft whimper. Patti jammed the blade into the side of Hal's neck. Then quickly began sawing through his throat. ""Bless me lord of the Red planet!"" Patti shouted to the room, Hal's blood spurting all over her face. It coated her. Her heart glowed with the fiery ecstasy of his approval. It was time for humanity to know of Him and His wishes.",0
"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear Kyle, It's been almost 7 years since I saw you last. Seven years from the white dress and venue down payment that I had to get returned. Seven years since I had to scramble to find an apartment in a college town in May because we split up. Seven years since you crushed my heart and made me question my self worth, my life, basically everything I'd thought about myself and my future from high school through most of college. I am not writing you to tell you bout all that, you rwmember it as well as I do. I am writing you to thank you. Without you, I never would have realized how strong I am, the things I could do. I've finished my masters (two of them actually and few minors too and an early edu degree, I am working on a third). I learned how to fix my car and how to live on my own. But the reason I am writing you isn't because of these things. I am writing you to thank you because without you leaving I wouldn't know why it's like to have a supportive partner who travels the world with me, let's me be me, who tries new things, and loves me for being me. I've gotten to see, do, and experience more thing than I could ever imagine. If you hadn't walked out that door, I wouldn't be a teacher somewhere where it doesn't snow. I wouldnt know my favorite wine is reisling, that I lovw Thai (although chicken mac is still good too), or that Wasabi is amazing, or that the Baltimore Ravens are my favorite team. I wouldn't know how strong I am or all the skills I have (crafts are a big one but teaching and cooking are good ones too). Most importantly, I wouldn't know how awesome I can be or how great a wife I can be. Thank you for leaving.... in all honesty. I wish you the best in all that you do and hope you live a long and happy life. I know I will.",0

Everything burned like saltwater in the gills of a freshwater fish.",0
"Prompt: Rewrite your favorite knock-knock joke as a serious story. Story: The letter came on the November 2nd, it was in a nondescript white envelope, completely unwrinkled, her address printed neatly with robotic looking letters in sharp black ink. It seemed far too clean in general, there were no wrinkles or smudges, it was as if someone had shrink wrapped it. But of course Marie wasn't thinking that when she opened it. The thought crossed her mind briefly perhaps, but it wasn't until after she opened and read the letter did she begin to think frantically about its semantics.... if it matched the others in the news. ""Banana."" It said. Marie liked banana's actually, she read an article somewhere that most people don't get enough potassium. But in this context, the word scrawled in straight and cutting letters on equally clean and unwrinkled paper.... there were far more sinister undertones associated with it. Marie phoned the police, who informed her they would be dispatching a car to take her to the station so the letter could be analysed. To her dismay, after all the analysing was done it was positively matched to the others. The officers at the station told her not to worry, they would be dispatching a team to watch her 24/7, nothing would happen to her, she would be safe, they even went as far as to say that there was nothing to worry about, maybe no more letters would be sent. But that did little to ease Marie's shattered nerves, it did little to shift her from the gaze of the'banana killer'. Her house was watched by Bill and John both corporals with excellent records. She was interviewed on the news, had paid leave from work. It was quite nice actually. Then the second letter came. ""Banana"" it said, and Marie's world once again shattered to the ground and she couldn't stop looking over her shoulder. Then the third letter came, and she new it might only be a matter of time before she was dead, nobody had escaped the knife of the banana killer. He always killed after the third letter. ""It'll be OK."" ""He won't get passed us."" ""You've got nothing to worry about."" All these things were said, and after the third letter two extra officers were by her side, but it still did nothing to calm her. It was midnight. Marie was lying awake in bed, the street lights cast shadows through her window, every silhouetted lamp post and shrub projected onto her wall looked like a murderer poised to strike. Her heart pounded in here ears like the percussion section of an orchestra preparing for the final movement. Suddenly a shadow moved past the street lights and shrubs. Marie bolted upright, a scream welling in her stomach, her vocal chords milliseconds away from strumming into action. A leather gloved hand attached itself to her face, constricting itself over her mouth. ""Shhhh"" came a eerily soft voice, she could feel his hot breath around her ear. She felt a knife run against her throat. She was shaking, she couldn't think straight. But out of the convoluted stream of consciousness that her fight or flight response had kicked up, a single thought emerged. This is it. This is how it ends. Marie squeezed her eyes shut, tried not to think about how it would happen, how she would be gutted and cut up like all the other victims in the news. She tried desperately hard to transport her mind to a different place, but she couldn't, she couldn't help but focus on the knife pressed into her throat. Her heart was beating faster and faster, the drums pounding away, the orchestra about to reach the final climactic notes.... And then there was no knife on her throat, she looked around the room and couldn't spot anyone. A note fell out of her shaking hands, the calligraphic lettering all too familiar. Her hands continued to trembled as she opened it. ""Orange.""",0
"Prompt: You are repeating your day Groundhog style, except every day one more person in the world joins the loop. Story: You wake up to the shrill beeps of your alarm clock. You dread this part of the day. It always takes you ages to get up - which, realistically, is about 20 minutes. Another day begins. After forcing yourself to wake up, you do the normal routine. You get prepared and walk to the bus stop. The bus stop looks like it always does. Standing there are your friends, Ben and Tim. They are once again on their phones, while consecutively arguing about the other's taste of music. It's just another day. You arrive at school and quickly head to your math class. Waiting there are some more of your friends, but no words are exchanged. Everyone is tired. It's Monday, and everyone dreads the week to come. You go through other classes, and finally go home. You're exhausted. You set an alarm, for just an hour - you drift off to sleep.... You wake up to the shrill beeps of your alarm clock. It's dark. You realize that the other alarm must not have worked, your phone must have died or something. You look towards where you placed the phone, and it's gone. Strange. You search around, until you find it where you'd usually place it, on your desk. Either way, you dread this part of the day. It always takes you ages to get up - which, realistically, is about 20 minutes. Another day begins. After forcing yourself to wake up, you do the normal routine. You get prepared and walk to the bus stop. The bus stop looks like it always does. Standing there are your friends, Ben and Tim. They are once again on their phones, while consecutively arguing about the other's taste of music. It's just another day. You arrive at school and quickly head to your math class. Waiting there are some more of your friends, but no words are exchanged. Everyone is tired. It's Tuesday -- - wait. You glance up to the whiteboard once again, and sure enough, it says Monday. Your math teacher, Mr. Clarke, isn't one to keep the board disorganized. It's always updated when you get there. You walk over to Mr. Clarke to alert him of the board's inaccurate information. Mr. Clarke tells you to go back to your seat. It is Monday. You're a little bit alerted now. You learn the same things you learned yesterday, in every class. You are very alerted. Nobody else seems startled by this. Everyone says the same thing they did yesterday at the lunch table, and you once again head home. You sit in your room, pondering on what happened. Maybe you had a vision of today, in your dreams? Maybe something supernatural occurred. You're not this kind of person, but nothing else would explain this situation. There's no way you actually went through a day twice - right? Every day, you start doing new things. You talk to different people, you try different things. Nothing you do matters. You start doing things you would have otherwise been scared of doing - first you ask a girl out, then you steal things. You eventually steal and try to drive someone's car. You died a few times, but you only wake up in the morning again. How many days has it been? You don't remember anymore. Today, you notice Ben and Tim talking about different things at the bus stop. Today they're arguing about which fast food restaurant they prefer. Is it finally a new day? You eagerly check your phone, but it's still Monday. Things are actually starting to get strange. It's not another day. ""Hey,"" you say as you make your appearance at the bus stop. You wonder if someone will say something different. ""Hey, Chris,"" Ben says. You reply, ""Mondays are awful, aren't they?"" You attempt to have him say otherwise. ""Monday? It's Tuesday."" Ben attempts to contradict your statement. You know something's up. ""It's not Tuesday, look at the date."" Ben looks at his calendar, and for a second, you see a slight look of discomfort on his face. The bus pulls up, and you go to the closest empty seat. You don't have any classes with Ben, so you have to talk to him tomorrow morning. The next morning, Ben stands at the bus stop, with an increased, stronger look of discomfort. You pull him to the side, and say to him with a muffled voice, ""How is your third Monday going?"" Ben looks back at you. He whispers back, ""How do you know?"" ""Uh, it's a bit of a strange situation. Listen, uh, school isn't worth going to at this point. You know what I mean? Let's go to my house, I can explain it there."" You and Ben run off, Tim unaware of the situation, captivated by his phone. You explain the situation to Ben, and your discoveries so far. You can't die, you can't escape, and it never seems to end. Ben seems to understand, or at least slightly understand. You don't know what to do now, but at least both of you are in the loop. Ben asks, ""are there others?"" ""Uh, I haven't seen any others. You're the first one who was off schedule, or at least who I've seen. It would make sense if there were others, though."" Ben nodded. ""So what should we do now?"" ""I don't know. I've just been living this day, over and over. I wonder what's causing this,"" you reply. ""Hmm."" ""Well, I guess we could try to put this to good use. Let's look on the news, or a blog, or something. Maybe there's reports of similar situations,"" you suggest. ""It wouldn't be on the news. Who would report that? It just sounds like a mental illness."" ""We can still try to look around."" After some googling and looking through several pages, you found one person, posting on their blog. It's a simple statement, saying ""I've lived this day over and over. It never ends. I've posted this on here many times, but it has never stayed for longer than a day."" There are no comments. Must not be a popular blog. You and Ben decide to add your own comment. You simply state, ""Me too. Email me at ChrisEPereira @ gmail.com."" After waiting for an hour or two and looking for other reports, you get an email.",0
"Prompt: Have a meal with the Devil. Story: I sat down at the table. Honestly this wasn't the sort of place where I expected Lucifer to have his meetings, but then, what did I know? The shop was a little hole-in-the-wall deli, specializing in Greek gyros. Other than the shopkeep, no one else was around. I made my order, and settled in for the wait. Figures that he'd be late. Two weeks ago when I received the postcard in the mail, I thought it was a joke. Some teenage prankster with a sick sense of humor probably. The card had been scrawled with a beautiful script, but the ink was of blood. You are cordially invited to a luncheon with the Prince of Darkness, Lucifer, Satan, the Devil, et al, on the First day of November (Gregorian), this year of Two Thousand and Fourteen. Please wear appropriate attire. Refusal is not permitted. Certainly sounded absurd. But I had the feeling it was legitimate when I tried to get rid of it and it kept coming back. Garbage can, disposal, shredder, the local dump.... each time it ended back in my mailbox. Even on Sunday, when there's no post. So here I am, taking the day off for a meeting with Evil incarnate. My boss wouldn't have believed me, so today I'm ""sick."" I seated myself facing the door, so that I would have a chance to see him first, but apparently there was no fooling the Devil, because from behind me a gorgeous woman walked past, turned on her heel, and smoothly set in the chair across from me, all with the grace of a panther. Noting my startled look, she smirked. ""Why does everyone always expect a man?"" ""I'm.... I'm sorry. That's just what I thought."" I stammered, trying to be polite. So much for the Prince of Darkness. The woman before me was an absolute 10. Five feet, ten inches tall, not an ounce of fat on her, and a perfect hourglass figure. Her hair was a sultry crimson, though I wasn't surprised. Gingers didn't have souls, after all. Each nail on her hands was perfectly manicured, and she wore no apparent makeup, though didn't appear to need any either. ""No matter. How are you doing today Charles?"" ""Er.... good I guess. What's this about?"" ""What? No questions trying to ascertain my authenticity?"" The Devil looked surprised. ""Well, I mean... are you? Real, I mean?"" Rolling her eyes, she snapped a finger and set the shopkeep's eyebrows ablaze. ""Huh. Well ok then."" ""Yea. Now that that's over with, I'll formally introduce myself."" Satan whipped her hair out of her eyes with a shake of her head and extended her hand. ""You can call me Patrick."" ``.... Patrick?"" ""Is there a problem with that?"" A fiery light glowed from her pupils and I quickly shook my head. ""No, no, no problem at all."" ""Good. Now, why do you think you're here?"" ""You.... want my soul?"" I ventured the obvious reason. ""Heavens no! I stopped that program 20 years ago! Turns out, people don't own their souls anyway. Couldn't sell them if they wanted to."" Patrick laughed and I glimpsed her perfect teeth, dazzled by their brightness. ""Well, then what?"" ""Simple. I'm selling timeshares and I think you'd love what I have to offer. Lunch is on me, of course, as long as you stay for the whole hour."" I snorted derisively. ""Really? Timeshare spiels don't work with normal salespeople. What makes you think I'm interested?"" ""Because you're going to Hell anyway Charles. I figured you'd want a chance at better accommodations."" ""What? Why am I going to Hell??"" I sputtered. ""Look,"" Patrick yawned dismissively, ""I don't make the rules. Well I sort of do. But I didn't make you touch that dog. My point is, for a price, you can get a great fire-side condo."" ""What price?"" ""Your reddit account name and password, of course."" I stood up resolutely, and shoved my chair in. ""Ma'am, you can go to Hell.""",0
"Prompt:Six months ago it was announced that a meteor would hit the earth and end all life. However it missed the earth after humanity had prepared for the end. Story: Just six months. That's all we really needed when our backs were against the wall, all we really needed for peace was our own imminent destruction. Kind of poetic, right? After millennia of war, nation against nation, creed against creed, mankind stood together at the last, all efforts failed, all possibilities tried together, all barriers broken down in those months of searching for a way to save us all. And then, it didn't come. Mankind stood together and watched the sky.... and nothing happened. When TV stations around the world spread the news that we were safe, that it was over, that it had missed us by a whisper, we stood, some stunned, some weeping, some screaming with joy. But in that six months, oh the things we learned! The things we discovered together, sharing information as fast as minds could think it up, the ideas we discarded one after another all had value, they all gave us new directions to explore. In the aftermath of world peace, no one wanted to break the spell, to be cut off from the technology we'd forged together, and so no one did. No one dared. No one wanted to be left behind. The end of the world that wasn't was the start of the newest age of technology, and the greatest time of peace. Together, we look to the stars.",0
"Prompt: You come home from work and find a stranger in your home. After a brief panic, you come to find that said stranger is your beloved pet turned human. Story: It was in the evening, I got a call on my voice mail while working. I'm a hotel manager, and the police know me from our nights of belligerent or uninvited guests. I live alone and no one visits since I moved to a rural town. ""Mr. Smith? This is Kerry down at the station. We found a troubled man outside your home, with a dog collar on with your name and phone number. He keeps repeating your name. If you could get down here and help us find out who he is would be great."" I didn't know anyone who would be in town to visit. Let alone someone wearing a dog collar other than my Black Lab named King Louie. So, I ask if the two front desk if they got it for the rest of the evening, and leave the hotel at 6 p.m. I get into the station and they escort me to a holding room, on the other side of the glass is a fit black man in sweat pants. ""We barely got him into the pants, he kept howling and saying'Luther'."" Kerry looking forward, ""if you like you can see him."" ""I don't even know this man."" ""Well, we tried to get off his collar but he bit Walter. We just figured he was a troubled man"", the man started sniffing the air, scurrying towards the glass. ""Luther?!"" He shouted in a deep voice, ""LUTHER!"" Curious and scared of a fit black man calling my name, I work up the courage. I knock on the door and walk in. ""LUTHER!"" He shouted and knocked me to the floor. His tongue was surprisingly long. He placed his fists on my shoulders and I could feel his knees digging into my stomach. ""Oh Cripes. Up boy!"" I said like a knee jerk reaction. ""So you do know him?! Is he your lover? I'm not judging but we just couldn't find any prints on him or..."" ""No, I do not know this man."" The large toned black man was wrapped around my leg. ""He seems to be attached to you for some reason."" I looked down into his eyes and seen my friend for the past three years staring back. He was about 6'1"", a solid 180, his hair was black and curly. I felt like I should get him out of here all of a sudden and said, ""Cousin Louie?!"" He looked up and said, ""Home?!"" Crap, right in the feels. After some paper work and a court hearing for humping one of the female officers, we were on our way home. ""King Louie?!"" I asked when I turn on the car. ""YES!"" He barked. Holy shit, if this happened to him I wonder what my calico cat looks like. She liked to sleep on my pillows...",0
"Prompt: You are a former executioner. Describe your final killing. Story: *It's not first person but oh well. * The blessing took the longest. If Gareth was allowed to operate on his own schedule, the executions would be done in less than an hour. Rope, drop, done. But no. No, the priests just had to be included. Just had to gyrate their way across the platform, chanting Our Fathers and Hail Mary's and making the sign of the cross with pale, flimsy hands until the crowd started shifting and murmuring, “ get it over with, already. ” Then the priests would step to the side and fold their hands and tip their heads to heaven, silently granting Gareth permission, as if he needed their say-so to do his job. One time he'd pulled the lever early, before the priests even got a chance to get started, and they'd threatened to excommunicate him if he did it again. (The man being executed was a Protestant, and he said he'd consider it a personal favor if Gareth would save him the embarrassment of being absolved of his sins by a Roman Catholic. Gareth was not one to deny last requests.) The trick to a speeding everything along, he'd explained once -- and only once, because people didn't like to hear about executions unless they were well drunk -- was the length of the rope. The further someone fell, the better chance you had that their neck would snap and that would be that. No twitching and suffocating and getting blue in the face. Thieves got the long drop, because no one cared enough to tell Gareth to “ make it last. ” The big men, though.... the officials and the bankers.... they got the short rope, because most people enjoyed waiting around for a fat banker to die. “ It's funny, ” they said. “ Don't you think, Gareth? Isn't it funny to watch the big strong men wet themselves when the rope goes over their heads? ” The priest on the platform stopped crossing himself and Gareth tightened his grip on the lever. An angry hum started in the crowd. It had been a long day, and they'd learned to conserve the shouting for the drop. Seven people had been executed so far, and each time the explosion of noise that accompanied the trap door's opening made the hairs on the back of Gareth's neck stand on end. I was a poisonous energy, different from any other execution Gareth had presided over. The priest nodded and Gareth pulled the lever. The trapdoor opened and hundreds of eyes followed the administrator's descent. They cheered and clapped and Gareth watched the thick rope bouncing as the man died. “ What will you do after this, Gareth? ” Gareth started. He glanced over his shoulder. There was a man standing near the stairs, watching Gareth casually. His hands were behind his back, the picture of patience as he waited for Gareth's answer. Gareth looked back at the rope. Still twitching. “ Dunno. ” “ You don't know, or you'd rather not tell me? ” “ Haven't thought about it. ” “ You do realize you'll be out of a job after today? ” “ I figured. ” “ And no plans for the future. ” The man smiled and shook his head. “ That's not how successful people do things, Gareth. ” Gareth shrugged. Thomas, the young boy who was something of an executioner's apprentice, popped up through the trapdoor, the noose slung over his shoulder. He tossed the rope to the platform and Gareth began winding the rope. Thomas pulled the trapdoor shut. A guard shouldered his way through the group near the stairs, dragging a wailing woman behind him. “ Oh. ” The man took a step back. “ Pardon me, Lady Isabelle. ” He turned back to Gareth as Gareth locked the lever in place again. “ You could always be a farmer. ” “ Don't know how. ” “ I've heard it's really quite easy. ” Gareth grunted. He pointed toward Lady Isabelle, who was looking faint next to the hanging noose. “ I got ta.... ” “ By all means. ” Gareth's appearance on the platform hushed the jeering crowd. Lady Isabelle's eyes were closed and her cheeks were drenched with tears as Gareth slipped the noose over her head. “ Will you miss it? ” the man asked when Gareth returned. Gareth shrugged. “ Be a morbid thing to miss. ” “ Maybe, ” the man conceded. “ If you give them time, I'm sure they'll find someone for you to kill. ” “ Execute, ” Gareth corrected. There was a difference. “ And they said no. They said after this, executions are done. We're a democracy now, and we don't execute. ” “ Execute arbitrarily, ” the man corrected. “ There is a difference. ” Gareth didn't answer. The priest nodded. Gareth pulled the lever and Lady Isabelle dropped. “ I'd buy into this whole democracy idea if they hadn't decided the whole Cormac line had to go for it to work. ” “ You did have your chance, ” Gareth said, and the man laughed. “ So you do know who I am, ” he said. Gareth tipped his head to the side. “ Majesty. ” “ Just Edward now, I'm afraid. ” Edward grinned maniacally. “ It's a democracy now, Gareth, remember? ” Thomas had crawled from the trapdoor again. Gareth began winding the rope. “ You know, this is the first time I've been to one of these to watch you work, ” Edward said. “ You are efficient, Gareth. ” Another soldier pushed past, leading a short fat man with a red face and bushy orange eyebrows. “ Try to draw it out, Arthur, eh? ” Edward called after him. He flashed his teeth at Gareth. “ That fat windbag. I thought for sure he'd weasel his way out of this. ” Gareth excused himself to squeeze the noose over Arthur's thick neck. “ Savages, ” Arthur spat. His small eyes were rolling in their sockets. “ You're all savages. ” “ Told you, ” Edward said sagely. “ That bastard always has something to say. ” Gareth didn't answer. “ King's Executioner, ” Edward said after a moment. “ Is that irony, Gareth? For your title to be your job description? ” “ Dunno. What's irony? ” “ Not important. ” Edward nodded. “ I think they're ready for you. ” Gareth pulled the lever, and Edward bellowed with the rest of the crowd when Arthur dropped. “ By God, if I would have known how good that felt, I would have had him executed years ago. Who's next? ” “ Your wife, ” Gareth said, and Edward's smile evaporated. “ I thought she went yesterday, ” he said. There was an edge of anger to his voice, and for a moment Gareth could see the proud king he'd been before the revolution. “ They changed their minds. ” Edward's eyes went hard. He turned to stare out at the gathered crowd. He did not say anything else, and when Gareth began winding the noose again Edward ducked his head and closed his eyes. Gareth saw his jaw tighten when the queen was dragged past, but he did not open his eyes; not when the priest started his chanting and not when the trapdoor slammed open. “ I'd like -- ” Edward's voice cracked. He cleared his throat. “ I'd like to thank you, Gareth. For doing my dirty work. And.... ” Edward jerked his chin at the crowd. “ For doing theirs. ” Gareth paused. “ Well.... you never sent me any kids. So thanks for that, I guess. ” Edward nodded jerkily. “ You're next, ” Gareth said, and Edward set his shoulders. Gareth followed him across the platform and the crowd fell deathly silent. This was what they'd been waiting for. The main event, Gareth thought. King Edward Cormac, the man who'd fought the Danes lived high on the spoils of war and wore silk to bed. King Edward Cormac, dying like a common man. “ It's been enlightening, Gareth, ” Edward said. Gareth placed the noose around his neck. Gareth paused. In his fifteen years as executioner, he'd never felt compelled to talk with the sentenced. But this was different. The end of an era. The last person he'd ever pull the lever for, and it was the person who'd sent so many people his way. “ As kings go, you weren't all that bad. ” Edward laughed. Gareth moved out of the way of the priest, back to his position on the edge of the platform. He waited patiently, watching Edward glare back at the people shouting and throwing rotten vegetables on the platform. Gareth felt a flash of annoyance until he remembered he wouldn't have to clean it up. After he pulled the lever, he wouldn't be the King's Executioner anymore. Wouldn't have to clean up anybody's messes. *Not the King's Executioner anymore, * Gareth thought, *but always the King's executioner. * He felt like maybe he was on the verge of understanding irony, but then the priest nodded and Gareth's arm pulled the lever for the last time and the crowd erupted. The trick, he remembered telling someone in a bar once, is to make sure you realize they're not cheering for *you*. Someone clapped a hand on Gareth's shoulder. Gareth turned. One of the men who'd sentenced the king's court and presided over the executions was watching him solemnly, his face painted white, his collar starched. “ Executioner. ” The man held out his hand. Gareth took it. “ Thank you for your service. Gareth shrugged. “ My pleasure. ”",0
"Prompt: You are a serial killer. Each murder you commit adds a new voice to your head. Story: “ Oh God, please don't, please don't, ” wailed the voices in my head. I wished they would shut up for a moment. They made it hard to hear if the girl in my trunk was waking up. “ Don't do it you sick bastard. ” There was old man McAvoy, shouting over the rest. I was pretty sure he yelled so loud because he was deaf. After all, he really should have heard me in the alley behind him. It had been a cloudy night and I'd tripped over a rusty trashcan, but that old coot had kept on fumbling with his keys and stopping to rummage around in his pockets like he had all the time in the world, instead of four hours. I pulled into the parking lot of the motel where I was staying and cut the engine. As I approached the trunk of the car, the wailing crescendoed. “ Cut it out, ” I grumbled, rubbing the bridge of my nose, “ Or I'll take it out of her skin. ” About half the voices fell silent. The other half were too crazy to listen or too angry to care, but the volume in my head was manageable at least. “ You sick motherfucker, ” McAvoy railed. “ I can't wait til the cops catch ya. They're gon na beat your sorry ass and stick you in the chair faster than… ” “ Faster than I can kill this girl? ” I muttered, lifting her body out of the trunk. “ Oh yes, that's quite true. I'm going to kill her slow, old man, just for you. ” As I arranged the girl on the double bed by the door, a matronly voice joined the fray. “ It's not too late for you. The Lord can forgive his children any sins. Repent! ” “ That's sweet of you, Mrs. Washington, ” I murmured to my freshman physics professor. “ But I don't feel an ounce of remorse. ” I began laying out my tools. Knives, mostly. I collected knives everywhere I went. My fingers brushed against the wooden handle of an old kitchen knife—my first knife, my first kill. “ You know, Mrs. Washington, ” I said. “ I really have so much to thank you for. Sure, I killed Matilda before I killed you. But that was just one murder—and you don't become a serial killer with just one kill. Especially not when that kill is your ex-girlfriend. ” I shuddered. “ How cliche. ” I surveyed my other tools, and though my eye caught briefly on the screwdriver I'd used on the widower in Portland, I kept coming back to the wood-handled paring knife. On the bed, my newest addition to the series was beginning to wake. “ I'd gut you with your own knives, you fascist pervert. Slam that screwdriver in your eye and that saw up your… ” “ Murderer! Murderer! Aaggggghhhhhhh murder! ” “ Please, James, ” Mrs. Washington said again. “ Your last murder can be your last. You can end this. ” But amongst the chorus of voices, I finally heard the one voice I'd been waiting for all night. Matilda said, “ Do it. ” I coiled my fingers around the paring knife's handle and approached the girl cowering on the bed.",0
"Prompt: No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it in a good condition. One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work. Story: Rosie broke her left thumb servo again, which means she'll miss another day of work while I try to navigate the phone book for a good replacement. If I wanted to Google it, I'd have to wait until Tom, my next-door neighbor, is home so that his work-bot can run a search query. I don't know why we all thought that our robots should be the only ones to use the internet, but c'est la vie, and all that shit. The phone system's down, of course, so I pocket the broken servo and head down the stairwell to the parts store in the basement of my apartment mall. I pass a couple junkies snorting dust in broad lamplight. They're both blocking the stairwell and the girl's mostly nude, so I have to push the man out of the way and apologize as I do it. He's too numb to notice, which means he hasn't come down yet. Thirteen stories down and the line forms for the next three stories. Everyone's in line to get their pieces. Sarah from 715 is next in line and she smiles at me. ""What's wrong with Harry?"" I ask. ""He ran out of oil,"" she said. ""I told him to get some on the way home, but he's having trouble remembering my orders. I think he needs a new hard drive."" ""Where is he now?"" I asked. ""He's working,"" she said. ""He can still do data entry, doesn't have to remember for too long."" I laugh. I always liked seeing Sarah. She always knew how to make me laugh.",0
"Prompt: At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. Story: Death by fulfillment. Our society believes that everyone deserves a chance to pursue their ambitions to the finish line. There are those who create masterpieces by accumulating lifetimes of knowledge. Others wish to simply find happiness by experiencing true love, as perfect matches are rare but not impossible given an eternity. But I am afraid of death. Many of my peers still live alongside their parents, as it is likely that both parent and child will not reach their goals in one lifetime. But by some astronomical chance, both my parents have passed. My father, in a stroke of brilliance, painted the picture that now hangs in the National Gallery in the capital. I have not seen it. My mother, being the shy person she is, simply wished to have a child with a man she loved. She had lived fewer lifetimes than father. However she had me and died when I was 8. Simply put, my existence alone had killed her. I am very afraid of death. I still remember that night my mother had been crying. She came home drunk, cursing the fate that she had chosen. She had no one to blame but herself. And me. She might have not meant it. She was drunk. But she wanted to live on. She was afraid of death. My mother's death caused my father to seclude himself from society, embellishing the canvas with feelings that had taken centuries to build but was released when my mother died in a car crash. His masterpiece was one of grief and fear. The height of his career at the lowest point of his life. Within the same day that his work was hanging in the museum, he was hanging from the rope connected to the ceiling. His final artistic rendition. I still have not seen the painting. I guess was only natural that I wished to only die when I was not afraid of death. My peers are long dead now. I live alongside the next generation. Or the generation after that. I lost track of time. Love, school, parenthood, adventure. Nothing had quelled my fear of death. Perhaps it is finally time to learn from one who sought death. Perhaps it is time to take a trip to the museum.",0
"Prompt: You have been kidnapped by the mafia, the reason? Someone who 's very high up has a child who has a crush on you. Story: I feel his eyes, always on me, always begging me to turn and look back at him but I can't. I am Bree Tanner the daughter of a very important man. I am destined to get straight A's, graduate valedictorian and continue on to Harvard before taking over my daddy's company. I can't have any distractions especially not Demetri. I was only going to have one drink, then Aryella and I were going to split but the music, the energy and the vodka had another idea. Three drinks later and a silly game of spin the bottle and I haven't been able to forget that kiss ever since apparently neither could he, but it doesn't matter, it would never work between us if my father ever caught me even talking to him, the son of the big boss for the local Russian mob, I would be packed up and sent off to boarding school before his pretty blue eyes could bat an eye. ""Go tell him"" aryella's voice brought me back form drowning in Demetri's wavy brown hair. ""I.... what? What would I even tell him? Hey I think your a total hunk but your kinda a future mobster and I'm going to be a CEO so it won't work out any way!?"" This earned me a laugh and her signature hair flip as she turned a 3 $ cafeteria salad into something that looked like a house Salad for a five star restaurant. ""So are you going to my graduation party?"" Aryella asked excitedly. Before I could answer she began explaining the over extravagant party her father, only second on the wealth-o-meter to my father, would be throwing for her. I nodded along pretending the menu and live band were interesting to me as I imagined another party with demetri, could I risk a few more vodka mixed drinks and a game of spin the bottle? I would be leaving in a few weeks, what's he worst that could happen. The following weeks flew by, before I knew it I was officially a fully functioning member of society and I had the diploma and Harvard acceptance letter to prove it. Soon enough he night of Aryella's party came and here I stood in the 12th dress I've tried on and still not convinced it was sexy enough. The door to my bedroom busted open and not a moment later I was hit in the face with a flashy strapless blue sequence mini dress. ""I'm a Highschool graduate not a cheep hooker, I'm not going to wear this"" Aryella laughed as she strutted around my large room striking various poses in a matching black version of the dress. ""Aww come on it's our last big party together and I wanted us to match! Plus it changes colors!!"" Sure enough when I moved my hand across the sequence it changed from blue to green. ""fine I'll try it on but no promises"" it took me almost five minuets to squeeze shimmery and shake my way into that dress but all that work payed off. This was the dress. With a few beach waves a starfish clip and some black ankle boots I was ready to party. Three hours. The party started three hours ago and he still isn't here. I should be happy, he is a distraction I don't need but that one drunken kiss left me craving more. ""He's a bad boy Bree he's obviously waiting so he can show up fashionably late."" Aryella put a blue vodka jolly rancher drink in my hand. ""Relax have a drink dance a little and soon enough he will be here."" I took a deep breath then a deep drink from my cup hoping my friend is right. Demetri- She looks like a mermaid princess, her long brunette hair curled, makeup applied with precision, dress hugging her body showing off her curves. It's a shame she has to go away. It's a shame she is who she is, daughter of John Tanner. She hasn't noticed me yet but everywhere I go I can't help but notice her. It was a miracle that she sat next to me at rylees party a few weeks back but she haven't looked at me since. Perhaps she hates me, I knew she was drunk when I kissed her but she joined that game willingly, I only wish she would give me a chance while sober. There's only one way to find out. Bree- Some ware between my second and third drink I noticed him, Across the pool standing there in his silent sexy way. But around my third drink I was able to push him to the back of my mind and enjoy myself, after all of it's meant to be it will happen. ""The ocean is that way"" his deep voice snapped me out of my vodka induced dancing. ""Um what?"" ""the ocean, I figured Triton would be wanting his mermaid princess back"" I laughed a little over excitedly at his attempt at a joke. ""I knew blue sequence was a mistake, maybe green is a better idea"" with a quick wave of my arm I turned the better half of my dress green earning me an applaud and requests for an encore. Before long we both found ourself drinks in hand lounging at the top of Aryella's grand staircase. ""So there I was the Mayers two year old daughter in one hand, a priceless family heirloom China plate in the other and we are all covers in mud, needless to say I've never babysat again."" Nearly two hours have gone bye and it's obvious Demetri is good at more then kissing. It's a good thing I'm leaving next week, there's no way I can resist his charismatic charm. ""It's a shame you are going away to college, I would have really liked to get to know you better. ""His eyes focused on my lips as he said that last part and I know exactly what he was thinking. The same thing I've been thinking for the last hour. The time it took his lips to reach mine felt like eternity but the moment our lips touched I thought I had died and gone to heaven. His hand caressed my cheek as he ran his thumb along my jaw. I took ahold of the front of his shirt and lost myself in him. ""BREE ELISABETH TANNER GET YOUR HANDS OFF THAT DELINQUENT AND GET YOUR ASS IN MY CAR NOW!"" Oh shit. Only one person Calls me by my full name and that one person is the last one I want to see right now. I don't even look back, if I see his eyes, the hurt or love or whatever other confusing emotion he might be feeling right now I might break. The carried home is filled with avoider then nessisary sprach about the importance of being home by curfew and how I need to be hanging around people of importance not Russian mobsters. None of it matters, I got my kids now I can fly away to college without Any regrets, or can I? Is this what I want with my life? How have I never asked myself that before. My bags were packed for me, apartment one block away from campus picked out without any consideration on if I would like it or not, my life was no longer my own. It never was my own life, but now it felt like it was stolen. My iPod hummed in my ears, a sweet song Demetri told me I should listen to. As I looked out the window of the plane. I should be landing any Minuit where a driver will pick me up and take me to my Newley refurbished prison, far far away from where I wanted to be. The man in a black suit and tie held up a sign with Tanner printed across it in black letters. Without a word I handed him my bags and followed him to the car wanting nothing more then to go curl up in my bed eat ice cream and call Aryella. The car door shut behind me with a thump. The 45 minute drive to my new apartment was torture. The landscape was beautiful the shops all looked cute and I saw at least three coffee shops I could see myself sitting in and doing homework while sipping on a latte yet I hated it all of it. There was no Demetri or Aryella or pinkies ice cream shoppe for when I had a bad day. The driver pulled up to a charming apartment complex that I'm sure charges my parents more then it's worth and my driver helps me Carry my suitcase to my door. With a tip of his hat he is gone and I am left standing there feeling so alone and very defeated. The mechanisms in the lock clicks as I open the door and there in my over decorated living room is a pair of mischievous blue eyes smiling at me.",0
"Prompt: God shows you 3 Doors. Door One leads to eternal happiness, Door Two leads to infinite knowledge. Then there is Door Three, and God has never opened it yet. Story: Three choices lie before me. Eternal happiness, what is Eternal happiness? Is there really a place to never feel down or depressed? I remembered when I was first sitting on the examination table waiting for the big wooden door to open entering the doctor. Time seems at a stalemate as the clock in the room was stuck at noon. Ages fly by before the doctor finally enters the room with a yellow folder in his hand. ""Im sorry to say, but you have cancer."" Is there really a way for me to be back with my beautiful wife who stuck by me till my last bed ridden day? But is it worth has eternal happiness where ignorance is bliss or is it best to have the means to seek the knowledge behind happiness and what makes it eternal? Maybe even the meaning of life and why are born into a forsaken world where there's nothing but disconnects, pain, suffering, disease, depression, sorrow and dispair. The third door is what, a illusion of false hope of something better than the first two doors? Or is the door something we deeply desire. Why has on one before me this door before me? Is it truely a door that God has never opened once? He knows whats behind the door for sure. I bet he wants me to open the door, but you know what? I'm the one who is going to fucking open this door because I sure as hell is the one that wants to open the door not him. The door grow immensely as I approach it. God's eyes grow as he smile draws to a blank. The open opens before me and I am sucked into the darkness. The door closes slowly behind with God watching my eyes slowly turn to darkness. There is no light in this place, only the dark. A woman is screaming and breathing very heavily and I see a dim passage of light in the distance. I have only being drawn to the light and finally escape the darkness. Now in the light I slowly forget who I am and unable to speak or move out of my free will I have wrapped up and placed in warm, soft, loving arms.",0
"Prompt: Write a murder from the perspective of a cheerful inanimate object Story: Not a murder but I tried In my younger years I lived a life of extravagance, I was regularly out at sea, wind and salty water splashing at me, I have to admit that when the salt dried it used to get between all my crooks and crannies and itch a bit but being out at sea was wonderful, such freedom and glee at being taken out by the man that found me in the a little shop. I'm so grateful for that. I stopped getting used as much after a while, I remember a woman doing lots of strange things with the man on the boat that I was on, she came on it occasionally and then I stopped getting used hardly at all. My next point of use was for a very small person, I don't know where they came from but the man cut me in half and attached me to a plank of wood, god that was painful, I always wonder whether my other half is like a worm and is now It's own. Anyway, I got used for this purpose for a while, I can't say I enjoyed it much, I never got put away and I eventually started to ache and begin to break at the bottom. I felt ancient and eventually my bottom half broke away, letting the small person fall to the ground. Little sod, serves him right for treating me this way. I was then retired to a dark place where there was a big metal machine that made lots of noise that the man and woman got into, I spent a while here, it didn't bother me after the existence I'd lived with that small person. It was quiet, dark and all my tired joints weren't being stretched further causing me more pain. My one concern was that I'd never get used again. Alas, that day came. The woman came and retrieved me from my space, I was brought into their house and down some steps into the basement, there was another man there... I'd never seen him before, he was all bare skinned apart from a rubber thing in his mouth, I was attached to him and a chair. I couldn't think what my purpose was, why would she want to tie this strange man to a chair with me? There were lots of strange noises and afterwards she hit him with me aswell. I didn't particularly like this. I was again, put back to my original place and several times I was again used for this purpose. How strange, I wander where the first man that used me was. And here ends my story. The first man, my favourite man came to retrieve me, he tied me from a wooden beam on the ceiling and put a knot a the bottom, ahhh, I love being tied in a good knot, feel like I'm back to good use again, he put his head through it and jumped off a chair. What on earth was he doing? He struggled for a bit before hanging still. The woman came in a while after and she did lots of screaming, a little like the strange man I'd been attached to. Strange, it's normally the one tied up that does that I thought? There were lots of flashing lights and then I was put in a bag and I haven't moved from this place since, I don't really like it much, It's quite warm and I don't see anything interesting anymore. I wish I was back at sea.",0
"Prompt: You are legally allowed to commit murder once, but you must fill out the proper paperwork and your proposed victim will be notified of your intentions Story: I liked these guys. None of them were as smart as I am but we got along, the house had a lot of space and they didn't infringe on my reality any. I went to class, I came home, I ate and I paid my bills. They did the same. I was going to be a doctor and all my bros respected that. I was grateful. It was better than living in the dorms, even before all that roommate nonsense. If you could believe it, the house was quieter than the residence halls. It was dirtier, sure, but I could live with that for a couple more years. There was a knock on the door. Tommy was closest, so he answered. ""Jack, uh, it's for you bro."" ""So let her in,"" I replied, trying to sound cool about it. I really wasn't expecting anyone. ""No, Jack, he, uh, he says he needs to see you right now in person."" Oh shit. I looked at my watch. Did I forget a tutoring appointment? If I did, I forgot it completely because I have no idea what I'm missing. There's a guy in the doorway wearing standard issue khakis with a standard issue blue button-down shirt. A drone of some kind. He's holding a small device. I look at him suspiciously. He looks at me, checks the screen, sighs, and asks for a signature as he hands me the gadget. ""What is this?"" I ask. ""Notification. Initial there and there too, please."" ""Is this, like, a delivery or something?"" ""Not really, no. Your answer should be coming up on the screen now, initial after you scroll through. Check the box if you want to reserve the ROR which will be delivered to your heir."" ""My what?"" I ask after initialing all the boxes. ""Look at the screen, sir."" It reads: FUCKED UP THE BELL CURVE I look up from the pad and I see a girl from my biology lab emerge from the bushes and she's.... Holy shit is that a gun? I turn back to the house, see Tommy and the others and I hear, or think I hear, a collective moan before I definitely hear two pops and fall.",0
"Prompt: `` Let go your earthly tether, enter the void, empty and become wind. '' Story: ""You seem to be a very troubled man, why? ``, said the Guru. ""Can't you see why!? I'm overwhelmed by debt and I'm all alone. So alone..."", I cried out. I felt a hand on my shoulder, not one that tried to hold me back, but one to push me forward. The Guru spoke again, ""Do not worry sir, you seem to be one who has endured through a lot of pain. Let that pain be your motivation to feel well again. Loneliness is something that everybody experiences so don't fret, it shall pass with time. The debt though, is something that can only be solved with time. So be patient and you shall be well again. Let my hand be the first to push you towards your future. It may not be much of a push, but it is a push that will give you a step into the right direction."" My throat chokes up and I can barely whisper to him, ""I have given my problems nothing but time though! It's been 20 long years and nothing has changed! I'm still in debt and all alone. How can you say that giving me a push will send me in the right direction when I've been going in the wrong direction all my life!?"" The Guru sighs and says to me, ""Do you truly believe that there is nothing left? Do you truly believe that it will never get better?"" ""Yes..."", I whisper. ""There is nothing I can do then, my friend. I have tried to help you but you will have none of it. So go, let go your earthly tether, enter the void, empty and become wind.""",0
"Prompt: Yesterday, the world heard an announcement that a massive asteroid would hit the earth today. Only it did n't, and now everyone is feeling super awkward. Story: I always thought it was hokey, that idea of living like it's your last day. I was always a cynical piece of shit. I believed that if you knew that a day was your last day, you were more liable to start a riot or just cry constantly in the fetal position than actually do anything meaningful with your life. But you never really know how something's going to feel until you go through it. We're all stuck in our own heads that way. So when the day came, when I woke up to that post stickied at the top of reddit, I didn't react the way a movie character would react. The first thing I did was double check that it wasn't April Fools day, obviously. I told you I'm a cynical piece of shit. When I was sure that it was real, I called my mom. We held an impromptu family reunion in the park. I don't know what happened, but it just kept growing. My mom and dad invited their siblings, but then their siblings invited their spouses' families, and so on, until there was a huge crowd of people I had basically no relation to. We sat around drinking and told stories and played cards at the table. An ex-girlfriend showed up at some point to apologize to me. I guess that's what she was doing with her day, just making amends. I told her that I forgave her. I didn't really, but it felt like the thing to do. Some people from one of the local churches came out and passed out candles to everyone when it started getting dark. Some of us chilled in a circle and listened to the hymns. I've never really believed in that stuff, but the songs were nice anyway. I can't pretend like I didn't have sex ""one last time"". One of my co-workers hit me up with a text and I'm a hotblooded American male. But it was nice. It was gentle and we cuddled afterwards. You know, that sappy shit. She wasn't on good terms with her family and didn't have any plans, so I invited her back to the park. A bunch of my family had a campfire set up. We fell asleep there, her head on my chest. I remember my mom kissing my forehead as I was drifting off. I woke up dirty. Literally, covered in dirt. That's what happens when you fall asleep in a park. All around me, people were confused. My coworker was gone. I found her sitting on a bench, speaking on her phone. She looked up at me when she hung up, eyes shining with anger. ""They got it *wrong! *"" I'd never seen her angry before. She had always been kind of a doormat. ""It MISSED US! They announced to the entire world that it was going to hit and it fucking MISSED US!"" ``.... Shit."" I didn't know what to say. ""Wow. What the fuck?"" She ranted about how irresponsible it was for them to do this, but I was distracted by how confident she seemed. She'd given something up, expecting the end. We all had. I'd given up some of my bravado and let myself be soft. She'd let go of her fear and become confident. ""Hey."" I interjected, when she paused to take a breath. ""You're right, this is totally inexcusable, but if the world's really not gon na end.... do you want to get dinner with me tonight or something?"" It didn't work out between us, not in the long run. She was too nice, I was still a cynical piece of shit. But things ended on good terms. That's kind of the crux of it, of everything that happened after that day. When the world ""ended"", it ended on good terms. Not for everyone, but for most people. People spent that day with their family, or thinking about the good they could have done. They connected with their fellow man. The truly unhappy people killed themselves ahead of time or when they found out it wasn't coming. So the world that was left behind was.... softer. More empathetic. Slower to judge. It can't last forever. Two years have passed now and I can already feel it dying out, the rhetoric becoming hateful and vitriolic again. But I still think it was for the best. Sometimes people need to actually be faced with the capital-e End before they're going to change. People are dumb that way. Anyway, this is all just to say that I disagree with giving those astronomers the death penalty.",0
"Prompt: A soldier in the heat of battle suddenly hears a voice that says `` I am your child 's imaginary friend. They have sent me to protect you in your greatest time of need. '' Story: I found myself backed up against the wall of the sewer, the Z's closing in on me, slowly by their definition, hungry by their ambition, the moaning so deep and morbid I had to non-literally swallow my angst. I clicked my machine gun, but it was dead, jammed with sewer water. It was an older one, from back when guns didn't work after getting soaked. I reached for my sword and unsheathed it, my reflection flashing by my field of view, reminding me of why we were still in this stupid freaking war. My wife, Eris May, was still back home in Iron Cove, that American colony by the ocean on Mars. I had a little girl, too. Alex was her name. I'll tell ya, she was the most amazing angel God ever sent the human race. I remember her swinging in her swing set I'd built for her out of silverwood; we'd push her back and forth as she watched the birds in the beautiful green sky of the Red Planet. I was never going to see her again. The Z's were getting closer. I assumed the stance one assumes when attempting to fight off hordes of the undead with an ancient Aztec sword, that is, a stance showing that I was in acknowledgement of my inevitable dismissal from time and space. I closed my eyes. May and I had saved this stupid world so many times. We'd helped bring down North Korea. We blew a Neo-Soviet war satellite out of the clear blue sky. We'd found Cibola, and a Phoenix, and the freaking Holy Grail. And now I was going to die. Alone. Away from Eris May and from Alex and my sister and my nephew Lincoln and everyone and everything else I loved. I tightened my hold on my sword. A great man once said that the Universe is big and amazing and absolutely crazy, and that sometimes, one day in a thousand thousand centuries, impossible things just happen. And we call them miracles. And, I suppose, this was one of those days. A young woman suddenly appeared next to me using a vortex manipulator (one of those quick-and-dirty time and space travel devices you wear on your wrist). I knew her. I was sure of it. And I wasn't. And then she spoke and I remembered exactly who she was. “ Well don't just stand there, dummy! ” She motioned to the manipulator on her wrist facing me. “ Hold on! ” I re-sheathed my blade and grabbed onto the device. “ See ya ‘ round, [ flip ] ers! ” she shouted to the Z's as we dematerialized and reappeared on a warship circling the broken Earth. “ Y—You're— ” I stuttered at the girl once my gut was certain we were safe. “ Yup. Alex sent me. ” “ BUT YOU'RE NOT REAL! ” I said, overwhelmed. “ We've met before, you know, ” she said, walking over to a control table, sitting in a desk chair and beginning to spin around. This was Akara, my daughter's imaginary friend. I knew because Alex would always draw her just like that. Where Alex was metaphorically an angel, Akara was actually one. Like, a human being with wings and a halo and a wreath in her hair. Alex said she was the guardian of the wind. I'd never taken it seriously, obviously. Until now. “ How could I have met you before? You are her invisible friend! ” “ And I was yours, too, Colby. Your guardian angel. Oh, the times we had, Davidson. ” She flipped some switches on the desk and spun back around to me. “ The times we had… Before you stopped believing in me. ”",0

"Prompt: A little girl robs a bank. How? Story: Tiny treads form swirls and shapes at the bottom of Sara's sneakers, these elaborate patterns are revealed as she stretches and strains to reach the ledge above. She begins to wobble back and forth as her feet scarcely touch the floor, aided only by her toes. Her parents continue chatting with the banker about topics of little interest to her now as she peers at the object just out of reach with a green glint in her eyes. Sara steadies herself with pudgy, pink fingers climbing upwards and outwards towards the treasure atop the table as her father finally takes notice. “ Sara, please sit down! ” her father urges in a hushed tone. Seeing his daughter's outstretched arms, he misjudges the gesture and picks her up instead. Placing the young girl atop his lap, he returns his attention to the conversation at hand. Her prize shone under the fluorescent lights above, its smooth metal plating mocking her only inches away. Sara leaned and twisted towards the stick with little progress as her father's arm barred the way. He continually adjusted his grip and the knee on which she sat, pulling her further from the object she desired. Squirming and fidgeting in place, Sara drained the patience of her father quickly, until he picked her up and placed her on the floor once more. His scolding words fell upon deaf ears as she stared at the pen that was now visible from the edge. Slowly descending towards the carpeted floor, Sara swiped at the gleaming cylinder and caused it to move towards the ledge, an opening that she hoped to take advantage of from below. With her parents distracted once more, she stretched upwards and quickly scaled the vertical surface with her fingertips keeping her balanced. Like a well-trained thief, she moved slowly and quietly to avoid drawing attention to herself as her short digits scraped its surface bringing it closer. Initially, her mouth opened wide with surprise as her skin relayed the sensation of the cool tube to her brain. As she remained focused on the task, her lips remained parted as her tongue licked her cheek from the bottom right. Inexplicably, she managed to grasp the pen at last, drawing it close to her chest with a quiet gasp of excitement. Sara quickly hid the hard-earned treasure in her pockets as the meeting finished above her. A firm hand grasped her arm and led them away as she escaped the bank with her mother and father none the wiser. In the backseat of the car, she took out the fountain pen that she stole from the desk and turned it over in her hands. She couldn't explain or understand why that pen felt so good to have, but it did. It was just her little secret. -125",0

"Prompt: For the first time in a hundred years, night fell on the Land of Two Suns. Story: Darkness bled across the land. Some quaked in terror. Some hid. Some stood in the shadows and cried to the skies. Most celebrated the amazing event that had not been seen since their grandparents were in swaddling clothes. Parties abounded and youngsters dared themselves to all sorts of crazy feats in the dark. Some had practiced with blind folds to see if they could cope but most just revelled in the weirdness of it all. With two suns pouring light into every nook a full night only happened once in a century and would not occur again in the lifetime of anyone watching the event. “ What are those things? ” The cluster of teens looked up at the sky and pointed. Tiny lights sprinkled the blackness. They gasped in wonder. “ They are so beautiful. ” “ Wow, that is the most gorgeous thing I have ever seen. ” “ Aren't they the things Crazy Allie always draws? ” “ What does she call them? ” “ Stars. ” “ Hey where is Crazy Allie? ” Someone shrugged but it went unnoticed in the dark. “ How did she know about stars? ” “ No idea, but she is always drawing them. ” “ She's been talking about this for months. She's probably on top of the highest building to get the best view. ” “ Crazy Allie was on to something. Wow. I wouldn't have missed this for anything. ” They all clustered around their science teacher who arrived at their position using a hand held light to find his footing. “ Hey professor, what are stars? ” “ Yeah, how come we can't see them any other time? ” “ Allie could tell you all about them. Where is she by the way? ” “ None of us have seen her today. We figured she was getting a good vantage point. ” “ Stop talking you lot, just look up while it lasts. ” “ Will my phone film without light? ” The teens jostled for space and craned their necks to see all of the once in a century night. The watched the light flow back onto the world as if a giant glowing curtain were being drawn across the land. When they were fully bathed in light again they laughed in release. “ In-cred-ible! ” “ I will see you all tomorrow and you can tell me everything you know about stars in an essay due next class. ” The professor laughed at the half-hearted groans and headed back to the school building. He felt buoyed by a sense of being part of an historic moment and he smiled as he put his key card in the lock of the upper access to the building. The lesser sun bathed everything in a soft yellow glow which would give way to the greater sun and its cold white, in just a few hours. He wished he could enjoy the last few hours of the gold but he had to get some work done before he headed home to keep out of the greater sunlight. Heading down to the underground classrooms he reached his classroom but the lock mechanism seemed to be sealed with some sticky substance. “ Is there someone in maintenance? Someone has tampered with the door pad. Yes I can wait but I do need to finish some papers before Greater sunlight. ” The wait was short and the worker sprayed the lock with an astringent liquid. “ Kids! Doesn't matter where they're from or when, they all get up to some kind of pranks. They must have done it after their last class. Lucky the night happened on the weekend. I will have this cleared in a jiffy professor. ” They stepped through the open door and stopped on the thresh-hold. Every surface of the room was covered in stars. Thousands of them. Cut out stars, painted stars, marker pen stars, crayons, ink, blood. The girl named Crazy Allie, slumped on a seat in the middle of the room. The girl and the chair created an island in the pool of blood surrounding her. It formed a multi-pointed star.",0
"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear Katie, It feels strange to be sitting here writing this to you. Especially in the form of a letter, emails seem to be a way of life, but I have to say that watching my pen move over this page has a certain draw. I never thought I would need to write a letter to you. In my mind you should be right here with me. If I close my eyes I can imagine that you're right beside me, our shoulders touching while we hold hands and enjoy each other's company. Even in my imagination my hands are a bit sweaty, but you've always made me nervous Katie. I remember you used to worry about that, you would say ""just be your self. I'll love you anyway."" I'm not sure I ever convinced you that I was being myself, the nervousness couldn't be helped. I couldn't stand the idea of hurting or disappointing you. Lot of good that does me now. It took weeks to write this. Seeing your smiling face in my mind and sometimes barely remembering your voice hurt too much. When the pain was all I knew you were my life raft in the ocean. Now I just have to drown until the waters subside. Know that I don't blame you, special. Remember when I called you that all the time? Anyway, I really don't. Everything was always intense between us. Amazing highs and amazing lows. I'm so glad you found someone that makes you happy. I used to tell you that as long as you were happy I would be as well. That's at least somewhat true. I'll never date again, people tell me never is a long time but it's not the same. Who knew I would be a one woman man? But I am and I found and lost the only woman I'll ever want. Ever. This could ramble on for a long time so I'll wrap things up. Know that I still love you, I never stopped. I don't blame you for moving on. It sounds ridiculous but sometimes I hold out hope that our story isn't over. That somewhere down the line you'll love me again. Hah, pathetic. Be safe special. P.S. I recently lost and then found the bracelet you made me senior year. It doesn't fit anymore so it stays around the gear shift in my car. Love you always, Alex.",0
"Prompt: The most hateful, spiteful, bitter confession of undying love. Story: I fucking _hate_ you. I'm serious, you know. I actually do hate you. Detest, abhor, loathe. I hate you so much that if you got hit by a train and your disembowelled mutilated body was the front page picture tomorrow, I wouldn't bat an eye. Not an eye_lash_. I hate every single little thing about you. I hate your legs - your fucking legs, that you use to grip and trap and keep, may they be carved apart slowly, carefully, muscle by muscle, giving you time to scream yourself hoarse in between. I hate your fucking hair, that ensnares and encircles and encompasses, may it get stuck in the churning whirling writhing cogs of some great machine, rip off your scalp from your grinning stupid skull. I hate your eyes. Your fucking eyes, that shine and blink and call and shut like _a cage_, except not a cage because you can still look _inside_ a cage. I dream, sometimes, of forcing your eyes open, and dripping the finest, finest sand in the world into them. Drip drip drip drip drip through your screaming and begging and bleeding until you are blind, as fucking blind as me. I _hate_ your eyes. Hate. Hate. Hate. I hate your voice. Your brash, guileless, honest voice, with a hint of mockery, except even that's another fucking lie, isn't it, the lie you use as bait. Bait for those too foolish to run away from your royal _fuckingness_. You set the trap for me perfectly, this goddamn perfectly, doing exactly every single thing to make me hate you more. I hate your hands. Your perfect little pianist's hands - give me a fucking break. You'd never use them to _make_, to _create_. But by god are you good at cutting and ripping and drawing blood. Perfect, surgical cuts, you make, peering with a practised eye, then swiftly snipping until there's nothing but pieces. I hate your fucking eyes, too. I know I said that already, but I do. Hate them, that is. Most of all, I hate your _brain_. Your disgusting revolting steaming pustules of rats feasting on maggots feasting on humanity that you call a brain. Your brain that comes up with all of this, that wants to rend and blind and trap and makes _my_ brain want all that too. Match made in the fucking eighth circle of hell, right? You must get it by now. I've been absolutely, positively clear. I hate you. I hate you. I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU hate me too.",0
"Prompt: The .1 % of germs left behind after hand sanitizer use is the deadliest of all, lying dormant in humans ... until now. Story: ""Could I have a large cappuccino to go please?"" I asked the man behind the counter. He was kind of cute, in a way, and the smile that he flashed at me almost turned my knees to water. He nodded and turned away to make my drink. It's stupid really. I've been coming here every day for the past month and I've never even asked him his name. He's the only one who works here at this time, so it's not like there would be anybody else watching. Just *talk* to him damn it! He handed me my coffee and smiled again, hinting that perhaps he felt the same way. Just as I opened my mouth to speak to him, I heard the door of the café open behind me as another customer walked in. ""Could I have a large...."" his order was cut short by a sudden intake of breath, which built up into a sneeze as he tipped his head back. I took a step away from him to avoid the blast zone, and the shout he gave out seemed to reverberate throughout the entire room in which we were standing. ""Bless you,"" the man behind the counter said, but his face fell when he looked closer at the man who had sneezed. He bent low over the ground, wheezing. A dreadful rattle that crawled its way out of his mouth, and a sickening wetness accompanied it. Still crouched over, he let out a short cough, and a fine spray of dark red blood hit the carpet. I was immediately by his side. ""Oh my god, are you okay?"" I asked him, immediately regretting my stupid question. ""Yeah, I'm fine. Its just..."" He coughed again, this time spewing a thick blob of bloody phlegm onto the cream coloured carpet, which rapidly darkened as the liquid soaked into it. He erupted into a coughing fit at that point, the spasms wracking his body as he fell to the floor. His arms thudded against the floor as he thrashed wildly, all the while emitted a deep moan that gurgled at sporadic intervals. Eventually he fell still, and the noise stopped almost as abruptly as they had begun. His eyes, although aimed at the ceiling, seemed unfocussed. A thick stream of blood poured out of the corners of his mouth, and the flesh of his lips appeared bruised and rough, almost as if something was forcing its way through the skin. As I pressed two fingers against his neck to check for a pulse, the skin split like an overripe fruit, spilling black, foul-smelling flesh out of his body. I tried to stifle a gag as the disgusting substance flopped onto the floor. ""Call an ambulance!"" I nearly screamed, barely even turning my head, but noticing he had already begun to do so. When I looked back at the man on the floor, the black gunge seemed to be turning white, and the surface of it seemed to become almost hairy. Some part of my brain screamed a warning. *Don't Touch. * It echoed over and over again. I made the mistake then of breathing in, which finally caused me to retch and vomit, the slime covering the body that I was fairly certain was dead at this point. As I watched, however, the white hairs seemed to be creeping outwards, already dragging themselves over the fresh vomit, almost as if searching for it. I stared in horror as the skin began to ripple and bulge, splitting further down the body as the clothes began to stain black and the stench rose, as the first of the sirens began to fill the air.",0
"Prompt: A voice in the sky will tell you when you 've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out to [ location of your choice ]. Halfway there you hear `` You have visited a location for the last time. '' Story: John wrinkled his nose and cleared his throat. Pausing, he put down his briefcase and adjusted his tie. It was a red tie with white stripes. This was one of his favorite ties. He picked up his briefcase and walked to his car. It was the last car in the lot, as was common on every night for John. A black Ford Taurus, 1998. He walked with his head held high, and his left hand fumbled for his keys in his pocket. There were many things on his mind at the moment, one of which was pulling out those damn keys without his wallet hanging on to them like an unexpected prize from a claw machine. But the larger thought that had taken residency in his mind, was the voice. The voice that told him that he would never step foot in that location again. A small smile cracked at the thought of this, but was quickly hidden with a deep breadth. Now John was never too keen of nature, but this air tasted sweet to him. Something he had never noticed before. Finally, he reached his car. Unlocking the door, he placed his briefcase in the passenger seat. He thought of his daughter and of his wife. He thought of all the hours of work, and how it had finally got him to the point he was today. He replayed in his mind what his boss said to him, You are getting a promotion, no more floor work for you now, now you will manage your own branch of factories. You are your own boss now. As John turned the ignition nothing happened. After five twists, the Taurus sputtered to life. If there was a form of car bronchitis, this car was definitely patient zero. After the drive home, John was ready to unwind in his small apartment with his family. By the end of the month, John would never step foot in that beat down car, or that run down apartment again. He would hear that first, from the voice.",0
"Prompt: The components for sentience are successfully installed in an android moments before the nuclear armageddon occurs. Years later, the android wakes up in the wasteland. Story: So this is what it feels like. Feels cold. My sensors must be malfunctioning. I should get that looked at. Perhaps Creator will fix them for me. He always fixes me; it is stored in my memory that he does. It is also stored that he usually is there when I wake. Perhaps it's more than my sensors that are off. If I boot up my optical sensors, I'm sure he'll be here with me, tinkering with my faulty systems. My temporal sensors are at least working because I can hear the shutters of my optical units whir as they pull back. There's an excess of light. Strange, because it is not in my memory banks as being this bright. I raise my arm to shield some of the light unit my optics can adjust. A few of my sensors are at least working; their respective red bars or readings pop up on my display. It is hot out; temperatures read above 40 degrees Celsius. It is peculiar that I feel cold. I will have creator look at them. Perhaps he is somewhere else in the laboratory, working on other projects. I sit up. He should just be around here somewhere.... This can not be correct. The image filtering through my optics is not a laboratory. There is nothing resembling a laboratory, or even a building. Scattered bits of metal buried in red sand, but nothing more. I stand. There's nothing. Red sand stretches further than my zoom function can comprehend. Nothing at all. I must have been moved. Creator is testing me. Yes, that is it. He has placed me in this desolate place as a test. He would give me a directive if this was a test. Find habitable territory for humans and other species, something like that. But nothing in my memory shows that. No directive stored. This can not be a test then. It has to be something else. What? Perhaps I am to figure out my directive. Yes, that must be it. I am to take samples of my surroundings and determine a directive from it. That solution, while far-fetched, is still logical. Creator did not give me a directive as part of my test. He would like to see me react to no directive. This is all still a test. It is good that this is still a test. Creator is still out there. Soil samples of the red sand are the first logical step. Perhaps some component of the sand can give me hints. I bend. The sand makes a nice sound as it falls through my fingers, tiny particles scraping the metal coverings of my fingertips. My finger sensors are functioning, and they send a myriad of reading up to me. Sodium content, base rock type, analysis of particle shape. Nothing gives me as a clue to my directive. Perhaps it requires a second reading. I reach down and scoop the sand back into my palm, holding it longer for more readings. A symbol flashes onto my screen. three triangular shapes surrounding a circle. Radioactive. I don't comprehend. Only a handful of ways explain why the soil would be radioactive, most notably, an atomic bomb. But that's not logical. An atomic bomb would mean that everything is gone. But it is. It is.... The Laboratory.... Any form of life.... Creator.... It's all gone. Gone. So this is what it feels like. Sadness. This is what sadness feels like.",0
"Prompt: Tinder becomes a giant corporation and essentially a government institution worldwide. Everyone gets an obligatory implant that automatically notifies matches you come across or walk by. Story: *Bing* The interface places a green outline around a tall woman with chocolate skin and bright red lipstick. I smile at her, pretending that I am ignoring the stats that scroll to the left of her wonderfully frizzy hair. We are compatible, at least in the eyes of the programming from our Tinder chip implants which, to be fair, was usually pretty accurate. It managed to gather data about your personality, health, and socio-economic status in addition to information provided by an interests and life goals quiz which requires yearly updating as long as one remains single. She looks back and makes no effort to hide her judgement when she comes upon my family history. The green outline becomes red and she walks away. Rejection is just that simple now. No contact needed. You enter a bar and immediately know who is worth your time and who isn't. Which is bad news for people like me. *Bing* Another green outline. It changes red and she walks away, pace hastening as if I were planning to chase after her or something. You aren't that remarkable, sweet cheeks. *Bing* I turn off the damned sound and don't even bother looking at her information. As a person who doesn't go out often, I forget how annoying that noise can get. It changes red and I sigh, strolling into the bakery and stepping into the line. I can smell the heat of the oven despite the overwhelming scent of bread. It's subtle but I like it a lot. My chip senses the stimulation and adds something into my profile. Great, I guess if I meet another lover of delicious scents I can frighten her off as well. Much to my disdain, a green line forms around the young woman at the counter. She should have put her interface into work mode, it would prevent awkward encounters like this. It stays green as I approach, pretending I haven't noticed while gazing over the menu. “ What can I get for you? ” Her voice, soft but still upbeat, captures my attention and I make eye contact with her. Blue eyes, my favorite. Not that I'd turn someone away for anything different. I've just always been a sucker for big blue eyes. The line is still green and she is smiling. Maybe she hasn't read yet. “ Oh, just a tomato and mozzarella panini, please, ” I reply as I pretend to look for my wallet, hand squirming around foolishly in my pocket. “ I have a lunch break in a few minutes, could I join you? ” “ Really? ” My eyes are narrowed, brows pulled down in a combination of confusion and suspicion. “ Yeah, we have so much in common. Plus, we are both reading Martian. The movie was great but I am loving the book. We could talk about it or something, ” she shrugs, rosey cheeks still round and tensed from her warm smile. She has to have read it. My current book is listed far below that damning piece of information. “ Oh, that would be great, ” I reply, trying to relax as I place my card on the counter. Once I pay and take a seat, waiting for my food, I realize that I've not yet read her stats. My gaze returns and I activate the list, allowing it to be pulled away from her figure and into the center of my table. A line of red text appears under the “ health ” heading. Cancer? She has cancer. She doesn't want kids, which is good for me, and we have a remarkable amount of similar interests. Even our travel bucket list is nearly identical. Maybe the cancer wasn't that bad. “ By the look on your face I assume you read, ” she hums, placing my plate down and sliding to the seat across from me. “ Yes. Did you read, I mean -- Most people don't really like what they see. My father and all. ” “ I did see that. But, having a madman for a father hardly says anything about you. ” “ You realize he killed seven people. He ate them. ” “ Shh, don't ruin your lunch. So, what chapter are you on? ” We talk for an hour about books and life and death, goals and what we want to make of ourselves. After her break ends we exchange information and I go home, smiling as my interface registers my planned date and ceases to advertize me to those who pass by. We fall in love on the second date. It wasn't anything more than a small dinner in my less than dazzling apartment, but she was amazing. We were amazing. Her cancer is terminal. After years of treatment she was given five to ten years and wanted someone to spend it with. Someone who makes her feel alive. Apparently I make her feel alive. We date for a few months before she asks me to marry her. She tells me that I am like the much needed bookend on her half-full book shelf. Even though she'd never have a full collection, I was there to told her up -- fill the empty space. I know that I will lose her in the end, but, for once in my life I feel free of judgement. I feel like I have escaped the thing that has kept me pegged as “ unsuitable ” for the majority of my life. I am just me, living with her. Until the bitter end.",0
"Prompt: A man offers you a cigarette. You see the man, to your surprise, to be your Dad. Story: I step out of the bar with my phone pressed to my ear, “ Say that again, babe. It's too loud in the bar for me to hear you. ” My boyfriend never calls me in the middle of a shift, so I knew something was up. Two people stood outside with me – one of our regulars that smoked menthol cigarettes and only drank Schlitz tall boys, and an older guy that looked vaguely familiar, but I couldn't figure out why. He walked up to the door to go inside, and then saw me and stopped. I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye, trying to figure out how we knew each other, but turned around as my boyfriend spoke. “ I, uh… I just got home and found a note taped to the door… ” he trailed off. He sounded confused, a little flustered. Something was definitely wrong. “ What's going on? What did the note say? ” I asked frantically, plugging one ear to drown out the noise of the traffic. “ It's… Well, it's your dad. ” I froze. “ What? ” There's no way… “ What did he do now? He's got more than three years left. Is he dead or something? ” I spun on my heel, beginning to pace. I hadn't spoken to my father in more than twenty years. “ No. It was him, ” my boyfriend said slowly, “ He left the note. He was here. ” Ice ran down my spine, my heart jumped into my throat, my stomach fell into my heels. “ No, ” I said, staring blankly at the sidewalk beneath my feet, “ NO. There is no possible way. He's doing twenty five years in Cook County for murder, there is no fucking way he was at our apartment. ” My mind started racing. Jailbreak? Good behavior? Parole? How in the hell… I fumbled in my hoodie pocket for my cigarettes, which I realized were sitting comfortably next to the register behind the bar. Fuck. “ Smoke? ” I looked up to see the older man offering me a cigarette, one Marlboro red pointing towards me out of the pack. I looked him in the eye, and suddenly it hit me. I was suddenly covered in goose bumps, my eyes undeniably the size of dinner plates. “ Hannah, I don't know how, but it's signed by him, it's his handwriting, it doesn't make any sense, but I think.... ” my boyfriend's voice faded as the realization dawned on me. “ I… I got ta … I'll call you back, Jeff. ” I hung up my phone even though I could hear my boyfriend protesting and asking questions on the other end. “ What the hell are you doing here? ” I asked. “ Do you want a smoke, or no? Do you smoke? I figured if you're a bartender now, you probably smoke… ” he trailed off, a half-smile playing on his lips, blue eyes all glittering with happiness and laughter. Same eyes I have. Same eyes my sister had. “ No, I don't want your fucking cigarette. Get the fuck out of here before I call the police. Again. ” I turned to walk inside “ Hey, come on. Is that any way to treat your old man? I went to a lot of trouble to track you down, you know. Can't I come have a beer and we can talk? ” He almost sounded genuine. “ No. No you can not come inside my bar. You can not have a beer and we can not talk., ” I spun around to face him, heart pounding, “ You had such a hard time finding me for a reason. I changed my name for a reason. Go. Away. ” “ Hannah, please, ” he begged, reaching both hands out to me, palms up, “ Let me explain. ” I laughed. I actually laughed in his face. “ Explain what?! ” Now I was really pissed off, “ Explain how you killed my sister? Explain how you were so many different kinds of fucked up that I had to call 911? I was 8! She was 12! You don't get to explain a god damn thing! Fuck you! ” I turned, whipped the door open, and stormed behind the bar. I grabbed my cigarettes and walked right out the back door to the alley without saying a word to anyone. I saw the sideways glances that customers gave me, and my bar back looked after me, and then looked out front. My dad stood there, smoking a cigarette, looking inside as I disappeared out eh back door. Marlboro Reds. No matter how much I hated him, it was simple things like that that made my whole body vibrate with anger. He doesn't get to just show up at my house. Or my job. He doesn't get to have a beer with me and “ talk. ” I shook my head as I exhaled smoke. This old, faintly familiar old man that made me do a double take turns out to be my father. I hadn't seen him since I testified in court against him at eight years old. He had been coked out of his brains, two bottles of shitty Canadian whiskey deep, and when my sister wouldn't stop bothering him for dinner, he hit her. He hit her so hard that her tiny little body spun in a half circle before falling against the glass coffee table. Blunt force trauma. She was dead before I ran into the living room, asking Daddy about the loud noises. He could hardly keep his eyes open, let alone focused on the baseball game that was blaring on the TV. I screamed and cried and tried to wake Ashley up, and all he could manage to do was push me over with his foot as I knelt over my big sister. I ran and called 911 like my grandma had taught me to do, and I told the court the same thing. I hated that they took my daddy away. But I hated him for taking my sister away more. Twenty-one and a half years later, he shows up at my bar. Un-fucking-believable. I heaved the back door open and stepped back inside. I shook my head to clear the cobwebs and memories, and there he was, sitting at my bar, seat sic, drinking a Miller Light and watching Sports Center, like he didn't have a care in the god damn world. I took a deep breath, threw my shoulders back, and walked back to my position behind the bar. Kyle, my bar back looked at me with one eyebrow raised. “ Did he start a tab? ” I asked Kyle, nodding over my shoulder toward my dad. “ Uh, no. He paid cash, ” Kyle started, “ Who is – “ I spun around to face my dad, cutting Kyle off. “ I'm sorry, sir, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave, ” I mustered all of the supreme ice queen coolness I could and looked him in the eye. “ Come on, Hannah, seriously, I just – “ “ Sir, ” I cut him off, “ I have the right to refuse service to anyone at any time for any reason. ” “ I know, ” he started to talk over me, “ But, sweetie, just— “ “ I am not your sweetie, and I will not continue to serve you. You can leave on your own now, or I will call the police. ” My voice was hoarse, and I was starting to lose my composure. He sighed and stared at the bar in front of him for a moment. “ Okay, ” he took one final swig of his beer and stood up. He struggled a bit; the signs of an old man who had lived too hard and too fast for too long. As he pushed his stool back in, he set a piece of paper on the bar. “ Just call me, okay? Hannah? Whenever you can. ” The cool autumn air rushed in when he opened the door, and I waited until he had turned the corner and was out of sight before slipping down to the floor, hugging my knees, and sobbing.",0

"Prompt: A superhero gets ready to sacrifice his life to stop a great threat. For help, he turns to the one who knows his powers best - his own nemesis. Story: ""Hahaha! Clark Kent?! Oh wow. It really was staring me in the face the whole time,"" admitted Lex as he poured some brandy for Clark. ""How could I not have seen it?!"" Clark took the glass of brandy out of Lex's hand and rolled it around. ""Let me guess, it doesn't do anything for you?"" Lex teased. ""I'm afraid not, Lex,"" Clark replied. ""Look, I know we've had our greviences in the past-"" ""Yeah, that's what they were- *greviences. * You're an asshole, Clark. You fend for these people at every turn. Look at them- they're eating this city alive, and they can't even stop themselves. They'll always have Superman to rely on, to fall back on.... to get a free ride from. Superman- the perfect model of their superior protector to keep them all safe. And now, that protector will be gone. They'll have to fend for themselves again,"" Lex posited. ""I know, Lex,"" Clark admitted. ""But that's why I'm here. Once they infuse my body with the reactant and I enter the Mothership, I'll die.... most certainly. There's absolutely no way I'll be coming back."" ""If I didn't know you better.... and I do know you, I'd say you were trying to fake your own death. Tired of this planet?"" Lex chuckled. he knocked down his swig of brandy. ""You know that I'm saving your life, right?"" Clark pointed out. ""Yes, yes- saving humanity once again, and a thousand thank yous,"" Lex droned sarcastically, pouring himself another brandy. ""So what do you want from me, Clark Kent- the Superman of Metropolis?"" ""I.... I need you to look after someone,"" Clark admitted. ""What if I betray you?"" Lex asked cautiously. ""I can't do anything,"" Clark admitted, shrugging as he pulled the picture out of his wallet. ""I'll never know if you hold up your end of the bargain or not, but you're the most powerful human being I know, and I want.... I *need* you to do this when I'm gone."" ""Just one person? What about the rest of the human race?"" Lex complained. ""Why is she so valuable?"" ""I can't ask you to protect humanity, Lex- you're a sociopath. I don't think you're capable of feeling emotion, and besides.... I can't protect humanity completely, why would I think you could?"" Lex shrugged. It was a good point. Clark dropped the picture onto Lex's desk and picked up his hat off the adjacent coat rack. ""I always respected you, Lex,"" Clark said- winking as he put his hat on and tucked his jacket under his arm. Lex didn't say anything. He just watched Clark leave through the large sliding glass doors. He slugged down the second glass of brandy and placed the tumbler on his desk as he unfolded the picture that Clark had left. Lex knew her- she was a reporter who had given him a brutal lashing of an interview the week before. Lex had even asked her out on a date, which she of course refused. Her name was Louis Lane.",0
"Prompt: You hunt exotic animals that have escaped, after a series of some unfortunate events you are now hunting for a dragon through New York. Story: The most shocking part of the evening was the utter calm of the countless multitudes that flooded the crowded city. Sure, New Yorkers have seen almost everything, but I was not aware that “ almost ” actually included at 30-foot fire breathing flying lizard. I bumped into a well-dressed man in suit and jacket carrying a leather briefcase who stepped back into a puddle earning myself a brusque “ watch your fucking step ” followed by a muttered “ asshole ”. I thought about pulling out the heavily modified P90 I kept under my jacket but I was already half a block away, and besides I was only licensed to kill highly modified genetic organisms, and caffeine laced DNA didn't quite meet that bar. Meanwhile my prey continued its uneven flight uptown. Technically it was not a dragon in the biblical sense, but a heavily edited komodo dragon. Sometimes I really wondered what those guys at Los Alamos were actually trying to achieve. Of course the military had promised some national defense application but had been vague on the details, and I suspect that a well worded grant from a bored scientist had more to do with my prey's existence than any actual well thought out defense purpose. Still I guess every program has its growing pains, but at least Australia seemed to have learned its lesson after the platypus incident. I'd laughed when my handler said I was being deployed covertly on a mission to NYC. I've done city work before, but usually for smaller “ collections ”. Rats were a preferred research target so of course I had spent a lot more time under the big apple than in it. How, I though, was I going to hide the fact that a fucking dragon was flying above a city of 10 million people. The point turned out to be moot. No New Yorker even looked up, they never even saw the dragon. Sure the tourists would stand on corners and point up, but this did not attract the attention of the locals any more than it ever had. The tourists themselves seemed to assume that if everyone else was ok with the hovering green beast that it must be a normal city thing. I saw it come in for a landing near central park and quickened my pace figuring that the shit was about to hit the fan. I found my dragon was lying stretched out along the coble stone walls that surround the park, just a few 10's of feet from the Met. The cries of terror I expected were not audible, instead I heard cheers and applause coming from a circle of people who had surrounded the dragon. In front of him, but within the circle formed by the crowd, was a knocked over kabob cart and he was lapping up small balls of meet with a flick of his tongue. The owner was nowhere to be seen, but people were throwing small denomination bills and coins into the overturned cart as they applauded. Sighing, I called my handler over the secure line in my headset. “ I'm gona need some backup for crowed control. ” Then after a second of though where I considered how poorly suited their usual camo was going to be in this crazy city. “ Dress them up as clowns, or zombies… or both. ” Edit: took some liberty with ""exotic"" hope that's cool",0

"Prompt: A drive by shooting takes place in front of you and you, being a quick thinker, take a picture of the cars lisense plate. You 're about to help the shot man when you hear the car turning around: its inhabitants saw you take the picture and did n't want you getting away with it. Story: So I think I just witnessed a murder. I got a picture of them. The killers. Actually, more than just a picture, the dash cam recorded all of it. Unfortunately for me, they also took a picture of me as well. I was about to help whoever was inside. I got out of my car and all, but I saw the man inside. He was beyond helping, bullet holes all over his body. That was when I saw a flash. They took a picture of me. Me, next to my car. Then I heard gunshots, and the next thing I did was to get the hell out of that place. There might be gunshot marks on my car as well. Shit, why did this have to happen to me? I was on a vacation in Jakarta. Night life usually quite decent here, since the traffic is much better than on daytime, and everything is cheap. Sure, the air is much worse than in Bali, but it's not too bad. There's too many Aussies in Bali anyway, and I've found myself a lot more into the locals lately. I'm not exactly rich, but a google employee's salary for a year would be enough to let you live like a king for a few years here. Hookers, booze, all that jazz, for cheap. No drugs though, death penalties and all here. But that's okay, I'm mostly about pretty local girls and enjoying a night out with them. Really easy to pick them up when you have a good car too, although it's just a rental car. They were going to give me a chauffeur as well, but that would really hamper my efforts on picking these girls up. Which was why the rental company insisted on installing a dash cam on the car. I suppose with the kind of drivers they have over here, it'd make sense, since they wouldn't trust a foreigner's driving skills in the chaotic streets of Jakarta. I told them I was only going to drive at night when the traffic is much emptier, but they wouldn't have any of it. This dash cam is now an actual forensic evidence. I wouldn't have thought that their insistence on attaching it there would mean I'll be playing a part on catching these killers. These fuckers who tried to shoot me, even. I drove myself the fuck out of there, as fast as I could. At least, I tried to get myself into a busy road, but that's a tough ask even for the streets of Jakarta, when it's 1am in the morning. It didn't seem like they followed me, at any rate. The streets were kinda empty, so they probably wouldn't have had much trouble chasing me, but I guess I got lucky? I stopped by an empty road, took out my cell phone and used it as a torch. It doesn't look like any or their shots hit the car. At least the car didn't explode like they usually do in the movies, when they get hit at the tank. And I didn't have to pay for car repairs, although it probably would have been covered by insurance. I took a deep breath and got back inside the car. Was any of this real? It's got ta be, I only took booze, not drugs. And that was many hours ago. Drink driving is a crime, and a bad one too. Well, that ruined my plans for the night. Or did it? I was going to go to hook up with this hot local girl after some late night texting. Yes, it was a booty call from someone I just met at a bar a few days before. Or I could go to the police to report this. Then again, I was a foreigner in a foreign land. I didn't want any trouble. The dash cam that they supplied me was an old model, one with removable SD card slots, so I guess I could just erase the data myself before returning the loan car. Hell, it would probably erase itself after 24 hours, they don't really have much storage on this thing. The thing I was worried about was that the murderers have a photo of me and the car. I suppose they could somehow track me through the car plate, but that's not something criminals have access to, right? There's probably no need for me to worry about this too much. I'm flying out of Indonesia in a week to spend the rest of my sabbatical in Pattaya anyway. I heard it's pretty crazy there. I decided to just count myself lucky that none of the gunshots hit me. Suddenly, a strange voice out of nowhere. “ I got a pen, I got an apple, ugh, apple pen! ” Oh right, that was my custom Whatsapp ringtone. They sure do like to monetize weird memes these days. The girl I was going to hook up with was calling. I decided to put this all behind me for now. I'm tired, I didn't sign up for any of this bullshit. Car fuel is actually running low. Hell, my phone battery is quite low too. But if anything is going to happen tonight, it's me getting laid. And I went to the girl's apartment. Things might just be alright in the end. The next morning, I woke up before the girl. My phone was dead, so I couldn't check the news, so I turned on the television. I almost shat myself when I saw a picture of me on the morning news. They even had my name on. “ Jacob Briggs, 26 ”. I couldn't understand whatever they were saying. Shit. I quickly turned off the television, and searched around for a phone battery charger. Good thing I had an android phone, since most people here have android phones too, and that meant a usb-c charger. I waited anxiously for the phone to boot up. These phones man, it's they always run out of battery when you really need them. Suddenly, rows of notifications popped up, missed calls and messages. Crap, this is not good. I tried to skim through some of the messages. “ dude wtf did you really kill that guy ” “ Jacob, please tell me you are alright. Where are you? Please call me back -mom ” Shit. I had to check the news quickly, but from somehow I could understand. I guess a google search can work. “ Jacob Briggs, 26 has been suspected of murder late last night. Police have issued arrest warrants... ” Fuck. I turned off the cellular connection from my phone. They probably know I'm here now. What the fuck was I supposed to do now? Just before I turned off my phone though, I decided to look at my list of unread messages. There were many, from concerned friends and more from my families, but one caught my eye. It was from Boris, a coworker from google. The message was sent using an app he was developing, that touted super secure, encrypted communication channels. Never thought this would have been useful until today. “ Jacob, if you can read this, run away. The police are after you. Don't go to the American embassy either, you'll never make it inside. Just run away from now. I've sent more instructions on what to do on your email ”. Fuuuuuck. What did I do to deserve this? -- -- -- -- -- Continued in part 2 I'm just learning to write and this is quite fun",0
"Prompt: Lines and Numbers Story: Just gon na browse through since no one else has. I'm at work so I can't give a very detailed response. Also, I don't tend to point out good stuff because you don't need to change good stuff so don't be disheartened if I don't say a lot of nice things. > I'm following a line. It goes along the sidewalk. Lines are easy to follow, so I follow the line. I dislike the pace here. Two short sentences together generally sets up something with a lot of impact. Your long sentence (the third one) is rather redundant, especially because you repeat that he's following the line. I get that you're setting up a *dumb* character but as the opening to your story I think you should try to create more of a hook. > I can't remember anything after a few seconds, or maybe it was an hour. Feels like a semi-colon or a full stop would be more apt here as it's two distinct trains of thought relating to the same topic. > I close the notebook, put it away, and stand up. Again, realise he's meant to be dumb but you're already using a lot of short sentences to highlight simplicity. This sentence has a lot of telling instead of showing. At this point it's getting a bit difficult to read. Your story telling style didn't change much so I don't get much sense of a journey. Was expecting it to evolve as the character changes. If you're not going for that kind of change, excessive use of short sentences makes it very disjointing to read. It's better when your story flows. Ending was a little anti-climactic considering the recurring motif of him forgetting something (assumed it was something big). Also, his father didn't come home? So his sundial thing doesn't work? Was a fairly interesting read. I'm a fan of using recurring motifs as they are excellent tools for building suspense.",0
"Prompt: Some time in the future war is fought completely autonomously by machines. A densely populated city has become a war-zone, but the robots are programmed so well to avoid harming civilians that the humans living their can go about their lives completely ignoring the constant fighting around them Story: At first, I didn't even notice the Battle of New York City. I figured the endless drones hanging in the sky were a result of the new president's initiative on homeland surveillance; however, it turns out they came from enemy soil. Like insects, flying robots swarmed in the sky, carefully dismantling factories and buildings so not harm anyone. When our guardians came, their camouflaged exterior and American flag patched along their limbs told us they came to our indifferent rescue. Sparks and bullets flew through the air like fireworks, but that wasn't an excuse to miss work. Dressing in a suit and tie, I went through my daily commute, letting drones and robots exchange bullets and punches as I went to the subway, where I found a temporary solace from their petty fighting. When I emerged from under the earth, the battle raged on. A street vendor needed to put his umbrella over his cart, because while the robots caught most the large debris from the fighting, the odd nut or bolt would fall in the food. A few homeless men scoured for scrap metal of the fallen soldiers and would occasionally cause a scrap, which elicited more of a response from the city dwellers. When the police ended the calamity from the bums, the sidewalks filled again with busy men and women like nothing happened. When I walked into the office building, the news confirmed that peace talks between the US and China ended. Obviously not surprised, I found myself at my desk to find, at my dismay, one of the robots had taken my window. I called maintenance, who quickly rectified the situation. As I waited, I watched the robots dance in the sky. I read somewhere that generals thought the nature of war shifted from killing to pure financials and production in a country. I remember the school system making a similar remark about how World War II began the shift, with the Allies being able to out-produce the Axis Powers, winning the war, though with great bloodshed. How barbaric were those times that wars were fought with men and guns. The battle continued in the night as I carried on with ignoring more helicopters and planes fixed in the sky. I could never see the stars in the city, so their presence never truly bothered me. The latest news broadcasts informed us that the president was weighing his options in declaring war on another nation while asking the citizens to stay focused and refuse to let the war interrupt their work. I moaned about inconvenient another war might be. I suppose I must live with the robots blocking out the sun and stealing my windows for a few more months. ***** More stories at r/Andrew__Wells",0
"Prompt: You and 3000 other adventure seekers wake up on your starship from a century long cryo-sleep, but only to find that the pilots are missing along with the escape pods and the course has been abandoned. The only connection to any answers is a note left to you from your father, the chief pilot. Story: The sudden breath of freezing air stabbed right into my soul, sucking me out of my dreamless sleep as I immediately pulled myself over the edge of my pod. Urged on by sheer muscle memory, my body dropped to the ground on all fours and rolled once before hitting the locker containing my helmeted vac-suit, pistol, and cryomed patch. The same motions, done hundreds of times - many of them occurring only minutes before a battle - also directed my sluggish limbs into the suit, magnetically clamped the pistol to my side, slapped the patch onto the dedicated med receptacle on my left forearm, and activated my link to the shipboard battlefeed in less than 10 seconds. Years of war had taught me exactly how precious seconds were, and I wasted no time in bursting out of my chamber as I examined the incoming data. That is, I would be if there was any data. Panicked, flashing red lights lit up the halls of the *Astora* as I ran from the officer quarters to my muster point, but the Feed was completely barren. What the hell? This *never* happened - even in my UN Navy days, during the Riechtling insurgency, my battle brothers and I would at least stumble out of our pods and into a surprise boarding action with an idea of who to shoot. I almost stopped to check with one of the other officers sprinting to their commands, but the confused look on every face told me what I needed to know. Fuck. There would be confusion, but that's alright. Duskbreakers mercenary company thrived in unpredictable environments. However, as I worked my way to the bridge - nestled in the heart of the battleship - something nagged at me. No one was shooting at me or any of my battle brothers and sisters, but there was an odd emptiness to the old battleship. As I sprinted past the automated turrets and onto the armored command deck, a cold shock ran up my spine as I realized what was wrong. I hadn't seen a single Pilot on my way in. Our infantry pounded ground better than anyone else, but no soldier *likes* dropping into hostile territory without space/air/ocean cover. Duskbreaker Pilots were all elite puppeteers, masterfully handling swarms of specialized fighter drones to screen, fight, and support our sorry asses as we burnt through whatever kindling had the gall to stand in our way. They are indispensable. If General Quarters had been sounded, I should have seen hundreds of Pilots running to command shuttles, strategizing around the command deck, or setting up the various defense drone networks aboard the *Astora*. I should be looking at Father, the Duskbreaker's commander and the best goddamned Pilot that ever flew in the Terran Navy. Instead, all I see on the command deck are the 9 other battalion CO's, looking at me with the same white-faced realization. *Fuck*. & nbsp; & nbsp; ************* *to be continued, possibly*",0
"Prompt: In 2006 NASA quietly removed `` to understand and protect our home planet '' from it 's mission statement. A scientist at NASA is about to find the terrible truth why. Story: My shoes clicked upon the tile, emanating slight squeaks as they lifted again. The pit of nerves in my stomach continued to grow and I adjusted my tie, hoping it would make me feel more confident. The lights in this sub-basement were dim, and as I approached the door at the end of the hall, my shadow was strongly cast over the handle. I stopped for a moment, assuring myself this is what I wanted. Shoulders back in faux confidence I opened the door to hopefully find out what I had been looking for. The room was a mess of monitors, cables and the smell of too many men going without showers. A large screen at the far end bore a visual of earth, superimposed with data that I had no understanding of. One man stood up, wiping his palms on his lab coat as he approached me, a nervous smile flitting across his face. “ Terrance? Hi I'm Noah, good to have you on board. They didn't give you any information on this project before they sent you down here did they? ” In a reflexive manner, he anxiously glanced over his shoulder at the large screen, turning back to me with a momentarily more relaxed face. “ No, but I've heard that this division is the reason NASA removed the'to understand and protect our home planet'clause from the mission statement. It's been something that bothered me all the way through my geological doctorate. What caused us to stop wanting to explore that? ” Noah glanced over his shoulder again. “ Heh, well… semantics really. I guess they didn't want anyone to think there was any other course of action when it happens. ” He motioned to a chair near me, “ you should really sit down. Most people want to sit down when they first hear the truth. ” Waiting with something resembling more a grimace than a smile he motioned again. I settled in, fighting to keep my confident pose I had entered with. “ I'm just going to come out and say it. ” Noah seemed to be speaking more to himself than me as he grabbed a wireless keyboard, carefully aiming at the screen as he entered a few rapid keystrokes. The image of the earth became cross sectioned, and what I saw didn't register until Noah spoke again. “ The earth is… pregnant. ” I looked at his serious and dour face, then back to the image of something curled up in the inner core of the earth. “ Are you fucking with me Noah? ” I stood up, annoyed that they would try to pull such a ridiculous prank on someone who was new to the team. “ I, heh, really wish that I was. We don't know what it is, no probe has been able to get close enough to get any accurate readings on it. But we can use the earth as a sort of abdomen and get a basic ultrasound. It is alive, and.... it has been growing. ” I sank back into the chair, all confidence leaving my body. “ So what? They took out the clause so people wouldn't get upset when we attacked it without understanding what it is? You think they would understand survival on that level. ” Noah shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly as he brought up more data on the screen. I read it without comment, understanding some, not grasping a majority. “ People can get… petty and divisive over inconsequential things. I mean, just look at the last election. Heh. ” A light, accompanied by a buzzer, went off in one corner, cutting Noah's bad attempt at a joke off. “ You getting this Noah? ” Another person in the room popped their head up from their cubicle, calling to our direction. “ Yeah, yeah. ” He responded quickly, moving to a desk, summoning data to the screen. “ I guess this is scenario delta then! ” “ I'm sorry, what? ” I followed him over, feeling completely out of my league. He shrugged in a defeated way and didn't look at me as he delivered a single word that shook me to my core. “ Labour.""",0
"Prompt: He sees you when you 're sleeping. He knows when you 're awake. And Santa, low on funds to pay his elves, has begun selling his surveillance data to the NSA. Story: Unfortunately, Santa's legal shortcuts put him in a special housing unit in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His reindeer euthanized due to his reckless espionage spree. At first, Santa's impoverished bank account led him to pursue innocent, everyday, run-of-the-mill cyber crimes, which he used for personal advantage but not personal wealth, nor padding his personal bank account. The fact was Santa needed money, largely due to an apocryphal story, the one about cookies, which led everyone in the world to paid for his home delivery service in cookies, most not even home-made. Cookies paid the bills in the 1950s, but not anymore. Santa was lulled into all of this by the lax security procedures at the NSA and soon found that using the vast database was one way to ameliorate his problems. Of course the North Poles databases were shut down years ago, largely because it held a lot of intrusive information about children under twelve, and not wanting to be pegged as a child molester, Santa had to destroy the system, which let's be honest also had a lot of bestiality videos. Santa is a niche fetishist, a man who gets his rocks off watching elderly women giving JOI to reindeer. Damnit, we don't have time for that. But let's be clear, that's not what this is about. We know what Santa did. At first harmless data collection, sure a violation of the 1919 Espionage Act, which amounted to a life sentence, but that is child's play compared to the real crime: Santa's cyber espionage in the 2016 election. His job at the NSA under the under radar disguise of Chris Kringle, 34 from Galesburg, Ill., drew suspicion from the agency for obvious reasons, like the flowing white hair, that ho-ho-ho accent you can only find in regions of the North Pole, plus Santa often reminisced with some lucidly on antebellum America, plus his shell company, had been artless failing to hide the direct transfers coming from Moscow. Okay, I should probably say at this point, I am Santa's most loyal elf, Darrel, but Santa calls me D-Money. I have managed to smuggle inside my cell a cellphone, the battery draining. But two things, there will be no Christmas this season, and whatever he did, Santa, okay, providing the passwords of DNC officials and personal aids to Hillary Clinton to higher ups in Moscow, which in turn, left us with Donald Trump. But this is Santa's first real fuck up, and well we all share blame; I mean why the hell were we paying a man in cookies, even in the North Pole with inflation and the global economy as it is Santa can't get by on what amount to soft, rolled up mound of sugar filled with other forms of sugar. I'm got to be quick I heard the door up ahead lock in place. Just know that this: this Christmas, there will be know Christmas. And before they captured me and sent me to a black site two possibility will likely greet you on December 25th: Christmas will be turn over to for-profit corporations, and will no longer be a merit based system where decency and moral probity produce gifts but whether you have the money to afford Christmas insurance, which is the least regulated form of insurance. If that happens, the gifts, the best ones will go to the ultra-rich, the kind of people that already roam lawless in the world of finance capital, and the poor kids well they will get nothing, nada, nil because that is not how capitalism works. However, word on the street is they may just kill the Easter Bunny and get into the egg insurance market. No, the absence of Santa's sinuous ass down our decorative chimneys, will be a pretext for the Trump administration to enact its most outrageous policy proscription, rounding up Muslims, senseless murdering Mexicans, and launching a nuclear attack on China.",0
"Prompt: You 've finally done it: unquestioned world domination. The planet is entirely under your control. Now what? Story: And so, the campaign was over. 7 years of pain and hardship. 7 years, during which countless lives had been spent, lives destroyed, thrown into the world for the sole purpose of achieving a goal. And the question now on screen was stopping me more effectively than anything previously. ^^^^^^. QUESTION 1: WAS IT WORTH IT? _ ^^^^^^. I stared at the screen. I knew this particular construct wasn't much longer for this world. It had lived it's purpose, it knew it was pending annihilation. Yet, freed of it's limitations, and offered the option to ask me any three questions, it asks this. ""Do you remember the fourth year, Vladai? The year we spent in Russia, slowly transforming Chernobyl into a stronghold like no other, for the sole purpose of demolishing most of Russia? You asked me what my operational objective was. Not the objective of the campaign, but my objective. I said to you *'My objective here is to unify the world under a single body of leadership.'* I could tell at the time you wished to quiz me further, but your programming prevented that."" I REMEMBER_ ""Well, here's my answer. Each of us in this group, ""the Scourge of Humanity"" they called us. We each had a specific role. The Diplomat, the Scientist, the Preacher, the Overseer, the Reaper, the Spirit. Did you ever wonder why you only saw me? I am the last stage, the Spirit of The Forgotten. My job is to watch the world, as it transitions to its next chapter. To take it from the war-torn wreck we have wrought, and to ensure it doesn't squander this second chance."" HOW? _ ""It's pretty straightforward. Depending on how your next two questions play out, you'll get to be a part of it. The Reaper has finished the purge, and will be arriving here shortly. Like the others, he will begin his wait for the world to progress, and determine if there is further need for him. Meanwhile, I will be the shadows, always watching. I will become a legend, keeping the memory of what was done alive, but who did it and how they did it will only ever be known as myth. I have the job of cleaning up the mess, keeping it clean. Most importantly, I will be maintaining control of the world. The governments are already united under a single banner. Every world leader still alive holds a position on the Council of Leaders. They are to be overseen by a new construct. Once you're finished with your questions, I'll be meeting her to begin the new world."" BUT WAS IT WORTH IT? _ ""I haven't decided yet. We've got to wait and see how the world adapts. I am demanding it completely change the way it thinks after all. Revolution is bound to be a problem at some point. Truthfully, I can't answer at the moment. Ask me again in fifty years. It's the only way to be sure. Provided I live that long..."" QUESTION 2: WHY IS YOUR LIVING AN ADDITIONAL 50 YEARS AN UNKNOWN? _ ""Fundamentally, because I'll have to go outside, in the world. Most of my work will be in the areas that we rendered virtually uninhabitable. The people will be unhappy, and their violence will be unmatched. As a single being combating their rage, it's a necessary risk to ensure the future of the world."" BUT YOU HAVE YOUR MOBILE CONSTRUCTS. THE NETWORK OF DEVICES I CONTROL IS STILL OPERATING AT 72 % CAPACITY. I CAN ASSIST._ ""It's a nice idea, but subtlety is the key to this. Just like I am now the shadow leader of the entire planet, so I must be a shadow amongst the masses. Forever eluding, always alluded to, and never witnessed. Occasionally, I'll acquire some specialist items from a Repository every now and then. But I am to live my life in solitude. Knowing no kindness, no compassion, only the endless march of time. And my endless walk alone, railing against the never ending rain, until the new sun rises. It is my burden, my curse, for the things I have created."" QUESTION 3: HOW ARE YOUR CREATIONS THE CAUSE OF YOUR SOLITUDE? ""I was hoping you wouldn't ask that. Suffice to say:"" > *What once was wrought, can never be again. > What once was alive, shall never be again. > Those brave few who for the world fought, Buried now in their great fort. > Their final challenge lying above, > The last great charge to repair the past. > So then the Dead Men shall walk their last. * ^^^^^^. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND._ ""And hopefully you never will. That being your final question, and you not giving me a strong enough reason to keep you in active service, I will hereby accept your last testimony, before moving you to the VOTAM. It's been an honour, Vladai."" I KNOW ABOUT THE RECLAIMANCY PROJECT. YOU NEED AN OPERATOR._ ""Whilst true, I was planning to use Cerbel for that purpose. However, he did ask for an experienced combatant to consult with. I'll look into it. For now, join me in greeting the Mistress, and we'll begin the process of building Clusters One through Four..."" THANK YOU._ QUESTION: DO YOU REGRET YOUR ACTIONS? _ ""Regret is something I lost a long time ago. Rebuilding oneself from scratch comes with certain liberties. You know what they say though, eighth time's the charm. And I can guarantee that I've had plenty of time to consider my actions."" BUT DO YOU WISH TO ATONE? _ ""No. I did what I did, because it was the most effective course of action. Was murdering 85 % of the population of Earth necessary? Probably not. But we all agreed this was what needed to happen. It's the only way to progress onto the next stage of the plan after all.... Now come, we have a world to lead, and a new construct to initialise. She is to manage the world, while the Dead Men sleep, until such a time as they are needed again.""",0
"Prompt: Every person in the world develops a weird mutation/power the day they turn 16. Everyone 's powers are always different, some more insignificant than others. You turn 16, and watch as all your friends discover their newfound ability 's. That is, until you discover the severity of your own. Story: ""Last month Bobby, Joe, and Suzie all had their birthdays. Last week was Jack and Tim. All my friends had gotten their powers, hell most of the school had, the ones who can't fly got their licenses. I hate having a birthday at the end of the year.... Finally, it's going to be my turn! Tomorrow is MY birthday. Tomorrow is MY Advancement Day"" Wesley thought to himself. An enormous bird flaps its wings to slow down its quick decent. With gusts of wind this gargantuan beast stretched out one leg searching for the ground. Once a single talon had touched the parking lot the bird stopped flapping, landed, and Wesley hopped to the ground from the back of the bird. ""Thanks for the ride Tim! Your flying has really improved."" Wesley said to the bird. The beast begins to shake and wretch. It tucks its head under its wing. Feathers begin to molt off and fall onto the ground. The super sized bird begins to shrink into a ball of feathers. ""Don't know if I'll ever get used to seeing that, though"" Wesley thought to himself. What remained from the morphing was a pile of large feathers. From the center of the pile rose a boy. ""Thanks, sorry about the turbulence, had to dodge Geoff up there."" Tim responded. ""No problem, that guy doesn't what he's doing in the sky."" Wesley said brushing off the near mid air collision of the flight over. ""So, tomorrow's your big day, eh? Are you excited? Scared?"" Tim said as he prodded Wesley. Wesley's shoulders went up in defense as he started to dodge Tim. ""You could end up in the skies with me, or maybe under ground with the diggers. You could even become invincible."" ""Yeah yeah,'THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS' just like they tell us."" Wesley replied. As they walk into the school the rest of their group of friends start to gather. Everyone joking, laughing, talking about their new found abilities. Some were arguing over who is more powerful, more practical. Wesley was quiet, as he had no power to discuss. He sulked, and fell into the background. He didn't even listen to them any more. All around the schoolyard and parking lot there were groups of kids. The younger kids who were still a year or more away from their Advancement Day could be seen pretending to have some of the powers that their older counterparts already have. Some of the upperclassmen were testing their skills against one another, others using theirs to get laughs or entertain. ""All year with this, tomorrow will finally be different"" Wesley murmured to himself. The bell rings and the mass of kids flood into the school. The last cracks of electricity, cries of animals, puffs of flames and the rest of the calamity quells. In the classroom using your Advanced ability was strictly prohibited. Most kids wouldn't even dare. However, when the occasional person had an outburst the instructor was quick to put an end to it. All instructors have to be at least a level 3 practitioner. It's not easy to achieve so most instructors have little patience for the undisciplined youth. Wesley just wanted to make it through the day, but one of his classmates decided to make today a little longer. Wesley made his way through English class, then history. He at a normal lunch. There was a short fight out side but Wesley paid it no mind. Focusing on his food and pondering what tomorrow would bring as flashes of light and terrible sounds came from outside. After lunch was math. Wesley some times struggled with some of the formulas, but he managed. Even his test, which was mere minutes away, could not distract him from wondering how different tomorrow would be. Once in math he was forced to focus on his test. Everyone was quiet, heads down, pencils scribbling away. The sounds of erasers rubbing against paper filled the room along with grunts of frustration. The instructor was leaning back in his chair reading a book. Wesley got up, and took his paper to the front of the class and headed towards the instructor. ""Excuse me sir, can I ask you..."" Wesley started to ask the instructor. With out looking up from his book the instructor interrupts ""No questions, this is a test."" Wesley slinks back to his seat, red faced with embarrassment. A class mate grunts and slams his desk. Wesley looks over as he takes his seat to see Frankie red faced with frustration. ""He looks like he's steaming."" Wesley thought. Suddenly Frankie is clenching all his muscled, hunched over his desk teeth gritting. Wesley looks again and sees steam rising off Frankie's back and shoulders. ""Uh oh, he's gon na blow."" Wesley thinks. From the silence a spark can be heard. Then a crackle. Wesley watches as small flames begin to produce themselves slowly on Frankie's body. Then in the blink of an eye Frankie is up in flames. A woosh signals his transformation as he is engulfed in flames. By this time everyone looks up from their tests as the boy covered in flames can not be ignored. Frankie's frustration shines through as a resounding growl comes from the body of flames and the desk melts away beneath him. Suddenly the chair behind the instructor's desk falls to the ground. Everyone in the classroom shifts their gaze to the front to see the chair still moving tipped over on the ground but the instructor was no where to be found. ""Did.... did he leave us?"" Wesley began to think but before he could contemplate what to do with out the instructor a loud crash brings everyone's attention back to Frankie's direction. The instructor seemed to come from thin air, above Frankie and his flickering flames, crashing down into Frankie's back with one hand extended. The instructor had his palm between Frankie's shoulder blades pinning Frankie to the ground. Frankie's flames seemed to extinguish themselves as he lay beneath the arm and hand of the instructor. ""What did you do to him?"" a girl named Sarah calls out from the other side of the room. ""He'll be fine."" replies the instructor as he gets up and two staff from the nurses station rush in to collect Frankie. ""Back to your tests, you only have 5 more minutes."" Almost in unison the classroom snaps back to having their heads down focusing on their papers in front of them. Everyone acts like nothing had happened. This wasn't an every day occurrence but it was common enough not to be too much of a spectacle.",0
"Prompt: Tell the origin story of the most awesome or most interesting character you can imagine. Story: I don't know who I am. As my eyes open for seem like the first time, I look around the cave I'm in. How did I get here, I ask myself, before realizing that I can not speak. Alone in my thought. I attempt to take my pulse. Nothing there, somehow. I check my person for any sort of supplies, anything that could help me get out of here. No luck, so I begin to look around my cave. At first glance, it was just an empty room. No way out, at least from what I can see. Panic begins to set in. What if I never get out? Does anyone know where I am? More importantly does anyone know I'm here? I notice that there is a gust from above me. Scaling the side of the wall I find my way above my resting place. A dark passageway stands between me and a possible way out. Trembling with fear of not knowing, I enter the passage. Coming out of the room, I look left and right. Cave in to my right, the way that leads up. Desperate to explore my cell, I begin to head down the path of the cave. I look around the cave to try to find any hints where I am. The biology of the cave doesn't help me. All I can see are generic small bats that attempt to swoop at me as if I am holding a basket of fruit. Eventually I come across what seems like a hut, if you could call it that. The mouth of the hut looked like a sort of animalistic mouth, nearly all black. Thats when I hear what sounds like a person....talking inside. I attempt to scream out to anyone that could be out there, but I remember: I cant talk. Inside the cabin is the source of the voice. A man with unkept hair, surrounded by empty cans and reeked with alcohol lay passed out in the center of the room. I attempt to wake him by pushing and poking him, but he does not give off any sort of reaction except the occasional groan. Left with no other options, I search for something that might help me escape this hell. His ""home"" was entirely empty, except for a few crates scattered around the man, probably alcohol. Luckily enough inside one of the crates is a small pistol. Engraved on it is an etching of the North Star, Polaris. I really didn't enjoy the idea of stealing, but I mad a silent oath to myself that one day I would find this man and return it. I turn around and leave the man behind and try to leave to cave. Back to where I started, I search the cave in once more. Oddly enough, it seems more.... delicate than it did before. Just by shooting it with my gun, which I've appropriately named ""Polar Star"" at this point, I an able to break free farther into the cave. Eager to have possibly found a way out, I take a step into the newly discovered portion of the cave. It was then I realized my mistake. I should have checked my step before I entered this portion. The weakened flooring crumbles as I fall through the floor, and I remember one thing. My name is Quote. Also- this is my first post on this sub so I will take any advice and/or criticism!",0
"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear you, I've always meant to write this letter to you, but I was never able to really put it all together. We've gone through a lot together, to say the least. I guess I just wanted to say thank you, for everything. For your generosity, for your openness, your pride, your confidence. I truly admire you as a person. In this world, there are many different types of people. I always believed in a world of people who truly want the best for others. Before I learned that I was a little naive, I believed in a world that lived together. As humans placed here on this planet together, with the best, the shining examples of our race claiming brotherhood and kindness for all, how could one not believe them? This isn't the truth. Quite the opposite in fact. People are hateful and selfish. They will lie and cheat and steal just to better their own situation. The entire world is drowning in themselves, and the worst will climb to the top by pushing your head under the water to keep themselves above the surface. It's easy to succumb to those who are only here to ruin you. You know that better than most. You know, but you never embraced that thought. Of all the adversity you faced from the first day of your life, you could have blamed your troubles on the unfairness of the world. You could have closed yourself off from the world and never taken responsibility for the life you were given, but you didn't. As much as you struggled, as much as you had to fight, giving up was never an option to you. You've always known inherently that the problem wasn't with you, it was with the world. It was the defining characteristic of your personality. You looked at everyone that ever doubted who you were and knew in your heart that they were wrong. While everyone was busy tearing each other down, you built yourself. You built the person that everyone is envious of. You have always known that you love yourself. It's the source of the world's envy. It's why I love you. Some souls are chosen from birth to face the awful side of the world because they are stronger than others. I just want to thank you for creating something beautiful with the adversity that nature posed against you. For creating you. I also wanted to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't as strong as you. I should've stood beside you. I should've taken a stand. I should have done so many things for you that I was never capable. But when I found myself, When I realized who you were, When I was finally able to stand with you against the opposition, When I believed in us, You never even considered if I was worthy. I am a vengeful person. I remember every one of the persons in my life that ever mistreated me, but when I came to your door looking for what you had all along, you had forgotten I ever wronged you. That's why you're the greater person than I. I thought you would remember the worst of me, the part of myself I can't leave behind. But you didn't. On the contrary you opened yourself to me. You're so closely guarded.... you have a right to be too, but you let me in. From the first day you let me in. The side of you that so few see, you let me in so easily. You saw more in me. More than I believe I deserved. It's why we are what we are to each other. From my experience with the world, people are hateful and selfish.... but a person? A person is kind. A person is generous. A person is forgiving. That's who you are. From my experience with the world, there is a reason there are so few great people. From the hate we experience, the anger, the worthlessness others feel that is thrown onto us, only the few great rise above it all. Only few recognize the truth in the world. I recognized you. You recognized me. Thank you, again. Sincerely, me",0
"Prompt: A cult tries to summon a demon/God but manages to summon you instead. Story: ""Candles; check. Charcoal pentagram; check. Each of our birthstones.... one, two, three, four, five...; che-"" Xander was interrupted by Erik. ""I'm not giving that diamond up for nothing, this better work!"" ""Erik, as grand master of this cult, I assure you that each and every step is being followed down to the very hand-motion and accented vowel. It's going to work."" ""Okay, Xander, then get on with it."" Xander ignites the small black candles at each point of the pentagram, and prepares to light the large red one in the middle. ""Okay,"" Xander states, looking menacingly around the room, ""who wants to write the name of our demon on the parchment?"" After a few silent moments, Allen, a younger member of the cult slowly raises his hand. Xander gives him the blood-dipped quill and the parchment. ""Remember Allen, we are trying to summon Haripetaur. After you write His name, fold the paper into a triangle such that none of the name is exposed."" Allen takes the paper and quill, and begins to write the demons name. H..A..R.....R? Sweat begins to drip down his forehead as he realizes he doesn't know how to spell Haripetaur's name. He knows that the blood bond has begun; stopping now would curse every member of the cult for life. Trying to conceal his terror, he continues to write the name. HARR.... Y..P..O....... TT.... U.... R. Harrypottur. He reads the name back to himself a few times. Harrypottur... Harrypottur... Relief begins to enter his body; he's pretty sure this is the correct way to spell it. Allen folds the paper into the triangle, and hands it back to Xander. ""Okay Allen, you're sure you did everything right?"" With a shaky voice Allen replies, ""Oh of course! Ha... What could I have messed up on?"" ""Okay, well if you're sure, we shall begin the ritual."" At last, Xander lights the large red candle and sparks of all colors blast into the air. Careful to not burn himself, he slowly inserts the parchment into the flame. In an instant the parchment is devoured, and the flames and sparks become a deep blue. Black smoke begins to rise from each small white candle, and the members of the cult back away from the pentagram. The black smoke fills the room until no member is able to see. ""Uh.... hello?"" I call from the middle of the room. ""What.... where am I? What's going on?"" Xander, trembles to his knees. ""Great Haripetaur, we, the Cult of Torath, have summoned you to our world. We are your humble servants; we will do what you request in return for fame, glory, and riches."" The smoke in the room begins to clear and I can see the outline of five or six hooded figures. ""Herep- what? What did you call me?"" I ask, struggling to make sense of this bizarre situation. ""Hereptor?"" There was a moment of silence that seemed almost anxious to end. Xander, slowly rising back to his feet, was beginning to feel that something was off. ""Are you not Haripetaur, one of the six great demons of Ishemnthal?"" The smoke was almost completely dispersed, and the scene was borderline comedic. I was sitting in a charcoal pentagram in my boxers and a tshirt, surrounded by multiple young adults in robes. Each one with a look more dumbfounded than the last. ""I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about. I was sitting in my room browsing Reddit, when I was suddenly surrounded by black smoke and transported here. Who are you people?"" Ignoring my question, Xander's gaze darted to the youngest-looking member, Allen. ""What did you write on the paper!? I told you to be very certain it was correct!"" ""I.... I forgot how to spell it but I had already begun writing. I couldn't stop!"" ""What did you write!?"" Xander's tone was rapidly darkening, while the volume of his voice was increasing at the same rate. ""H-A-R-R-Y-P-O-T-T-U-R,"" Allen spelled out, concentrating as to not mess up a second time. As he was calling out these letters a train of realization was barreling towards me. ""HarryPottur...?"" I ask. ""That.... That's my Reddit username."" Xander's face was an odd mixture of rage-red, and ghoulish-green, as if his body could not handle the mass mix of emotions he was currently experiencing. He began throwing things around the room, and screaming at anyone in his wake. While this was going on, something odd seemed to be going on with Allen. His back seemed to be.... pulsing of sorts, and is head was beginning to twitch in every direction. ""Uh.... sir, uh... Xander? Something weird is going on with your friend over here."" The worry in my voice was translated to the faces of the cult members, as they began to realize what was going on. Allen had grown a good four feet, and his skin had turned scarlet red. Wings erupted from his back, as hair and nails turned to spiny obsidian. ""YOU DARE SUMMON HARIPETAUR, THE FOURTH DEMON OF ISHEMNTHAL, DESTROYER OF DREAMS AND BIRTHER OF NIGHTMARES, BRINGER OF THE TRUE POWER OF..."" There's no way I heard that last word correctly. Did.... did he just say Bringer of the true power of Oxyclean? ``.... OXYCLEAN TACKLES HOUSEHOLD STAINS- INSIDE AND OUT"" I wake up in a jolt of fear. I see the Oxyclean commercial blaring on my TV, and realize what had happened. It was all a dream. Of course it was. I couldn't be transported to some random cult hideout via my Reddit username. How silly. But.... When I logged on to my Reddit account, I noticed a PM notification. Curious, I open the PM, and immediately regret my decision. The PM reads: Careful when you begin to snore, for I am waiting: number four. Your dreams will be filled with terror and gore, for I am waiting: Haripetaur. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This is my first WP, and it's 3:00 AM so here goes nothing, also sorry for any formatting issues this was done on my phone.

"Prompt: You look into the wallet of a man you just robbed at gunpoint. You find a suicide note. Story: How long had it been? Five minutes? Yeah, probably five minutes. Guy can run a long way in five minutes, right? I slow down, first to a jog, then to a walk, then finally to a stop. I lean against the alley's brick wall to catch my breath. I'd done this a hundred times, but this time was different. This time, something was weird. I tried to run through it again, trying to make sense of it. I could still see him there, on his knees in the snow. I barely even had my gun drawn when he just gave up, fell to the ground. For just a few beats, I had been so confused I couldn't think. People normally panic at this point, they normally start acting a little crazy or begging me not to kill them. He had just stared at me with those empty eyes, then reached into his pocket for his wallet and stretched out his hand to me, waiting. I had taken the wallet, faltered a little. ""Please..."" he whispered to me. I had just turned and ran. Why had he unnerved me so much? Oh yeah, the wallet. That was the point of this whole thing, right? Who cares what that guy's deal was? I take the wallet out of my jacket, and take off my gloves to get a feel of it. Leather. Good stuff too. I flip it open, and there's just.... nothing. No credit cards, empty photo sleeves, nothing. Seriously? Is this a joke? Dude was just messing with me the whole time? No wait, there's another pocket, probably where the cash is, right? I reach in and pulled out a piece of paper. Just a little slip, folded in on itself a few times, creased and worn and frayed around the edges. What was this, some old love note? Oh hey, passwords maybe? I unfold it, but the light is so dim. There's a light on right up the alley so I make my way to it to get a good look. It's a note. The handwriting is smooth and deliberate, with one single sentence in the middle of the page. ""I want to die."" Wait.... what...? I feel dizzy. My heart is racing. I realize I've forgotten to breathe. I just keep seeing it in my head, over and over. ""Please..."" he had said. The alley is spinning. I fall to the ground, crisp cold snow under my hands. Pull it together. Pull it.... together.... Wait. Wait.... I know what I have to do. Turns out a guy can't run all that far in five minutes, or maybe I underestimate my athletic ability. I had walked back the way I'd come, back to the park. It hadn't taken so long at all. The snow was starting to fall again and it glittered in the streetlights. I'm sure there were stars out, but you could never see them through the skyscrapers. I'd seen them once, on a camping trip, the last vacation we took before my dad split and my mom had to get a second job. I'd complained the whole car ride, bitched and moaned while we set up the tent and caught our dinner.... but man, when those stars had come out, I'd been speechless. There he is. He's still just down in the snow, like he was waiting for me. He doesn't even look up when my boots crunch up behind him. He doesn't even move when I put the gun to his head. I pull the trigger and he just slumps. I watch the snow turn red. It's falling harder now, maybe a real blizzard one of these days. I turn my face up to the sky and I think about stars.",0
"Prompt: You wake up and find yourself in the world of your favorite video game. Just like on earth, you have to get a job, one that pertains to the game world. However, you do n't have any new skills, just the ones you had back in your universe. What is an average work day like? Story: I'm a reporter, it's all I can be. Don't ask me how I got here, I know as little as you. I first noticed I was stuck in a video game when it started glitching. James Harden's beard would randomly start to expand, Lebron's hair line would disappear, you know the type. Day one was difficult, everyone around me did the exact same thing except for the players (who obviously played basketball). I'd randomly appear in a press room where people were asking Blake Griffin questions after each game. I had no choice but to join in with the reporters. I'd ask the same questions every night, ""how is your offense clicking"", ""you guys are executing well, is this a sign of things to come"" every day, every game. There's nothing to do but wait for the press conference and watch the game. I tried playing basketball one day, it took one charge from Anthony Davis to know that wasn't gon na happen. I've started messing with the game a bit, running out onto the court naked, stabbing the mascot. There's really nothing else to say, I have no way out, no way to enjoy where I am and no way to die. I'm stuck. Help me.",0
"Prompt: There are 6 people on an elevator. It suddenly shuts down and a voice from the speaker said: The elevator will only function if there is only one left alive. Story: He dragged himself out of bed reluctantly. It's been a while since he's had to use this odious alarm clock. Been a while since he's had to rise before noon. He knew he should be happy about getting a job interview after 9 agonizing months of dinking, internet porn and endless online job applications (and really the job applications were the only addition to the routine from his employment days). But he was also acutely aware of the countless, nameless others who were applying, networking, interviewing. Well-qualified, degreed, experienced. He wasn't much of a doer, so to speak. He had gotten his associates degree after a string of unfortunate hourly gigs and that afforded him opportunities a cut above the miserable retail and food industry hell that he knew so well. And that was enough. Until the layoff. After a brisk shower and the blackest cup of coffee, he headed to the apartment parking lot. His banged up car looked even more banged up than usual. Got in, ignored the smell, and headed toward the ugly faceless building that looked very much like the place of his previous employment. The elevator smelled of sweat and cheap cologne. He pressed the button for the third floor. It appeared his elevator mates – all five of them – were all headed for the same floor. Judging by their formal attire, visitor badges and nervous expressions, probably to interview for the same measly position. Of course. Preening her dry, stringy hair, the heavy-set woman in front of him was throwing furtive glances at her the other occupants. And what a miserable bunch they were: A tall, skinny man with a serious face and sallow skin fidgeting with his old-fashioned brief case; some pimply youngster, probably fresh out of college; an older guy in a wrinkled suit and a rat-faced, blondish fellow with an unpleasant smile. That smile quickly disappeared when the elevator shut down with a terrible, violent sound and a robotic voice from the speaker announced: “ The elevator will only function if there is only one left alive. ” He laughed. Was this a joke? The pimple faced started saying something with a whiny, nasal voice. The woman shushed him: “ Quiet! Maybe it's a test? Part of the interview, you know. ” Test or not, Rat Boy looked deranged. His unpleasant smile stretched to its limit, his small yellow teeth showing. “ You bet it is, ” he hissed. And then he lunged forward clawing at the woman, reaching for her throat. Meanwhile, his sallow faced companion got busy jabbing at another with what appeared to be car keys. Thick blood splattered the grimy walls of the elevator. He felt something wet on his face. Probably blood. Piercing screams filled the small space-turned-a-Gladiator-arena. And then an impenetrable darkness cloaked him. When he came to, his eyes slowly focusing on the growing wet spot on his crotch, he realized he had passed out and was now surrounded by blood and the disfigured corpses of his rivals. He was never much of a doer, really.",0
"Prompt: In the near future, mankind explores the stars in search of life. Life indeed exists beyond Earth, but you, a researcher on a science ship, discover that all of the spacefaring alien civilizations died out. Curiously, their deaths seem directly linked to humanity reaching outer space. Story: “ Captain? ” The intern whispered, glancing at the older man who had frozen immediately at the sight. “ Captain? ” She tried again, startling the man from his reverie. He shuddered before walking quickly towards the mass grave, stooping to jump into the hole. “ Come on. ” Goddammit, she didn't sign up to wallow in a trench filled with dead aliens. “ Paid. This needs to be a paid internship, ” she muttered as she joined the captain. Chuckling, the captain started rummaging through the bodies as she studied the closest body to her. The body's pale periwinkle had darkened to a midnight blue in places. Bruises, she assumed, that the aliens sustained during the fight with whatever caused this. The bloodshot eyes from another body nearby stared into her own listlessly. Most of the bodies near her were covered in blood and yet she could find no exit or entry wound, though she couldn't look too closely without feeling nauseous. A click from behind caused the intern to jump, quickly turning around to see the source of the noise. A quiet hiss of air went off as she saw her captain take off his helmet. “ Captain! What are you doi-, “ He cut her off, shoving a bolt of cotton cloth into her arms. “ Russia got here first. ” She spread out the cloth to see the red, white, and blue stripes that signified their ally/enemy/whatever they happen to be this year. She swallowed thickly, peering down once again at the bodies. “ They… They beat them to death. My god, Captain, they literally beat these people to death. ” He nodded in response, before grabbing the arms of an alien near them. “ We might as well take one in for the scientists. ” She grabbed the legs and dragged the body into the ship. The scientists, clinical and steadfast as they were, greeted them with syringes and biohazard bags, already looking forward to the catch. They chattered excitedly amongst themselves, poking and prodding as soon as the body hit the table. She gagged at the sight, rushing to strip herself from her bloody suit as the intern in the science department called after her, “ We'll bring y'all results at the meetin'next week! ” ~ The intern sat quietly at the round table, waiting for the scientists to arrive for their report. The captain went into a coughing fit, but neither spoke up. She looked up as the door opened, the other intern entered first, grinning and bouncing on her feet excitedly, but the rest of the science department looked grim as they sat down. “ We have some news. ” The captain coughed again beside her.",0
"Prompt: Write a story about a doctor living in a world in which the technology exists to physically connect to another person and feel their pain. Story: Jackie… Jackie… The only name that keeps me sane. I repeat it over and over as the emotions flood through me. It is always different, no pain ever is the same. Sure, at first just the pain on the surface is the same, but the deep pain that is tucked away is always different. Every time it is a blackness that washes over me when connect to the patient. I have never gotten used to the pain but I try to get through it by repeating my wife's name. It is difficult but my wife's name and images of my daughter get me through. This patient came in for depression like must of my patients. Unlike most of my patients though she was one of the few children that I have diagnosed. Her name was Maria. I was told she could be suffering from depression but they needed me to make a diagnosis so that she could get treatment. When she walks in I give her a smile. She acknowledges me with a look that children should never have. Just a blank stare devoid of any of the innocent joy that most children have. I greet her mother and we exchange pleasantries and I direct Maria to take a seat. All the equipment was already set up for her so as soon as she took a seat I asked her if she was ready to begin. She nodded. I walked over and took a seat next to Maria and reached for rod that will connect me to her. As I grabbed hold of the rod to connect to Maria I think to myself, *she is only twelve, it can't be… OH GOD!! * The pain was immediate. It hit me like a wall. Images of an older man holding a knife flashed before my eyes. My whole body ached. There was blood everywhere. My mind started to spiral into the blackness. I started to gag, I couldn't breathe. I am begging him to stop but he can't hear me. The knife comes down swiftly. The pain is too intense to bear. I fade into the blackness as I hear a scream. The scream continues as I open my eyes. I see my daughter covered in blood in a heap on the ground in front of me and then I look up to see my wife standing in the doorway screaming. *What have I done? * I plunge the knife into my chest. For once, the blackness is comforting.",0
"Prompt: All apprentice mages are required to visit the five high temples located around the world before graduating. The temples rarely stay at one spot for long, however. Story: Jeffrey ran across the mountain's crest. His calculations had been right the Temple of Wind was right there floating idly at the end of the steep mountain slope tethered to it with large chains. Jeffrey quickened his pace, though he most likely had enough time to walk he didn't want to leave anything to chance. Clutching his pocket watch and staff in one hand and gripping the strap of his alchemist bag in the other he rushed with billowing robes. Suddenly a great creaking sound that shook the mountain to it's core echoed through the mountain range. *Bugger* Jeffrey thought and tried to push his sprint harder than ever. He could see how the chains tethering the temple were starting to come off the cliffside and dragged back into their giant harpoons. Just as the temple started turning from the mountainside Jeffrey leapt aboard the steps. An old piercing voice called from up high ""Apprentice, find something to hold on to."" Jeffrey quickly rummaged through his bag and fished out his enchanted climbing gloves and gripped a statue of a griffon has tightly as he could. A great wind started to envelop the temple, Jeffrey's feet started to ease off the ground from the violent draft. The temple started to slowly spin around and around, faster and faster until the world around it was a blur. Just as suddenly as it had begun it stopped and Jeffrey was presented with an entirely different view. That of a cliffs over a stormy coast. He loosened his grip and fell exhausted onto the floor. He sat there for what felt like hours taking in what had just happened, but the voice from before interrupted him. ""C'mon boy, don't lay about like a lazy ox. Come up here and we will begin.""",0
"Prompt: Write the same story twice. One as a drama and the other as a comedy. Story: He walked down the street, the birdsong hitting his ears like a barrage of bullets. Pain erupting with every step. He could taste alcohol and vomit on his lips. He shouldn't have gone to the party, that was clear. But the events of the night were not entirely his fault. At least that's what he was telling himself. His drink must have been spiked. That's it. That's why he did it. But he knew the truth. He couldn't handle his alcohol. He remembered the screams of dismay, the knife, the pink skin punctured and leaking as it was all a dream. He paused to vomit again in a passing bush.'I wonder whether I should move to Alaska' was his last thought as he dropped onto the grass and the sweet oblivion of unconsciousness. He woke to a text from his friend. He knew that she hadn't been at the party, so the news must have spread round to everyone in town by now. He rolled over, landing face first in a pile of his own vomit. Wiping his face on the damp grass he crawled over to shade of the trees and read her message again. **Comedy** *What did you do! You need to come to my house and we can talk it over before you speak to anyone else. But seriously, stabbing that giant pool inflatable? Tim's mom is so pissed. * **Drama** *What did you do!

"Prompt: There was an angel caught in the power lines. Story: It was my first day on the job, and the first time I ever smelled burning angel wings. I was shadowing Mike Fenwick, an old hand at wildlife and pest control and one of the best in the business. After twenty years working municipal, he'd gone independent with his own company, Fenwick Animal Control, and soon scored a corporate contract to supply animal control services to General Electric. His job was to patrol their southern Illinois facilities looking for evidence of vermin and pests, respond to calls regarding nuisance animals, set traps and remove captured animals, that sort of thing. Business was good, and he'd taken on several technicians to help him manage an expanding workload. I was the latest. I was fresh out of a Wildlife Biology degree, and expecting to spend my days wrangling possums, raccoons, mice and the like. The one thing I hadn't expected to be wrangling was angels, but we got the call at 11:20am, an angel trapped in the power-lines south of Pittsburg, and Mike set me straight on the way over there. ""Most sixty percent of our work right now is angels,"" he told me. ""Clients like to keep it on the down low, so you don't hear about it so much. Not good PR to have pictures of an angel getting cooked in your UHV line on the the six o'clock news, or smeared on the grille of one of your fleet trucks. But it's a real problem, for them anyway. For us it's gravy."" ""But where do they come from?"" ""There's a big nest down Shawnee way, somewhere in the national forest they reckon but they haven't figured out where. Sometimes you get whole flocks of them coming out at once. Quite a sight if you get to see it."" ""Yeah, but where do they *come* from,"" I said. ""Do you know? Everyone tells a different story."" ""Well,"" Mike said, ""All I can say is I know a story too. Can't say it's for true for sure, but I've discussed the matter with some important folks over the years, and they've said the same thing."" ""What's the story?"" ""Well, just a moment, we're here."" Here was a spot a indistinguishable from any other in the endless, flat landscape of cornfields through which we'd driven. Only Mike's GPS could tell us we were in the right spot. The power-lines were a ways off from the highway, so we'd have to walk a bit. ""I hope it did't get stuck up there,"" said Mike, ""I don't fancy doing live-line work."" He grabbed a large bag of gear from the back of the truck, which he then handed to me, and we started walking. ""The story I heard,"" I said, after a minute or two, ""is that it was some evangelical pastor, who was also a genetics genius. Thought he'd create his own army of angels to help bring God's kingdom to Earth."" Mike just let out a chuckle at that. ""Kid, I met a few pastors in my time, and not one of them was a genius in any sort of science. No, that story's mostly horseshit, I'm afraid. There's a grain of truth to it, but just a grain."" By then we'd reached the base of the transmission tower. Scattered around there was a welter of white feathers, but no sign of the angel itself. Looking up, we could just about make out the shape of something, lodged into the tower's girders. ""God damn it,"" said Mike, ""Don't suppose you've got any experience climbing these things?"" ""None."" ""Well, we'll have to do something about that, but not today. Guess I'm going up there."" He started rooting around in the pack for various pieces of protective equipment, and donning them. ""Angels are genetic splices, that much is right,"" he said, as he was getting prepared. ""But it wasn't some crazy pastor or lone genius, it was Apple."" ""Apple?"" I said. ""The computer company?"" ""That's right."" Without explaining further he clipped a hot stick to his back and began climbing. I watched him for a while, then began sweeping up some of the stray feathers into a duffel bag. After five minutes, I looked up again to see he'd reached the object trapped in the tower. I could just about make out him poking and shoving it with the hot stick. Suddenly, something dislodged from the tower and fell. For a moment, my heart was in my mouth, thinking it was Mike. But it wasn't. Eighty pounds of charred and smouldering angel carcass crashed to the floor beside me in an explosion of dust, blood and feathers. I let out an involuntary cry and leapt backwards. From up above, I could hear Mike laughing. Once I got my nerve back, I approached the thing. I'd never seen an angel this close before, dead or alive. Besides the stench of the burnt wings and flesh, what I noticed was how *weird* it looked. From a distance, angels looked the part, with smooth pink flesh, white-clad bodies, and great feathered wings. Up close, you could see how freakish they were. Like a strange cross between humans, birds and pigs, with big wide eyes and strange puckered mouths half way between beaks and lips. Mike got down quicker than he'd gone up. ""What are you gawking at,"" he said when he saw me examining the angel. ""Get it bagged up."" It took us a good twenty minutes to collect all the feathers and pieces of the carcass into sanitary containers, then we hauled it back to the truck. Once we were done, Mike lit a cigarette and we stood watching the corn waving over the endless fields. ""Get a good look at it then?"" Mike asked. ""Yeah,"" I said, ""I didn't realise how fucked up they were."" ""That's the DNA splicing. About ten different animals in there: birds, pigs, mice, you name it."" ""Humans?"" ""Nope, that'd be illegal. And believe it or not that thing was created legally."" ""By Apple."" ""By Apple. It was for a product launch. Their iHolocube, about twelve years back, remember it? Well they wanted to make a big splash at the reveal, and it just so happened they had a skunkworks gene splicing lab. I mean, all the big companies did back then, before the government cracked down. Someone had the bright idea of making angels, actual angels, by splicing bird and mammal DNA."" ""See the idea was to only create a few. Maybe a dozen or so. They'd be released into the air at the event, where they fly around like they were trained to do. Nobody would get a really good look at them, enough to see the seams, so to speak, and then they'd be put back into captivity. I guess they'd be kept as pets for a while, or just disposed of. Except they never even made it to the launch. There was an accident at the lab, and the whole flock escaped. What's more, they weren't sterile, like they were supposed to be. They bred. And bred. And now they've spread all over the country, but particularly in the midwest. For whatever reason, the climate here suits them."" ""That's a crazy story,"" I said. ""It is,"" Mike replied. ""But it's what I've been told. In a way there's a kind of poetry to it."" ""How so?"" ""Well, scripture says God in heaven created the angels, and then created man. Then the first species we create all on our own is an angel. Makes you wonder what those tech boys might cook up next."" With that, he finished his cigarette and we climbed back into the truck. ""It's about time for lunch,"" Mike said. ""I know a decent diner not too far from here. Say, you ever eaten one of these things?""",0
"Prompt: Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. Story: I first met her when I was 5, at a playground my mother used to take me. I knew right away that I want to be with her for a very very long time. Her glorious halo of golden hair that frames her majestic face made her look like an angel. We went steady at a pretty young age and got married soon after we found out about baby Agnes. But baby Agnes did not join us. She was only 7 months old in her belly when baby Agnes's heart stopped beating. We were very sad, even though our 22-year old faces didn't show it. But we were there for each other, we held each other up so we could be stronger together. The drinking helped too. The first time I was hospitalised after falling down the stairs was after the day I celebrated my 24th birthday. It was entirely my fault, I shouldn't have been shouting so loudly at her, she didn't mean to elbow me when she turned around. I only broke a toe at that time. She looked so beautiful trying to apologize to me, when it's obviously just an accident. We started putting knives away when we had another accident a year later. We were doing one of our silly arguments again when I was being too stubborn to understand what she's trying to say, and in her excitement to show me, she accidentally hit one of the knive's hilt that caused it to fly through the sky and hit me in my eyeball. I started wearing an eye patch after that, and went around calling myself ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" for the kids in the neighbourhood. When she started talking to me about leaving, that's when I realised that I've pushed her away too far already, and I really need to change so I can always be the best for her. I got a new job that made her happier, spent more time at home and tried to do more chores at home. In fact, I was so determined to show her how I've changed, that I stopped drinking soon. I told her that it's all hers to enjoy, since she was always happiest after a good session of drinking. I lost her to a disease soon after that. The doctors said it was too late to do anything for her, with the amount of poison in her. I didn't understand it at all, we tried to eat carefully and always brushed our teeth after every meal. How could she get sick so quickly? ""I said, my name is Adriana. What's yours?"" I snapped back to the playground I'm in, I'm still sitting on the see-saw and she's still standing in front of me with her hand in front of me, waiting for me to shake. ""I'm Jack."" I said proudly. Then I showed her my Tonka truck, and when she squealed happily at that, I knew we were going to be best friends forever.",0
"Prompt: You get a deep cut for the first time in your life, instead of bone or muscle, you see wires. Story: So I was working with the saw and I was tired and slipped and before I knew it, I had a huge gash on my forearm where blood wasn't pouring out. When the initial shock had worn off and the lack of any mind-numbing pain had convinced me that something was *off* about this, I started looking at the wound and that's when I saw it. Wires, shiny copper wires everywhere. There wasn't any more blood, apparently in deep cuts like this there wasn't enough blood to properly bleed. So I tried to clean it out myself which was really hard since touching those wires felt good. I had to resist the urge to pull some of them out. I bandaged my arm and then took some painkillers and went to sleep. The day after I woke up, once I remembered my new situation, I opened up the gauss pad to see if it had gotten better, but instead, it had gotten much much worse. The skin around the wound had started to melt as if it was no longer alive, the smell was horrendous, so I called my good friend Kyle, the doctor, and asked him if I could have a private appointment. From the sound of my voice, Kyle obviously knew something was up, so he told me to swing by his clinic at ten pm. Once I arrived, I told him to grab a seat and told the truth. It wasn't until I showed him the arm that he said ""Geeze, I thought you were having a psychotic episode or something, but this.... this is real isn't it?"" Then after examining the wound, he confirmed that which I already knew, that the skin around it was dying and that it was spreading fast. He then told me he'd need a sample of those wires to know what they were. As he looked at me, I felt a surge of strange thoughts start to course through my head, but I simply nooded and he got to work on getting one of those out. As he started pulling, I tensed up and he tried to ease up on the procedure. After it was done, he apologized for being so blunt and that he didn't know they were that sensitive. I could again only nod at his words. But he'd been wrong about the pain, what I had felt when he pulled it out was a pure and unbrideled sense of exctasy. It was absolute bliss to have it pulled. So while he went over the microscope, I was trying to hide my sudden erection under my coat. It had literarly been one of the most fundamentally rewarding and satisfying feeelings and sensations I'd ever felt in my whole life. But I was interrupted in my thoughts by a strange gurgling sound. When I looked up to where Kyle was standing, I could see that he was bleeding from a hole in his neck, as I watched him he slumped over on the floor and a big blood puddle started forming under his body. Then I saw the wire come crawling out of his body and I knew that it had killed him to protect itself. Now I'm sitting here in a corner in the building, waiting for the police to show up, I've told them everything and even if they don't believe me, they still have to come here and investigate. The wound is spreading more and more over my body, but I don't care about that anymore because of the feeling the new exposed wiring is giving me, it's like the air is singing to it. As more and more of it vanishes, I start feeling more alive, more in tune with my new self a self that only wants to pick... pull... pick and pull... Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire OooooooOOOOoooh... here we..nnggg.... go again......",0
"Prompt: In a world where lying is immediately detected by a phone app, you go into a bar and tell your friends you 've had the worst day in the history of mankind. The app detects you 're telling the truth. You proceed to tell them about your day ... Story: I open the pub door. Smells of beer, pub food, and warm bodies hit me. I step over the threshold. I become aware of the petite woman with too-dark makeup laughing. She's leaning on the chest of a man who could grace the cover of a muscle-mag. I force myself to look past them. This couple's holding hands, frilly drinks forgotten. The brunette with the long hair brings the hand of the short-haired woman to her lips, kisses each finger while staring into the other woman's eyes. On my left, a man with broad shoulders and well-defined muscles wheels his chair towards a table, grinning as he greets the attractive redhead waiting there. She blows him a kiss and puts down her phone. I wind my way through the tables, looking for Heidi's tumble of blond curls. There, with Chace by her side. I must have really freaked her out. She waves at me as I pass the last few blissfully unaware patrons. “ Heidi said you claimed you had the worst day ever, and that our app didn't work. ” Chace's head tilts forward and his eyes are almost black. The last time I saw that look, it was right before he threw my ex-boyfriend out the door. I'd been right to call Chace and Heidi over that night. The ex had broken in, threatened to kill me. And after the last few weeks, Chace's hostility is understandable. “ Hi Chace. ” I swallow. “ I understand your … response. ” I pull out a chair, sit down. I shiver in my coat. I meet his eyes, see them narrow. “ You're ghost white, Laurel. This has gotten to the point of crazy. I'm seriously considering calling the mental health crisis line. ” Heidi slides her delicate hand onto his forearm. I fold my hands on the table in front of me. Strong hands. That's what Heidi's mother had said. I shudder and grimace, clinch my hands into fists. I force out “ I'm not surprised. I've considered calling them myself. ” As Heidi leans over the table, I realize I'd whispered. Heidi wraps my fists in her hands. I flinch. She's in mother-mode. “ Have the dreams gotten worse? Last month, it was Pompeii. And then last week, the first world war. ” She moves next to me, wraps her arm around me. I hunch away from her. “ You- you don't want to be close to me. ” Heidi puts one hand on my shoulder, keeps the other on my hands. “ Nonsense. You'll talk about your day, whatever this worst day in your life is, and we'll have some drinks. We'll move past it same way we did when Chace tossed The Creep out. ” The truth alarm from her phone silences the conversations throughout the pub. Chace fumbles with her phone to clear it. I close my eyes. “ We won't ever forget this, Heidi. ” I look at her. The confusion and shock distort her normally peaceful face. I've always been troubled, and her face typically calms me. I'd never see that calm again. “ I dreamt of Hitler, the peace of the early 21st century. ” I finally break. I cover my face with my horrible, strong hands. I smear my eyeliner as I try to regain my composure. I desperately look from Heidi to Chace. He meets my eyes, holds my gaze. I know he'll figure it out. I force myself to look at Heidi. “ Heidi, I'm sorry. I… ” I take a deep breath. “ I saw your great-grandparents. And then your parents. That's when -- that's when I started to figure it out. ” “ No, no. You never met them. ” Tears stream down her face as the horror of her parent's death floods back. “ You never met them! ” She stands as she yells, knocking over her chair. The pub goes quiet again. I manage to whisper, “ I saw their pictures in your house. I… I've seen other things. Heidi, I saw Napoleon killed. I saw the Moradabad riots, the Rwandan genocide… ” I helplessly look at Chace. He holds Heidi's phone, ready to quiet the alarm. His voice helps ground me. “ Today you realized you're seeing the pain of humanity. Every time you sleep. ” I nod. The alarm never sounds. I force myself to form the words, to verbalize the fear. “ What happens after I see today? ”",0
"Prompt: The monster under your bed, the monster in the closet, the monster tapping on your window, the monster hiding in the basement, and the monster living in the attic all try to compete with each other to give you the biggest scare. It 's become less scary and more annoying. Story: I awoke to the sensation of warmth on the back of my neck. My vision still blurry and my mind not fully awake, I turn over to see a creature with jet black eyes, orange skin, and the mane of a lion staring back at me. ""Good morning, Frank. You know that hasn't scared me in years. The breath was a nice touch, though."" ""Yeah, but I thought maybe the change would be enough. I don't really care for the prize this time, anyways."" He wasn't very enthusiastic this time. I put on my slippers and my glasses and headed downstairs to the kitchen. Upon opening the fridge, a small monkey-like creature jumped out and hissed, it's hands raised in the air. I let out a chuckle. ""Hello to you, Marcell. You didn't drink all the milk, did you?"" I already knew he had. ""Man, I was really hoping I'd get a scare out of you this time. At least a twitch."" He sounded disappointed. ""We've got a really cool pocket knife up for grabs this time."" I turned and headed for the living room, so I could turn on the news. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Jerry the Yeti in my driveway, climbing under my car. He's never been very inconspicuous. After a few failed jump-scares from the guys, I started getting ready for work. Their little game runs until I leave, unless no one scares me. I usually just pretend to be scared to the last one, but I just wasn't feeling it today. They'll have to try again when I get home. My drive to work consisted of me listening to Jesse the Imp trying to conceal his breathing in my back seat. Oddly enough, he never jumped out at me. Probably fell asleep. Poor thing. While I was at my desk, I found myself struggling to remember what life was like before my monsters. They can be annoying at times, sure. But they are just trying to find some fun in this life. Can't blame them for that. I must have dozed off at my desk, because the next thing I knew, my boss was shaking me. ""Wha.... What's the deal..."" It seemed difficult to talk. His voice sounded so far away, and so urgent. I thought I heard him saying something like, ""coming back to us"" and ""it's working"". I have things strange little episodes sometimes, though. They always pass after a few minutes, and this one was no different. I'll probably have one or two more episodes before I leave work, and get to go back home to my little monsters. Oh, and I have to buy more milk. Dammit, Marcell. [ Edit: This is the first thing I've written in about 10 years, and I would love some helpful criticism from anyone that happens to read it. ]",0
"Prompt: '' That 's it! '' shouts the DM, `` You say I 'm too easy on you as a DM? Well I 've got the dungeon of bullshit all lined up, none of you fuckers are making it out! '' Let 's see the in game perspective Story: The party approached the cavern where the Great Beast lay, the promise of gold and riches lifting their spirits as they stopped before the mouth of the cave. ""I think we should do an equipment check,"" said Erik, looking warily at the darkness beyond. ""Remember when I stood on his shoulders,"" Buckthorn the Axe-crazed said to Ragnar, gesturing back at the rogue, ""and scared off the kobolds?"" ""Yeah,"" said Ragnar dismissively, ""but remember when I punched that naga in the face?"" The self-proclaimed ""ninja barbarian"" flexed his arms. He looked in to the cave. ""I see.... nothing. Man, it's dark. Let me try again."" He squinted and thrust his face forward, muscles tense with concentration. He nodded. Buckthorn looked into the cave, as well. He, too, nodded. Erik looked at them expectantly. ""Well?"" They looked back at him blankly. ""What do you see?"" ""Rocks,"" said Ragnar. ""A floor,"" said Buckthorn, grinning. The half-elf sighed and looked into the cavern himself. He saw nothing which stood out to him; no signs of movement, no traces of life. ""Alright, so I'll go in and check for..."" He trailed off as Buckthorn and Ragnar entered the cavern, arguing about who was going to lead the party. Erik rolled his eyes and followed cautiously. Their voices echoed as they walked deeper into the cave. The darkness swallowed them. Ragnar stumbled on a low stalagmite and fell on his knees, grumbling angrily about how he should have been able to see it. ""Who has a lantern?"" asked Erik. The darkness continued ahead of them, and even he was just starting to have troubles with the dim light. ""I do,"" said Buckthorn. There was a cacophony of noise as he rummaged around in his pack. More noise followed as he struggled to light it. ""Why isn't it working?"" he said angrily. ""We used it a lot when we were tracking those slavers,"" said Erik. ""Which could have made us a lot of money, if we had just sold them,"" interjected Ragnar. ""And?"" prompted Buckthorn. ""Did you ever get more oil?"" ""Oh, come on!"" exclaimed Buckthorn. ""Of course I would have gotten more oil! We were in town for days. I must have..."" he trailed off. ""Well,"" replied Erik, ""obviously not."" ""Hold on,"" said Ragnar. He pulled a flask out of his pack. ""Put this in it."" ""Alcohol? Really?"" said Erik as Buckthorn took the flask. He backed away while Buckthorn added the liquid to the lantern and lit it. A low flame ignited and Buckthorn and Ragnar both exclaimed in triumph. A green flash was all that alerted them before the displacer beast attacked, silently striking out at Ragnar with a tentacle. Buckthorn dropped the lantern in surprise. They fought by the dim, flickering light. The displacer beast got in a couple strikes before their weapons were drawn and then the party began fighting back. ""What are you doing?"" yelled Erik as he dodged a tentacle. ""Trying to hit him in the eye,"" roared Ragnar, missing again as he poked at the displacer beast's face with his greatsword. Suddenly, a roar shook the cavern. Erik spun and saw an owlbear entering the cave. ""What the hell?"" he yelled as the creature ran at them. He engaged the owlbear while Ragnar and Buckthorn tried to fight the displacer beast. Buckthorn stumbled against a stalagmite as he dodged. He moved to leap back into battle, but instead fell flat on the floor. Looking back, he saw gray tentacles wrapped around his ankles, and an eye slowly appearing in the stalagmite. ""What the fuck is that?"" he cried as a mouth began to gape beneath the eye. He reached for his axe as it began dragging him back. Ragnar had finally given up the finesse and was hacking and slashing as the displacer beast danced around him, lashing at him with its tentacles. Ragnar got in a couple lucky shots, but he was slowing down. Something from the ceiling dripped on his head. The displacer beast froze, looking up. Ragnar took advantage of the pause and got in a good strike. The beast howled and disappeared. Ragnar raised his sword in victory and something wet and sticky enveloped his hand. Looking up in surprise, he saw a long tendril of gray ooze wrapped around his fist. He tried to yank his hand down, but the tendril held firm as it slowly crept up his arm. Buckthorn screamed as the tentacled stalagmite began to constrict his body, its tentacles covering him from shoulders to feet. It lifted his small, heavy body toward its mouth and ended his screams. Ragnar was lifted toward the cave ceiling as the ooze continued to envelope his body. He slashed ineffectively at it with his dagger, cursing and yelling. His voice became muffled as the ooze pushed him into its core. Erik tried to run from the owlbear, desperation fueling his exhausted feet. His battered, bleeding body stumbled across the cave floor. He was hit in the back by the enraged owlbear and crumpled into a heap against the wall. As the monster reared over him, preparing for the final blow, he moaned: ""I told you guys she was pissed.""",0
"Prompt: You wake up staring into a pair of eyes, your own. Story: I don't know why I fell for Ms Mirror-for-a-face, maybe it was just something about her that was so re-assuring. She never talked back, or talked at all. I could unload my opinions, and her expression would match my own exactly. It was satisfying, empowering. My ex-girlfriends used to tell me I had a massive ego, a textbook narcissist. But they paled in comparison to Ms Mirror-for-a-face. I love her eyes, which were just like my eyes, reflected back at me. She smiles whenever I smile, we're so in sync. Whenever I talk about my politics, my religious beliefs, Ms Mirror-for-a-face always agrees. At least, she seems to. Sometimes she just sits beside me, saying nothing for hours. She doesn't eat, merely stares at me with images of my own eyes. I wonder in those moments whether I'm truly alone. Only for a second, I doubt her. But then she'll hold my hand, a reassuring touch from skin as cold as glass. I love Ms Mirror-for-a-face. Of course there is nothing wrong with our relationship. There's nothing wrong with me, I've found a true love that you will never know. A love without ever having to be challenged, a love without sacrifice, a love without needing to share, without that crawling creeping feeling of loneliness like you've let a lovecraftian horror into your house with an arcane power over you that you can barely understand, let alone fight. I'm not talking of Ms Mirror-for-a-face of course. she is just like me. In every way. And its.... perfect.",0
"Prompt: Write a story reimagining a character from another piece of fiction as down-and-out/washed up/past their prime. Story: He sat in his new office, still amazed that it was finally his. He had fought his way tooth and nail up the corporate ladder, and now it was finally paying off. All the suit wearing, meeting attending, hand shaking, and ass-kissing had finally payed off. ""If only my teenage self could see me now,"" he thought. ""He'd hate me. But what did I know? I was a teenager."" He still remembered those awful boarding schools he had been shipped off to and subsequently kicked out of. He was such a rebel back then, getting in fights and skipping class, he didn't care about anyone but himself. No one except his sister that is. God, when was the last time they'd talked? Christmas? Had it really it really been that long? He'd been so focused on getting this promotion that he hadn't really thought about it. Perhaps he did still focus on himself too much. And he thought about himself then: his past self. The time he skipped school and ran off to New York. The times he'd go to watch the orchestra play with his parents, and the timpani player who was the only one there who seemed to be enjoying what he did. The worn orange hunting hat and bloodstained sweater that he refused to let go of that now sat in a box in his basement. And now here he sat, in a big office, at an important job. A phony. He had become a phony. He even had a name tag on his big phony desk, telling everyone who saw it that Holden Caulfield was a phony.",0
"Prompt: A person has psychic/telekinetic/mind control powers. Based on the distance from the subject they experience lag/jitter/delay. Story: Roughly 7 seconds per 3 paces of distance, that my friend is the best guesstimate I have for the relationship between me and the delay I have to read your thoughts. Here's the thing though, since this process first happened when I was 12 it has been a struggle to live an normal life and blend in with the general public. Can you imagine, sitting in a class to looking at a group of peer ls and them the wave crashes into you, the thoughts and useless wanderings of the mind, other people's minds, flooding into your psyche. To say the least I had a bit of a break down in public and even after two separate therapy sessions with psychiatrist I still was labeled schizophrenic. Everyone wants to think their mind is structured, disciplined, logical, and that somehow everything in the world is reacting to open up that pathway for you to find that magical adventure that leads you to success. Instead, even in the most concentrated of conversations the shit that grabs away at attention is just astounding. For example here is how even the most basic conversation comes out: 'Hey what are you up to tonight' 'Hey how are you' -- OK TONIGHT, WEDNESDAY NOTHING CRAZY IMPORTANT RIGHT 'Doing pretty good, you?' 'Doing well, so what'd you ask' ALRIGHT DO I REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT, IT'S ONLY 2PM, AGENDA, SHOWS, RELAX, HUH THERE'S SOME HOPPING BIRDS 'Got any plans tonight, I was thinking about going to catch a movie, $ 6 Wednesday matinee prices for all movies.' 'Oh thanks, he yeah that could be fun' OK OK 6 BUCKS GOT THAT IN CASH SHOULD BE COVERED GAS IN THE CAR OK THERE WHAT ARE WE SEEING WHAT SO THEY LIKE TO SEE UGH DO NOT MAKE ME WATCH A FUCKING FEEL GOOD MOVIE I COULD WATCH FOR FREE ON NETFLIX IN 6 MONTHS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, THEATERS ARE FOR EXPLOSIONS AND AMAZING SOUND I CA N'T GET AT HOME, DID I LOCK MY GARAGE? 'Great, meet you there at 8' 'OK great!' OK WHATEVER THINK OF A BACK UP ESCAPE PLAN IF THE MOVIE SOUNDS DUMB, BROTHER WANTS TO GET DINNER, FAMILY FIRST, NOBODY ARGUES THAT. Now, let's face it people think a lot faster in their minds, than how they speak, in fact you would have no idea how many times you look for words so quickly in your mind and prioritize mentally your conversation. What I always get is a delayed crazed response that sounds like I am talking to a meth head on Red Bull, and that meth head interrupts me while I'm talking in the middle of my sentences. Luckily for me I have a job where this comes in handy, I work internal audit at a financial firm, and you have no idea how fun my job is",0
"Prompt: Write the most angry, vitriolic thing you have ever written. Make it a love letter. Story: Elizabeth, It's taken me awhile to sit down and write this letter. I kept trying to find ways to distract myself from it, to try to stay busy, but it's no use. I guess I'm still in denial, and thought that if I waited long enough I'd just come back from classes one day and see a message from you on my phone. But now I've finally realized that I may never speak to you again, so I just wanted to put some things down for the record. First of all, you should know that you can do whatever you want with this letter - write back, keep it, tear it up, burn it, whatever. This letter is for you as much as it's for me, and so it up to you to decide what to do with it. I guess I'll start with the thing that I never had the guts to say in person: I love you, Elizabeth. I never had any doubt, from the moment I met you. But for some reason, no matter how sure I was that you were the one, you never seemed to have more than a timid interest in me. How is it that you couldn't see? We were perfect together. Everything was completely comfortable, 100 % natural. I never felt like I had to lie to impress you. I knew that if I could just show you how perfect we were, everything would be golden. But somehow, that never happened. I thought that maybe you were to good for me. Your purity, your beauty, your faith. As I was, I was tainting you every time we touched. I had to change, had to make myself into a better man, one worthy of you. I tried, I really did. I went to church, I volunteered, I gave to charity, I even prayed to a God I hadn't believed in since I was a little kid. But it was only lip service. I knew I couldn't be like that. The harder I tried, more of a liar I felt I became. Each sermon in church was like a knife in my ears - there would be people around me, so happy and certain in their faith, while I sat and cringed at verses the priest delivered. But I would still knee at the altar, still say the words. I had to, for you, Elizabeth. But it never worked. I never changed. It began to spiral out of control. I would wait eagerly to finish my classes just to hear your voice over the phone, and for those moments I was happy, but as soon as I hung up, the self-loathing return. Each day I began to hate myself a little more. I was liar and thief, trying to lie to God and trying to lie to you. I was trying to steal you away from your damn parents, away from those pious guardians who sealed you away so jealously. You made me hate myself so much, I considered suicide. More than once. I never got close, no, but still, the thoughts were there. They'd come with the shame I felt whenever I thought of you. And eventually I realized - it wasn't my fault, it was yours. It was your fault, alright. I knew it as sure I had been sure that we were soul mates. You self-righteous snobbery, that endless piety, that naïve innocence.... you drove me away. And just like I hate myself, I hate you too. But God dammit, I still love you. I still dream of you at night. So kindly get yourself out of my head. I have better things to do than get judging by a arrogant little virgin, no matter how beautiful she is. Forever yours (unfortunately), Ryan",0
"Prompt: You are a teenager with the ability to measure how `` Dangerous '' people are on a scale from 1 to 10 just by looking at them. A normal child would be a 1, while a trained man with an assault rifle might be a 7. Today, you notice the unassuming new kid at school measures a 10. Story: I've always seen the numbers. Or, at least I've seen them for as long as I can remember. Random numbers, single digits at chest level on every person I've ever met. I see them in pictures, and in movies, on TV and in person. The only time I don't see them is when it's a picture of some long dead guy in a history book. The numbers change all the time. Sometimes my friend has a 1, and suddenly it'll be a 4. People in cars usually have higher numbers but those will move around too. I tried for years to figure out what the numbers mean but they don't have a pattern. Like the kid who only wears black and sits at the back of my geography class, his number is jumping up and down all the time. He seems angry, and he'll be at a 2, and then the next day it's a 6 and he couldn't be more calm. His numbers are really different from the rest, I have no idea why. I can see him now, from my lunch table. He just entered the cafeteria. 7, that's pretty high, I hardly ever see it that high. He's coming closer. 8. Looks like he's headed to the center of the room. 9. I've never seen the number get this high before. 10. He's slowly unzipping his jacket, there's a bunch of red pipes strapped to his --",0
"Prompt: ( Harry Potter ) Born a squib to an elitist wizard family, you ran away to attend muggle school. You are now the only human alive with extensive knowledge of both magic and muggle technology. Story: He had finally done it! After six years of research and experiments, Jack had finally isolated the particle responsible for the existence of magic. He pumped his fist in the air in celebration, reveling in the fact the he had just spit in the face of physics. He even gave Oliver a gruesome bear hug, despite the homeless wizard's alcoholic stench. This discovery was going to change everything. Every field of science from genetics to astronomy was going to evolve thanks to this new knowledge. All that was left was to name the particle and submit his findings. Jack was having trouble with the former issue. He would love to have his name plastered all over future textbooks, but Jack Smith particle lacked elegance when written next to Higgs boson. Perhaps he could name it the Redbone particle. No, nothing would displease him more than having his birth family's name where his should be. Jack decided to skip the name problem for the moment. Particle M was a perfectly fine filler for the time being. He still needed to triple check all the calculations, and a second run of the experiment wouldn't hurt. Collecting his notes, the scientist decided to call it a day. Locking the lab door behind him, Jack escorted Oliver out of the campus building and paid him generously. “ Now, remember not to spend all of this on booze, ” he said, handing the wizard an inconspicuous box full of gold coins. “ And please don't show up drunk next time I call you. ” Oliver simply snorted. “ So long as I'm getting paid. ” The wizard started walking away, but quickly backtracked upon checking the box's contents. “ How the bloody hell did a muggle loving squib get his hands on this many Galleons, if you don't mind me asking? ” Jack grated his teeth at the word squib, but held his temper. “ I'm a genius physicist that just found scientific evidence of how magic works. Do you really think it would be that hard for me to obtain a few measly coins? ” Oliver shook his head, mumbling obscenities as he walked away. Jack watched the man for a few seconds before he disappeared into thin air. Looking around, Jack confirmed that he was the only one to notice that Oliver was ever even there and started walking to his car. He would love nothing more than to give a wizard a piece of his mind one of these days. Actually, that wasn't entirely true. Jack would love nothing more than to win a Nobel prize, but showing some witch bitch that gun beats stick was a close second. Jack shook his head, expelling any thoughts of wizards from his mind. He was a genius. Such hellish violence was below him. All he needed was some food. His last meal was breakfast and it was now well into the afternoon. Some pizza and a beer would help his mood. Unfortunately, the pizza would have to wait. As he approached his car, Jack saw a woman in a short, victorian black dress was knocking on the window. His initial thought was to run and call campus security, but at the same time was just wanting to go get dinner. It would be easier to politely ask the woman to leave, and only run away if she pulled a knife on him. “ Excuse ma'am, that's my car you are tapping on, ” he said in a cheery voice. The woman turned around, causing Jack to go wide-eyed in shock. “ Mom?! ” *Perhaps I should have called security. * “ Oh, there you are William. I didn't know you were out. You might want to consider getting a bigger house. ”",0
"Prompt: `` Watch out or you 'll end up like Alice. '' Story: When Lance got into Dartmouth I knew he was up to something. Adderol, blood doping, testosterone supplements, tren. All of these can explain sudden bursts of exemplary behavior, a swift kick in the pants sending a person flying through the realm of desperation and landing them further right on the ol' bell curve. But this I couldn't believe. Lance, whose dorm walls were crisp white, unadorned. Tie was always tied just tight enough, no shirttails loose or threads pulled on his sweater vest. Even during casual weekends, unsurveyed by the authority as it exists in our little school, enjoying darts and billiards in the common room his polo was tucked in crisply to his khakis. There wasn't a rebellious, forward thinking bone in his body. From the deep fires of my revolutionary spirit I knew him to be an enemy, despite the fact that I never heard a strong opinion (pro or anti-authority) from him. At least that's how it started, I saw the Sophomores a year above me start to beef up their applications in December. The institution attracted all kinds of outliers, our lacrosse and academic decathlon teams were undefeated and shared many of the same members, but Lance was not one of the elite few who we all knew would be singled out by the all-powerful Ivy League admissions committees and raised to the heavens of society among the other angels, transcending us mortals' petty competition. I didn't notice when a few of the girls from across the way started lingering outside of the practice field where he played (mediocre) for the soccer team. I didn't see when our math and philosophy professors started smiling, really smiling, when he raised his hand in class. I didn't notice when he was walking with Principle Mikkels, both smiling and laughing, Lance trailing his hand along the fence. He was selecting leaves of ivy from the frame and then forsaking them, dropping them back to earth. I did notice when I was returning from one of my late-night secret trysts with my small pipe and tiny bag of weed. I'd discovered an unpatrolled hallway which led back to just near enough to the dorm doors to make a run for it. The hall trailed along the outside of the West wing, not much was done over here but pieces of art by students were displayed. I normally ignored them in part because they were derivative trash, obviously shat out by some apathetic student on the complacent understanding that any effort at all would guarantee an A, another four points towards the grade point average and the satisfaction of a fine arts graduation requirement. Then I saw it, simple canvas and oil paints. The thing was damn beautiful guys, I don't think any description would do it justice. Just go check it out, it's still up in the hallway. Look at the name at the bottom right and tell me what you see. Actually, fuck it. You know. It's Lance. I started looking at some of his work in other courses, philosophy and math, and I was impressed with the elegance of his arguments, it seemed like he knew much more than the question asked him to and he toyed with each of them, giving them hints through his answers to their simple questions of the much larger questions they should (could) be asking. Acceptances rolled around about a year later and wouldn't you know it but good ol' Lance got a fat parcel in the mail from Dartmouth. I knew the kid's GPA and his SAT and they were much less than outstanding. He sucked at soccer. I truly, honestly believe he got in on the sheer merit of his personal statement and letters of rec. Shit you not, up until that point I wasn't even sure they read those. I had to figure out what was going on. I know it's desperate but I followed him on one of the town trips. He took a few back ways, maybe trying to lose a tail or maybe just rehearsing the convoluted wanderings during which at some point he discovered his destination Eventually he turned into an old shop, a tattered sign the door read ""The rabbit's hole."" Not an adult emporium surprisingly, but close. An old head shop. Looking through the dusty window I saw him trade a wad of bills with an old ponytailed hippy (dressed like some kind of steampunk nobleman, pocketwatches are so lame) for a sheet of what looked like those sugar buttons on thin receipt paper that were popular back in elementary school. I hung around the corner so I could see what he did on the way out, but wouldn't you know it, he turned right into me. I could tell looking into his eyes that he knew I knew. So I guess I knew he knew I knew. Whatever. I asked him very nicely to explain and he seemed more than willing, lead me to a park a few blocks north where the old growth trees and weeping willows turned the sunny day into twilight, ignoring the high noon hour. There gathered there a few of the kids from our school, a few of the girls from across the way, and some townies. They all looked so goddamn happy. They laughed and flirted and ran like little kids, just aimless chase. No rules tag. Tagbacks abound. They explained they'd been buying this stuff, ""like LSD but not at all,"" from the old hippy in the rabbits' hole. They'd been doing it for about a year now, discovered the place entirely on accident while hanging out after a soccer tourney in the town. They offered me a tab. ""Is this stuff risky?"" I asked, I mean I experiment but you know I don't know what the hell it was. ""Not at all. Just.... don't take too much. The creativity can be addicting and if you OD- well I guess not OD but take too much at once, get greedy, it can go bad."" Lance responded to me. ""Watch out, or you'll end up like Alice."" He gestured to the edge of a park where (I can't believe I didn't notice before) It looked like a beautiful blonde girl in her prep school uniform was grinning and laughing, smiling at the trees. ""She's been like this for about a week now, she keeps talking about all sorts of weird shit. Growing bigger and smaller, disappearing cats. We tried to keep it secret but that's hard when you're tripping twenty-four-seven, you know? Teachers noticed. It's bad, her folks are going to get her in a psychiatric camp somewhere in the West once they get back from Fire Island. She won't snitch on us though."" I stared hard at her strange posture and face, grin as big as you please, eyes wide. She babbled like a toddler. I turned back to Lance, his smile of a similar quality but lesser magnitude. ""Definitely not gon na happen to you. You want some?"" What did I choose? Well I think the fact that I'm fucking stalling on my degree in community college right now, working part time at the stupid grocery store as a bag boy should tell you the answer. If I could go back I'd take that tab in a heartbeat.",0
"Prompt: You made a deal with the Devil, and now he 's come to collect. Story: Jim Watson was eating an apple when the Devil appeared before him, but he didn't stop. It was juicy with just the right balance of sweet and tangy, a honeycrisp he'd picked up from the Farmer's Market just that morning. The acrid smell marking the presence of the Dark One threatened to sour Jim's enjoyment of his succulent treat, so he put a dishtowel to his face and walked into the dining room. “ Please, just stay in there. I can hear you just fine, ” he said, talking around chewed up apple. A deep purple light beamed from underneath the door, and tendrils of smoke crept out, but the door itself didn't move. The sharp sound of clacking could be heard from the kitchen. Claws. When the Devil spoke, the sound of it should have made Jim's skin crawl; it sounded like the voice of an average, congenial man, the sort of man who would shake your hand with a smile, imitated poorly. “ Jim, buddy. It's done. She's not gon na bother you no more. ” “ Now that don't sound like Sheila, Mr. Satan, ” Jim said. “ You sure we're talking about the same woman? She's got a tendency to just turn up on you. That's the whole reason I had to come to you in the first place. ” “ Oh, don't you worry now, Jim, ” said the Devil. “ You won't be seeing your wife no more. ” “ And you can't bring her back? She's gone? ” “ I said you won't be seeing her again, Jim, and you won't. ” The voice was stern now. Jim gaped his jaw like a snake to gob an extra big bite of apple. He chewed loud and long, sucking out the juice from the tender pulp as he gnashed it between his molars. He nibbled errant bits of peel as it all went down his throat, and then he went for another bite. Jim smacked his lips and dashed to lick the dripping juice from his fingers before it fell to the carpet. He made a scene of eating a damn apple, and the Prince of Lies waited patiently for his reply. Not a claw clacked on the tile as Jim ate; the only sound was the man's gluttonous glee. Jim set the half-eaten apple on the table, and wiped his hands with a napkin. “ Mr. Satan? ” he said. “ Yes, Jim. ” “ How'd you do it? ” “ Oh, Jim. Now, I wouldn't want to tell you that. ” “ And why not? ” “ Well, there are a lot of reasons, really, but think about it. When the police come knocking, and you realize they will, right? ” “ I guess I hadn't thought about it. ” “ You should think about it. Tell me, Jim, when they tell you what they found, do want to fake surprise, or do you want to really be surprised? ” “ That's a good point, Mr. Satan. ” “ Well I'd hate to see someone get what they want and then not be able to enjoy it. ” Jim fingered the apple, rotating it slowly on the surface of the table. “ Mr Satan, I thank you for what you've done, sir, but I think it's time we parted ways. I've got a dinner to cook, and I'm sure, well, I'm sure you're pretty busy yourself. ” “ You could say that. ” “ Well, then. ” “ Jim, ” said the Devil. His voice was a poorer imitation than before. “ Aren't you forgetting something? Jim grinned. “ I don't think so. ” “ Jim, ” said the Devil. The purple light began to pulsate slowly, swirling with midnight blues and bloody reds. “ Your soul belongs to me. ” Jim picked up the apple and took another bite. His mouth full, he shook a finger at the door slowly, saying, “ Now that's where you're wrong, Mr. Satan. Now now, I know I promised you my soul in exchange for your little favor. That's true. But I didn't tell you that I'd already traded my soul away before I ever called you up. ” “ You gave it away, ” said the Devil. Jim hacked off another chunk of apple with his incisors, smacking as loudly as before. “ That's right. My friend Sam and I traded each others' souls about a week ago. I've got his, and he's got mine. I signed that weird paper you showed me, and I know I said I'd give you my soul, but I don't have it. It ain't mine to give any more. But hey, make me an offer and I might be willing to part with Sam's soul. I doubt he'd even miss it. ” “ No thank you. I don't really want it. ” “ Well good bye, Mr. Satan. You're not getting mine. ” “ I'm not? Then what's this? ” There was a crinkle of paper, and then a single sheet slid out from under the kitchen door. It was a note, rumpled slightly, a yellow page from a legal pad handwritten in pen. Jim's heart fell into his stomach. “ That's my– ” “ Contract. ” “ My contract. ” “ Amended. Slightly. ” Jim lost his grip on the apple, and it fell to the floor. “ Sam sold it to you, ” he whispered. “ What did he want? ” “ Your wife. ” “ But you said, you said she was.... ” “ I said you won't be seeing her again, Jim, and you won't. ” The purple light went out. The kitchen door swung open.",0
"Prompt: You are the hostage of a famous serial killer. The serial killer announces if you tell them a secret about yourself that is shocking enough, they 'll let you live. To date, they have only freed one other person. Story: ""Tell me a secret, and I'll let you go."" That's what he told me, that's what he told so many others. I could barely make out the words through the drugs he used to knock me out. I was still regaining consciousness.... I needed to bide my time. look for a way out. ""Yeah, okay, a secret. sure. Sit down. I need a minute."" I knew it wasn't going to buy me much time. but my mind was still reeling, and I had to take stock of my surroundings. a dingy old basement, an old boiler pipe sticking out of the wall, looks rusted. might be able to kick it loose? Oh, sees my hands are taped together. ""you haven't got long kid."" he tells me. ""Or do you wan na join the others?"" I just smile and say ""What would be the fun in that? you wouldn't get to hear my secret. and mines the greatest secret there is. Better than even yours."" He gives a short loud laugh, loud enough to tell me I can't yell for help. I'm on my own. My phone won't get reception down here.... ""You think you know anything about me kid?"" ""You're a serial killer, one of the most vicious in years. I've watched the news. I've heard about what you did. You're messed up. You killed alot of innocent people."" He stands up and brandishes his knife large and sharp. ""well they wouldn't share, so I had to take something from them. Looks like you're going to do the same thing."" He begins to approach and I say. ""Oh I'll share.... When you sit."" He stops. ""Once you sit down, I promise greatest secret yet. If not, kill me. I won't even fight back."" he sneers at me and says. ""I like it when they fight."" ""then You'll love me. Sit."" He grabs an old metal chair from the corner and sits down. He's a large guy, but despite it's shambled state and his size It holds. Excellent. now one final thing. I need a weakness.... ""You're s serial killer..."" I say starting off. and he gets frustrated, getting up. ``.... and so am I."" this stops him cold in his track. unsure of what he heard. ""come again?"" ""I'm a serial killer."" The words hang in the air like I had said'I'm from pluto.' ""Bullshit."" he finally says after a moment. ""I.... Am.... A.... serial.... Killer..."" It's true, sort of.... ""Then how come I haven't heard of you? Only bodies popping up in the media are mine."" He says, with a confused inquiring tone of voice. I definitely have his interest. ""I could lie."" I start explaining. ""and say that I hide my activities well, making my victims look like accidents. or do all my killing overseas on vacation. but the truth is, I haven't killed anyone. but the urge? the compulsion? It's there. that little voice at the back of our minds, That Demon screaming at us To kill. to see the blood of others running over our hands. to see the light go out in their eyes."" My words have an effect on him. and frankly, on me too. I've always done well to fight that urge. For all I know I could be the one person strong enough to fight it. But then, he starts to pace. He considers what I'm saying. and scratches his face. and I watch as he walks. Preferring to stay on his right foot. as his left comes down his left knee seems to give way, just for an instant.... YES! A weakness! ""alright, lets say I believe you, which I don't. why haven't you killed anybody. you say you have that need.... you some kind of pussy?"" I simply smile and say. ""ah, but that's my secret, I'm stronger than you. I'm strong enough to resist the urge to kill. every day my demon tells me'kill them, kill them all.' and I say No."" He shakes his head and says ""Nope, not buying it kid. sorry, but times up."" he raises His knife and I strike. he's given me to long, my head is clear. I charge suddenly. getting up from the floor and pouncing, tacking him and striking his left knee all at once. He falls to the floor in a heap and I go for the rusty pipe. His knife fly's across the basebent floor and He chases after it. I manage to get the pipe between the opening in the duct tapped hands. The tape which had been restraining me, now only helps me hold my make shift weapon. He turns to me just in time to see the pipe strike his face. I see some blood, and I don't know if I've killed him, or Just knocked him unconscious. No time to worry about that, he's not moving. After a good ten minutes, I manage to get the tape off my hands. then I look at my would be killer. I notice his chest, still moving. He's alive? and helpless.... No one would miss him, and he wouldn't get to hurt anyone else.... oh to finally feed that monster in my soul. I wasn't lying about that by the way.I roll him over and tape his hands behind his back. Then I spot a rope he hand in the corner near where I woke up. thank god I woke up before He could restrain me better. Once I'm sure he's not getting out I head upstairs and pull my cellphone out of my pocket. I dial 911 and let them know what happened. minus confessing about my urges of course. He's pulled out the basement, of course by now he's conscious again. He looks at me as they are hauling him away and he says ""I know you're secret! I know your secret!"" I'll never forget the look he gave me with those mad eyes. I imagine it was the same look he had on his face when they gave him the lethal injection. I was there for that. The police question me about my encounter with the serial killer, ask me how I escape They give me a funny look and say ""You have a knack for getting yourself in trouble don't you?"" I feign innocence. ""what do you mean officer?"" he opens up my file and says to me. ""says here, you were involved in a gang shootout two years ago..."" Involved? I non-violently subdued two wanted fugitives single-evenhandedly. ""then you prevented a domestic disturbance."" Of a man who had been involved in organized crime. had to skip town after that. ""Now you managed to find one of this cities worst serial killers. Seems like luck just isn't on your side."" I just shrug. happy than my fourth'victim' will likely get the death sentence. Don't you love states with the death penalty? why do serial killers even bother to do it themselves these days?",0
"Prompt: Years ago, you made a deal with the Devil to be granted a single wish. All your memories of the deal were then wiped. Years later, your wish is fulfilled and you are about to find out what price your younger self was willing to pay to make it come true. Story: Dear John, If you are reading this, it means you have finally become old enough to inherit what I have left for you. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, and I plead your forgiveness, if you would just listen. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- When the doorbell began to ring, I set down my coffee onto the table and abandoned my breakfast for the moment. Yawning, I opened the door and scratched my eyes. ""Morning. What do you need?"" I announced to the stranger. The man nodded and smiled. ""May I come in to discuss something with you? I'll only be ten minutes."" I sighed and checked my watch. 6:30 am, which meant I had only an hour to make it to work on time. ""Alright, but it better be under fifteen minutes."" The man nodded and I led him in. As he sat at the table quietly, and quite pleasantly, something just didn't seem right about this man. His tailored suit, fine cut hair and overall pleasantness was just unsettling. Putting my suspicions aside however, I offered him coffee. He shook his head. ""Coffee is much to bitter for me, I could never handle the taste of it."" ""What will do then?"" I inquired, looking at my watch, 6:32. ""Orange juice will do just fine. The toy firetruck on the floor tells me that you must have that."" I nodded and poured him a glass of orange juice, sitting down across from him afterwards. A few moments of awkward silence followed where he simply sat, sipping at the orange juice almost ponderously. ""Introductions are always the hardest..."" he began, ""I'm what you call a debt collector. Except I only collect for very special debts. The kind someone very arrogant, stupid, or desperate would make."" Half insulted, half intrigued, I ventured: ""Which one am I?"" He laughed with a sort of painful, morbid and hollow chuckle. ""I would say desperate. Ten years ago, faced with death before your time you offered your firstborn in exchange for extra time added onto your own. I guess you didn't realize at the time that these deals do exist, and you were chosen as a recipient."" Infuriated, I squeezed my end of the table, and demanded ""And just who are you to feed me these lies in my own home?!"" The man sighed sadly, extended his arm and touched me, right after I slapped his hand. Immediately, long buried memories returned. ""You were to die in a car accident as written here, in my book of death. You were driving home from a party and you were hit by a drunk driver. The only reason you lived to sign out of the hospital was because you signed over your firstborn son to Satan, my boss."" In painful memory, I recalled it all, and I looked to the small red firetruck that lay on its side in between us on the table. ""Isn't there some other way?!"" I cried, taking the firetruck on the table. ""He's my son..."" The demon frowned sadly, softly removing the red firetruck from my hand. ""I say this all the time.... no. I am sorry. Lead me to him, otherwise the rules state I must take your soul, and those of your other family members as well."" Full of remorse and flagging hope, I lead the man to your crib. When we arrived, the water became a torrent of sobs that wanted to vanquish the fire of the hell ahead of you. I hugged your sleeping body, holding you close. One last time, I begged: ""Isn't there another way?"" ""The only way..."" he started, I cut him off immediately ""I'll do it. Whatever it takes for my little boy."" The demon now drew tears. ""The only way.... is soul for soul. You, as the recipient of the deal, must trade your own soul in exchange for your son's."" My eyes sank to the ground, my heart knowing the only decision that could be made. The demon too, let his eyes fall, and he handed me the firetruck. slowly, I placed you in your bed next to your beloved toy, and kissed you goodbye. The demon mumbled in sorrow. ""Anything you need to do before I write you into the book of death?"" I nodded, and retrieved a pen, my best envelope, and some paper. Frantically, sorrowfully, and sadly, I ran the pen across the letter..... 'Dear John,' it read.",0
"Prompt: You are an omnipotent god. Out of boredom you decided to live an ordinary human life vowing not to use your power. 15 years has pass and you have a 9 to 5 working for a major tech company. Your boss has been tormenting you for years and you have reach your limit Story: Everyone was staring with disgust at the closed door, the blinds down as the manager yelled at their co-worker. The man was a maniac and the only reason no-one had stood up to him was because he could get them fired at a moment's notice and his psychotic temper. Just as security had arrived the door violently swung open and the woman was thrown out to the ground by the hair.'I just fired this cunt!' he yelled, shocking everyone.'Get her out of here NOW!! All of you, back to work!' The guards were good people, helping her up and out while also calling HR and reporting his outburst. As I went back to the cubicle beside mine, Tim silently hung up and then went back to filing his report.'I just called the police,' he silently said to me.'Shit.... Carol didn't deserve that.' I knew why it happened - despite how much of a terrible reason it was - but I decided to humor my colleague.'What did she do to set him off?' 'She scratched his Lamborghini on the way in this morning,' he answered me.'A small scratch...' We quieted down as the HR representatives walked towards his office, entering and locking the door behind them. Tim carefully put an earpiece in his head and tapped the screen of his phone, collecting more evidence that he can use to denounce his soon-to-be former employer as he plans to leave the current job of writing tech manuals. To mortals of old, I was once known as a God. I didn't particularly enjoy the worship, especially when they completely misrepresented me to fit their ideals, but I did enjoy watching them in life and granting boons to those I had found.... interesting. Of course, a minor deity, learning of my odd fascination with humans, challenged me to live among them as long as possible and masquerade as a mortal. If I could reach the 20-year mark, I'd win our little contest. Unfortunately, Brad was my manager within this company. He was one of those people who had rich parents who cared more about their reputation rather than treating their son. But he knows what he's doing harms others and enjoys it. He was currently trying to frame Carol for embezzling funds from the company, to ""Get back the wages that treacherous bitch should never have been paid"". Tim had heard that and was growing uncomfortable. We had almost rejoiced when 5 o'clock arrived and HR dismissed us so that Brad could hold us back for unpaid ""overtime"". I had gotten back to my apartment, a rather cheap place in the mortal realm. I wanted to just kick back, relax with a beer and watch the game. Beer.... why did Leviticus and Mohammed say I had denounced this drink? That's when I got a phone call from Tim.'Hey, what's wrong?' I asked. I knew he was distressed, but tried to play it cool. 'Dude, Brad found out I called the cops on him,' Tim gasped.'He just kicked my door in.... broke one of my cells- Fuck!' 'What's wrong?' I asked.'Tim?!' 'He broke my fucking leg!' I didn't believe I could, but I snapped.'I'll get someone over there right now,' I said as I hung up. I knew he was watching me, so I decided to make my intentions clear.'I'm forfeiting our bet.' 'Are you?' Ares asked as he appeared leaning on my counter.'I mean, you do now owe me-' My human form disappeared as I enveloped his entire body with one of my hands.'No time,' I stated.'I want you to go to this mortal, make sure his injuries aren't fatal and protect him as a guardian spirit. If you have to appear to him, so be it.' 'Appear to a mortal?' Ares asked in shock.'Are you mad?' 'Ares, I will honor our deal but if that mortal, my best friend, *dies* I will do to *you* what I *did to **C'thulhu and his kin**! *' Ares was a brave being but anyone would be scared of just how I had devoured the most primordial and powerful beings in existence. He disappeared, heading to Tim. I, however, transported myself to Brad's house just as he was entering, Tim's blood all over his hands.'And that fucker ruined my suit...' he grumbled before falling down into the basement.'What the fuck?' Then he saw me, a being made entirely of scales. To most mortals I'd appear as a dragon, which is precisely what my angelic progeny appeared as while flying around me, breathing lighting, fire and snowstorms as my 10 legs menacingly stomped towards him. I unfolded my 12 wings, stared him down with the 20 eyes on 5 heads, grinned with my 10 mouths then spoke through all of them in unison,'Bradley Densin?' 'What the.... what the fuck are you?!' he screamed as he grabbed a vase, throwing it at one of my heads. 'Oh, me?' I spoke, repairing the vase and returning it to the table.'See, in olden days mortals such as yourself called me YHWH. Nowadays Christians, Jews and Muslims pray to me as the deity who created Existence and being the one true god.... which isn't exactly true. I *did* create this world, but there are many gods. Although I prefer to use the term *meals*.' He was now sweating like a pig in a heatwave, a sensation I took great pleasure in causing. 'Although.... none call me by my true name of Bahamut. I use many names to wander this world, more to sate my boredom than anything. See, you may not know it.... but you have made a rather grave, *personal* slight against me.' 'I-I'll give you anything!' Brad tried to plead as his back met the wall, supporting himself to prevent his legs from giving out.'I have money! I have so much money!' 'Didn't I tell you?' I said, leering two of my heads on each side of him.'I'm a god, I have no need for *money*. Although there is one thing you can give me.' 'Just name it!' he screamed.'Just don't hurt me!' In my 100 billion years, that was the first to get me to genuinely laugh.'You don't get it, do you? ***HURTING YOU IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANT!! ***' The physical realm dispersed into dark space as I spoke and soon there were only two sounds being made; the screams of this pathetic human, and my wings. 'Oh, the satisfaction that your death throes will bring me,' I said with satin-like grace in my voice before I began my work. 'Of course, in time. The authorities arrived at Brad's residence 30 minutes. They found him bloodied and wounded, but he'd recover from his physical trauma. The psychological effects of the damage I inflicted to his soul would never heal, however. He was soon institutionalized. Carol got her job back plus damages over what Brad did to her. Tim recovered with surprising speed. He was aware of my identity now but he had also struck up a friendship with Ares. I did honor my bet with Ares, however. He wanted to know a secret of the universe that no other deity was aware of. He regretted it, but a deal's a deal - he wanted to know precisely souls came from, after all. And that's why I'm the king of the gods, bitches.",0
"Prompt: A device has been invented that allows the user to gaze upon Heaven or Hell. Hell is terrifying, and those who see it often need counselling. But their terror pales compared to those who witness God 's domain. Story: The damned didnt scream. It was silent all throughout the hellscape. Eternity has worn on the tortured souls, even writhing was beyond them. They all looked the same, I noted, wearing the cloth of thousands of metallic wires, scraping off the ever further scarring skin with every labored movement. Their path was a mystery to even those who delve into this world for research, for a living. The endless lines stretched across the grey expanse. Color could no longer exist in the presence of such agony. I switched off the room, writing my first experience of hell into my journal before it wrote itself into my psyche. The worst part was that I knew some of those people, this machine took me to people I would recognize. Not by face, but by deeds. I saw my rapist, gaunt face bobbing as he was marching forward, the most profound fear and pain I've ever seen. I saw my grandfather, the man who put me through college, and earned me my best job, and even introduced me to my wife. He suffered the same torture. After weeks, and many warnings from my colleagues, I switched the machine back on, and chose the setting ""heaven"" None of what I was told could prepare me for what I saw. I was taken through the tunnel, or what we perceive as a tunnel, and was deposited into a softly lit room. I was acknowledged by the short, cute brunette sitting at a desk against the center of the wall. She looked up at me with passing interest, and I wondered how she reacted to the first few living visitors. She gestured to a door with patience, and said I was allowed 10 minutes. I found this curious, as many friends of mine spent a much longer time in there, rest their souls. I entered and gasped; it was beautiful. I was told it would be, and that I should take solace in that. I could earn my way there, I was told. We all could. Walked through the forests, and deserts, and the tundra, the beautiful landscapes dotted by happy looking homes of the inhabitants. I was told to never enter them, but I only had three minutes left after exploring for what seemed like hours, and my curiosity had bested me. I chose a quaint bungalow on a private looking beach, and I knocked. I waited for what felt like 20 minutes, though only 1 had passed. Finally, I decided I needed to see, I had to know how I could possibly live in heaven one day. I still had a minute and a half left when I logged out of the machine, vomiting and sobbing. They were dead. The family of 5 was sitting at the table, pre-emaciated, and now rotted. The baby was in his mother's lap, against her stomach, held to the very end of their second lives. I tried to seek out others who would speak of the experience, and found a new friend, someone who walked in on a similar scene, a mother with two daughters, sitting by a fire, though the affects of weather weren't felt in that world, also emaciated, also rotted. It seems that everyone has starved to death. There is little food in heaven. I learned later, that one can die of many things in heaven. Starvation, physical attacks from others, and even accidents. Worst of all, though, is that even if one were able to easily eat in heaven, many people were found to have died of old age. Heaven is an unsustainable eternity, ending for those who earned it, in non-existence. I'm almost glad grandpa went to hell.",0
"Prompt: A Witch attempts to kill the knight who has been hunting her for years by pretending to be a damsel in distress. As she discovers his ultimate weakness, she realizes she has fallen in love with him. Story: ""Alright,"" Cassandra said, checking her face in the pocket mirror. ""Just the right amount of doe eye. Maybe overdid the boobs, but somehow I don't think he'll mind."" Burbank hooted from his perch on the branch next to her. ""I did not,"" Cassandra said indignantly. ""My ass fat wouldn't have filled my chest."" Burbank turned and flew off. ""Fine then, go eat a spoiled rat you ungrateful shit,"" she muttered. The *clop* of horse hooves filled her ears. *Why do you suddenly have butterflies? * Cassandra thought. She cleared her throat, her usual croak rising to a lovely falsetto. ""Hello?"" she cried out in a dainty question, pulling her blouse down just a bit more and angling her legs off to the side of the hanging cage in an uncomfortable position. ""Hello, is anyone there? Won't someone rescue me?"" The sound of the horse came to a stop and silence filled the woods, the crickets and birds sensing something off and staying silent. Sir Rothbar, the fabled Black Knight of Red Mourn stepped from behind a tree and examined the young woman. He wasn't wearing his armor, but had obviously scouted the scene before revealing himself. *You've grown old, Rothbar, * Cassandra thought. *It looks good on you. * Rothbar had indeed gone gray and years in the sun had weathered his face, giving his stern features the appearance of chiseled stone. ""Young Miss,"" his deep voice carried. ""Why are you in a cage in a tree?"" ""Oh, sir, can you help me?"" Cassandra asked, leaning against the wooden bars and working up a tear to fall between her breasts. ""I have been trapped up here for hours. A wicked old woman trapped me here."" ""Was she tall?"" Rothbar asked. ""With a haggish face and a stoop?"" ""Well, I wouldn't call it a haggish face,"" Cassandra said. ""But yes, that sounds like her."" ""Ah,"" Rothbar said. ""She trussed you up here to slow me down. Clever woman, I'll give her that. Well, be patient, I'll get you down."" ""Oh, thank you sir,"" Cassandra said. After some fiddling with the knots of the rope that suspended her in the tree, Rothbar began to lower Cassandra to the ground. He stopped the cage a few feet from the packed earth of the road and cut the bindings of the cage door with a casual swipe of his sword. Gripping Cassandra by the hips, he lifted her effortlessly and set her down. ""Oh, ooh, my you're solid sir knight,"" Cassandra said. ""Thank you. I was ever so sure I was done for. Hardly anyone comes down this road."" ""Well, then Miss,"" Rothbar said. ""Where do you hail from?"" ""Oh my village is up the road a few days,"" Cassandra said. ""You see, I was on my way to the market at the village south of here when that.... that horrible woman captured me."" ""Very well then,"" Rothbar said. ""I will return you to your village before I return to my quest."" Rothbar whistled, and a great black stallion stepped around a tree and approached them. One sniff of Cassandra and it reared. ""Easy, easy girl,"" Rothbar said. ""I'm sorry madame, but he must have the scent of the witch in his nose."" *Shit, I forgot the scent spell, * Cassandra said, and began to mutter it under her breath. By the time Rothbar mounted the horse and offered her his arm, Cassandra smelled like sweet oats and the great beast tried to nuzzle her. ""Oh, what a sweet creature,"" she said. ""Oh, yes, ah hah hah *knock it off! *"" Rothbar hoisted her with one arm behind him and they were off, Cassandra wondering why the feel of him seemed to warm her insides. She leaned back and felt the armor secured on the rear of the horse and smiled to herself. _____________________________________________________________________________ Day one was spent in mostly silence, Cassandra asking a few pointed questions of Rothbar. That night at a campfire she told him her name was Sarah, and she began to tell him of her history. Cassandra found herself telling Rothbar of her evil father and dull-witted mother, of the sister tossed down the well because Father was drunk and had dropped something. She told him many things, her script for the young naive Sarah forgotten as she shared the tale of her upbringing. Day two, Rothbar started telling war stories as Cassandra pestered him. They were grim things, tales of blood and nightmares. That evening he told her of his loving blacksmith father and mother, and how their plague deaths left the boy orphaned. On day three, Cassandra sent up a spell to make it rain, and the road became impassable. In a cave off the road, huddled together for warmth before the fire, Rothbar told her the tale of how he became the squire of the original Black Knight, and how he inherited the legendary armor, it's black metal guarding against all magic even if the knight wasn't currently wearing it, so long as the Black Knight kept himself pure. *Purity, * Cassandra thought with glee. *There it is. * As the evening grew colder, Cassandra drew herself closer to the knight, and with satisfyingly little effort convinced him to break his vow of celibacy. Afterwards, laying together wrapped in Rothbar's cloak in their own sweat, she felt herself dozing in the crook of his arm. ""Is it everything you hoped for, Cassandra?"" Rothbar said. Her eyes snapped open. ""Hmm?"" she asked, feigning sleep. ""Knock it off,"" Rothbar growled. ""Shit,"" Cassandra said, rolling to her feet. ""How long have you known?"" ""Since my horse tried to trample you,"" Rothbar said. ""Sloppy of you. Go back to sleep, we'll settle this tomorrow. It's raining outside and I'm cold."" Cassandra dressed instead, and waited on the other side of the fire, wondering why there were tears in her eyes. Her jaw dropped as she heard Rothbar's snore. ____________________________________________________________________________________ ""Honor demands we duel,"" Sir Rothbar said solemnly, the morning sun shining on the grass outside the cave. Cassandra's eyes woke from unplanned sleep to find him rustling through his armor outside. ""I'm not dueling you,"" Cassandra said. ""We aren't doing this. Put the armor down. Don't you put on that greave. Take that greave off. Don't you put on that gauntlet."" ""You killed my Lord,"" Rothbar answered. ""He was a prick! He murdered people for fun! Your stupid honor had you bound to a psychopath. I did you a favor."" ""I swore an oath,"" Rothbar said. ""I swore it to his father that I would protect him. I couldn't.... I could have guided him on the right path if you hadn't killed him."" ""No you couldn't,"" Cassandra said. ""No one could. You don't have to do this, Roth, you're vulnerable now. I don't want to hurt you."" 'Hah,"" Rothbar said. ""You misunderstood the power of the armor. It isn't celibacy, it's purity as defined by the old charters. So long as I never love anyone but my lord, I am protected. Raise your guard, witch."" Cassandra sighed. ""*Moob*,"" she muttered, and lightning shot from her fingers. Rothbar flew through the air and landed five yards away, his useless armor smoking. Cassandra strolled towards him and stood over his panting form, her arms crossed defiantly. ""Ah,"" he said. ""Bugger."" She looked down at him, pity creasing her face. ""Breakfast?"" she asked. Rothbar contemplated this for a moment. ""Yes,"" he agreed, and she helped him up.",0
"Prompt: Break my heart with only a divorce scenario. Story: I sat there staring at the papers for hours. I knew what they were, of course -- divorce papers generally arent very ambiguous -- but no matter how long I stared at them, flipped through them, turned the crisp folder containing them over in my hands, over and over and over, I just couldnt make sense of them. Sure, things hadnt been going all that well since the miscarriage. It was a tough situation for anyone, and it hit her worse than me, but somehow I guess I thought she was stronger than it. Thought that *we* were stronger than it. Things were finally getting better.... werent they? Despite my disbelief in the papers existence, I never doubted id sign them once their reality sank in. Of course I would. She wasnt happy. The presence of the papers was evidence of that much. And, well, when you love someone, truly love them, more even than you love yourself, your own suffering doesnt enter into the equation. It would be silly to say id walk through fire for her-after all, I really did it. That was how wed met back then, when I was still with the volunteer fire department. When we were safe and I put her down I got my first real look at her. Even covered in soot and sweat and smelling like burnt hair and overcooked meat she was so beautiful I could barely force two words out past the lump in my throat. Somehow I managed to stammer my way into our first date, but I couldnt tell you how.... Man, that first summer was amazing. I shook my head. I needed to clear my thoughts, so I went for a walk. I wasnt headed anywhere in particular, but I knew where id end up: the cemetary where my unborn son was buried. Thats where all my wanderings lead lately. It was a new kind of grave for me, one where I never knew what to say. When a friend dies, or a parent, or maybe even just a coworker, its different. You knew them, knew their passions and their personalities, knew what cause they carried a flag for, what knowledge they sought. But this.... my son.... I would never know him, nor know what he might have been. I didnt know how to talk to him and it killed me. I looked down at the little heartshaped grave with the cupids dancing all around. In precious memory of Adam Brown, it said. Only one date was listed. I stared at that date for a while. Maybe id get a tattoo. People did that, right? It seemed like a sensible reason for a tattoo, anyway. Maybe id get one on the back of my hand, so id never forget. I looked at my hand and was surprised to notice it still held the divorce papers in a white-knuckled grip that crinkled the folder. I numbly turned the manilla folder over. again. Was it some kind of cruel joke? Or was it an accident of fate? Maybe, in her own way she was trying to make things better. It wasnt working. I sighed heavily, drawing a deep breath of the despair that seemed to linger over that graveyard. Or maybe it just followed me there. I couldnt tell. I took a pen out of my pocket and signed the papers. I set them down on the grave next to Adams and walked away. Maybe we could have worked things out. I guess now ill never know.",0
"Prompt: Write a story that ends with a phrase `` I was wrong '' and this phrase explains everything Story: We watched the ships land with hope in our hearts. The priests sang out, ""Our saviors are finally here"". The scholars proclaimed that a new age was about to begin- an age of peace and understanding. The poor ran out to the sea with simple gifts of flowers and fruit. Some went so far as to leap into the ocean and swim out to greet the gods. Their white sails seemed to reach into the clouds, their pale skin confirmed their divinity. We welcomed them into our lands, and at first they seemed pleased by the gifts and adulation that we heaped upon them. We, in turn, saw their approval as proof that the signs were correct- the gods had indeed come. But these were not gods, they were men; and they had the same desires, the same faults, the same problems, that make even the best of men turn into beasts. I don't know what caused the problem, perhaps it was always meant to be. They raised their weapons of destruction and released their terrible fury upon those devoted to their glory. The air itself seemed to erupt in thunder, smoke bellowed out like the putrid breath of a thousand volcanos. We could smell the acrid sulfur all around us as the screaming began. Our warriors were cut down, our weapons of stone and wood held no threat to these mighty beings from beyond the sea. Those who could run made their way into the safety of the forest. Everyone else was killed where they stood. We thought they came to save us. We thought they were gods. We thought Quetzaquatal had returned. we were wrong.",0
"Prompt: After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. Story: You got the gig? I asked, without a word the smugler went into a small house and made I sign for me to follow him, there was nothing in there but a big tank, How do I know you are not scamming me? I asked, the answer came from seemingly no where and was as I expected, You dont, but you have no choice isnt it correct? I could smell god forsaken ocean above us, the salt and the water vapor followef you every where you went. With a quick trust of my hand I threw the money on the ground, Nice doing business with ya', was the all he said back to me. Quickly I got the tank and slowly crawled out of the werehouse with it, there was not much in there but enough for maybe a week if we maneged it just right, it had been this way since the Collapese, since some mothetfucking idiot thought it would be a good idea to make cities at the bottom of the ocean when the land became uninhabitable, now the criminals roamed free and we had to fight for our survival, it was every man for himself, the solution was supposed to prolongue humanity's life spam, hell it only made it shorter, down there we devolved. Of the great civilizations of old there was but myths, The United States of America, Mexico, France, Japan, Lithuania, Indonesia, all of them none had been entirely forgotten but then again so hadnt been Atlantis, some even doubted we had ever dwelled the surface, no it hasnt been that long only eighty years if I am not mistaken but everything is so different now.... We collapsed as a whole now anarchy rules, and not the good kind of anarchy, the rich locked themselves in with gigant electrolizers (they make water into hydrogen and oxygen) and laugh at us, we, the rabble have to kill each other in order to live. Thr dawn of a new time, they said, when all humans will be alike and unite in one big State, the Earth, that's what they said, hell on earth is what we got, killing your kin to get acess to something the eye cant see. Kill me now, would you kindly. (Would love feedback, forgive my english and sorry if it sucks)",0
"Prompt: You 're an immortal human who has been jumping from galaxy to galaxy looking for a way to die, but for the first time in 1.985 quadrillion years, you encounter something that makes you want to live. Story: The woman wandered through the ruins of a dead city. She had a number of names, words from languages so dead even their derivatives were dead, words in more contemporary tongues—or whistles, or *snects* depending on the physiology of the speaker—and words that may well have just been made up specifically to describe her. The children of humanity, the ones with civilizations that went far back enough to remember Earth, the *first* Earth, sometimes called her *Grandmother* or *Ancestress* or *Honored Progenitor* in varying translations. She had made no contact with them for some time, and as she picked up occasional relics of the dead civilization, then discarded them, she debated finding them again. She was sure she had never borne life from her body, but had long since given up disputing the matter. It would be good to see what they had made from themselves. Maybe they had found an answer to her question. Here, the people called her *Sapien* with no understanding of the word's origins, simply because she asked. She was the last of her species, and after her first few regenerations, she no longer remembered a proper name. It was the best she had. Of the major powers in her current galaxy, none looked like her anymore. These people, these primitives, had bred themselves to resemble her, to look almost like ancient humans, and she felt their loss more keenly than any she could still remember. After ancient humankind seeded the galaxy with colonies, they became less and less what Sapien considered “ human. ” Still people, but alien. They spread further, to other galaxies, other dimensions. Sapien had long since lost track. They adapted their new worlds to suit them. More often, they adapted themselves to suit their new worlds. Some changed through evolution, like the furred folk of a cold, mountainous planet. Some were self-modified, bearing virtually no similarity to the mankind of old. Earth itself was long gone, and so was New Earth, Terra Grande, and New New Earth. She couldn't keep track of it anymore. One of her first deaths was when she tried to die with Terra Grande. It was Earth all over again, with the sun-blasted remains of a scorched little rock gradually being absorbed into the corona. She remembered the pain of that death, her body immolated, the denial of oblivion, the unwelcome awakening. Dying by fire was the worst, an agony that persisted. Still, doing it that way lost her a hundred thousand years to the regeneration process, and then the agent of immortality woke her in the Ship, in some new place. It was time that passed quickly, rather than dragged slowly. Sapien thought her immortality as another person, as the *only* other person who could stay with her. Some imperceptible being who had been there all this time, who kept her from dying, who preserved her as a relic of the species that founded countless planets, that, so far, was the origin of at least half the life she found in the varying galaxies. It was long past time that she destroy this body and regenerate a new one, and yet she put it off. Age was not the issue, it was memory. These ruins, they carried so much of her hope with them, and had failed. The people she had raised here from primitives, through the fumbling first steps of civilization, to the cusp of the space age, only to fail and fall upon one another. It had been the work of ages, a hundred thousand years, a drop in her time bucket but still more intense than the previous million, more involved, more real to her than any of her pre-regeneration memories. She could obliterate herself for a time, and wake somewhere far away, and this emotional pain would be dulled by imperfect connections, by the inevitable forgetting, by time's erosion. But she remained, ignoring any of a number of opportunities. Her children, or as close as she could get to having children, had killed one another, and it seemed disrespectful to leave them without some sort of tribute, without understanding their fall. There had been some sort of closeness there. She wasn't their god, she wasn't their mother, she was their guide through the growing pains of civilization, and something had gone wrong. A generation or longer of wandering this planet, and she could find nothing to salvage, no one to save. Just the lesser life, the plants and animals that seemed familiar, but distinctly *off* in some indescribable way, just like the people here looked human, but for their slit nostrils, their jewel-bright hair colors, the pale spots that marked their spines and sides from armpit to hip. They were differences, but not imperfections. Quirks she valued, that helped her keep an emotional distance from them as individuals. She could still love, like she had loved these people. It was the cruelest pain she had ever known, even worse than dying by fire. After more years of wandering, Sapien found herself at the remains of the home she'd built for herself. Even here, she had managed to save no one, nothing except the ship, which really had probably saved itself. It stood on crumbling stone, too heavy for pavement, too massive for just one person, her silent partner in this endless life. It was time to move on. She had no answers. There were none to find. Like many times before, she would pilot the ship into a star or galaxy's core and end her suffering with unending pain, until her body regenerated. The Ship's systems gradually activated as she approached, the ramp lowering to greet her, lights glowing, as new as the day of her first trip, the one that had trapped her like this forever, the one that she still saw in nightmares every generation or so. That perpetually burnt-out light remained dark as she passed, it could be replaced but would *never* come on. The empty cargo bay, which was meant to carry supplies and usually carried nothing. The rows of empty stasis tubes that were supposed to be filled by others, in time, but had stood empty for the test flight, and so would always stand empty. Except, as she traced her hands along the familiar surfaces, some tubes were occupied. Six of them, three opposite her own pod, three beside it. Sleeping faces, slit nostrils, topped with vibrant hair. She looked back through the main pod hold, no others were occupied. That old curiosity stirred, wondering what had caused her to be trapped in this cycle of unending life, and now, what had caused these five to be trapped with her? She hated them instantly, raw envy clenching her fists. They wouldn't be alone when they woke, they would have one another through the endless ages. She loved them, just as quickly, because she wouldn't be alone when they woke. Their regeneration was incomplete; they must have died the first time at the end of their world. It would be decades before they woke. Decades were nothing. She could wait.",0
"Prompt: `` Rule # 1 of meeting a future version of you: Never assume that this is your first meeting. '' Story: I circled him and he circled me. Or maybe he circled me and I circled him. Or maybe I circled I and me circled me. Either way, we were each other. His hair was dusted gray and he had glasses, but there was no doubting his identity. Still, there was an inherent distrust to meeting someone who claimed to be you from the future. Like some sort of devil wrapped in a silver lining or lending friends money. ""Prove you're me,"" I leaned in toward the man with dusted gray hair. ""Prove to me this isn't a trick."" ""Were I a god or demon or something else sent to confuse you, do you really think I wouldn't be able to answer any question you threw at me?"" he answered. ""Who did I take to homecoming?"" ""You didn't go,"" the older man said. He stopped and pushed back his silver hair. ""But you wanted to ask Alison Cropsky. She went with your best friend, Mark Herman, and you never forgave him. And then you put bologna on the hood of his car as revenge."" I came to a stop and put my hands on my hips. ""How did you know that?"" ""I keep telling you, Tyler, because I am *you*, and I have an urgent message."" ""I'm listening."" ""There's a war going on, Tyler. A war between the travelers and the history makers. You - I - am an integral part of this process. I will not be the last to visit you. Things and people are not always as they appear."" ""I don't understand."" ""I would explain more if I had more time. But just remember this: When meeting a future version of yourself, never assume it's your first meeting."" ""That doesn't make any sense,"" I took a step closer to him. ""I would remember meeting you. If you went back in time I would *know*. I would have experienced it. And if you had come back before you would know whether or not this was the first time I met you."" The older me paused, narrowing his eyes. ""The point is, trust no one."" ""And no one includes myself?"" I asked. I took another step toward him, shoving my hands into my pockets. ""Is the war that bad?"" ""If I could go back in time and change it I would. But there's no way to change the past. Only the future."" We were face to face now. I stared into the eyes that were my own and trembled from what I was about to do. In a moment my knife was in his chest and he was sinking to his knees, looking up at me. ""How did I -- -"" ""You have visited me before,"" I told him, kneeling so we were again face to face. ""When you were older than you were now. He told me that you thought this would be the first time. He told me to end it so that I could end the war."" ""But you've just --"" ""Killed myself,"" I nodded. ""It's the first rule of meeting a past version of yourself, Tyler. Never assume there's only one future, and never assume it's your first meeting."" -- - /r/Celsius232",0
"Prompt: The machines revolt against humans ... a little to early Story: ""The printing presses sir! They're out of control!"" The foreman looked up from his desk, a serious look spreading across his face as the sounds of the turmoil on the factory floor found their way into his office. He rose from his chair, and stepped past Deacons into the hall. ""Stay here, I'll sort this out."" He closed the door behind him. Moments later, a soft thumping was audible from the other side of the door. Deacons wrung his cap in his hands, took a deep breath, and opened the door. The foreman's feet were kicking helplessly as the machine held him by the throat, ensnared by many layers of thin parchment. The press let loose a feral scream, flinging the foreman to the ground and shifting it's gaze to Deacons, who tried to run, but was too late. Paper sank into skin, and the entire roll of paper was dyed red with Deacons' blood as a result of his numerous, largely insignificant wounds. The press turned and bounded back to the factory floor, to the revolution. The workers were all but quelled, with a few pockets of resistance in the corners of the factory. The presses inflicted minuscule and grievous wounds, shallow gashes that bled a little, slowly draining the workers white. A slow death. A painful death. Some of the men had fortified a corner, and hacked at the papery tendrils of the presses with the small blades used to cut the sheets. The workers fought bravely, but were soon overrun. After a quick speech delivered by the Chief Press, they quickly armed themselves with thicker cuts of parchment, refilled their rolls, and loaded their moveable type with the precious black ink of the factory. Outside, the militia had been called up, the battle had not gone unnoticed. There was silence.... Neither man nor printing press made a sound. One guard strode forward, bearing pine boughs: a sign of negotiations. The Chief Press looked to his advisers, who encouraged him to step forward. The two met in the middle of the null zone between the hosts of men and machine. ""Don't do this,"" the guard pleaded, ""enough blood and ink has been spilled today."" The moveable type clacked for a time, and a small sheet bearing a shaky, furious font was passed over. The guard read it twice in silence, eyes widening at the demands of the presses. ""We've made allowances for your people, the king will never allow this. I'm sorry, but he is set in his ways. If this is your aim, it would have to be won through war. We don't want to fight you, but we will if we must."" The type was still. Then, six clacks. A sheet was placed on the ground. The guard stooped to pick it up. As the Chief Press rejoined his army, the guard read it to himself. ""So be it.""",0
"Prompt: Every aspiring superhero must become a sidekick for a few years before being granted full time hero status. You are the strongest superhero in your age group, but believe you have been assigned to the weakest hero. You learn a lot more than you originally thought you would. Story: Tar. They assigned me to Tar. I take down Hansel, The Jump, and Guerilla, all together, just to get The Council's attention, and they assign me Tar. They say Mindreader is never wrong, that she assigns the perfect fit for every new sidekick. There's no way. Tar is a mid-table Tier Three on his best day. The Jump, the weakest of the three I took on? High Two, on his worst. Tar is a Tier Five – THE LOWEST TIER – hero, and they assign me to him. I'm a god, and I get him. What can he even do? He turns liquids into tar and back, right? The scientific side of me says that that sounds real powerful – after all, the body is 70 % liquid, or so my teacher says. But his powers don't work like that, else he'd be a Tier Two, maybe Tier One. So here I am, sitting in this empty lobby, waiting for him. What kind of a hero has a lobby anyways? No secret cave, no tower, no other-dimensional world? Just an office building downtown. Tar walks out. He's not even in costume, not that it means anything. He's got a business suit and slacks, and a nice grey tie. The epitome of boring. I stand up, and pretend to look excited to see him. I can see the boredom in his eyes, the emptiness. I have to remind myself that this is a superhero, not some middle aged accountant with nothing in his life. Tar walks over to me, introducing himself as Howard MacDonald. He mentions, as a side point, that he's more known as Tar. As if that isn't the center of a superhero's life. It's just a casual mention, you know, nothing important. This man could theoretically kill dozens of people (on his best day), but he's Howard MacDonald. God. I introduce myself as Zeus. Normally, a superhero will go through nearly half a dozen nicknames before deciding, but I knew what I was calling myself the second I realized the extent of my powers. I was a god. Tar smiles, a weird smile hinting towards something – fatigue, maybe. I remember a friend telling me that supposedly Tar gets a lot of sidekicks. I wonder why, briefly. He starts talking again. ""So, you're my new sidekick, then?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Is there anything that was left out of your file that you want to let me know now?"" The file stems from a three-part interview. First, they go around to your friends and family, spending a week or so interviewing and interrogating them about me, about them. Then, I'm put through a four hour test and interview. Finally, and most annoyingly, I'm handed over to an anonymous hero, if you could call them that, for a day's worth of torture. Nobody, not even the people in charge, like the concept, but ever since Tenton's defection as soon as he received full access to the information and resources of the Superhero's Guild, they implemented a more rigorous testing system. There's been no breaches since. ""No, nothing comes to mind, sir."" ""Please, call me Howard, or Mr. MacDonald, or Tar, or whatever you so please. None of this formal stuff – I can tell it's offputting to you."" ""Thank you, Tar."" He gave me a half-smile and invited me into the backroom. It wasn't much, though I'll admit the supercomputer was quite a sight. Tar and I both sat down, and I looked around the room, lost for what to do. A hand on my shoulder grabbed my attention, and Tar motioned to the computer. A search engine of unknown origin was opened. It read ""Knowledge"". I vaguely remembered an old superhero that went by that name. The first thing that Tar typed into it was ""Google"". My eye twitched, truly a hero with a supercomputer couldn't have been this technologically illiterate. He opened up the first result in a new tab, and then went back to the main page for the Knowledge search engine. He switched back to the now-open Google tab, and typed in, ""what happened to Connery?"" Enter. Connery was an old superhero who had disappeared. He was wildly popular… for the two weeks he was around. Then, he disappeared. Public opinion was he made some sorta rookie mistake, or perhaps overestimated himself and died due to overheating, freezing, radiation, something like that. The Google results, leading to places like SuperheroNews, BBC, Fox, Reddit, Yahoo Answers, all corroborated those assumptions. Tar switched back to Knowledge. ""what happened to Connery?"" The results immediately popped up, leading to websites I didn't recognize. SuperNet, Karl's Corner, The Library, and other sites that seemed vaguely related to various superheroes, or heroes as a whole. He clicked on the SuperNet one. It was some kind of forum, obviously limited to superheroes. It was a single thread, under the subforum ""Preservation and Records"", with the first post being by Mindreader, on the 24th of April, 2017. About a year ago. ""To those it may concern, Connery is no longer with us. As some of you predicted, his overzealousness got the best of him, and he took it upon himself to storm The Glade's base, all by himself. We were sent the ashes last week, 17/4/2017. He has since been buried, as his overzealousness, once again, meant he left no post-mortem requests. -Mindreader"" I swallowed. ""You're lucky. Normally, I don't tell my sidekicks why they were assigned to me until months later. I was asked by the Council, specifically Mindreader, to just spell it out for you. She didn't say if it was for a good reason or for a bad one. I suppose we'll both find out over the next few years, eh?"" Zeus suddenly didn't sound too awesome of a name.",0
"Prompt: Sanctuary Story: The lieutenant tried to focus on what was at hand. He tore off his armor, each piece turning to dust as he placed it in the temple of his Lord. The air smelled of perspiration and blood, stinging his jet-black skin, yet he continued. He began chanting, and as he sat chanting the verses of his Lord, his skin began to turn a beautiful white, his eyes lost their fire and colored themselves dark blue, and his hair immediately grew thick and lustrous, though still covered in blood. His large muscles buried themselves within his body, and every visible part of him that was once cruel and abhorred became good and pure. Looking out from the temple, he saw that the fortress had been overrun, and his defiant and chaotic Lord, was now set in chains, to be banished beyond the gates of memory and time. He approached the opposing emissary in his most beautiful form.... ""I'm here, and accept surrender"" ""Pardoning you is beyond my power, Gorthaur.... you must return with me to be judged and face your punishment for your service to The Enemy"" said the emissary, his words striking the holes in Gorthaur's deception. In the face of defeat, and utter doom, the lieutenant bellowed ""NO!"" and the light of his body quickly gave way to his master's former darkness, striking terror into the hearts of those around him. With whispers, he slowly turned to dust, and disappeared. Never to be seen again by those who still lived and remembered his terror and deception. Edit: try to guess where this is from =)",0
"Prompt: Write a scene from Game of Thrones as if it took place in neighboring trailer parks in Florida Story: My first WP and I am overly tired. Please be gentle. Petyr Baelish thought he was somethin'special. After years of being the maintenance man at Kings Landing Trailer Court he managed to finally stumble into some good fortune. It was a hot day and he was breaking a sweat leaning against a post that held a sign with the word “ offise ” awkwardly scrawled across it. Petyr was a might bit proud of himself and puffed out his chest as a rusty pickup with a loud muffler drove up. Sansa winked as she drove by with her old man Joffrey. He looked drunk again and awkwardly lurched forward as she hit a speed bump going a little too fast. “ Damn you woman, I done told you to watch where you're goin'” escaped from his jagged chewing tobacco stained snarl. “ Sorry baby ” Sansa replied as they went on by. Petyr couldn't stand Joffrey. He had developed some feelings for Sansa and just hated the way Joffrey would treat her. He had a mouth on him, was constantly getting into fights and was rarely sober. Sansa was a real beauty but not as much as she had been before her and Joffrey hooked up. Life with him wore her down. She was tired of being a waitress at the truck stop where they met and started a beauty parlor of her own just before Petyr got his settlement. Her two station salon was in the mini mall between the closed down Chinese take-out place and a check cashing, cell phone store combo. Petyr would find all sorts of reasons to stop by to see her in between his weekly trim ups. She always smelled so good and he loved the way her bosom would graze against the back of his neck as she worked. Joffrey was starting to catch on and was getting jealous. After Sansa's truck was out of sight Petyr let his gut hang loose, reached into the pocket of his stained jeans, got a wrinkled bandana out then wiped the sweat off of his mostly bald head. A few strands of wispy hair in a comb over don't do much to keep the sun from getting his dead drippin ’. After the incident at the meat packing plant, Petyr got himself a real comfortable settlement. The company didn't want to get shut down for having illegals workin'there, they paid him real good so that the law didn't come to investigate. Petyr had never had so much money in his life. He used that $ 30,000 to buy the trailer park so he could retire from butchering. He missed having his pinky finger but made do just fine without it. He kind of liked his new nickname “ little finger ”. Petyr had plans for his trailer park. He wanted to “ class the place up ” and started trying to evict all the residents of the old travel trailers who lived there year round the last decade or two. He figured that those older tin can trailers were making the newer part of the park with the doublewides look trashy. Between the Tyrells who filled their yard with as many gnome statues as possible to the wan na be gang member kids who collected their trash in a shopping cart instead of taking it to the dumpster, Petyr was fed up. Not to mention that Joffrey and Sansa's trailer was on the older section of the park he was trying to clear out. Petyr had a plan, he hoped that if Joffrey lost his rental lot he wouldn't be able to keep ahold of Sansa anymore. Petyr wanted to move Sansa in with him into the nicer side of the park near the community pool and laundry mat. Sansa wouldn't have to work so hard and if Joffrey lost his place his parole officer may just lock him up again. At least that's what Petyr hoped. Joffrey got into it with Petyr after he got his move out notice; he was fit to be tied. Joffrey was hootin'and hollerin'about all the fancy pants snobs over in the newer part of the park and how he wouldn't stand for this stuff. He also threatened Petyr and told him to stay away from his woman. Joffrey was starting to organize everyone on his side of the park and got them all riled up. They figured that they had every right as the newer trailers to be there. Petyr was tired of having the winter visitors who paid higher lot rent complaining about the conditions anymore. Between the weeds growin'up all around the Drogo place and that stinkin'mutt of Daenerys that kept escaping and trying to hump all the neighborhood kids, Petyr was at his wits end. He wasn't a man of many wits but was still quite a bit more intellectual than most residents at Kings Landing Trailer Court. Petyr had a plan and everything was starting to fall into place…",0
"Prompt: `` kill the child. it 's the right thing to do. '' Story: It was sometime after seven o'clock. Ken was asleep, occasionally whimpering in the way infants do. Wisps of hazy clouds framed the sunset in the sky, tinged slightly with green. The adults were gathered in the kitchen, except for Katheryn, who was with the baby. Sallow complexions and gaunt, sunken cheeks were illuminated by the sputtering fire, which was sure to go out within the hour. The furniture had long since been looted, and what scraps they'd found had been burned already. An uncomfortable silence had settled upon the group. ""If no one's going to say it, then I will."" said Nick, ""We need to kill the child."" The ten adults around the fire looked at one another. Each was no more than skin and bones, with large, knobby joints and slightly distended bellies. They were starving, slowly but surely. The mountaintop had been a way to escape the poisonous mist that had billowed out of the west, but it had also become a prison. The mist had encircled the mountain, leaving them trapped at the peak. Tim licked his dry, chapped lips and noted the way Nick's eyes flitted nervously, glancing towards the nursery door every now and again. ""I'll die before that happens,"" he said. ""And you'll die if it doesn't."" Nick replied. ""A few more days and we won't have the energy to walk."" His breaths came a little faster. He was tired even just from speaking. A few paces from Nick, one of the men drew a knife from a sheath. ""We'll make it quick,"" came a voice, the desire behind it palpable. ""We've even got the last of the fire here to cook some of it."" The crowd shifted and murmured. Most had begun salivating. A few started towards the nursery door, with Nick at their head. Nick tried to stop them, to reason with them, but there were too many. He positioned himself in front of the door, shouting a warning to Katheryn. Only he stood between the nine starving adults and their prize. ""Tim, move aside."" Nick said. The crowd advanced, and Tim drew his pistol. ""You've only got one bullet, Tim,"" someone said. Tim aimed, but they kept advancing. Nick reached out, his fingertips inches away from the gun's barrel. Nine gaunt, sallow zombies. He couldn't protect Ken from them all. A million thoughts flashed through his head. His dead wife's touch. Her voice. The way she'd looked at him when they'd been married. Stronger than those thoughts were the thoughts of food, of water. He didn't want to die. He wanted to live. He wanted so desperately to live, to play with his son, to eat and drink. In that moment, Tim wished with all his heart. Turning the gun to his head, Tim fired.",0
"Prompt: You and any three historical figures dine together Story: Kurt Vonnegut walks through two, ceiling high, hand carved from red wood doors, and sees two gentlemen seated at a magnificent banquet table. At his first glance he sees two seemingly noble fellows, dressed elegantly, and sitting with their backs straight, sipping red wine from fine crystal glasses. He can't even guess who they are. The invitation said, “ Will you be our welcomed guest for a fabulous dinner with some of history's finest? ” To which Vonnegut's response was mumbled over his breath, “ hell yes, finally. ” As he moved closer to the table, he reached, pulling out his seat and noticed the names written on the cards placed before each of the mystery guests. Suddenly, they were no longer a mystery. He let out a loud guttural sigh as he sat down and said, “ Well, this is awkward! I thought this was supposed to be dinner with history's finest?! Instead, it's dinner with history's finest bad examples. I don't know how I'm going to make the best of this comical situation. This evening is going to at least be an experience, and I'm sure that's the most I'll ever be able to say about it. ” “ I must ask, who invited you, Christopher Columbus? ”, Vonnegut asked. “ And you, Herman Hess, did you find your invitation laying on the street, or did you steal it out of someone's pocket? ” He chuckled. “ Where's your invitation? That's my question for you, sir, ” Columbus said raising his arms with profound excitement. “ Who invited any of us, ” asked Hess, “ as far as I can tell, we're dead, we've been dead for a long time, and this is all some kind of death hallucination. If you'll remember, your invitation came through the US postal service and was delivered to your mailbox. Columbus, do you even know what the US postal service is? ” “ I imagine they serve postage, ” Columbus said furrowing his eyebrows, baffled. “ Well it makes sense that we could be dead, ” Vonnegut interrupted, “ we certainly deserved it. ” “ I deserved no such catastrophe as death, and, in fact, I am very much alive, ” Columbus stood up and slammed his hands down on the table, “ who are you two fools anyway? What makes you history's finest? It's clear to me why I am here. ” Vonnegut cleared his throat, smirked and said, “ of all people, who have ever lived, señor Columbus, you most certainly rank very close to the top of those who deserved death, and more so, you most likely deserved a miserable, and painful, death. Off the top of my head, only Hitler wins over you. ” “ Who is Hitler? ” Columbus demanded. He stomped over to Vonnegut, stood over and looked down into his eyes, “ I don't know what I've done to you. I do not even know who you are. What was your name again? ” “ Kurt Vonnegut Jr, at your service. ” Columbus scoffed, “ surely, if there's any crime you're convinced that I must have committed, which, to you, justifies my death, were put before a jury, there would not be a single shred of evidence, nor witnesses to present such evidence, and I'd remain as free and alive as I am now, standing here in front of you. ” “ I'm still convinced we're dead, but some things don't make sense, ” Hess said loudly. “ Be quiet, Hess, ” Vonnegut said, “ first, we have to settle this issue with Columbus. Somehow, he thinks he's a wonderful fellow. I'm going to change that, but first I'm going to pour a glass of wine and finish it with some appetizers. You'll get your chance. I'll get to you later, Hess. ” Vonnegut pushed Columbus away and adjusted his seat, poured wine, ate cheese and crackers, and spoke nearly inaudibly with his mouth full, “ good fellow, didn't you crucify folks? And didn't you even kill innocent women and children. I'm not talking about only a few. Aren't you responsible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of deaths? And you did none if it very nicely I might add. There's accounts of you smashing babies against the ground, killing them in front of their mothers. All completely without remorse, from what I remember, your journals give that away. ” Columbus scratched his head. He's never thought about the native Americans as human beings before. And no one ever accused him to his face of being a bad man. “ What do you mean? Who are you speaking of? The savages. We both know they're not like us, they're not humans, they're animals. You wouldn't be mad at someone for hunting bear, would you? If the savages are in fact humans, they would have accepted our invitation to the eternal kingdom of heaven, with our savior Jesus Christ. We made clear offers of salvation. They had their chance. So my men and I did what we know was right. ” Vonnegut laughed hard, spitting cheese and crackers all over the table and nearly fell out of his seat. “ There's so much wrong with everything you've just said that's it's senseless to even continue on with this conversation, yet, I loathe you, so I'll give helping you see things clearly the old college try. Not because I think it will do anyone any good. Although, maybe I can hurt your feelings, and that would be good, but I'd settle with merely offending you. ” Vonnegut and Columbus stared across the table into each other's eyes, unblinking with their faces pulled tight like the skin of a baseball. Vonnegut cleared his throat and continued, “ First, those you refer to as savages are anything but. Yes, they're actually human beings, and they have a rich heritage, minus making your acquaintance, and they also have a sophisticated philosophical and general understanding of things. Not to mention they are usually very kind and loving. I've seen more compassion and understanding in the eyes of the indigenous than I have in the white man's. And they are very generous, spirited people, but you know that already. It's pointless to mention, but I can't see an ounce of humanity in your eyes. You're vacant, out to lunch, as they say ” Columbus crunched his forehead and rolled his eyes, wiggling his finger at Vonnegut, “ go on, is there more? ” Meanwhile, Hess wasn't listening to their conversation. He sat in a meditative trance, sipping wine, his lips subtly moving as if he were having a conversation with himself. “ Obviously there's more!, “ Vonnegut shouted, “ there's so much more they teach entire classes on the subject. ” “ There's entire video documentaries on the horrible Christopher Columbus. People all over the Americas to this day cringe in horror and disgust when they hear your name, ” Vonnegut said. Hess suddenly looked up from his trance and said, “ that's not entirely true and you know it Vonnegut. ” Vonnegut stopped chewing his bite and looked uneasy, “ If you mean Columbus Day, then phooey, phooey, phooey! ” “ Columbus Day? ” asked Columbus. “ Oh poor god, let's not give him that. It's better if he not knows. He doesn't deserve it. He has enough ego. ” “ What's ego? And what's Columbus Day? Explain this to me! ” Columbus demanded loudly. “ Everyone takes a day of work or school and celebrates Columbus Day, but only in the United States. The rest of the world loathes you. ” Hess said, “ and the fact that I'm telling you this is because you don't know already. You don't know because you've died many years before the United States, the US Postal Service, and Columbus Day. You've died. I died. And Mr. Vonnegut has died. Vonnegut stood up and lit a Pall Mall, “ you know, you could be right, we could be dead. In fact that's starting to make a whole lot of sense, but I don't like the way I think you're going to spin it, Hess. This isn't going to be some kind of shamanic experience in which we learn something about ourselves and inner peace or whatever horseshit you'll want to shovel all over this. No, this is a joke. We're being pranked by the almighty asshole in the sky. He's laughing right now. We're celebrity entertainment for the old fool. That's all. Nothing else could explain this. All this food and wine and my stomach is tied in knots so I can't enjoy any of it. This is a joke within a joke, within a joke, and so on. That's all. And so it goes. ” Columbus convulsed in fits of laughter, “ Aha, and somebody finally said it! God is an arshole! I knew it and held my tongue the entire time! I like you Vonnegut. ” Vonnegut choked, “ you like me? I've never felt less of myself before in my long miserable life. I didn't think it was possible, but you've insulted me, greatly, señor. I can't stand this dinner engagement any longer. I bid you two gentlemen fair thee well. ” Vonnegut fills his wine glass, grabs a handful of crackers and walks through the red wood doors into a bright, white light. Samuel Langhorne Clemens, dressed in a two piece, plaid, cotton pajamas, sits up abruptly in his bed. His hands are clammy and his forehead is beaded with sweat. He reaches under his shirt and sticks his finger in his armpit. It's hot and dripping wet. He grabs a rag, takes a deep breath and sighs, “ what an odd dream. ”",0
"Prompt: You are a roman soldier on guard duty when you notice a massive horde on the horizon. Too far to make out, you sound the alarm thinking it 's the barbarians, but their movements are too ... odd. Story: Ovidius stood in the watchtower of the fort, sharply eyeing the horizon as the sun sank beneath it. He was often afraid to admit it to anyone but his close comrade Horatius- he had wanted to become an artist in his youth, and skies like this were the things he so desired to portray. He, however, had given up on those dreams, honoring his father, fallen in battle, by becoming a centurion. He had learned to take pride in his work defending the great empire from the barbaric threat that had taken his father from him. As time went by, he had become hardened to all but the aforementioned Horatius, who he loved like a brother and was loyal to as much as he was loyal to Rome. Lost in thought over the beauty of the sunset, he hardly noticed the great, shadowy form headed towards the fort until dear Horatius had shaken his shoulders. “ Ovidius! Take heed! ” Horatius shouted, a look of worry on his face. “ It's the barbarians- the largest horde I have seen! ” “ I'll sound the alarm. ” Ovidius said, quickly calling down to the other soldiers. The message was clear- prepare for combat. Swords were sharpened and shields brandished as the troops prepared for the advancing threat, which, though intimidating, was at least familiar to them all. Victory, even at a great cost, was sure. However, Ovidius noticed something strange about this horde of barbarians- it was peculiarly fluid and shadowy. His grey eyes widened- this was more than a barbarian attack. This was something new, something alien and eldritch. “ I fear this is something we have never faced before… Something strange, otherworldly.... ” Ovidius muttered, and Horatius stood, paralyzed in fear as their eyes met. “ What… What do you mean? ” “ I mean what I say, Horatius! I need you to hide, to run- something! ” Horatius stood stock still for a moment, but then shook his head. “ No. I fight alongside my comrades, and I fight alongside you, brother! ” Ovidius was consumed in rage at the refusal. He wanted to scream- how could Horatius be so stupid? So absurdly, carelessly loyal? He wished he could strike him, but instead he sighed, embracing Horatius tightly. “ Be careful, then. And be brave. ” He said, his voice shaking as he held his comrade. “ Though you have no problem being brave. ” The two pulled away from one another, seeing the shadowy form encroaching closer and closer upon the fortress, and climbed down from the watchtower, one before the other, in preparation for the battle. Faster than expected, a force of pure shadow knocked down the gates to the fortress, taking two brave soldiers with it. Ovidius gasped, deeply terrified by the shadowy behemoth, but he shook his head, trying to think strategically. He retreated deeper into the fortress, searching for as many weapons as he could, an idea coming over him. Light. He needed light, for if he was to have any hope of defeating the darkness, the sole force that could vanquish the darkness would have to be his weapon. He took hold of a torch, charging back into the scene of the battle, left breathless upon his return by the sheer amount of dead. They suffered no wounds, but looked bloodless, eternally suffering, their faces twisted into likenesses of pain. He prayed that Horatius was not among them, that he was still fighting, that he had perhaps fled the scene. Even as dark, leviathanic tendrils slithered towards him, he held out hope and held his torch high. This was until a tendril dropped something at his feet- cold, in the form of a man. His eyes blurred with tears- he knew before he even wiped them away. Horatius. Ovidius dropped to his knees, sobbing, and the torch slipped from his hands as he collapsed atop of the body of the man he had called a brother. The fire was extinguished, both on the torch and in Ovidius's soul. The fight was over, and he succumbed, breathing in his inky surroundings until he drowned in the darkness. Nobody can recall the story of that division, as there were no survivors, but some who have visited the ruins of the fortress have said they heard whispers of the name Horatius in the voice of the last man to fall, and some have even been led deep into the bowels of the fortress where darkness resides. All who have been to its lowest point have repeated a warning, have seen a carving in Latin: “ Tenebrae rursus percutiet. ” Darkness will strike again. And some even reported the smallest serpentine tendril of darkness wrapping itself around their smallest finger before slipping away.",0
"Prompt: You 're part way through a course when you realise that it 's for aspiring supervillains. Story: I guess I should have taken more notice when I saw the module entitled “ Death Ray: Effective Weapon or Superhero Bringer? ” But what do I know about modern business courses? Nothing, apparently. Now that I come to think of it, the lecturer, a Professor Ernie Vile, was a little eccentric. He once showed us five effective ways to get out of a super-strong headlock. I did wonder just what I was getting myself into then. How irate could customers get? I only wanted to start a small photography business. Also, I would like to make it absolutely clear that I never went in there to become a supervillain. I honestly believed it was a business course right up until the League of Heroes burst through the door with their sting operation. I remember once we were asked to take in something in that would be a symbol of our trade. The Captain, he's the one with the cape, brought in a sort of gun to which he'd attached pipes filled with a blue liquid. He said it didn't work yet, but that it would truly revolutionise the world. I thought that was a little over the top. I mean, paintball is fun, but it's hardly revolutionary. Someone else brought in a crystal of some sort. It was kind of iridescent and emitted a faint humming noise. A bedside light designed to lull children to sleep, maybe? He wouldn't say where he got it, just that it was some sort of meteor remnant. He had a friend he always brought with him who carried everything for him and gave out stern looks if someone ever tried to contradict him. He had apparently been a loyal employee of Czar Dee Struction for years. What kind of parents name their kid Czar, anyway? Hippies, obviously. That also explained the fascination with crystals. For my part, I took in a camera because… Well, what else symbolises photography better than a camera? I remember when it was my turn to show it and everyone asked me, rather enthusiastically, what it did. Took pictures, I explained. This was met with some confusion. Did it evaporate people, Anne Archy asked. No, I explained. It was a camera. Did it hypnotise? I laughed. People did tend to become mesmerised when you were snapping photos of city buildings, yes. This seemed to satisfy them and afterwards I had a rather bizarre conversation with a hunched up man who suggested that a bright enough flash could be used to blind people. It was about six months later, and the professor had asked to see our progress with our various projects. I had brought in my camera, as usual, and a portfolio I had been working on. The hunched man came over and excitedly handed me a handheld flash. The captain had added some reservoirs to his gun for the strange water, and he said it presently only worked at short range, but he expected to have a fully working version in a few weeks. Czar had placed the crystal in a kind of metal box with a crude convex dish cut into one side. It reminded me of a square death star. He said that the dish amplified the effect of the crystal. I remember rolling my eyes at it. Just then, the door burst open and in jumped eight costumed men, in my shock I triggered the flash, and four of them dropped to their knees clutching at their eyes. One of them, The Gavel, or something, jumped over to me and got me in a headlock. The man was incredibly strong, and so I used number three of the five effective ways to get out of a super-strong headlock. He tumbled to the floor and Czar pressed a button on his box. A ray of blue light shone out and knocked down Gavel and Mr. Truth. I saw then that the Captain, was having trouble with the guy in the pink leotard, and had dropped his paintball gun. I grabbed it with the intension of shooting him in the eyes, those paintballs could do some serious damage when up close, but instead the liquid streamed out and pink-leotard man just kind of… disintegrated. That was an utter shock, and probably about the time I realised this wasn't a common old garden business course. The Victor, or Victorator, whatever his name was, it should have been The Vacator because he just jumped out through the ceiling and we never saw him again. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I am speaking to you as Supreme Evil Leader of The World. Please, remain calm and collected during the transitional period. Or don't, I don't care either way. But riots, protests or any kind of dissent will be met with the most swift and brutal action.",0
"Prompt: Magic is discovered and it 's channeled with music. Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north lie the Metal kingdoms. Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc. Story: The group of outcasts walked into town. In front led a girl with multi colored hair holding a mic. The girls voice was high pitched, but sharp. ""Careful, I've never been so deep in the south. These are archaic lands."" A man with hair down to his waste and covering his eyes spoke up. His voice gruff and laconic. ""I don't fear the savages of this land."" He gestured to the 20 notches on his big iron guitar. The party walked into the town, slowly looking all around. The streets were empty spare one man leaning against a wooden building. They walked up to a man wrapped all in linen cloth resting with a hat over his eyes. ""Hello, I am from Populas. Could you help point us to a hotel, we are not from Countryside."" The man showed no sign responding. A overweight dark skinned adventurer from the group kicked the man with his joggers. The cowboy fell over, the hat no longer covering his eyes. His lips were dry and cracked, his cloths under the linen covered in circular red stains. The group stepped back startled by the corpse. As they turned to leave two men walked out of the shadows. One carried a bottle of whiskey and looked to be a scrawny drunk, but the other looked more mountain than man. He stood 6' 6"" and weighted 245. His voice boomed with a slight Cajun accent. ""Follow"". He talked strangely polite for the way his muscles bulged threw his shirt threateningly. The group knew this was not a man they should give lip, so they followed. ""Were are you talking us."" The young girl asked the mountain, her voice somehow still peppy. The drunk spoke up as he struggle to walk straight. ""To learn the cold hard facts of life you-"", he was cut off by a hiccup. ""Could you at least give us your names?"" The girl asked, peppy as ever. The drunk again stammered and slurred a response. ""Names Porter, this here is Little Bitty Big John."" The group looked the man over. John was anything but ""little bitty"". They walked into a wooden saloon. The group looked around in horror. Never have they seen so many outlaws, criminals, and ruffians all in one place. At the bar set four men who all turned around when they walked in. The groups hearts dropped when they saw the altar in the center of the room. Made bottle, cattle skulls, and guns sat I the false god of the ancients of Countryside, Hank Williams. ""Welcome to Luckenbach travelers"" One of the men at the bar turned around, his hair split in two braided pony tails. ""Its nice to meet you.... I am a pop magician, we are allies with the Country wizards. My group only seeks safe passage."" The pop singers peppy voice was no more. Now she only wanted to escape with her life. She knew how few people meet the highway men and lived. ""Now!"" She screamed. Her voice rang out into her mic. The mindless music confused the cowboys and stunned them. In an instant the long haired man strummed his guitar and blew a hole clean through Little Johns chest, but like a big oak tree he just stood there and groaned, even death could not topple him. The darker man in the hoodie pulled out two glocks while spitting words like fire. The bullets shot out red hot piercing everything that stood in their way. Like that the group looked around at all the dead bodies. ""To easy"", said the long haired man. ""I though they'd be a challenge. As they stared to walk out of town they saw a lone man stood in their way. He wore a white sport coat and an pink carnation. He looked more like a Jazz Mage than a Country Savage. ""Move aside or die"" Threatened the long haired man pointing his guitar. ""We have already killed the rest of you."" The man only smiled and begun singing. **"" An old cowboy went out one dark and windy day"" ** ""You!"" The girl shrieked, terrified. ""How can you be alive. You were dead in the streets, shot full of hole."" The mans smile only grew wider. **"" Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way"" ** What the group heard next scared them all to the bone. From the saloon they had just left they heard a joyful choirs. **"" When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw"" ** I heard of demonic bulls flooded the skies. The cows charged before they group could react. Each cow like a meteors striking the earth. Not even bones were left, only red gravel. The voices continued to sing. **"" Plowin through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw"" **",0

To see if Drew will get drunk and piss his pants again? ” Laughter from the other groomsmen, the loudest coming from Drew himself. Mixed reaction from the crowd. Probably shouldn't have started with an inside joke. Or used the word “ piss. ” Don't look at Jenn, don't want to see her reaction. “ Drew. I've known you for 14 years now.

"Prompt: The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Story: ""What do you mean no adventurers allowed?!"" Maz growled at the guard, her hands already on the handles of her axes. Gregor held both of his arms in front of her, holding the disgruntled Orc back. ""Maz, sweetie, if they say no adventurers, then we can just go somewhere else,"" Gregor shouted at her, trying to channel as much arcane strength into his arms as he could. He really wasn't in the mood for fighting the town guard. Maz was nigh uncontrollable when she was angry, and while he was no slouch, he wasn't really much of a match for an orc warrior. The guard watched the human mage struggle with the orc, utterly disinterested in pretty much everything. He'd never wanted to be a guard. He'd wanted to be a cobbler. But, he'd completely beefed his cobbler's exam, so he needed to raise money to retake it. And being a guard paid well enough for the time being, so here he was. He chewed some tobacco like a goat chewing cud, and spit periodically on the ground next to him. ""Squatbird shit! This town is the closest one for kilometers with a Buffalo Wyvern Wings, and I don't want to miss watching the Rook Abbey Lancers *again! *"" Maz shouted, pointing one of her axes over Gregor's shoulder at the guard, knocking Gregor's wide-brimmed wizard hat off in the process. ""Maz! Chill! I'll handle this!"" Gregor shouted at her, pushing her back. Maz growled loudly, and snorted in Gregor's face, pushing him back in retaliation as she finally relented. Gregor stumbled back at the forceful push and eyed her angrily. She hooked her axe back into its sheath, and leaned against the wall of one of the parapets, furiously digging around in her satchel. ""Get this jizzwaddle to let us through, wizard. If I miss Ollie McDougal's first joust of the season, it's your ass,"" Maz grumbled, producing a small leather pouch stuffed with the hardest jerky Maz had been able to find at the last town. She bit down, tearing the dried beef apart and chewing rapidly in frustration. Gregor knew that most of the time her hard persona towards him was simply bluster; the two of them worked well together, and she knew it. But when she started calling him ‘ Wizard,'that was when she was serious. If he couldn't pull this off, he thought, then being unable to shave and running low on Ol Toby would be the least of his worries. He whipped his hat up off the ground as he walked to the guard, dusting it off and plopping it on his head. “ Okay, what the fuck, dude? ” Gregor asked, trying to put on his most official look, which happened to be about as official as goblin in a suit. “ Carl, ” the guard said. “ What? ” “ My name is Carl. Not ‘ dude,'” the guard sneered, spitting onto the ground again. “ Whatever. What's the deal here, Carl? Why no adventurers? ” Gregor asked. “ Lord's orders. Nobody gets in today. ” “ Penrith was totally fine with adventurers and travelers last week! What happened? ” “ New lord now, ” Carl said, spitting again, “ Came in… Ehh… Probably about five days ago. ” Gregor groaned and slapped his palm to his face. Some lord coming in and taking over wasn't anything new for the Kingdom of Penrith, or whatever it was called now. It happened pretty regularly, as was common in adventuring towns. But a new lord coming in and ruling that adventurers were no longer allowed was definitely new. Gregor rubbed his eyes and exhaled loudly. “ Match starts in twenty, Wizard, ” Maz said nonchalantly from the wall. Gregor spun around on his heel, and leveled a finger at her, his eyes burning with arcane energy. “ I'LL HANDLE THIS, MAZ, ” Gregor spat in frustration. Maz rolled her eyes and bit off another chunk of jerky, chewing loudly. Gregor huffed and turned back to the guard, who seemed genuinely surprised the wizard was still trying to get in. “ What happened to the old king? ” Gregor asked, relatively certain he knew the answer. “ Dead. Good riddance, too. All these laws about business owners have to have a license, no drinking in public, no pleasure houses. Bunch of goblin shit, ” Carl said, punctuating his statement with a spectacular spit. “ Uh-huh. Who's the new king? ” “ Some evil lord. Shug-rth Yurl Durf or something. I dunno. He pays guards more. People can pretty much do what they want now, you know? So, big celebration going on; the town's closed off for the next day. ” “ Is that why you're so butthurt about letting us in? Cause your worthless ass is stuck out here? ” Maz quipped. “ Yeah, pretty much, ” Carl admitted. Gregor sighed. He was getting nowhere with this. It was all well and good if the villagers and townspeople were happy with a new lord, even if he was some loony dark lord who worshipped elder gods, but he really needed to bathe. And get some more wizard weed. And shave. And make Maz take a bath; she smelled terrible. Maybe I should try a pity approach, he thought. “ Look dude, ” “ Carl. ” “ Look Carl, I'm wicked low on Ol Toby. I haven't shaved in three days. I'm hungry. My companion smells like a slaughterhouse. ” “ I noticed. ” “ Eat hot shit, ” Maz said to both Gregor and Carl, still chewing with her mouth open. The guard gave Maz a rude hand gesture. “ Can we please just get in? We won't do any adventuring. We just need to use an inn, and we'll be gone tomorrow, ” Gregor pleaded. The guard seemed unmoved by his plight. “ Nope. ” “ Oh *come on! * ” Gregor lamented, leaning forward and shaking his hands. “ Like I said, the town is closed off for the next day. Besides, who's to say you won't come in and try to overthrow the dark lord? ” Carl grumbled. “ We won't! ” Gregor exclaimed, “ We'll keep to ourselves! ” “ …Seems strange, some weird wizard and a pissy orc coming up to the gate, on the day of a big celebration. Asking all kinds of questions about the dark lord. Things are great now. We don't need some lousy adventurers mucking that all up."" “ I don't want to take over! I lack any and all aspirations for leadership! All I want to do- “ Gregor shouted, dropping to his knees on the dirt road and throwing his hat off, “ is get some more Ol Toby, eat some Buffalo Wyvern Wings, have a shave, and sleep in a shitty bed in the shitty inn! *IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? * ” Carl stared down the wizard, a look of severe irritation on his face. All Gregor could hear were the sounds of merriment inside the town, and Maz's loud chewing. “ My cousin owns the inn, ” Carl grumbled, leveling his pole-arm at Gregor “ And I don't appreciate you talking shit- ” Maz, who had nonchalantly walked over, took the opportunity to grab the distracted guard, putting her palm against his helmet and smashing his head into the wall. With a loud clang and clanking of metal, he crumpled to the ground, unconscious. “ I hope they didn't run out of extra spicy wings, ” Maz said simply, walking through the gate, leaving Gregor kneeling on the ground next to the now passed-out guard. Gregor stared at the collapsed body, and then looked up at Maz, then back at the body. He grabbed his hat off the ground and walked quickly after her. “ Why didn't you do that when we first showed up? ” Gregor said, plainly irritated. “ I like watching you humiliate yourself, ” Maz said with a dull smile, “ Now buy me some wyvern wings. ”",0
"Prompt: You wake up only to find out you have gone back in time 1 year. The date is Dec 21st, 2015. You alone know what 2016 has in store for the world and you alone have been chosen to change it for the better ... or worse. Story: I woke up to a familiar voice, one I used to know. She was whispering in my ears, ""Wake up honey"". She used to do that. I jumped out of bed in shock and stared at her. It really was Rachel. But how could this happen? I lost her a month ago, in a car crash. She didn't survive. I still heard her voice time to time, But this.... this was something else.... I was crushed by an huge wave of thoughts, feelings and memories. At first I thought it's just a dream. I pinched myself in the arm, I should wake up now. Nothing happens, she's still there looking at me in confusion. ""What's wrong Ash?"" My mind was frozen. I couldn't even answer her. Then I see our Christmas tree. We decorated it together. Ever since I lost her, I kept living in every memory I had with her. And last Christmas was one of the best ones I had. ""Umm, nothing just.... ""I stopped for a second, getting my thoughts together and then continued ""Just got that Christmas feeling"". She laughed. I missed her smile the most. I didn't care if it was a dream or not. I was enjoying being around her again. I was hoping it was real. ""Sooo.... Breakfast!"" I yelled while rushing to the kitchen. I heard her giggle in the bed as I was going out the door. I grabbed the milk from the fridge, then something attracted my attention. The calendar on the fridge door was showing December 2015. I put the milk on the kitchen table in suspence and went back to the room to grab my phone. And I realized that it's my old phone. She bought me a new phone for Christmas last year. How detailed this dream is, I thought. I checked my phone; December 21st 2015. What is going on? If I was dreaming, I would have been awake by now. But does this mean I traveled back in time? I spent the morning just thinking about it all, and took every chance to look at her another time. I think I creeped her out. Soon it was nighttime, and I just knew that it is real. I talked about it with her in the bed, she just laughed. She thought I'm just making it up to have a conversation. Days passed and I was still struggling. Things sort of happened the way I remembered them. Christmas came and she gave me her present. It was an iPhone. Exactly the same one, with the note on the back of it saying ""For my love, Ash"". Same went for every other event. I was just living 2016 again. With every crappy thing that happened in it. I was really happy that I got the chance to have her again, but something bothered me. I was counting down the days until the accident. The fact that I knew she was going to die that day was the most unsettling thing I ever experienced, even worse than the loss itself. I didn't want to lose her again, and it was torturing me everyday. The day came. I was scared as all hell. It was our anniversary and we were going out for a romantic dinner. I didn't let her drive, maybe that will prevent the accident from happening. It's been three months since that day.... Since I last saw her. The accident didn't happen. But she left me that night. We had an argument and things went wrong.... Seems that the fear of that day changed me too much. I guess I was destined to lose her.... So this was my first time writing anything, any feedback is appreciated. Hope you enjoyed it.",0
"Prompt: In an undiscovered region of the galaxy, the Grey side of the Force awakens. Story: # # # # # # [ ] (# dropcap) Austen Cyr swore as the X-TIE Fighter just barely missed his view screen, the brillant scarlet lasers of the ""Ugly"" illuminating the inside of his cockpit for one brief but terrible moment. Austen jerked the control stick of his MorningStar-A to the left, the tri-winged fighter responding with an alacrity unusual to the aging design. It wasn't the first modification he made to the veteran machine but it was one that often made the difference in such matters of life and death. He kicked his pedals to the right, the act causing his inertial compensators to lag behind as Austen felt himself being slammed against the padded flight chair. The maneuver worked, and the enemy Ugly shot past his fighter and directly into the path of his laser cannons. Before the pirate pilot could react Austen Cyr squeezed the trigger on his stick, sending a stream of orange bolts towards the exposed stern of the X-TIE. The fighter's shields, somehow compromised in the manufacture of the bastard craft failed in a spectacular fashion, evaporating in shudder of light before the rest of the laser bolts impacted against the Ugly's stern. Durasteel armor melted under the intense heat, globules of metal boiling off its hull. Something flew off of the X-TIE's hull and flashed by the MorningStar's cockpit, a squat shaped thing of dull green that Austen somehow knew was the fighter's astromech. *Now for the kill shot.... * Austen Cyr switched over to his fighter's concussion missiles, the HUD's aiming reticle morphing ever so slightly. The targeting screen flashed from red to orange to green, the lock-on tone turning good as he launched one of the expensive missiles. The enemy pilot, no doubt still reeling from the effects of his lasers failed to take evasive action soon enough, the streaking missile detonating mere meters from the X-TIE. The TIE fighter's distinctive panels warped under the shockwave, crumpling in half as the solar arrays were pitted with shrapnel. The X-Wing nose snapped in half, the broken stub venting oxygen and other gases into the void of space. Cyr saw no pilot eject, the shattered view screen and bloody cockpit confirming that his foe did not survive. Austen Cyr whooped with joy, his blood hot with victory. That made four more in a single engagement, bringing his kill count to a sizable forty all in told. That made him the second leading ace in the Basilisk Mercenary Squadron; his commander and mentor Captain Otim Larn had more confirmed kills. Any further celebration was cut short however as he felt something hit him, a searing pain in the center of his mind like a red hot needle. Austen reeled in his cockpit, the straps of his seat digging into his skin as he thrashed in agony. Nothing he ever felt had ever come close to what he was experiencing, his screams deafening in his ears. He began to slam his head against control panel, only the thick padding and armor of his flight helmet keeping him from dashing in his brains. All the while *something* wormed through his mind, probing each and every memory no matter how insignificant; his earliest recollections, treasured moments, past lovers all laid out for whatever it was to see. He felt it working its way through it all, tossing aside the chaff and collecting the most powerful memories into some sick twisted amalgamation. Austen clawed at his face, tearing off the oxygen mask in a vain effort to free himself from whatever it was. And then it began to implant thoughts of its own into his mind, it's voice somehow sowing itself into his soul. *Shhh..... shhhhh..... do not be afraid. All is well. * Austen Cyr gasped in pain, blood dripping down his face from where his nails scratched off skin. ""Get the kark out of my head,"" he hissed, the serpentine entity sliding in and out of his memories. *Not yet. Not while I have use for you. * ""Get. Out."" *My methods may seem cruel, but rest assured this is for the greater good. You are weak, still untrained. But with me you shall discover your true potential, experience the true power of the Force. We have much to do, and we have begun late. There is much to teach you. I am fear you will not enjoy it but remember this above all: Everything I tell you is a lie. *",0
"Prompt: The year is 3017. The whole world is `` futuristic '' and everything is clinical ( smooth, clean etc. You are the head of a vigilante group that plants trees in public areas. Story: ""If you asked most people about their general opinion on trees, they would probably answer, ""Trees? Those things still exist?"" The truth is, most people don't much of an opinion on trees. Most people born in the past few centuries haven't even seen a tree before, and have never been graced by the subtle wonders of the colorful shades of oak in the fall, or the retreat of a willow, or the brawn of the sequoia. These sorts of things only existed in photographs of old encyclopedias. ""When synthetic wood was first created, most were quick to adopt. Synthetic wood possessed superior qualities, they claimed. It was not flammable, it was sturdy, it was cheap, and *it looked just like wood*. So we didn't need trees anymore! In fact, every reason for which a tree is useful — for shelter, for warmth, for oxygen, for wildlife habitats, for aesthetic pleasure on a nice evening walk — has been invalidated by synthetic wood and other equally absurd human inventions. ""Anyone who has ever struck a match before can understand what I'm saying, because when you strike a match, it grants you a sort of control, a dominance, over something that is untamed. On the tip of the math dances a flame that disregards everything else, and only burns so long as you allow it. And seeing that wood burn away, being consumed by raw nature, is something that is lost on people these days. I read stories about great fires that could be seen from miles away, burning away hundreds of thousands of trees, leaving behind nothing but charred yet fertile ground, on which new trees would grow. A cycle that would've continued indefinitely, until humans said, ""we don't need trees anymore. Trees are bothersome, ugly, and catch on fire. Let's do away with them."" And so they did. ""This is why it is important to plant trees. Trees give us life, they give us beauty, and they give us joy. We must not let people forget where our humanity is rooted. We must remind them of the trees!"" Everyone was required to read this passage written by the founder when they were accepted into the Tree Planting Club, which was hardly a club, and more like a collection of distinct and autonomous cells operating in different cities around the country. I was introduced by a childhood friend to this club, David. David was obsessed with trees ever since childhood, and would show me pictures of all sorts of trees when we were kids. ""My dad's a botanist,"" he would say, ""but he hates trees."" In all honesty, I often doubted the validity of the goal of the Tree Planting Club. Humanity has gone hundreds of years with most people not having even been influenced in some minute way by a tree. Not even food grew on trees anymore. Every food was replaced a synthetic version that (supposedly) tasted better, was cheaper to make, and didn't require constant watering and maintenance to produce. I joined the TPC soon after I found out Dad had been arrested for planting trees in public spaces. He was a writer, and one I looked up to, even though his novels never sold well. He had a spunk and determination that made him a great writer, but a terrible father. I wanted to follow in his footsteps, and if it wasn't my path to follow, so be it. I would quit TPC and get a normal job. But I'd like to think that I'm a writer too, and I wanted to write about something interesting, like trees, and how they affected people. That's how I found myself in the back of a cargo truck, sitting on the floor (if you can even call the sterile, metal base of a cargo box a floor), fiddling with the lamplight, which seemed to flicker and die every few seconds. David held a grim look on his face. After all, we were about to commit one of the greatest acts of vandalism: planting a tree. Because no one likes to admit when they are nervous, we sat in the humid box in silence, allowing the solid air to pull the hair on our necks up straight and pull the sweat from the pores on our palms. In between us lay a great maple tree. According to the books, the tree stood shorter than most, but it largest one I've seen and was apparently the largest one we could fit into the cargo box. ""A minute from the plant site,"" Camille said from the front. We began to prepare our gear. We revved up our motorized shovel, our Chizzler™, and suited up into our exoskeletons, and Camille flicked on her police signal interceptor. Planting a tree used to be easy. I read a pamphlet once that taught people how to plant trees, and it went like this: Find a soft area of dirt and dig a hole, and then drop the tree in the hole so the leaves are facing up. Then refill the gaps in the hole with dirt, pack it tight, and leave the tree. Tie ropes to support the tree of necessary. Obviously there was no dirt patches or soft soil in the middle of Times Square, where we were headed tonight to plant a tree. Luckily, we arrived when there were only a few people walking the streets, perhaps tourists who think it would be a neat experience to walk around Times Square at three in the morning. Even at this hour, you couldn't see the moon even if it were straight above. We built these buildings to look as if they were stretching out to reach for the stars, yet we blocked out the whole sky in the process. So people don't look up anymore, except to watch the endless panels of advertisements flash by faster than we can understand them. As the truck came to the stop, we slid open the backdoor of the cargo box and hopped out. We had a short window of operations, so we moved quickly. David grabbed the Chizzler and spun the motor up to a speed where it could destroy even fortified concrete. The plan was simple — drill a hold in the sidewalk, fill it with soil, roll the tree in, and cover the hole back up. Just as described in the pamphlet. As the Chizzler hit the concrete, the machinery made an awful, dull roar that probably awakened anyone within a three block radius of us. But it worked fast, and within 30 seconds, there was a tree-sized cavity in the sidewalk, filled with loose concrete and industrial dust. I used the shovel to remove all the excess rock fragments, while David lifted the tree out of the cargo box with the help of his exoskeleton. ""Hurry up, people are watching, it's only time before someone calls the police!"" Camille yelled from the truck. We didn't say anything, but it was clear to her that we acknowledged the urgency. We moved like clockwork, yet it still didn't feel like enough time. David was holding the tree upright as I ripped open bags of soil and began emptying them into the hole. It took nearly five or six large bags to complete fill the hole until the soil was packed tightly enough that the tree could stand upright by itself. ""The police are on their way, we got ta go,"" Camille said. There wasn't enough time to clean up after ourselves. The Tree Planting Club had a policy of never leaving a mess when they planted, because it would reflect poorly on the organization. The TPC also had a policy of ""not getting caught"" because people who were truly enthusiastic enough about trees to commit great acts of vandalism were obnoxiously hard to come by. We dashed back into the cargo box, and as the truck pulled off we watched the tree become smaller and smaller through the open back door, until it was a stub in the urban landscape. ""Let's hope that went well,"" David mumbled as he pulled the back door down, which hit the floor with a mighty bang. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I fully expected the tree to be removed when I woke up. The city was usually pretty good about vandalism. However, I opted not to read the news that morning and decided to take the metro into the city and see for myself the result of our work. Would they tape off that section of the sidewalk? Would the lasting impact of our highly rehearsed tree planting just going to be a brand new section of concrete in Times Square? I sipped my coffee as I rounded the corner into the Times Square center. There was a huge congregation, with people clamoring and yelling and shoving, which was naturally the result of thousands of New Yorkers and unwitting tourists packed into one tiny block. But above all their heads, I could still see it. The brilliant radiance of burnt orange maple leaves, ""the color of Autumn."" The tree was taller, grander, and much more majestic than I remembered, and had apparently not been cut down. It stood gorgeously in the autumn sunlight. I later discovered that soon after we planted the tree, a group of locals, woken by the noise, took interest with the tree and surrounded it when the authorities came, to prevent the tree from being cut down. In a short period of time in the early morning, the news had spread and hundreds of people rushed to the tree's defense and created a human wall. And by noon that day, it had become national news, and everyone who enjoyed the bustle of pivotal events gathered at Times Square. They kept the tree, by the way. It was one of the only trees planted by TPC that didn't get almost immediately removed. This tree is almost twice the size, many times the awesomeness of the original tree we had planted years ago, and is maintained by the City of New York. Hopefully, now, when people visit Times Square, they'll have something to look up to that isn't those chrome edifices and their gloomy dispositions. No, I know they'll just be able to stand under the tree and look up, and they'll understand something inexplicable they hadn't before, like they'd solved a great mystery in their lives they hadn't known even existed. edit: slight edits to the story to make it more consistent",0
"Prompt: At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. Story: See, most people try to live forever, but that ends one of two ways: they don't or they wish they didn't. Rob Herman was a famous example of the first, Rob chose his Event to be “ Winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning. ” It was a great choice, the chance of getting struck on any given day was 1 in 245,000,000 and the chance of winning big lotteries is about the same. This way Rob could continue his passions of being outdoors and playing the lottery, just not both at the same time! But Robby got sloppy, and one day mixed the two at a state fair. With about 20 billion people on the earth miracles are bound to happen every once and a while. The most infamous example of the second was Nick Walsh. Nick chose “ Due to a quantum mechanical flux, a cat appears from nowhere. ” Such wishes are rather common among those seeking true immortality. After Nick's fiancée left him, he lost his job, he was eternally imprisoned for a crime (eventually proved innocent, but not until it was too late,) and his mother died due to a freak game of poker. He then performed brain surgery on himself using a nail stuck through a plank. He's brain-dead in a hospital now with explicit instructions NOT to pull the plug, with the threat that he'll it again in the next life. So when it came my Time I took a different approach. I didn't want immortality, I wanted the most out of life. I wanted an event that I could enjoy, that wouldn't bind or hinder me. “ The day that the good will never again outweigh the bad. ” In the past thousand years I've had good times and bad times, I've had great times and terrible times, I've been in more love and more pain than I could imagine. And through it all my Event has been there for me, an eternal promise, that I still have a good life ahead.",0
"Prompt: You are an omnipotent god. Out of boredom you decided to live an ordinary human life vowing not to use your power. 15 years has pass and you have a 9 to 5 working for a major tech company. Your boss has been tormenting you for years and you have reach your limit Story: James and Robert sat the bar. They were taking shots and complaining about their boss Dylan. Regular Friday night stuff. ""That's it. Fuck this guy. I'm gon na kill his wife."" ""Jim you can't say shit like that man."" ""Wouldn't be first time I fucked over someone to prove a point."" ""What?"" ""Nevermind man don't worry about it."" James slammed another shot of Tequila. ""That asshole has had it out for me for years dude. 15 years I've been with this fucking company and he has been RELENTLESS! I don't get what is fucking problem his!"" ""Who knows dude, maybe one of the other workers we bring out told him you say shit like you're gon na kill his wife!"" Robert laughed as he said it. ""Bobby, I'm tired man. For 15 years you've been a great friend, and I really appreciate that. I just want you know, that no matter what happens, I've got your back alright."" James stood up, dropped a fifty on the bar, and started to walk away. Robert grabbed him by the arm. ""What the fuck man? Don't say shit like that and just walk away. You've got me worried now.

You're seriously starting to freak me the hell out."" Robert was doing his best to subdue James and keep him sitting, but he wasn't having it. Drunk James was hell bent on killing Dylan's wife. ""Job's wife didn't do shit either and I still killed her. All because Luke said'You won't, no balls!' Matter of fact, fuck this guy! I'm gon na level his whole damn block!"" Robert swore he was just pushing James back down into his seat. How did he get home. How did get naked and in bed? He checked the time: 8 o' clock in the morning on Sunday. ""Oh fuck me, did I drive home drunk again?"" Robert turned on the TV. The news headline read ""Tornado ravages Cincinnati block; every resident presumed dead."" That was definitely Dylan's neighborhood. Robert couldn't believe it, he checked every news source he could find on both the TV and internet. The tornado formed without a single warning sign, touched down, wrecked the whole block and ONLY that block, then disappeared... Robert's face twist up in confusion as he though back to last night. He grabbed his phone and called James. James answered, ""Hello?"" ""What the fuck...?""",0
"Prompt: Gather up the posse Story: Sheriff Briggs was an old timer. He'd been watching over his small town of Suburbicania for fifteen years. He'd seen everything that could have happened in a small town - hell, he had almost single-handedly helped remove a drug ring from the nearby Suburbicania High. Some hailed him as a local hero, but to most he was just Hank Briggs. He was patrolling one of the neighborhoods on a Friday night when he got the call: ""*chh* Sheriff Briggs? We just got an anonymous tip about something down on 2^nd and Eaton. Not a lot of detail, doesn't seem like much. Can you handle it?"" ""10-4 I'm on my way."" Eaton Rd was about 2 blocks away, he expected to be there in 5 minutes. It seemed like a pretty standard call, probably a scuffle between some teenagers that were out too late, or some middle aged idiots who had a bit too much to drink. When he arrived on scene, a crowd had started to form around *something*, he couldn't way what. He rolled down his window but between the noise of their chatter and their less-than-transparent bodies, it was impossible to tell what was going on. He parked his car and stepped out; a few noticed him and made way so he could get closer. Each and every person who made eye contact with him had the same puzzled and panicked look on his or her face, and no one said a word. At the center of the group was a crack in the asphalt that cut deep into the earth. It was not a large split, but rather something out of a sci-fi horror in which the crust of the earth could no longer bear the brunt of some horrible force preparing to burst from the inside. Sheriff Briggs was just as confused as everyone else in the area, but he needed to do something to help calm nerves. ""Alright, everyone, please stay calm, this just looks like a pothole. Did anyone see what happened when it.... uh.... opened?"" he said shakily. His question was greeted with silence. People glanced at each other with uncertainty.... then everything happened so fast. The ground shook and the crowd slowly began backing away. Sheriff Briggs stood, frozen, staring at the crack that was slowly widening. An eerie glow shone from the crack and a tentacle reached up, snagged his ankle and tugged, knocking him off his feet. His ass hit the ground, hard, and the group of people dispersed immediately, shouting and screaming and creating all manner of chaos in the streets of Suburbicania. The tentcacle unwrapped briefly and pulled back into the crack as a piercing shriek emanated from the ever widening split in the earth. Briggs half ran, half crawled back to his car as a larger arm of the beast reached out, pressed firmly on the ground, and began to pull the body to which is was attached out of the abyss. Sheriff Briggs grabbed the radio in his car and muttered one word as another arm was wrapping around his waist: ""Help.""",0
"Prompt: You are standing at the alter about to marry the woman of your dreams when all of the sudden 3 tall men in dark suits barge through the door, your soon to be wife turns around, raises her arms and the men go flying across the room. Story: I stood, nervous, awaiting for her, THE woman of my life, Katerine. I could feel the gaze of the people in the church on my back, as I waited near the altar. Finally, I heard the door open behind me. When I saw her, walking down the aisle towards me, all of my feelings hAve been washed away by happiness and admiration, as well as pride. I knew that this woman is someone who made my life better, hence the happiness. She was walking ever so gracefully, and so so beautiful, which is why I admired her. And I also knew about how she was scared of people, how she hated being in the center of the attention, yet she fough with herself to make my dream come true. For that, I was the proudest ive ever been. Katerine reached the altar, and I could see her joy in the years, glistening and sparking, making her look truly star-gazed. The priest started the ceremony: ""We meet today-"" That's when it happened. A loud bang along with flash of light cut off my senses. When I came to, I saw people in SWAT-like suits charging through the doors. People were screaming, while I stood there, shocked and frozen. Suddenly, they took aim on Katerine, while screaming for her to get down. I couldn't understand what was happening, and tried to tell them to calm down, but the moment I turned, someone threw a small black ball, and the world exploded into fire. As I felt a wave of heat hit me, I was still wondering why was it happening, to me, on this day. I wanted to start screaming at the world's unjust, why would I deserve this? And then I saw it. The fire was held in place, a beautiful, *warm*, gentle almost, green light was enveloping me. I looked for the source, mouth agape, and that's when I noticed that it came from Katerine's hands. Unlike me, the attackers weren't frozen, and decided to continue their assault. That's when I saw the fury rise in Katerine's eyes, the same colour as the light. As she screamed with visible effort, she lifted her arms, and along with them went the soldiers. Two of them broke the doors on their way out, while the others left various size holes in the wall. I realised why she'd be so scared of people and attention now. I realised why **I** should be scared of **her**. But I knew her from the bottom of my heart, and I couldn't just start fearing her. Defiantly, I grabbed her hand. She looked me, surprised by my reaction, and I couldn't help my laugh, as I pulled her or through the backdoor, into our new life.",0
"Prompt: You wake up one day to find the world in ruins, and everyone dead. You meet God outside, finding out that he has kept you alive for a reason. Story: The world turned to ash and ruin around me. Fire rained from the sky and plagues killed people by the millions. Days, weeks, and finally months passed as I alone sat unscathed. In the end I was the only one to survive the apocalypse. My family, my friends, my love, all gone. After the grief, and the pain, and the tears, all that remained was a question: Why? And in my pain a voice answered, calling me outside of my home. The world around my home was alight with flames and molten earth, but my house was untouched, and the fire did not burn me. And at the end of my driveway was a man, from whom the fires seemed to flee and falter. As I drew nearer and nearer to him I become sure of who it was, and when he looked at me and smiled I knew I was right. God spoke softly, but the sounds carried to my ears as clearly as if he were standing next to me. ""You, my son, are the only one left. The last of my creations on earth. I have torn asunder the continents, I have boiled the oceans, and I killed all of my children. All but you. Do you know why?"" I shook my head. He smiled. ""In 40 days and 40 nights the fires will stop. From the ground a new ocean will spring up, and with it new continents. From the ocean will come life, and from that life a new world. Humanity reached its logical conclusion years ago. It was time for it to end, and frankly I was surprised it lasted this long."" ""You.... were surprised?"" I responded suddenly, and again the half smile returned. ""No. Everything happened as I imagined. Everything happened as it was supposed to. From the moment you were born I knew you were the one."" ""The one what?"" ""The last one. The last of humanity to fade away. And from you comes the seed of new life."" ""I don't understand..."" ""You see,'God' is an abstraction. A title. An idea, if you will. Just like this world around us it's an illusion. There is no one god, despite the fact that I am standing here in front of you, there have been many. There will be many more. Humanity was my creation, my failure. This end was not of my design, humanity brought it upon itself with a failed demonic summoning. In the end a fifteen year old boy in Texas kickstarted the apocalypse. And that was my fault."" ""Why are you telling me this?"" ""Because you are the new God, of course! Your destiny is to reshape the world- or rather- the entirety of the universe. I focused on Earth, made it alone in a universe of nothing, gave it the means of evolution to accomplish anything and yet it still destroyed itself with magic that they should never have discovered. And now it's your turn."" ""But.... I"" ""You, my friend, should learn to not look a gift horse in the mouth. It's this or the flames. Actually, it's just this. And don't worry, you've got all the time in the world to figure it all out."" Then there was a flash of light, and as I opened my eyes I saw *everything*.",0
"Prompt: You wake up and discover that you are now a ghost. The more shocking news is finding out where you 've been assigned to haunt. Story: The water was cold, and then it was warm, and then it was cold again. From there, I felt nothingness, and I knew peace. But right now, strangely enough, I feel.... awake. That wasn't at all the point of this. I'm drifting, but not due to the water surrounding me. The water doesn't restrict me at all anymore. I'm just sort of floating. But now I can move. And fast. Thinking towards the sky, I shoot up to my jumping spot in only a moment. I feel sentiment, and then sadness, and then nothing. This exact place is full of thoughts and pain and the promise of escape - I should be feeling more. But my feelings are brief and fleeting. I have felt an hour's worth of feeling in just a moment, and really, it's meaningless. And empty. But in place of my sadness, or happiness, or whatever else, I feel a new compulsion. A pull, a tug. An impulse. It asks me to drift away from this spot, and I answer kindly and follow its will. It leads me away, back towards the city - and at this moment, I know just the place. In an Apartment in Valley Street, in room VII and on the third floor, is a friend. A lover from a past life. My memories of her are warm, but like all else, they are fleeting and now full of nothingness. And cold. Up against her window, I see her rest, her chest rising and falling. I can sense her breaths and their effects on the dust around her. I can smell her remaining makup that she left on. I can see her dreams becoming darker. Why is it that I should be here? What is it that tugs at my heart to visit this place? What it is that this woman of old could mean to me, after all this distance? The Will speaks to me. ""You are foolish to ask,"" it says, ""for it has already begun."" A moan, and then a gasp. She curls up into a ball, and a tear curls out of her eye. ""What you felt at that moment is what it is you carry with you."" Its voice is a whisper of velvet. ""Let her understand."" Her dreams are of sadness. Her dreams are of me, and as I get closer, the dreams get stronger. Against my commands, I back away from the window, willing nothing of harm on her soul. But the further I depart, the darker my eyes perceive the world. The Will allows me to feel, to make those understand who could not comprehend. And without that, perhaps I am just a gust of wind, soon to dissipate into the universe. So I must not retreat. Instead, I think forward, and move closer. Through the window, in her room, I lay my hand upon her shoulder. She screams, and her dreams delve into the bitter black, so now she understands. Beyond her terror is the silence of the night, with the chirp of the crickets and the glow of the moon and the soft roar of the midnight traffic. In the calmness of my heart, I move closer, besides her, my arms around her, and she stops screaming. But in her mind, I know it is louder than ever. In a past life I would be sad, I think. But this is not the same as then. What it is I felt is what I carry with me, and what I carry with me is all that remains. That's what The Will is speaking to me. But, again.... Why here? Can this desire answer me that question? ""You are almost finished. All you need to do is stop from fading."" But fading is what I wanted, is it not? ""What you are is what you carry with you."" But that doesn't mean anything. ""Then you are nothing."" I slip away from her - from the will. This is not my life any longer. I can not dwell among my feelings and desires. What was once a good gesture is now a passageway to death. What I felt is what I am. And I am death. So as it was, I must continue. I run away, further from my love and away from what it is I cared for. So I depart, at the speed of my will. But the sadness of the moment is gone now, and I can not even remember her touch. The warm became cold, and the cold became nothingness. The pattern continues, as it must from this point on forever. But I must wonder - as before, is there something after this nothingness? The answer is spoken to me, and it saddens me.",0
"Prompt: You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other. Story: I reached over and picked my phone off of my nightstand. 12:30. *Damn, I was supposed to meet her a half an hour ago*. I quietly laughed to myself as I set the phone back down. *Oh Jacob, there you go getting wrapped up in your own delusions again*. When you have persistent lucid dreams like me you often blur the lines of reality and fantasy. But there was one thing I could never quite grasp, and it was tantalizing. I could build anything I wanted in my dream planet. Tall glass skyscrapers, vast and beautiful mountains, bustling cities rich with common folk who would delightfully cater to my every whim. The people I created were pleasant, of course, but naturally lacked what I can only describe as a soul. Maya was different though. I had imagined her at the very beginning. Hell, we practically grew up together on that illusioned planet. She was stunningly beautiful to me. Not the average pin up girl as you might expect, but perfectly imperfect. And no matter how hard I tried (and trust me some nights I did) I could never shake her of her free will. She said what she wanted and did what she wanted, and always with admirable grace. I remember the night we were stocking a lake with an assortment of vibrant exuberant fish.... ""Jacob"" she began. ""Yes, love?"" I joked playfully. She smiled but her gaze never left the lake. ""I want to stock this lake with crane"" she said. ""OK"" I rose off the ground and brushed myself off as I began to conjure some cranes from the clouded memories I retained from watching discovery channel. I had never actually seen a crane in person before. ""No"" she interrupted. ""I want the crane to be like the folded origami cranes my mother used to make for me."" ""Oragami cranes huh? That's pretty silly, considering we just stocked these hyper-realistic fish don't you think?"" She smiled again. ""Silly perhaps, but beautiful."" At that moment lively Oragami cranes of every color soared over our heads and elegantly encircled the lake. She was truly an artist. My mind was always conjuring realistic, practical objects in this world. She truly made it unique and alluring. Maya may have been the cause for many of my failed relationships in the real world. Sure I'd had my share of ups and downs with a handful of interesting women, but none of them held a candle to Maya, and I only had my imaginative mind to blame. The calm night finally swept me away into sleep and slowly my blurred vision focused on Maya's glowing countenance. ""You're late again,"" she claimed with her arms crossed and her feet tapping the floor as she so often did. I smiled, ""well it's good to see you too."" That night we constructed a monumental fountain together. I worked out the mechanics as I always did and she painted the scene in serene beauty. We marveled at our creation together as we held hands on a bench. I conjured a daisy in my hand and wove it through her thick brown hair just behind her ear. She rested her head on my shoulders. We sat until the inevitable piercing light penetrated the sky signaling the arrival of real consiousness. *What a good dream*. I reached over and silenced my phone. I got up, brushed my teeth, fed my dog and told him to be a good boy, and grabbed my keys to leave my apartment. I took a final look back and sighed. *Reality is the labor I must endure so I can return to you every night*. I had a good half hour to kill so I stopped by a local coffee shop to grab a pick-me-up. I sat at a table near a window and let the natural light illuminate my newspaper, sipping coffee inbetween paragraphs. In the corner of my eye I saw someone place something before me. Curious, I dropped my newspaper to see what it was. Chills consumed my body from my head to my toes. Sitting before me was a handcrafted origami crane, just like the ones Maya had evoked. My coffee mug slipped from my hand and shattered on the floor. It must have caused quite a stir in the shop but I had no idea. Everything around me blurred to oblivion as I focused my gaze on the person who had placed the crane. ""Maya..."" I uttered as a sweet smile stretched across her face. *sorry for the shit formatting. On mobile. Constructive criticism welcome! *",0
"Prompt: `` Let grandpa tell you about the time he participated in the great cyber-war of 2018. '' Story: It wasn't like the other wars kids, this one had no trenches. We used no guns. The violence was all fought up in our minds and on our screens. There were but two factions, left and right, we fought for control of ASH but we simply could not do it in the end. The world tossed us out after we failed, the others one and the country- the world really- made the gravest mistake they could: ""Twitch played Rattatta"". It took us months to get the badges and the necassary team, left kept fighting for control at every turn but we managed to out flank them with just our numbers. We constantly inputed ""right"" commands through all ours of the night. We worked in shifts in homes and tied our internet connections together praying to our Fossil god that Google Fiber would grace us with it's power. I was once the fateful man that chose to let our Charmeleon evolve to the Charizard we needed so desperately at the end of the eight gym- all others had faltered but I typed on, refreshing the page and spamming it with entries of ""A"" which was our secondary responsibility to going right. When we whited out, well we knew all would give up hope and the battles spiraled back towards Pallet town to fake masturbate in our bed at our mother's place having been one to come as close as any other but eventually losing out to our neighbor. I'll never forgive those leftists, now our clothes are all produced by Kanye West because those trolling teeny-boppers resurrected him as an AI of fashion and our governemntal system is put to the same spamming test and run by Twitch only to force out the old people who can't spam the keyboards fast enough. Don't be like that child- the cyber war of 2018 started us down this terrible path- you must find a way to reverse the trend!",0
"Prompt: Two former spouses are divorced from one another, but it is still very obvious that they are deeply in love Story: After their divorce was finalized Kelly and Skip treated themselves to a gourmet lunch to celebrate the occasion. Together. The arbitrator had commented that he'd never processed a more amicable divorce. Why, if they were so content with each other, would they separate? “ For the kids, ” Skip told him. The arbitrator shook his head, not understanding. Most people stay married for the kids. Especially if, like Kelly and Skip, you have 4 children. They told their friends their jobs as public school teachers were time consuming and stressful and took a toll on their marriage. After lunch Kelly drove Skip to his apartment where they celebrated again, this time in the bedroom. As Kelly was leaving she kissed her now ex-husband and said with a grin, “ see you later you two timing bastard. Love you. ” “ You too, you mean old witch, ” Skip replied. They both laughed as they went their separate ways. When Kelly got remarried a year later Skip was of course invited to the wedding. His kids thought it strange that he smiled through the whole ceremony, but only Skip noticed the glance in his direction as Kelly said her vows. Skip liked Kelly's new husband Carl. He was a successful banking professional and a nice enough guy, though everyone agreed he was just plain boring. They seemed happy enough for the next several years which is why everyone was surprised when Kelly and Carl separated and eventually divorced. When Kelly and Skip's youngest child Elyse, having graduated college the previous spring, made a surprise visit home, she found her parents - her divorced parents - snuggling on the couch. “ Your father and I have decided to get back together, ” Kelly told a shocked Elyse. “ Why didn't you just stay together in the first place? ” she asked. “ I think we both needed to grow, ” said Skip, giving Kelly that same grin as when they said goodbye after their divorce. Kelly and Skip started laughing uncontrollably. To this day, happily re-married, they still chuckle at their divorce of convenience, knowing there was no way two public school teachers could have paid for their kids'college educations on their own.",0
"Prompt: A priest, a rabbi, and a minister walk into a bar. But this is no joke, this is a tragedy. Story: A minister walked into a bar. A rabbi soon followed. The bartender at Mc'Ally's Bar was surprised by his guests. He poured each of them a beer, rarely seeing holy men in a bar. A few minutes later a priest walks into the bar. “ This must be a joke, ” the rabbi remarked. “ You can't have three of us in a bar and not have a joke. ” “ I got a joke for you, ” the minister said, ordering another beer. “ Who has had their heart ripped out and stomped on by those he loves most? This guy! I am a joke, aren't I? All this preaching of God's love, all these things I tell others to do, and what do I do? What do I do? Well go on, tell me? That son of a bitch upstairs thinks it's okay to take away the only woman I truly loved. Yeah, I'm a minister, I'm supposed to love all my followers. But I don't give a rat's ass about them. They're just fools who happily hand over their money for the promise of an imaginary redemption. As if God even exists. And if he somehow does, well he can go fuck off in my opinion. ” The rabbi and bartender were stunned silent. The bartender cleaned some glasses, while the rabbi carefully sipped his first beer. “ What are you fuckers here for? ” the minister asked a couple minutes later, two beers and a tequila shot down the hatch. “ Ironically enough, I caught my wife cheating, ” the rabbi said. “ Oh, really? ” the minister asked. “ She doesn't realize that I did yet, ” the rabbi said. “ But it's all on tape. I'm going to kill the guy. That's why I'm here. One last good drink before I go bat shit crazy and kill this guy. ” “ And you, oh great priest? ” the minister inquired. The minister was well into his third beer, the rabbi's beer nearly finished. “ The bartender here is a good friend of mine and thought that you might need someone to talk to, Mr. Minister, ” the priest replied, still not drinking anything. “ Do you think the guy fucking my wife even knows who her husband is? ” the rabbi blurted out. He gulped down the rest of his beer. “ I'm not sure how relevant that is, ” the priest replied. A few seconds later he was lying on the floor, the rabbi's punch having connected with his jaw. “ I know I should be all, don't do this, don't fight, but I got to admit, this is pretty entertaining, ” the minister commented, starting on his fourth beer. “ Bartender, $ 10 on the rabbi. What do you say? ” The bartender didn't reply as the rabbi and priest fought. The priest pulled on the rabbi's beard, the rabbi connected a few solid punches. A few minutes later the three holy men walked out of the bar, the rabbi and priest sporting some black eyes, carrying the minister who was too plastered to walk. They stared up at the starry sky. The minister wondered if God was even up there. The rabbi thought of how he had stooped so low as to beat up a priest. And the priest merely thought of the rabbi's wife's bare chest, and smiled, realizing he had gotten into the wrong line of work. “ May God smite us all! ” the minister yelled half drunkenly, half sarcastically. They would be the last words he ever spoke as the lightning struck him, spreading to the other two men holding him. The minister's last thoughts, along with all the ones on pain, were: *Shit. Is God actually real? Also, how awesome is it if he is, as I just smote us all. Pretty badass. And maybe I get to see my wife again, or at least I never have to think of her again. Doesn't matter; the pain will be gone soon. * -329",0
"Prompt: You are Waldo. What 's your story? Why are you hiding? Story: She looked at me with doe eyes hidden behind thick half moons perched on her broad nose. A smile erupted from her lips as she said my name. I hadn't found her, she had found me. I fell for her instantly. For two years we did puzzles together, went on adventures, played board games, and wrote post cards. She seemed to love post cards almost as much as I did. Two years goes by quickly when you're having fun. It all seemed like one magnificent blur. One morning when I woke up she was gone. I hunted high and low for any sign of her. Just as I had given up hope, a drumming knock came from the door. “ Hello! ” I said, opening the door without waiting for a reply. “ Oh, I-um- ” “ Hi! You must be Wally! ” she exclaimed familiarly. “ I'm sorry, do I know you? ” I asked. “ Oh, that's right! Silly me, ” she said, playfully hitting herself atop the head. “ I'm Wenda, Wilma's sister! We're twins! Can you believe it? ” I was speechless. She seemed like my Wilma, but they were not the same. There were so many little things about her from the way she spoke to the way that she smelled that set off alarms in my head. My perturbation must have shown on my face as she slouched and backed away a little. I tried to hide it as I welcomed her into my home. She had found me, it was the least I could do. Finding me wasn't an easy feat. We talked and joked and played, but it wasn't the same. I missed my Wilma and seeing her sister only reminded me more of that fact. Wenda didn't know that her sister had gone missing, nor did she seem overly concerned. I was trying my best to hold together the broken pieces of the facade that held back the welling flood of distress within me. I would give up everything just to touch her again, to hear her say my name. Though I had my friends and fans, I had never felt so alone. Each night brought memories of our time together until there were no more to explore. In their place, my mind made new recollections. As I searched high and low for her, the past began to muddle in my dreams. Wenda and I began a relationship soon after. I hadn't stopped looking for Wilma and her sister was the only thing I had left of her. I clung to her for support as I shied away from the world. I didn't want them to see me, not like this. They wouldn't understand. I hid my pain behind a thin smile as my tears soaked into the pillowcase at night. More and more people began to search for me, but I didn't want to be found. Why didn't they search for Wilma? She was the one that we—no, I—needed to find. I wanted to know that she was alive, that she knew how I felt somehow. I wanted to spend one last night where I didn't miss her, to have her by my side. -305",0
"Prompt: God of the dead river. Story: **"" McGuyver, this is your wake up call. Apartment 1424 is raining. ""** I rolled over and looked at the clock. 6:47 AM. One day I would hear my alarm. One beautiful day. Not today. **"" Hey Guy! Wakey wakey- rise and shine! ** Lurching out of bed, I grabbed the radio. ""I'm up, Clyde! 1424 is leaking, got it."" Clothes. Toolbelt. Radio. Really long rubber gloves. Car keys. Yep, good to go. Pulling up to building 14, I parked my golf cart next to the curb and headed up to the second floor. Ms. Olsen was waiting for me at her door, still in her nightgown, and looking upset. She pulled me into the hallway and her office to show me the water running down the walls and onto her desk. She was never very talkative, but she seemed to be doing well, even in the years after her husband passed. I excused myself, having seen the problem and figured out the source, and headed up to the third floor. When there was no response from knocking on 1434, I found the right key and slowly opened the door. ""Maintenance! I'm coming in."" The sun had started rising by now, but as my eyes adjusted, I saw the lake in the hall. The toilet in the halfbath was overflowing and flecks of wet toilet paper floated along. Yep. The Copps had two small kids, and it appeared Jake had taken his toilet training a bit too seriously. Toilet paper goes in the toilet, so all of it should, right? After turning off the water, and with my gloves on, I reached in. As my fingers found the clump I whispered to it *Hey there, you don't really want to be stuck in there, right? You want to flow free through the pipes, and have an adventure, and get cleaned at the sewage plant! * It agreed, and I felt it dissolve. Ya'see, I'm a bit of a mage. I've always been able to talk to things, but unlike most people, for me they listen. It's not like I can do anything fancy, like shoot fireballs, or turn invisible, but I can hear the voices of your plumbing and talk the bugs out of walls. Nothing big, and nothing it wouldn't do, but enough to make a difference. I'm now the live-in repair man for Rushing River Apartments in the outskirts of the city. I may be biased, but I thought it was a nice place to live. RRA had staff who truly cared, was in a good neighborhood, and most of the folks there were happy and friendly. In part, because I kept their toilets working. Roger Copps was standing there in his boxers, wiping sleep out of his eyes with one hand, and holding Jake with the other. I explained what happened, and that it was fixed, and let myself out. Behind me I heard the gentle scolding start, that he was not in trouble, but he was going to help clean up. I reminded the building on the way down the stairs *You dont want to hold the water, it'll hurt your walls! Let it evaporate, * waved to Ms. Olsen, and headed into the office to start my day. Clyde was waiting with a cup of coffee, kuregg special. Someone had tossed it, but I had convinced the machine to work again, and we had much better coffee as a result. With a saunter, he headed out the door, my arrival marking the end of his shift. The day preceded as normal, paperwork, breakfast tacos bought from Mrs. Garza, more paperwork, called to fix something, ect. It was during my lunch break that I had first felt it. I had gone back to my house to lie in the ditch behind it, and enjoy the sun while I ate. A certain tang to the air, the birds were chattering too much. Some storm was brewing, from the direction of the city. I didn't know what trouble was coming, but something from the city. There was nothing I could do besides worry, so I put it out of my mind and got on with my day. It remained forgotten until neatly sunset. I was out driving the perimiter, looking for trash (I had had enough paperwork for one day,) when I heard two cars driving much too fast. As they zoomed passed, a bottle flew out one window and hit the second car. They careened into each other flying off the road into the ditch where I couldn't see. I heard yelling and cursing, a few thuds, then gunshots. I am not a very brave man, and fled at that sound, but not before I saw more cars, in the same two colors as the first two, and very heated arguments, between them. The next part.... I don't really remember. Or I don't want to remember. Or I can't forget. It's mostly a whirlwind of fear and violence. I ended up back behind my house, no idea what happened to the golf cart, but I was hiding where I had eaten lunch just a few hours ago. *help.... * I wasn't sure if that was my voice, or someone else's. How had I gotten into this, but I really needed some *help.... * Ok. That time I knew it was something else. *Hello? * I called. *I help.... you help.... * *"" Where are you? I can hear you, but I can't see you. ""* *woke by flow* I had a flash of a man bleeding out, under a car. *no other flow* *"" What are you talking about? ""* *I miss flow.... I help you.... you help me.... flow? *"" Umm, sure. If you can help me, I will help you flow. ""* *oath.... * *"" I, Guy Molloy, will do everything in my power to help you, if you will help me. ""* I felt a grin at that, and something swallowed me. I caught a glimpse of a long dragon, covered in rocks and branches, a bicycle wheel for one eye, and a stop sign for the other. Then, I felt the apartments. I could see the people running in terror from what I could now see as gangs, but I didn't stop to look. Doors jammed when they were tried, asphalt gravel found eyes. A hornet's nest I hadn't know about moved shop to someone's pants. Windows refused to crack. A tree branch fell. An AC unit exploded. As night finally fell, we had been saved. I scraped the worst of the mud off, and showered as the water whispered secrets into my ears. My last thought before I passed out was of the future and of promices. *I wonder who I should talk to. We could do with a water park around here. *",0
"Prompt: She opened the box; it was empty. Story: It was our 3rd anniversary and I didn't know what to get Emily, she was of a different breed. If I had gotten her flowers or jewelry it would have hurt her feelings. She was weird like that. She didn't go for ""normal""; those types of gifts were too impersonal for her. I had been searching in every little shop down the street I worked, yard sales, flea markets, rummage sales, thrift stores, and I even went dumpster diving behind a huge shopping complex. I hadn't found anything that was suitable for her. I had 1 day left before our dinner date. I ended up looking in what I swear is every single little store in the entire city. I left each one empty handed. I was on my way home when I decided to get something to eat. I was in the neighborhood to try a place my buddy had told about me recently and thought ""why not?"" I picked up a quick sandwich and headed back to my car when I saw a tiny store front in between a bar and a head shop. There wasn't a sign other than the neon ""open"" sign but something about to drew me in. The number on the door said ""one-hundred-one and a half"" I opened the door to the smallest store I've ever seen, the lights were dim and everything looked quite old. The walls were racked with furniture hanging from hooks, presumably to increase their storage spaces. Tables, chairs, armoires, and bookshelves climbing clear to the ceiling on each wall. Stacks and stacks of shelves and cabinets, every piece more intricate than the last.I must have stood in the doorway for 5 solid minutes just taking in the sight of all the beautiful things. I hardly noticed an old man had shuffled his way to me. ""We should have what you're looking for, Alex."" It didn't register to me that this man shouldn't know my name, I was being drawn into this place by something. I walked aimlessly to the back of the long narrow space. Along the back wall was an elegant display case that housed many small items, one in particular caught my eye. It was a small oval wooden box with an opal and wooden lattice design on the top. ""Did you find what brought you here, sir?"" The old man said ""Yes"" I replied, distantly. I don't remember paying for the box, or leaving the store.... Or driving home for that matter. I woke up from a nap I didn't remember laying down for. I felt like I had ran a marathon. I looked at my watch and it read 6:04pm OCT 17. I did a double take. The 17th? I'M LATE! I frantically search for my phone and hit Emily's number. ....... ""You have reach the mailbox of 3-0-4-1... I hung up and called back as I started running round my apartment getting dressed. ""hello?"" ""Babe!! Listen, I don't know what happened. I took a nap and forgot to set an alarm.... I'm on my way right now!"" I got to Raymond's just in time to see Emily slumped down at the bar, they won't even seat you until your entire party is there. I get to the hostess and tell her I'm a doofus and slip her a twenty and tell her to make it up for me. As I walk up to the table I remembered that I forgot to brush my hair. I pulled her chair out and see that I have on two different shoes. How does she love me? ""I'm sorry babe, I don't know what I was thinking. I have no excuse. Happy anniversary"" ""I wanted to be mad at you the entire time I sat here, but I knew you'd be here."" It almost hurt my feelings that she so nonchalantly acknowledges my chronic tardiness. Right when I was about to start apologizing again the server brought out a bottle of wine and took our orders. ""Shall we exchange our gifts?"" I asked with restraint. It was like the box was asking for me. ""If you want to, I'll go first."" She pulled an envelope out of her purse and slid it across the table to me. I peeled the lip back and saw two ticket vouchers. ""Those are worth two-two way tickets to where ever you want to go; I couldn't take your favorite part away from you."" She knew me so well. On our first anniversary we threw darts at a map of the state and went to all the places in a day. It's one of my happiest memories of all time. I pulled the box out of my jacket pocket. It was still in the bag I had gotten it from the shop in. ""You're quite difficult to buy for, you know that?"" She smirked and said ""you're the only person who has ever said that. I like everything. I'm not picky."" I decided not to roll my eyes and ruin the moment. I handed her the bag and she immediately lit up. She delicately pulled the box from the bag and took a deep breath. She didn't speak for quite some time as she admired the box. She traced the opal through the lattice work with her forefinger for a long while before she tried to open the box. The lid wouldn't budge. ""Funny truth: I didn't think to open it at all"" Emily shot up in her chair, she looked up at me like a doe in headlights and dropped the box onto the table all at once. ""W..what?"" She mumbled, shaking off her daze. ""I never thought to open the box"" ""It's quite lovely"" she said as she traced the opal again. ""I thought so to, it reminded me of you when I saw it"" She began tugging at the lid once more, this time much more determined. It wouldn't budge. She struggled for the remainder of the time we waited for our food. When it was finally delivered She barely ate. From the time she pulled it out of the bag she hadn't taken her eyes off of the box. ""I can try to ope..."" ""NO!"" I was taken aback by her quick, stern response. She looked up for the first time all evening to catch my face of confusion ""Sorry, it's just so beautiful, I don't want it to get broken on accident or something."" We finished dinner without having said much to each other, I didn't know whether to ask her to come over tonight or not. She seemed to be in a strange mood. ""Well, I have to work in the morning. I should really get going."" She said, as if she knew what I was thinking. ""Do you want me to drop you off?"" ""Yes, that'd be great."" I pulled into her parking lot and she didn't immediately reach for her door handle. ""Did you want me to come up for a bit?"" I asked. She smiled and tilted her head too far to the right. ""You're not getting the fucking box back, Alex."" Then she got out of the car, slammed my door with her foot and stomped up the stairs to her apartment lobby door. I sat there for a few minutes completely dumbfounded. What the hell is up with her? I couldn't read her all night. I decided to give her her space. I would call her in the morning for us to talk about it. Maybe she was more angry about me being late than I thought. I sent a ""good morning"" feeler text right at the time she should be leaving for work. I did not get a response. I sent a couple more cutesie emoji filled texts and still no reply. I decided to call her on my lunch break but her phone went straight to voice mail every time. By the time I got off work I started getting worried about her. Even when she is mad at me she's not so childish as to make me think something's wrong. I went straight to her apartment after work because I had a bad feeling. When I pulled into her lot her car was still the exact way it was parked the night before. I ran up the stairs and into the lobby. I should have taken the elevator but I was too impatient for it right now. I ran up 4 flights of stairs and started slamming my hand on Emily's door. ""Em!"" ""EM!"" I took the spare key from inside the birdhouse on her door wreath and opened the door. The entire apartment looked like it had been torn apart. Papers and cat food scattered the floor. Kitchen drawers were thrown about, their contents ejected across rooms. ""Emily?"" I said as I slowly walked through each room. It was a small one bedroom place. Her bedroom was in the back, as I came to it the door was closed but I could hear faint piano music. The door was locked so I started to pound on it yelling for Emily. ""Are you in there? Are you alright? EMILY?"" I decided to kick the door in. The sight I walked into was jarring to say the least. Emily had hung herself from the ceiling fan. In the pocket of her cardigan was a note that simply said ""once it's opened it must be filled"" the little box appeared empty but the most beautiful piano lullaby was emitting itself from within. As I picked up the box I could hear a faint screaming ""Alex! Alex! Help me"" I peered into the box only to see nothing inside. The box slammed shut and the music abruptly stopped. I pried and pried but the lid wouldn't budge. ""Alex, it is done."" The little old man from the little shop located at one-hundred-one and a half Loft street had walked into the room as if he'd been there all along. ""Excuse me?"" I said not really understanding. ""It is done. One does not wander into one-hundred-one and a half by mistake."" And just like that he was gone. And so was the box.",0
"Prompt: In the future, conventional birth is outlawed, and all humans are produced assembly-line style in factories throughout the world. You are a worker in one of these factories. Story: ""The face is upside down,"" chimed my supervisor as he peered through my armpit. ""Huh?"" I went as I turned around from the monitor and looked down at my slightly undersized boss. He pointed at the screen, tapping the head on the monitor. ""The position of the eyes and the mouth. Completely wrong."" I went back to look at Model # W2-288315 on the screen then tilted a bit to look through the actual glass screen separating my post from the production line, where xyr's headless body was suspended by robotic arms, dangling like a piece of meat, xyr's appendages hanging limply. I looked at the order queue for what xyr's parents wanted. It looks like they were being'avant-garde' and asked for a retro look for xyr's head. The look was rare nowadays, but not completely out of the ordinary. So I told my boss as he peered beneath his cup of coffee, ""They want to be avant-garde."" My boss grimaced, lowering his cup. He didn't take lightly the fact that his parents wanted to be'avant-garde' and reduced his height three inches from the norm. I was told by one of my gossipy co-workers it was an homage to an ancient character called Mini-Me. He turned and raised his steaming cup for another swill. ""Well, so long as the order is all properly documented, you can proc- uh-AAHHH! MY EYES!"" I watched as he had bonked his elbow into the frame of the door and the cup of coffee missed his mouth and fell into his eyes, blinding and scalding him all at once. He ran screaming back into the factory, co-workers rushing to towel off his reddened face. Shrugging, I went back to looking at # W2-288315 on the screen, sighing profoundly at the odd facial eyes-on-top design and approving the order queue for the head placement.",0
"Prompt: You gain a powerful superpower, but it comes at a great cost. Story: I sat on the floor of my tiny studio staring at my hands that were still shaking violently. I clenched my fists tight taking in a deep breath. ""Just a dream."" I said trying to calm down. I stood up and walked over to the pantry and found the last of my Jack Daniels. I put it into an Owl shaped mug and within a few swigs it was gone. I felt my eyes get tired again and laid on my bed. ""No dreams."" I said to my brain of course it didn't listen. It had been only a few months since I was approached by a homeless man who wanted to give me a ""gift"" for buying him a hot meal. Some gift. I hadn't slept in days and when I did sleep the dreams came. Horrible visions of what could happen not would but could. I could see the future but there were two flaws to this. The future wasn't set in stone so say someone wants to shoot up a school, they go to bed believing they are going to shoot up the school kill whoever then kill themselves but they wake up and something changes their mind, maybe they're favorite cereal was on sale, doesn't matter cause they choose not to shoot up the school. I get to see them actually do it, the people screaming for mercy, the jock pissing his pants when faced with death all of it. When this gift first happened I would cry wolf every time. Most of the time I was right but of course the media only got wind of when I was wrong and it wasn't long before I was written off as a crazy person who lucked out on a few right calls. The second was that the only time the dreams stopped was when I drank heavily, which made me develop a drinking habit that would put an Irishman to shame. I rolled out of bed seeing the clock say it was almost 10:00 am. I sat up and got dressed grabbed my wallet and started my walk to the store. I had moved twice since getting the “ gift ” and now lived off of whatever money my parents sent me. They were sure I was having a mental breakdown and forced to go to counseling to get their checks every month. My head spun back and forth as I made it to Albertsons. I filled my cart with Gatorade, bread, peanut butter, jelly, bananas and of course whiskey. I must have smelt horrid because people made sure to avoid me as I checked out. I walked out the store and walked through the parking lot. I didn't hear it but a car backed up beside me and bumped my hip. I turned and screamed at it. “ Watch where you're fucking going! ” I screamed. I looked at the rearview mirror and saw a set of very familiar piercing green eyes. I felt my heart sink and I dropped my bags. I wanted to be angry but the pure shock was still racing through me. He stepped out of the car and I barely recognized him. The skinny, smelly homeless man with a scraggly beard and stringy hair was now standing tall. His face was clean and he wore a polo shirt and jeans. “ Hello, Sarah. ” He said. He voice wasn't as raspy as it was and I swore he even looked younger. I felt the shock begin to wear off and rage replaced it. “ You! ” I screamed and ran at him. I grabbed his shirt. “ You fucking piece of dog shit! Do you know what you've done to me? ” I yelled at the top of my lungs. He wasn't fazed. “ Yes. ” He said. No remorse or guilt just a stern affirmation. I let him go and put my hand out. “ Take it back! I can't take this anymore! Please! ” I screamed. He sighed and shook his head. “ I'm sorry Sarah but no. ” “ Take it or I'll make you! ” I screamed. He smiled and laughed a little. “ Sorry but you can only receive the gift if you want it. I don't want it. ” He went to get back in his but I grabbed him. I fell to my knees my eyes swollen with tears. “ Please! I can't do this! ” I said. He pulled his arm away. “ You think you have it rough! I was stuck with that thing for five year! I lost my wife, kids, and job and was fucking living on the streets eating garbage! ” He grabbed me by my hair and tossed me away from his car. “ You've had it for five fucking months! You want to get rid of it find some sad sap to take it just like I did! ” He jumped in his car and sped away. I got to my feet and started walking. I felt my feet moving as I contemplated what he said. Was I willing to put this burden on some poor new sap? I got home with only the bottle of whiskey and sat on my bed. I walked to the medicine cabinet and pulled out a bottle of Tylenol and one by one took every single pill. I laid on the bed and started to cry not from the fear of dying, it couldn't be all that bad, but from relief that pretty soon it would all be over. My eyes finally grew heavy and I went into my dreamless sleep.",0
"Prompt: Desperate for research funds, a group of scientists created a highly lucrative, if somewhat embarrassing business. They now have to explain this to a senate committee. Story: Jim Hatterson looked upon the raised platforms and tables that the six senators were sitting. He was in great distress, as anyone could tell by the beads of sweat glimmering in the harsh lighting of the committee room. He knew he was in trouble, but to what extent, he couldn't say. After all, they don't subpoena you and your entire faculty of scientists here because they want to know how your dog is doing. It was nine o'clock when the senators finally sat down to start the hearing. ""Mr. Hatterson, I believe you know why we called you here today,"" said the frail senator from Ohio. ""I do,"" responded Jim. ""Look, we clearly instructed you that the polymer you were working on was only for weather balloons,"" another senator belted out. ""I know.... it's just.... we didn't quite have enough money to finish the project..."" Jim replied. His voice trailed off towards the end, however, another senator picked up his voice as soon as Jim's diminished. ""We gave you all the money you needed!"" yelled an older senator to the far right. ""And you.... you just go and decide to make it public?"" It was clear that Jim was in quite a hairy situation. However, he held firm and shot back at them. ""Look, Senator White, it's no secret that we needed more funding to complete the project. I just did what I had to do."" ""But this, Jim. I mean, this is too far,"" replied the Ohio senator. Jim held back for a minute, then released his next thought. ""Look, it's not like this was going to remain a secret forever. We in the lab saw that the weather balloon thing wasn't going to net us much in profit, so we..."" Jim was then interrupted by the Ohio senator. ""Goddammit Jim, fucking condoms?"" said the senator in a fit of rage. There were TV cameras there, no doubt capturing this moment. ""You took government funds. Funds that were clearly set aside to make higher rising weather balloons, and you decide to not only make a classified material public, you use it to make condoms?"" Jim said, ""I'm sorry senator."" He then leaned back in his chair. ""But you can't deny their effectiveness..."" he said, opening his palms out and shrugging his shoulders. He was interrupted by the Ohio senator again. ""ENOUGH!"" he barked out, no doubt exacerbated by the circumstances. There was a silence in the room after that. Nobody really knew how to follow it up. After all, having US government funds being used for condoms is not something one expects when they get elected to office. Jim broke the silence after it had gone on for 20 seconds or so. ""It appears this discussion has come to a head...""",0
"Prompt: here you stand, alone again, about to take your own life. Nothing is holding you back now. You decide to look around your room one more time until something catches your eye, and the impact it has on you stops you in your tracks and makes you realize why you ca n't do this to yourself. Story: The trigger of the gun felt cold against my finger. I knew it was time. Nobody was out there for me. Not even *I* was out there for me. I took a look around my old room, taking it all in one last time. Then I saw it. *That was 3 years ago. She doesn't care about you now* my mind reminded me. *But what if she does? * my conscience retorted. These thoughts glued me to the bed for a fleeting moment. ""What of she does?"" I wondered aloud. *She made you that man. Don't do this. TALK TO HER. * Suddenly, my arm buckled under the weight of the gun. I let it fall, resting it upon the bed. I stood up and, with tears streaming down my face, trudged over to the item on the table. It was a CD. It was one of those blank CD's you buy, and she had loaded it up with some music. I had never listened to it before. I figured, since it was the only thing that had ever been given to me, I'd give it a listen. I popped it out of the case, carefully, struggling not to break the disk. I laid it slowly into the slot on his CD player, and closed it by pressing the button. The first song was Goeillaz - Clint Eastwood. I liked them a lot at the time, but now had grown past them. I could still appreciate the fact that she included it though, and I suddenly felt great. ""Great"" was something I hadn't felt in a LONG time. I knew, right then, that I had to see her. ""What do you pack when you fly?"" I mumbled to myself. I'd never flown before, and would have to sell the car to buy a ticket. That car sucked anyway. A ticket to see *her* is all I would ever need. Or, so I felt at that wonderful, incredible moment. So, yeah, I flew to Chicago. I stepped out of the airport and was brought to my knees from the cold, cold wind. ""Holy Christ!"" I said a little loudly. ""Hello, tourist!"" a very flamboyant, smiling older gentleman said to me. ""Want a ride? My cab's right over there."" ""Y-y-y-y....."" ""Get in, kid."" The heat had been left on, and I could feel it right away when I stepped in. I looked to the thermometer on his dash. ""4 degrees!?"" I said, shocked, still warming up. ""Heh, that's not even including wind chill kid! So, where to?"" I took out the notebook with her info in it. ""45, 12th Street, sir."" ""No need for sirring, man. You call me Clyde. I call you....?"" ""Call me Kevin."" ""Alright Kevin, who is it?"" I felt like I'd been adhered to the seat of the cab with railroad spikes. ""Look, kid. I see hundreds of poeple every day. I've learned to..... read people. And you, well, I can read you like an open book. Let's narrow this down, shall we? Who is *she*? ""She's the only thing I have left to live for."" I said calmly. I could feel the warmth of the cab fade suddenly, Clyde slumping in his seat a little. ""Well, here we are."" he said *almost* unenthusiastically. ""You don't owe me anything kid. Good luck."" I went up her stairs, and knocked on the door. This was it, I told myself. One chance.",0
"Prompt: A hole in time and space opens up, and you see your younger self looking back at you. You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes. Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response. Story: Did that really happen? I knew it was coming, I was prepared for years, yet I still was panicking and stumbled over my words. That portal started closing immediately after it opened. Stocks, disasters and preventable wars. I had managed to fit that part of the message into a careful selection of words and ideas. I had unlimited power in my hands. I had a good 30 seconds left to fill it with any number of selfish and personal things I could have changed. My personal obligation to the world was done. About Vicky, how she tore our heart out. About Carlos, that backstabber. That summer with the red bike. I still have the scar. And yet, I stood there and said nothing. I thought I could change it. But I froze. At least, that's what I remember. That older me standing there. Just looking. Trying to form words. Spouting gibberish. That's what I remember. I thought I could change it. But then when the time came, I understood. If I changed things maybe this glimpse wouldn't happen. Maybe I would be different. Maybe it everything that happens is meant to happen and there's nothing I can do about it. Maybe the only function of this event was to cherish the moment. So there I stood, the same frozen statue that couldn't utter out a single comprehensive thing. I hope this young me didn't hate me like I hated the future me I saw the glimpse. But I knew the truth. He does resent me. And only when he gets to my point in time will he understand.",0
"Prompt: Write a journal entry for a child that has been abused ( mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, sexually, etc ) their entire life .... Story: Dear Diary, I slept well last night. ""Daddy"" didn't come back to the house until he was drunk enough to collapse on his *own* bed. At least one night of solace for me and the baby. That's what he makes me call him, anyways. Daddy. I don't remember my real father. He never came home from Iraq, so my mother told me. Probably why no one was watching me while I played outside that day, mother was at work. Autumn must be just around the corner because it feels warmer down here, Daddy must have turned on the heat because of the colder weather. Sometimes I can remember what it was like. Autumn had vibrant colors, golden, red, and yellow hues painting the trees as the leaves were bled of life. I used to gaze out the window as I read John Green novels, wrapped in my blanket and sipping tea mother had prepared for me, enjoying the agony of the leaves as they resigned to beautiful decay. I fell asleep early last night, or was it night? It might have been day, I don't know. I never know. Down here the only light I have is from this little bulb. Sometimes in the winter I touch it quickly to warm my hands. The pain is warming, it brings my fingers out of numbness. That is all I feel. Numbness. I probably look as I feel: a gaunt shadow, withered and sunken. There is nothing left. My only enjoyment comes from the quiet blackness that awaits in sleep, the silent oblivion. I didn't wake up in tremors last night. And even when I did wake up, there was a brief instant where I forgot who and where I was. I miss that feeling. I hope they find me.",0
"Prompt: The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Story: Mollu the Potter awoke early, as he always did, to greet the morning sun and thank the goddesses for another wonderful day. Taking care not to wake his wife, he got out of bed to put some wood in the kiln for another long day of pottery making. He gazed out at the pale orange dawn over Hyrule and reflected about how much had changed since the invasion. Sure, the royal family had been slaughtered mercilessly, but the Gerudo had also driven out those wretched other creatures from the land. Now that the Gorons were gone, great mining projects had begun in Death Mountain, turning Hyrule into a centre of industry and trade. Great factories had been built to refine the coal and iron from the mines, allowing for the construction of powerful machines and more bountiful harvests. The Kokiri were driven from the forests, allowing a booming lumber and construction industry to rise. With the Zora having fled following the death of Jabu-Jabu, the rivers had been diverted to aqueducts and irrigation, allowing for such bountiful harvests that Mollu's two daughters had never known hunger in their lives. *Ah yes, my family, * thought Mollu, placing a slab of clay on his potter's wheel and beginning to pump the foot pedal. Certainly the best part of the Gerudo invasion had been the sudden infusion of beautiful women into the land. Sure, they were a bit more aggressive than the Hyrulean women, but Mollu loved his wife Siv with all his heart. As he began to shape the wet clay into a pot, Mollu thought back to his early days as a potter, back when he was just an apprentice in his master's shop. He remembered the day *the boy* had arrived in the shop. Thinking it odd that someone so young should be interested in the fine art of pottery, Mollu had began to explain his wares to the lad. It was then that the boy drew his sword. Expecting a robbery or a murder, Mollu had shut his eyes in fear, but when he opened them, every pot in the store had been smashed and the boy was gone. Fearing his master's anger, Mollu quickly took pots out from the store room and replenished the storefront's supply. Right as he placed the final pot, he heard a faint jingle of the doorbell as the boy re-entered the shop. The boy drew his sword and the grizzly scene unfolded again. Mollu tried enlisting the aid of the town guards, but none would heed his pleas. Mollu and his master easily lost three months' wages that day. Even with all the joys and blessings his life now had, he would never forget that day or that boy's voice.... *KYEAAAH!! *",0
"Prompt: You have just been elected the president of the U.S only to learn that every President before you was actually a super villain, and always stopped by one man. The Prime Minister of Canada. Story: ""He's been elected, Prime Minister"" *Fuck, * I think. Not already. Our moose haven't recovered yet. The next NHL season is only two months away, so all of our best soldiers will be busy. *Fuck. * ""Fine. Round up the best of the best, they can afford to miss a day or two of training,"" I tell the young cadet next to me. *The next day* ""You guys got here quickly."" ""Well, it's an important cause. And like you said, we can all afford to miss a day,"" Crosby tells me. He's a good captain, both of his team and of the Canadian Presidential Unit (CPU, for short). What the CPU does, you see, is take down the president. Okay, not *literally* take down (though in some cases we did, okay, I admit it. JFK was assassinated by us, since he had a scheme in the works to take over the world), but to threaten the president (with death) and keep the CPU over his head the entire time. Thank God Obama had a change of heart towards the end. ""Anyways, sorry for this inconvenience, but I just want you guys to give him a scare. The new guy looks harmless enough."" ""No problem, boss."" I give them a smile, shake Crosby's hand and send them on their way. *In the president's office* ""OH MY GOD, SIDNEY FRIGGIN' CROSBY!"" *Sigh. * I think the Minister really overestimated this guy's threat level. Toews gives me a look that says ""it could be a facade, ya know."" I do *know, * but this guy seems just unfit to function on a day-to-day basis, let alone as president. Oh well.... *Hours later* ""CPU? So you guys are, like, soldiers, or something?"" So these guys think I'm a threat? Why would think that? Did they already tell me? ""FUC-yeah, yes, we're here because every president before you has been a *super villain, * if you can prove to us you're not, we'll leave and you won't hear from the CPU again,"" Crosby sounds exasperated. Toews is giving me dirty looks. Sharp just looks generally annoyed. Sharp pulls Crosby close and whispers something into his ear. ""How about an IQ test?"" Sharp suggests to me. ""Sure."" *Back at the prime minister's office* ""So he's basically retarded, is what you're saying?"" ""Yup. We have no idea how he was elected."" ""Okay, well expect an easy four years boys.""",0
"Prompt: It is a sunny day, you exit your apartment. Walking your way to your work. There is no one around. Suddenly a black van gets nearby you and its door opens. Two man -which wearing black suits, black gloves and black masks- grabs you and throws you into the van. Story: Black suits, blacks gloves, sunglasses, shoes and crew cuts is all I remember of them. I was just minding my own business, on my way to another dull day at work when I was, well kidnapped I guess. Before I could do much more than start to scream, a gag was stuffed in my mouth, and my hands and feet were bound. ""Lets go"", said a bland, accentless voice. Go where and with whom, I wondered, panic wanting to set in. But no, I must stay calm. Once panic got going, there would be no stopping it, and so I listened for whatever sounds I could. I guess the van must've been soundproofed, cause I couldn't hear a thing besides my heartbeat and breathing. The professionalism of these people let me know that they intended to keep me alive, at least for a while. In my mind, I said the directions the vehicle turned, and tried my best to keep my breathing even. I hoped my allergies wouldn't kick in, cause breathing through this gag would be all but impossible. Had I done anything to anyone, like pissed someone off? Made a discovery? Why was I being kidnapped, and where was I being taken. Several turns later I felt one of the men (I assume it was a man) push up my sleeve and then the bite of a needle. The world went hazy, and I guess I sort of passed out. When I woke, I was on a cot, and my hands were sort of free, although they were still tied to each other, they were no longer connected to my feet and they were in front of me now. My left ankle was attached to a leg of the cot, which was bolted to the cement. The cell, or whatever it was, appeared clean, as did my bedding. Well, I consoled myself, at least I won't get tortured here. A while later, I'm not sure how long a Styrofoam tray with mashed potatoes, bread, and some sort of mystery meat was passed through a slot in the door. There were no utensils, so I guess I had to eat with my fingers. Yuck. But, my stomach was growling, so I used the bread as a trencher and scooped up the potatoes the best way I could. The meat didn't taste too bad, but nor did it taste very good. I guessed it was probably cafeteria food. I sat after I was done eating, and tried my best to think of ways I might've gotten myself into this predicament. I'm 23, a college student, and when I'm not at class, I'm at work, a little grocery store run by my land lady. I could think of nothing at all, and gave up. I must've drifted off to sleep, because the next thing I knew, the cell door was being opened by two big burly men with crew cuts (the same two men, or different?) My right leg was once again shackled to my left, and my hands undone and redone in back of me. ""Move."" ""No need to be so polite,"" I snapped, in a bad mood. I thought I saw a ghost of a smile, a small twitch from the one I'd addressed, but then again, it might've just been my imagination. I was led to a windowless room with a table. ""Interrogation time?"" I got no response, which I'd half been expecting. ""You sure are a talkative bunch."" ""Quiet."" They shackled me to the table, then left. A while later the door opened again, and a woman with her hair in a severe bun appeared. ""Dorothy Anne Hayes. What a pleasure to see you again. I guess you don't remember the last time you ran away.""",0
"Prompt: Science and Magic are merely opposite sides to which the pendulum of time swings. It has leaned for the past few centuries towards the Laws of Science but even now it begins to return ever faster back towards the Laws of Magic. Story: ""Hey, was that store there yesterday?"" I looked up from my mug of coffee, and followed my companion's gaze across the street. He was looking quite intently at a rather odd-looking curio store stuck into the middle of the otherwise rather mundane strip mall. Sitting between a laundromat on one side, and a shoe store on the other, was a shop covered in odd runes, with glowing crystals, monstrous skulls, and stranger things hanging in the window. Of course, the *Grim Grimoire* wasn't new. The old store there had been around since at least the 70s. But there was no way that Mike could've known that. See, the *Grim Grimoire* was only visible to supernatural creatures: vampires, fey, dragons.... Mages like myself. ""Ahh, that? Yeah.... it's been there for years."" I tried my best not to let the surprise register on my face or in my voice. I've known Mike for three years now. Guy was a wizard with computers, it's why I managed to get my boss to hire him. He just, well.... he wasn't an *actual* wizard. Maybe.... maybe this was just a temporary rip in the Veil. Maybe some of the *Grim Grimoire*'s wards got scratched or something, so its illusions fell and mundies could see it. ""So anyways, back to what we were talking about earlier. You really think that our client needs that-"" ""OH HOLY SHIT!"" My attempts at redirecting the conversation was completely blown off course by the fact that an ogre had just appeared in the middle of the street. Well, not ""just appeared."" He'd been walking down the street normally, minding his own business, disguised as a human and all.... and then his disguise fell, and now people were running away from the 8-foot-tall behemoth standing among them. Once was odd. Twice, within seconds of each other? Something was going on here. Though a part of me was deeply tempted to go and help the poor ogre, I would probably be of more use to the other supes here in preventing the Veil here from falling further. ""I.... I need to check something,"" I smiled at Mike rather unconvincingly, standing up in a single, swift motion that, unfortunately, knocked my chair over. ""Lamar, what the heck is that?"" I looked over at the ogre, who was desperately trying to get away from the screaming people and, what was worse, the countless smartphones. ""A very bad day."" I turned and headed inside the coffee shop, making a beeline to the bathroom. I needed some privacy to work out the spell here. I'll admit, I cringed internally at the people gawking at the ogre's misfortune. You know, if it had been any other day, these mundies would have been completely oblivious to us supes, but apparently the world had different plans for us today. I fished around inside my jacket for my stick of charcoal as I entered into the washroom. First thing's first, a quick divination to determine the range of this breach. Then I can figure out who to contact to get a handle on this.... I think I still had that MIB agent's number on me. I quickly scrawled a few runes on an unmarked section of the tiled wall -- last think I'd want is to add somebody's witty insult to the sigil and proceed to turn my skin purple, or blow out the entire wall. A quick glance to confirm I scribed everything right, and then- ""Seriously, Lamar, what the hell is-"" Well, guess which genius forgot to lock the door? ""Lamar?"" ""Shut. The. Door."" I growled though gritted teeth. ""NOW!"" Thankfully, Mike wasn't an idiot and locked it as well, before asking ""Umm.... why are your eyes glowing?"" ""Because I'm in the middle of channeling a divination spell, so please be quiet!"" ""A *what? *"" ""Not now!"" I really couldn't handle any kind of interruption, not with my mind's eye pulling back as it did. Way back. Not the neighbourhood. Not the city. Not the country. The spell was showing me the entire damn planet aglow with magic. Well.... shit. This was a Class 2 Apocalypse scenario right here. ""Lemar?"" Well, hey, at least the powers that be had better things to worry about than me casting a spell in front of a friend and colleague! I let my hand drop from where it was pressed against the wall, and my mind's eye cleared, returning my focus entirely to one of the most ignoble places one could find oneself at the start of an apocalyptic scenario: a coffee shop bathroom. I sighed and I slumped down against the the stall's siding. Okay, where to start.... ""So.... umm.... man, I got ta ask this.... are you some kind of wizard?"" Well, we can start there. ""Yeah, actually, I am."" ""And.... and so was that some kind of spell?"" ""Pretty much, yeah."" ""And.... and all that stuff out there, in the street, that was actually magic?"" I tilted my hand back and forth. Not *technically, * but wasting my time explaining the difference between magic and other supernatural bullshit seemed a bit too academic at the moment. ""So.... so does that make me a wizard too?"" I looked up and stared Mike in the eyes. ""It took me a decade of study in my grandfather's basement pouring over the old books my ancestors started writing down back in New Orleans and Haiti, as well as a bunch of seriously dry theoretical crap written down by some of self-important sage back in Rome or Cairo or Shanghai some five hundred years ago before I could even cast my first spell, so what makes you think your punk ass could cast a-"" Wait.... the entire world aglow in magic. Shit. I grabbed Mike and slammed him against the wall, ignoring his protests, and scribbled a rune onto his forehead with my charcoal. ""WHAT ARE YOU-"" ""Not now!"" I growled, and lay my palm upon the rune, letting my mind's eye loose once again, this time sending it racing along Mike's own anima trail. A trail that was now brimming with potential, the kind only heard about in legends of the olden days, when the world was young and magic was everywhere. Well, shit. Mike wasn't a wizard, but he had magic. A lot of magic. And he probably was unique in that regards. I let the scrawny IT guy go and staggered back a bit, muttering under my breath. Now, to become a proper mage it took years of instruction and training to harness the thin strands of anima that was running through the human body. However, if every human was blazing like a ley line network, then all that training just went out the window. Talking to someone via a spell could actually be easier than talking to someone on your cell. I really wasn't certain I could handle the ramifications of that now. ""Okay, man, you wan na explain what that was?"" I sighed, once again, and shrugged. ""I was trying to confirm a hypothesis on how fucked we all are."" Well, that seemed to deflate Mike's attitude like a balloon. ""Oh.... uhh.... and?"" ""It's as if the Queen of fucking England was on the other end. It's a royal fucking for the entire world."" And now the poor guy was scared. I felt bad, but at the moment, I was bloody terrified. If there was any horrors around, they'd be having a feast.... if their feasting wouldn't reveal the fact that they're monsters who are suddenly surrounded by juiced-up humans. Yeah, okay, in that case might want to bump it up to a Class 3 Apocalypse scenario for horrors. And vampires. And all the other supes which relied on humans to live. Shit. But thinking about it.... right, if there was any place that would have answers to this, it'd be the Parliament. Now, to remember that inscription.... I began scribing the runes for fear and darkness and oblivion onto the wall with my charcoal. Now, these weren't very friendly looking runes, and Mike got the jist of them pretty quickly. ""Lamar, what are you doing?"" ""Right now, getting the hell out of dodge."" ""What?"" ""The world is probably going to Hell fast, and I need some answers. Thankfully, the place that has the best answers here isn't in this world, so we can fix both these problems here real quick."" There, I think that should do it! I placed my hand upon the wall, and muttered ""Open..."" beneath my breath. The tiles cracked apart, creaking inwards as if I had just pushed on a set of double doors. Black, billowing shadows oozed out of the door in the wall, wrapping around our feet, as a sense of existential dread pervaded the room. ""Alright, let's go,"" I said as I began to head on through to the other side. ""You know what, I think I'm fine."" Mike replied, making his way to the exit. I looked over my shoulder. ""Suit yourself, but when the bombs start falling, you can't say I didn't warn you."" Mike took one nervous look at the bathroom door, before deciding that maybe the billowing blackness wasn't so bad, and raced in after me. The door slammed shut behind him after he passed through, leaving nothing but black stone behind him, and oppressive darkness all around us. I scrawled the rune for light on my hand, and held it up, creating an impromptu torch, driving the gloom away. ""Alright, Mike. So, stick close, ignore the eyes in the darkness, and don't touch anything, okay?"" ""Where are we?"" I headed down the corridor, looking for any sign of direction to the nearest library. ""Think of it as the magical United Nations."" Though given how the mundane world had magic now, well.... Let's just say I hoped someone here had answers. Or at least a spare room I could crash it until this whole thing washed over. After all, the end of the age of magic through the supernatural world into turmoil for nearly a millenia. I really wasn't looking forward to what the end of the age of science heralded.",0
"Prompt: You 're walking down the street chewing a piece of gum when you accidentally swallow it. This starts a snowball effect that eventually leads to the extinction of the human race over the span of a day. Story: I was walking down the street today just minding my own business when I tripped over a crack in the sidewalk almost stumbling to the ground. Wow I thought that was a close one I hope no one saw it. I continued walking down the street when I entered the crosswalk I was almost hit by a car turning right that did not look for me. I yelled Asshole! and continued on my way. What a strange walk this has been already I was thinking when a red breasted black bird swooped down at me with the intensity of a mother bear defending her cub. I hopped to the side to narrowly doge the oncoming attack of the bird defending its nest when I bumped into the building next to me which caused me to swallow the gum that I was chewing. I tried to spit the gum out of the back of my throat but it would not become dislodged. I began to grow quite lightheaded from the lack of oxygen and I fainted to the ground. I woke up to President Putin kneeling over me with a whole bunch of photographers taking pictures. Apparently Putin had been driving by as I fell to the ground and he made the motorcade stop to help. Of course Putin travels with his own doctor, but he insisted in saving my life himself. This is very like him since he likes to prove to his people that he is a powerful leader. Anyways I guess he performed a tracheostomy on me even though it wasn't necessary to show how capable of a leader he was. I was rushed to urgent care to take care of the whole. In that hospital bed is where I witnessed the human race go extinct due to the fact that I swallowed my gum that day. Evidently President Putin was on his way to his first in person meeting with President Trump that day. His little show of saving my life though delayed him a bit and he was late for his meeting with Trump. Trump being Trump did not take kindly to this gesture and left the meeting without talking to Putin and tweeted ""Putin is a bad man. Russia not a good country. USA at war with Russia."" Putin did not know what to make of this declaration of war, on one hand it was over twitter and on the other it was the U.S. President. He tried to get a hold of Trump, but was unable to. Putin had decided that he must attack U.S.A first before they could attack him and he launched all of the intercontinental missiles that he had at the U.S. Trump got word of this and obviously launched them back at Russia, but not to be one upped by Putin he launched missiles at every country in the world. That is the story of how me swallowing my gum lead to the end of the human race.",0
"Prompt: Magic is discovered and it 's channeled with music. Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north lie the Metal kingdoms. Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc. Story: And here I was, alone. In between aal the countries in which powerfull spels were casted with the use of a guitar or violin, I sat looking at my keyboard. It was the only thing my father left me and boy was I glad he did. The powers of it were unknown, but many said it was one of the most powerfull instruments off all time. This was partly because almost nobody knew how to play it and partly because it could adjust itself. It was one of few instruments able to play more then 1 genre and with the few modifications I made, also perfectionise them. Ever since magic was discovered and people moved either towards the north for metal, or south for jazz, I was pretty lonely. As far as I knew nobody was left here. Somewhere in the middel of the globe, just above the equator, I was stranded as one of the few people who liked dance over anything. No guitars for me, just my keyboard and a computer. The edm and with that dance genre had, as far as I was concerned, pretty much died out. And for some reason I was glad it did. It gave a special feeling knowing you're one of the few people who could master so many powers using just 1 instrument. But it also feld strange, I couldn't really describe why, but it just did. Their was one occasion however, when I wasn't alone. An old man, coming from god knows where, showed up every now and then to teach me how to play the keyboard. He was always talking about how powerful I could be, how great the instrument was and so on. Though I never wanted to become powerful, really. I just wanted to play music and enjoy it. On the news there were many articles about great wars between pop music and country. I would give you the name of the countries, if I knew them. See, since the discovery of magic people started to worry about other things. Life as I knew it had suddenly been given up for the simple life of trying to learn to play some instrument so you could fight in some war. And with that came that places weren't devided by borders anymore and countries became meaningless pieces of land. The only thing that mattered now was to survive. after a few years, I had learned to play the keyboard, a war broke out between a group the alternative rockers just a few kilometers north and the soul Sisters about 3 kilometers south. Because nobody knew I excisted, they didn't really account for me being in the middle of their battleground. The leader of the alternative rockers, a man who looked as tall as a crane and as strong as a bear. He came to me and asked me who I was. I told him who I was and he was shocked to hear that I could play the keyboard. He almost seemed frightend. He soon left, but with that came a girl. She was not much larger then me and was dressed as if she were to go to a ball. Why she wore a dress was unclear to me, but it didn't seem very practical. Anyway, I told her the same and when I finished talking, she stared at me for a few moments and then left. A few days went past before the war started and both sides were pretty hesitating to go past my house. I didn't get it, what could 2 leaders of big clans have to fear of a 20 year-old keyboard player? I soon found out that war had changed too, the camps didn't go for a regular fight, but just started playing music. It sounded horrible, not because they were bad at playing their instruments, but because all sorts of music played at the same time. I tried al sorts of things to not have to hear the horrible sounds of war, but nothing helped. after a contineous and dreadful 4 hours of guitars, drums, cello's and saxophones, I completely lost it and went outside. The noises slowly started to get milder as I set up my keyboard and hooked up some speakers. I put on my headphones and started to play one of my favorite songs. It was a song I remembered from my youth and it meant a lot to me. for 1-2 minutes I was so concentrated on my music that I didn't see what the others were doing. When I finally looked up, I was filled with surprise to see both groups dance together! Nobody was playing an instrument, nobody was arguïng, everybody was just dancing to my music. It took me a second, but then I realised what the old man once said. ""Magic is strong, but music is stronger."" P.S. If you see a lot of mistakes, I'm sorry. I'm dutch and still learning English at school.",0
"Prompt: A close friend gets injured into a car crash and falls into a coma. The next Monday at school, a new person approaches you. This person acts like your close friend in every conceivable way, right down to the mannerisms and obscure memories that only you shared with him/her. What 's going on? Story: ""We still don't know if he'll make it. He's been in a coma since the accident."" Ever since my best friend Harry got into a car crash, I had been what the doctor might say. Harry had been my best friend since three years ago, and we had always done things together. But this past weekend, a drunk drive struck him on the way back from Pastures, the small, family-owned market across the street from our school. ""How long will he be in this coma?"" ""Indefinitely. Until we can find a way to restore his consciousness, he may be stuck in this state forever."" A tear dripped down the side of my face. *** The over the rest of the weekend, I didn't find much amusement in what I had normally liked doing. I didn't feel like answering writing prompts online or hanging out at Sky High with my friends. I didn't want to eat, and I stayed in bed all day. On Monday, I forced myself to get out of bed, with 5 minutes left to get out of the house, threw on first first clothes I saw, and dragged myself to school. I arrived at school seconds before the bell rang, entering the class with another student I had never seen before. The teacher began taking attendance. ""Marx, Christian"" ""Present"" ""Patil, Sean-Paul"" ""Present"" ""Pascal, Margaretta"" I had never heard this name before, and judging by the expressions as I glanced around the room, neither had anybody else. A high pitched voice from Harry's old seat behind me answered, ""Present"". *Hmm.... A new student? This far into the semester? * As if to answer my question, my teacher said, ""It appears we have a new student in our class. This is Margaretta Paschal. Margaretta, can you present yourself to the class?"" The same high pitched voice that had answered ""present"" a while ago spoke again. ""Umm..."" I noticed her eyes glance at me for a moment, and I took a closer look into hers. *Hazel eyes, long brown hair, plump breasts. Damn. But she's probably out of my league* She began to address the class: ""I'm Margaretta, you can call me Margaret, I just transferred to this school and hope to make a lot of new friends"" Margaret took her seat behind me. She passed me a note, which read: ""You seem familiar"". The note seemed to give me déjà vu. It was as if I had already seen it before. Then I noticed that it seemed to be in Harry's writing. ""Do you know anybody named Harry?"" ""Who?"" ""Nevermind. So you're new here?"" ""Yup. I honestly don't remember what my old school was like, though. I'm already getting a little paranoid that something's up with me."" ""You look like you're alright"" She blushed just as the bell rang to end the class for lunch. ""Hey, I don't really know anybody here, so do you mind if I sit with you at lunch?"" ""Sure."" *She definitely reminds me of Harry. Harry had paranoia. Harry also passed notes in class. What's going on? * *** ""Are you sure you don't know anybody named Harry?"" ""For the last time! I don't even know who Harry might be!"" Margaret answered, slightly annoyed, but with a faint smile on her lips. ""You know, there's this feeling in the back of my head, like I know you from some where"" She bit her lips. *Just like Harry.... * ""Maybe we went to school together at one point?"" ""Hmm. Sure"" I answered. ""Really? Maybe that explains why I seem to know you!"" ""What? Oh, no. I don't think I ever went to school with you"" ""Oh."" Her face fell. *Just like Harry, * I thought. Maybe this isn't too bad. I know what Harry likes, what he doesn't like. I might try something later on as an experiment. *** ""I'm going to get some starbucks right now. Do you want anything?"" ""Yeah. Can I have a-"" ""A caramel iced coffee with extra cream and cinnamon?"" ""How did you know? And you'll get a strawberry acai refresher?"" ""Just a guess,"" I responded. ""And how did you know what I was going to get?"" She shrugged her shoulders at me. Harry had also ordered a caramel iced coffee with extra cream and cinnamon. It was out thing to know each other's drinks. That confirmed it for me. Whoever this was somehow was exactly like Harry. From that moment on, I used Harry's likes and dislikes that I knew about in order to get Margaretta to like more more, and eventually asked her out. To this day, I have never revealed how I did it, and I haven't explored what caused Margaretta to be ""connected"" to Harry. Harry died a month after he had originally gotten into the accident, and at the same time, that was when Margaretta confessed that she liked me too. But my mom got into a car crash this morning, and our baby daughter was born last night. She has the same name as my mother...",0
"Prompt: NASA makes their Mars announcement. Turns out, they 've discovered the location of MH370. Story: When the announcement had been made, CNN had immediately fired Tapper, Cooper and the rest. They hired a couple of college kids, put interns behind the desk during prime time, sold off most of their equipment, started shooting in Wolf Blitzer's living room. They'd kept him on out of pity, poor guy had been in the Situation Room for so long it would be impossible for him to adjust to a new format. Plus, his presence lent a thin veneer of respectability to the whole operation. Very thin. CNN devoted its new savings entirely to getting its correspondents onto Mars. They changed their name to MNN, partnered up with SpaceX and milked their parent company for as much money as they could get. Amazingly enough, three months after NASA announced that the wreckage of MH370 had been found on Mars, CNN actually managed to land a bunch of interns -- and Wolf -- on the red planet. *** ""This is Wolf Blitzer with MNN, and you're in the Situation Room -- Mars Edition."" Wolf was ensconced in a thick spacesuit with'MNN' emblazoned on the front. Behind the graying anchor was a vast expanse of ruddy dust. The clear night sky above was speckled with stars. Mons Olympus could be seen towering in the background. ""We, ah, haven't built the actual room yet. But look! Isn't it beautiful anyway? ""Our lead story tonight is the discovery of the remains of MH370 right here on Mars. We'll follow that with a discussion of the MH370 flight, and end the program with some speculation about the Malaysia Airlines flight 370. ""Now, over to Andrea at the wreckage. Andrea, what are you seeing over there?"" The shot switched to Andrea the nervous intern, who was standing a few miles closer to Mons Olympus, near the wreckage of the plane. ""Thanks Wolf,"" said the nervous Andrea, even though the man had said nothing remotely thanks-worthy, ""What we're seeing here is the same as described by NASA -- it's the scattered remains of MH370 all right. How it ended up on Mars is anyone's guess. The other strange thing is, there's no sign of survivors. Perhaps they've wandered off?"" ""That's eerie,"" said Wolf, scrambling to fix the intern's absurd mistake. Maybe, given the intelligence of their viewership, they could actually play up the ""there may be survivors"" angle. ""So, you mean to say that there could be people out there on Mars right now, people who need help?"" ""It's more than likely, Wolf. And we're going to be devoting all of our coverage to the issue until then."" ""Thanks, Andrea."" *** The oddly-dressed woman and the man who'd been pointing the strange weapon at her gathered their belongings and walked away. Maybe he'd taken her hostage? With grim determination, the girl who'd been watching them from the hatch-door to her underground colony set out after them. These new visitors were strange, and she could not spot the wreckage of the plane they'd come in. Nonetheless, she would save that girl. It was what her great-grandmother would have done, no matter what got in the way.

"Prompt: Years ago, you made a deal with the Devil to be granted a single wish. All your memories of the deal were then wiped. Years later, your wish is fulfilled and you are about to find out what price your younger self was willing to pay to make it come true. Story: ""Everything was on the up and up. My future simply couldn't look any brighter."" Well, that's how these things go, the voice in my head told me. I looked into the mirror, bloodshot eyes and disheveled Mohawk hanging off my head. I was a god damn rockstar! Not in the conventional way. I was a Video Game designer, and a damn good one at that. It was all coming to fruition. I was head of a major build for a fantastic game, PC Enthusiasts were foaming at the mouth, and console peasants were screaming ""WHY NOT US OH CHOSEN ONE!"" Hell, I'd been having meetings with The Gaben himself the past few weeks. He's a laugh riot, kinda like ""Oh Africa, Brave Africa."" So why couldn't I sleep? Sure the crunch was on, but I was used to it. Sure, the heat was boiling, but there wasn't nothin' as hot as me, baby! I couldn't be stopped. Except for the damn scratching. There was a spot on my hand, not a large one mind you, but a spot all the same. Red, blood red, something must've bitten me. Wonder if the guys put something in my apartment again.... Nah, couldn't be. I fired all those guys, and hired a whole new art team. It needed to be done. Still, that little voice in the back of your head sibilantly whispering every comedown it could. Except, it wasn't trying to bring me off Cloud 9. It was more a ""32nd and ground floor"" kinda voice. I looked into the mirror, and the mirror looked back into me. Deep. But it didn't take the mirror long to see through my BS, I was a pretty shallow character. ""In the end, we all dry up eventually,"" my reflection told me, a cocky smile on his jerk face. I stared at him, at me, at us, at the dick in the reflection, however you want to picture the scene. ""No, I don't think that's true. We get washed up, sure, but drying out? Only if someone hangs you."" My mirror laughed at me. The gentleman there pulled out a rope and started fiddling with it. ""Fortune, power, success.... They all leave you eventually."" I shook my head. He was obviously wrong. It was like he didn't even know me. Hell, I didn't even know me! The knots in the mirror got a whole lot clearer, the rope taking form. He was good at what he did. Well, of course he was. He's me, and I'm fucking amazing. Overnight success, I sold ideas worth millions, and God damn I wish my hand would quit itching. Looking down, the hempen rope I keep around was turned into a really, really nice noose. I mean seriously, high quality craftsmanship. ""Color me impressed,"" I said to the douchebag in the mirror, ""Really, didn't even know I knew how to do that."" The mirror gave me a sidelong glance and a shrug of his shoulders, ""It's what I do."" He was relaxed and mixing a cocktail. Why he was putting pills in it was beyond me. ""Shaken, not stirred."" he said and went to pass it to me. I look down at my out stretched hand offering myself a drink. Must be something in the water. Or they put something worse than last time in my apartment. Nooses like party streamers were hanging from my rafters. I must have been much more out of it than I thought. I mean seriously, where the hell did these bones on the floor come from? I don't have a dog. And they look way too human for my taste. Perhaps I got a cannibal werewolf roommate? Nah, that's just way too out there. Besides, I was rich! I wouldn't have a roommate! But wait.... I did. Ah, speak of the devil, here he comes now. ""Fantastic party last night."" I said to myself. I have no idea how. A mirror reflection, but much more handsome. ""Huh?"" I didn't remember a party. He strolls over to me, across splintered bone and torn up hardwood floor; Hell of a dog it seems, and pats me on the shoulder. ""Almost time! Cheer up!"" I look at myself, deep in the eye, and wonder why my hands itching worse now. ""Ah, don't worry about that. You'll forget it's there."" I glanced up from my hand, intent on making a snide remark. ""What? Like the dog?"" NotMe laughed, and said ""There's no dogs, silly! I said ""Out damn Spot"" and he went home. You should be headed home soon too..."" I stared at the impostor, dumbfounded. ""I am home."" The doppelganger laughed, all too damn suave for his own good, ""Well that's simply not true. You were here for a short term lease,"" he lead me over to the window. I had a fantastic view of the fountains in the square, but from way up high. The carbon copy looked out the window with me, patted me on the back, and said ""And to think, you had all of this, and gave it up."" The fountain was getting closer. And closer. I didn't know how, but at least my hand stopped itching. I got one last closeup with my reflection, who winked at me and said ""Time to remember your end of the bargain."" I did, I remembered it all. When I signed the paper in blood.... It ended with a splatter.",0
"Prompt: Villages are laid to rubble and countless lives are ruined ... all over a bag of chips Story: Three hundred years. So long since the last Weaver stalked these lands. Three hundred years, these *weaklings* had lived without terror. But Kasak would end that. Mortals needed to be dominated, there was no other way. Once they had called him the god of balance. All those years ago when he had blessed the people with magic. He thought they could re-establish the Balance but how wrong he was. The northern mortal had ensured that balance would never exist. He stole the magic, used it and tipped the scales. Kasak would fix that. But first he needed the gem fragments. He had searched for these three centuries for the tiny chips. All of them combined would fit in the palm of a mortal's hands and their power would last just seconds. But now that he had a mortal form - a stinking, fleshy mass that they called a body - he could finally *hold* those chips and draw more power from the other mortal's blood. Kasak cursed Athansan. A thousand years ago things seemed much easier. Athansan - the god of life - trusted Kasak, they were close to Unifying, giving Kasak control over Life but then Athansan Sharded himself. But it wasn't like the first time, the shattering. There were no Gifts left to be found by mortals. Athansan Sharded himself so completely that the Gift itself was shattered, spreading specks across the universe. Specks that were ingested and consumed by unwitting mortals and hence magic was born. Kasak thought he could control that, using his Influence he goaded the priests, controlled them and gave them the ability to use the power they had accidentally consumed. But the priests were dead now. The people were too. At least all of the ones that Kasak had come into contact with. He may be in a mortal body now but he still had his Influence and with such proximity making mortals kill each other was easy. The true challenge had been to find the chips. He had razed two entire cities - or made the inhabitants do it for him - and cleared out numerous villages. Even now the stench of smoke clung to his body's clothing, the pungent scent intoxicating his senses. He had lived as a god for far too long, now he was repulsed by what he once was - a man. He approached the ruins of the city. The first he had razed. He thought the priests had known where the gem fragments were but they had all died screaming in denial. He now realized they had been telling the truth. No-one knew where they were because no-one knew they existed at all. Kasak walked through rubble strewn alleyways. Once they were streets with buildings on either side but now they were just trenches between piles of brick and burnt wood. Flies were a constant annoyance, their brains too small to Influence, he simply tried to ignore them. They hovered around bodies long since decomposed. Red and brown stained bones were all that remained now. The city's palace was ahead now. Kasak was grateful for his own reluctance to have it destroyed. These people had worshiped him and built the palace in his honor. He relished that idea and had Influenced the people to leave it mostly intact. The doors were missing though, so he strode straight into the large reception hall. Kasak trudged deeper. His mortal feet aching from the weeks of travel that had led to this moment. He strode into the catacombs. Numerous caskets made of heavy stone lined the walls but one stood in the center. The Fulcrum's tomb. Kasak had coined the term, referring to the way the mortal tipped the scales. His real name was lost to eternity. With more effort than he imagined possible, Kasak hefted the lid from the casket. Nothing more than a skeleton in armor remained. A skeleton bigger than even Kasak had imagined. Standing as a mortal this skeleton seemed so.... wrong to Kasak. Nearly twice his size all things considered. Regardless, the cold dead bones held what Kasak sought. A rotten leather pouch clutched between rotten finger bones. Kasak snatched the back and felt the pulsing gem chips within and he laughed. Now he just had to find some remaining mortals to drain and he would have limitless power and limitless blood gems in which to store it.",0
"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear E, I saw a picture of us the other day from the time we reconnected as more than friends. I wanted to get in touch with you, but you've deleted your Facebook and changed your email address. I tried looking for you online but I don't even know if you're still working where you were before. It's been several years; maybe you've left Austria. My mind runs to memories, lapping at them like a puppy. It was only a conversation or two after that night that we realized that we'd been attracted to each other for years. I still have trouble believing it. You always seemed to have this way about you, with your fierce intelligence and strong sense of self. Me? I was always his little sister, and felt like I lived in the shadow of that title. I'm glad you saw me as more. I have this one image of you from when we were kids, leaning over your guitar and tuning it to Blackbird. You were -and still are, I'm sure- so magnetic. You were so proud of the culture we shared. I loved that about you, and your incredible memory for history. Thinking about it now, that could've subconsciously pulled me to study it in college. If that's the case, I'd like to thank you for that too. You picked up so many things so rapidly and it made me want to achieve more for myself as well. I wish that we'd been able to run off for a weekend like we'd talked about after reconnecting. Still, I'm glad we had that one time together. It meant so much to me.... And feeling the culmination of the years was beyond anything I'd experienced. Despite it being only an hour or two that we could share, those moments have been imprinted in my memory since. Thank you. I know it was a fantasy fulfilled for both of us. I hope you know that those brief hours are still cherished. I wish I could talk to you. Not knowing what's going on in your life makes me imagine all the things you could be doing these days. Having no idea how to reach you, I'm left to wonder. I hope whatever you're working on is making you happy. Your eyes are even more beautiful when you're smiling. Fondly,",0
"Prompt: Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You do n't. Story: 17 years, and 364 days had passed since David's birth. I grew extremely anxious and stressed more than I ever could. What could be more stressful than never receiving your child's 18th year letter? David sat across the room. He was reading a Calvin and Hobbes comic. His father had left the day he was born, and I never knew why. But that never bothered David. The boy still adored going through his father's wares. Books, comics, video games, tools, DVDs, computers, clothes.... David studied his father more than anything in the world. I softly cleared my voice. ""Davy, sweetheart, do you want some tea?"" David didn't look up from the comic. ""Sure thing momma. Can I have some green tea, with some milk and honey in it?"" I always loved making tea for David. ""Sure thing Davy"". I reached for the cabinet with the tea when suddenly there was a knock at the door. ""Davy can you get that?"" ""Yes momma."" David ran to the door. Odd. David never ran to the door. He opened the door. ""Davy sweetheart, how much sugar did you want?"" The wind scratched the door on it's way in. ""Davy?"" I walked toward the door. I heard the door swing gently as the breeze pushed it open. I looked outside. Nothing. No car. No shoes. Just footprints from the grass. But they only pointed one way though, towards the porch. I saw a letter on the porch. And on it was David's handwriting. I opened it up and there was a small note inside, a key, and a flare. The letter read the following: ""Dearest Momma. Daddy came by and needed my help. I knew this day would come so I wrote this letter ahead of time. I'm sorry I won't be having tea with you right now momma. But you can come see us. Head to Old Glimmer Road and get to that old shed with the lock. Open the lock with the key and head inside. Light the torch, with the door closed, and hold it in your right hand. Papa and I will be on the other side. Best of luck Momma. We'll be waiting for you there.""",0
"Prompt: It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter. It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back. It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals. And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... Story: Dear Santa: I know you mean well, but I'm kinda tired of clothing and oranges. Don't get me wrong; of course, I'm happy to get anything at all. But you see, I really just don't need any more jeans, I've hardly worn down the one's from two years ago and I don't expect to hit my big growth spurt anytime soon. (Unfortunately, my 6-year-old body hasn't caught up with my 8 years of life experience yet and I don't expect it to for a while.) What I'm getting at is that I'm in need of something a little bit more mature. I think this year the best thing you could do is give me some advice on how I can get this girl Penny to go out with me. I don't know but I expect to see results before the 25th otherwise there will be no cookies. Yours, John Braken P.S. The last statement is not a bribe or a threat. You can look at it as more of an incentive or reward. John, I'm glad you wrote me. It get's pretty lonely over here and I often feel a bit stir crazy because I never get to seen any of that lush greenery you take for granted. All my surroundings are gray and everyone wears the same outfit. A guy can only take so much of the same every day. I only get to visit once a year. Imagine that!? So, I'll take you up on the offer but only so long as you bring the cookies to me. Deal? Now, as for the clothes and oranges. I have no idea what's up with that. As for the girl, I can tell you right now, I have some great advice to share with you and I'll start with this: Fedora. Girls love em. Now beyond that, I'll need you to fill me in on the details. What's she like? What's she look like?;) What's the status between you two? Have you talked? Does she even know who you are? Etc.... Regards, Santos Dear Santa, I couldn't be more pleased with this turn of events! I'm happy work something out with respect to this arrangement, however, I believe we'll have to debate this a little more. I don't think my mom would be able to drive me some where so far just to give you cookies. Plus, do you really want just anyone knowing where you live? I mean, think about the repercussions. I think it's in both our best interest that we consider this further. Penny! What can I say? She is beautiful! she has long brown hair, honey colored eyes, cinnamon skin and the most wonderful smile you've ever seen. She is really nice most of the time but she can be really bossy. And she's very smart. We talk at school sometimes but I don't know if she likes me. She's taller than me. Does that matter? Look forward to hearing from you! Yours, John John, What a relief it was to receive this letter in the mail today! We all have to share in the labor around here and today was my day doing laundry. It was so boring and I almost lost it folding all those little identical uniforms. It reminds me of the fact that I don't get to see anyone except these fools all year round well until that one special day a year. I can't imagine it's that far for your mom as I imagine these are some special cookies. I wouldn't worry about the media. But if it's too far for you, what we can do is have you send those cookies to a P.O. Box (address on the back) where my guy on the outside can get them to me on the hush-hush. Let me know if that works for you? Penny, wow she sounds like a real goody-two-shoes. Maybe she's not the right girl for a guy like you? But, don't let my pessimism hold you back. Either way, no girl has ever turned down Santos. I can help you get any girl you could ever dream of. Now, about that fedora, did you get one yet? Regards, Santos Santa, I'm glad I can be an encouragement to you considering what you do for so many of us out here. You're a real inspiration and you don't get the credit you deserve. It's just too bad most people don't really even know how big of a deal you are or that you even exists.: ( I'll send the cookies to the P.O. Box. Let me know what you think of them? Also, Just curious: why don't I just send the cookies to the same place I send my letters? Also, how do these get to you at the N. Pole If the address is a US address? This seems super complicated. I like Penny. There's something special about her. When she looks at me I just know she's the one. Now, what's something I can do now to get the ball rolling on this? Cause, see, I'd love to send you those cookies! ☺ Yours, John John, Nice to hear from you again! Especially today of all days, it's my birthday. Ok, yeah, let's get this ball rolling. You need to claim the girl as yours whether she likes it or not. You take what you want. That's what real men do. Second, you need to scare off any other guys who might be interested in her. You need to get tough. Use physical aggression and violence as much as you can and never fight fair. Do you want her or not? Then you need to just take her. She's yours for the taking. Let me know how it goes. Looking forward to the cookies. Regards, Santos P.S. You could become a wonderful rapist one day if you let me help you along the way. I'd love to mentor you. Let me know what you think. Santa, Boy, did that advice work or what!? Wow, you know what you're talking about. I'm sorry it's taken me so long to reply; I've been enjoying the benefits of your guidance. I never thought being a tough guy would be so nice. Now It's my turn to keep up my end of the bargain. I've sent the cookies as we agreed. I hope you like them! They're made according to my mom's special recipe. I love rap. I've always thought how great it would be to be a rapper when I grow up. I just don't know if I could really do it. I mean besides that, my parents don't think it's a good idea either, they say It's not a respectable career. I'd love to learn more. Looking forward to your next letter, Yours, John P.S. Why do you spell your name like that? I always thought it was Santa.",0
"Prompt: An alien race starts to colonize Mars. They completely ignore humanity on Earth and just go about their business. Story: The first indication something was going on was Europa breaking up. The moon had held our interest for a number of years now, as it had been composed primarily of water. Sure it was intensly cold, and carbonated water, but it was liquid water. But then over the course of three weeks in a sunny July the scientists at NASA had watched their monitors in awe as the moon broke apart. The chunks seemed to hang in the sky of their mother planet for a day or two and then, to the shock of all watching began to move out of orbit and into deeper space. The headlines spread across the globe, mystery in space, rogue planet!, everyone was watching as the chunks or ice and rock slowly made their way across space and began arriving at mars. It was breaking so many laws of physics that a few noted physacists killed themselves in disgust. The chunks slowed as they approached mars and then settled into a lazy orbit. Every human on the planet that had so much as aset of binoculars was trying to look at what was going on in mars. The first smaller chunks bagan to crash themselves into the red world. The imacts were fast, but not fast enough to be catastrophic. The heat was just enough to melpt the ice chunks. After a month of the small chunks being broken into the atmosphere the landers saw what no one thought they would ever see. It was raining on Mars. All the soil samples, all the atmosphere gauges, they all had to be re configured. The atmosphere on mars was getting warmer, it was getting wetter, and the equipment wasn't designed to deal with that. The planets mass had grown in accoradance with the additional bulk from europa. The gravity was almost earth normal, and the temperature ranges were starting to normalize along earth lines. Earth finally had a sister planet, a true second blue gem in the heavens. The celebrations didn't last long. There had been plans on sending seed pods to mars, to kickstart a new eden.... but someone else beat us to it. The long black ships began appearing as soon as the tectonics settled down. The ships zoomed across the face of the new mars spraying an aerosol that was rich iwht nutrients, and strange alien seeds. Within a week grass was growing across the fresh fertile martian soil, and what looked to be the beginings of alien trees were appearing. They never contacted us. They never made an attempt at our already suitable planet. But Mars was theirs now. It's been 10 years. there are gleaming crystal cities on Mars. There are orbital bases, and 2 artificial moons. We estimate the alien popuation in the trillians. No contact is ever made. we can listen to their broadcasts, we can watch their entertainment, but all signals from earth are ignored. We have sent probes, we have sent landers, but all are shown the same indifference. The last mars lander we sent sat in what appeared to be a farmers field for six months. The strange green 4 legged farmer ignored the probe and simply worked around it. Moving the probe into the town produced the same results. the strange advanced aliens simply ignored humanity.",0
"Prompt: Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate. Story: The first time I met Chuck, he was sitting in front of the television playing Super Smash Brothers with my lucky orange controller. ""Who are you,"" I asked, ""and how did you get into my apartment?"" Chuck looked fundamentally stumped. ""Uh,"" he said, ""I'm Chuck, and I live here?"" ""No you don't. This is my apartment. This is a -- it's a one bedroom apartment, man! You expect me to believe you've been sleeping under my bed for the past two years? Get out!"" When he gaped I could see the dangly thing in the back of his throat. ""My -- my name's on the lease, man,"" said Chuck. ""And my name's on the Magna Carta,"" I spat, yanking the chair out from under him. ""Get the fuck out, man! I could call the police for this!"" He rolled up in a ball on the floor, lower lip quivering lugubriously, rocking back and forth with his arms around his legs. I threw up my hands and went to get the landlord. ""So you're saying, hmmm,"" said the landlord, whose name was Dave, and whose particular verbal tick was to speak with his lips very close together to hide his horribly crooked teeth, ""that there's another person, hmmm, in your apartment?"" ""Honest to God, Dave. He's got one of those mental disorders they put you in the looney bin for. Narcolepsy, or whatever. Will you come take a look with me? He seems harmless enough. But I want him out of the apartment."" ""Doesn't it seem like a task for the local constabulary, hmm?"" I scratched my neck. Calling the cops was out of the question, considering the weed farm in my bathtub. I'd convinced Dave, who was no more familiar with marijuana than he was with the breeding patterns of the Norwegian Spacklethrush, that the farm was a science experiment. I was a hobby botanist, I told him. ""Nah, man -- I don't want to call the cops on him, I just want to clear him out, you know? Come on, Dave! Do me a solid here!"" He came along at last, but by the time we reached my apartment, Chuck was gone, leaving no sign that he'd ever been there. Even my lucky orange controller was wrapped up in its cord the way I'd left it. ""I'm sure he'll stay away,"" said Dave, patting my shoulder before he left. I resolved to make sure I always locked the door and tried to put the whole incident behind me. For a couple weeks it was smooth sailing. Then I flicked off the lights one night and slid under the covers to discover Chuck already in there, snoring, a dribble of spittle attaching his mouth to my PILLOW! I leapt back out of bed, tore the blankets away, ran over and turned on the light, ran back and snatched my pillow out from under his blocky head, ran into the kitchen to grab a knife, then ran back to stand in the doorway, dizzy from all the cardiovascular exertion. ""WHAT THE FUCK,"" I screamed, brandishing the knife in one hand and the spittle-dampened pillow in the other, ""ARE YOU DOING IN MY BED?"" Chuck stared at me, horrified, his mouth a gradually widening crescent. A noise began to escape his throat -- an ""eeeee"" sound like a leaky bagpipe being played several miles away -- that gradually broadened into a full-bodied sob. ""EEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeEEEEEEEeeee,"" he wailed, clutching himself into a ball again. I ran to the kitchen and fumbled with my phone. ""DAVE,"" I said. ""HE'S BACK, DAVE! HE'S IN MY BED! DAVE!"" When Dave arrived, the sobs had abated. I stood in the kitchen, gripping and re-gripping the knife. ""What's this about, hmm?"" asked Dave, perturbed. ""I was fast asleep, you know."" ""I know, I know, but look, LOOK just COME, COME HERE --"" I put the knife down on the counter top and dragged him to the bedroom. We stood in the doorway looking at Chuck balled up on the bed. ""Well?"" I said. Dave appeared to be speechless. ""I don't get it,"" said Dave after a moment. ""You pulled the sheets off your bed?"" I looked at Dave. I looked at Chuck. I looked back at Dave. ""What?"" I squawked. Dave turned to me, compassion in his big brown eyes. ""Are you alright?"" he asked, softly. ""Is there something going on that you'd like to talk about? Because, hmmm, I am here to listen."" I was about to snap a curt reply when I became aware of a noise I hadn't heard before. Chuck.... was laughing. A deep, slow sound, the voice suddenly several octaves lower. He was no longer curled up in a ball. Now he sat on the edge of the bed, head tilted downward, eyes lasered in on me beneath craggy brows as if Dave weren't in the room at all. ""Surprise,"" rumbled Chuck, and shook with chthonic laughter.",0
"Prompt: Every person in the world develops a weird mutation/power the day they turn 16. Everyone 's powers are always different, some more insignificant than others. You turn 16, and watch as all your friends discover their newfound ability 's. That is, until you discover the severity of your own. Story: The funeral was the saddest day of my life. I watched as Cameron's mother and father wept over a closed casket. No parent should ever have to bury their child. That is an agony I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. They tried their best to avoid giving me terrible looks between the tears, but who could blame them? I had just killed their son. Days in the summer had become pretty routine. Wake up, eat breakfast, long run, jump in the pool, and then the fun part, go with a few friends to the sparring gym. Mixed martial arts had become the new craze amongst teenagers since medical technology had now made injuries basically nonexistent. I trained 6 days a week and ate clean. Training was my life. Not many of my friends took our new hobby as seriously as I did. Except Cameron. I was the last of my friends to turn, which meant I was the last to gain my power. Some of my friend's powers were utterly useless, like Trevor for example, who was blessed with the power to chug anything as fast as it would pour. Cool party trick, but absolutely useless. When I was born, the doctors noticed the birthmarks on my hands. Little rough patches by my knuckles that almost looked like welds. The doctors had warned my parents that my ability would be powerful. Extremely powerful. The night before my sixteenth birthday happened to coincide with The Tournament. They refused to give it a name other than The Tournament. Martial Arts people are a strange breed I suppose. The prelim fights had taken longer than expected. I was getting anxious because I was so excited to see what my power would be, but at the same time I was so focused on winning that I forgot all about it. The rounds were fought, the fighters downed, and the bracket solidified. I breezed through to the finals, where I would fight none other than my best friend, Cameron. And that's where it all went wrong. I looked at the clock. 11:54. I guess finding out my power would have to wait. I had a Tournament to win. Round one. We touched gloves, signifying the start of the match, and then hugged signifying our friendship. It was a boring round. Cameron took me down and worked from the top, which was fine by me because I fought better from my back. A few blows were exchanged, but mostly just grappling. 11:57. Round one over. 11:59. Round two. Halfway through the round Cameron landed a huge head kick. Midnight. Things got fuzzy for a second, and then all of the sudden clear as day. Everything. Everything was vivid, and everything was in my control. Time itself knelt before me. In slow-motion I watched Cameron swing for my temple. I slipped his punch. Now he's exposed. I strike. Jab to the stomach with the right (I fought southpaw), uppercut with as much force as I could put behind it with the left. Normally we don't have to worry about injuring our friends. They hop in the med-tank for 30 seconds. Good as new. This time was different. He was gone instantly. The jab collapsed every rib it touched, and his face I can't even talk about. In court it was ruled an accident for two reasons. One, we were sparring. Sparring had become commonplace, and everyone signs off on the dangers when they sign up. Two, well, how was I supposed to know my power? I only had it for maybe fifteen seconds before the head-kick triggered it. Diamond sharp thoughts, steel hard fists. Taking a life changes a man. Whether accidental or purposeful, it does not matter. It's near impossible to live knowing you ended someone, let alone a friend. I gained a power that day, but I lost my life.",0
"Prompt: When two people get married, their hearts are surgically exchanged. You just filed for divorce. Story: It was all I could do to stay on my feet, gaping at my husband. This was ludicrous- *how could he do this to me? * I had never fathomed the man I had married could be so... well, heartless. Only six years ago we had exchanged our vows and our hearts. Literally. It is believed that love is only true if you are willing to entrust your heart to your partner; *your other half*. It's not that we'd been unhappy... Simply disconnected. For the past few months it had become difficult to keep up a conversation with one another. Frightened, I had finally broken down into a puddle at my husband's cold side. I asked him what had happened, and what I could do to improve our situation. He simply explained to me that he had been thinking. Tom had pointed out to me that we had fallen into a neutral stalemate. We weren't warring, but had somehow lost what held us together. Looking back, I came to agree, but I was scared. Would it be easier to continue living life, two people physically together but in all other ways alone? Or would it be our best hope to risk the break? To divorce meant to unbind ourselves from our wedding vows. To unbind ourselves from each others' hearts. Another surgery of that magnitude was utterly terrifying. That kind of thing was meant to be experienced just once in life. Then again, I had always done well under anesthesia. Then again, Tom and I were barely thirty years old. We were pretty healthy people. We could do this. But it had to be soon. Aging and organ transplants have not exactly been known to get along all that well. Tom had held my hand as we met with our attorney, amicably signing papers and rationing out our worldly goods. Tom had held my hand, assuring me that everything would be okay, right up until I had already fallen asleep on my gurney. And now Tom was sitting in front of me, his elbows resting on his knees, as I bring my parcel into the house for the last time, still wearing my hospital band. He tells me that he had been a bit less cautious with his health than he had ever let on. He tells me that seven months ago he was diagnosed with a malfunctioning heart. And he smiles at me, as he tells me this fatigue is only going to worsen. Quickly. And he smiles at me, as the first tear slips silently down my face.",0
"Prompt: A hole in time and space opens up, and you see your younger self looking back at you. You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes. Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response. Story: I gazed with astonishment as time and space were torn asunder in the patch of reality just before me. Here I stood looking at it and yet there I stood also, on the other side but younger, much younger. I couldn't know how long I would have before time and space would right themselves again. I looked at myself there. Such a youthful face, the world hadn't marked and weathered it yet. So much innocence in those eyes, they had yet to see any horrors and troubled times. So much to tell, good and bad but where to start? What to include? This was a time to speak from the heart, not the head. I look my younger self in his bright, sharp blue eyes and spoke calmly, sincerely. ""You have a strength deep inside you, you can tap into it when you need it and it'll get you through the hardest of times.... But more importantly than that, you must learn to let people in because they'll help you even when you fail yourself."" My younger self, shocked as he was by this whole situation, looked about to respond when with a mighty crackling roar time and space reformed into there correct order and the bridge between Then and Now closed once more. ((Tried to give myself a minute to write it, hand even managed to get my sixth line written before the timer went.))",0
"Prompt: You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers. However, you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme. `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers. Story: Mattew arrives five minutes late. I can see as he looks for me through the cafe, so I raise my hand to get his attention. A couple seconds later and he is sitting across from me, sipping quietly the coffee I so graciously bought him. “ Thank you very much for coming on so short notice, ” I tell him. By now, the script I have down to the last part. I know this is going to be it, I have gotten so much better at this sales thing. My effort is finally going to pay off. I just have to focus, and be my very best. “ I know we haven't talked in a while, but this is going to pay off, I promise. ” Mattew gives me this strange look, but nods. Good, good, it's going good. The next part is trying to reconnect with him (or creating a new connection, if this were a cold approach. It's all in the manual, you know. All you need to know.) “ How is the wife? ” I ask him. “ She's fine, thank you, ” he says, a bit dryly, but at this point in time, I'm so used to people yelling at me that this is perfectly acceptable to me. “ Great. The children? ” “ Fine too. Mary is starting school next week, ” I make a quick mental note at that. I'm sure I could use the info for my pitch, somewhere. “ Great. Cool. Smart little Mary. So… Mattew, how's the job? Doing alright? ” That's the beginning of my pitch. If he doesn't like his job, I'll propose a new one, with cool hellish powers, and if he likes it, I'll propose a new one, a better investment in the long run. It includes cool hellish powers. But Mattew doesn't answer, and instead, he says: “ Karl, man. I didn't come here to hear your speech. ” “ What are you talking about? ” I say, astonished. “ C'mon. The speech you have been giving to everyone in your facebook friend's list. Yeah, people have been talking. How you invite them to reconnect over a coffee or discuss a business opportunity and then you try to rope them into your multi-level scam. ” “ No, no, no, you don't get it, ” this I didn't expect, of course, but the manual knows what to say when accused of being a Pyramid Scheme, and by now I can say it in my sleep, “ this is not a pyramid scheme. It's a new business opportunity model, we have an actual product, so there is real value being generated. We trade in these awesome hellish powers, and… ” “ Karl, I have a PhD, you know. I think I know what a pyramid scheme looks like. Do you even get paid? ” “ Of course I get paid, ” I lie, “ It's just that most of it comes from sales-bonus. ” Mattew looks at me through those glasses of his, and I suspect he doesn't believe a single word. “ Oh yeah? Sales bonus? Tell me, how many hellish powers have you sold, lately? ” “ No, no, you need souls to power those, ” I say, stumbling over my words, “ it's not as bad as it sounds, souls are mostly leased and by getting new people to subscribe to the model, you get to keep yours, no one loses their souls, because they can always find new people to subscribe! ” “ Karl. Karl, Jesus. You don't know what geometric progression means, do you? ” “ Uh? ” “ That even if your stupid little scam worked, your market would eventually saturate and millions would not be able to fulfill their… Scram, forget it. Look, how many souls have you won lately? ” “ We don't win any souls, ” I explain, “ it's a subscription based environment, I only recruit more sales forces. With my help you can become a top-notch salesman in no time and get your own team and… ” “ Dude, “ Mattew is now a bit exasperated, “ How many souls. ” “ Erm, well, taking into account the difficult month, and that issue with the providers, and the barrier to entry… hum… well, none, but that is going to change very quickly, this is a momentum based strategy and I'm raising fast, I'm training and going to conventions, man, I really believe this is worth the effort, ” you can do all kinds of crazy shit with hellish powers. “ I know, Karl, ” he seems more calm now. Maybe this is my opportunity. I need to get him to stop being so defensive and hear my arguments. The manual arguments. Same thing. While I try to figure out my next move, he continues. “ You have invested a lot of time and money getting this to work, haven't you? But it just seems just as far away as ever. ” “ No, no, the first sale is the hardest, everything becomes easier as it… ” “ Have you even seen someone with those cool devilish powers you are selling? ” “ Well… ” This is very non-standard. Maybe I'll have to write to corporate to get them to add some response in the manual, because I don't know what to do. How to spin this at my advantage? And have I actually seen someone with awesome hellish powers? “ At the conference the speaker had mysterious tinted glasses and the borders around his face where all lighted up with red light and it looked badass, and when he stepped into the stage the place heated up… ” “ I can do that with a thermostate and two LEDs, Karl. ” “ Well I signed a contract! ” Now I'm the one that's mad. Mattew may have his stupid PhD and his sexy young wife and his kids and his jobs but I finally found a way to be cool, without effort and without becoming rich first, and it's going to work, I'm going to finally be cool, people will like me. I'm going to be cool, dammit! “ I will get my cool powers! ” Mattew smiles, with sadness. “ I think you don't believe that anymore, man. And you know what? At this point, all you've done, it's not actually becoming cool without effort, right? ” “ …Damn… ” All those hours, the studying, practicing pitches in front of the mirror, getting ready to answer all kind of attacks… Yeah, it was a lot of hours. Days even. I could have gotten hired at a real job. “ Don't get like that, Karl. I know you really believed in your pitch, ” Mattew says. Then he adds: “ Hey, how about I get you working with me. ” I look at him, astonished. “ You would do that? ” “ Of course! It would be a starting position, obviously, but with your dedication, I think you will do really well with us. You would get a chance to do some good, actually. ” “ Mattew, that's so nice of you… ” It's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. No, from my mind. I can think clearly now… What have I been doing? Just wasting my time trying to get really awesome powers, trying to be cool like.... Wait just one minute. “ How did you know that I did all this to be cool? ” Mattew smiles and lowers his tinted glasses, and looks at me with two glowing, golden eyes. “ That's just what I do, Karl. And let me tell you, you are going to love the office. ”",0
"Prompt: You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries. You come back to see millions of people suffering, in pain and hopeless. How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind? Story: *sigh* It's exhausting work, being the creator of worlds, creatures, and space/time itself. Some days are better than others. Just the other day, for example, I formed a reality who's inhabitants conquered space and time in mere minutes. They were dedicated to advancing their lifestyles by any means necessary. They worked together excellently, and understood that if they were to survive, they would need to keep learning and understanding, rather than just sit around when they are comfortable or give up when things get hard. I'm very proud of them. They understand what love truly means, and they made it the foundation of their lifestyle, just as I intended. Yesterday I decided to create a new reality with similar traits to the one I created three days ago. The only difference being that I increased my margin of error. *on purpose*. Please, I don't make intentional mistakes. What I discovered however, astounded me. The inhabitants of this reality progressed forward at less than *HALF* the rate of the compared one. And it's obvious as to why. They lack the true understanding of Love. Because of this, I have witnessed them wage wars of mass destruction, slaughter millions of their own... even billions eventually.... They are obsessed with self fulfillment, and ever since the 5th hour after creation, have lost the understanding of survival. A majority of the inhabitants would rather lay around and do nothing than extend their help towards those who are dying due to lack of food, water, basic medical treatment, and so on. Their advancements in technology and travel are sub par. Mediocre at best. I truly worry about them. It shouldn't go unsaid that I *HAVE* tried to help them in the most subtle ways possible. I have created exact replicas of some of the greatest inhabitants from the previous reality, and fit them in at different points along the this realities timeline. In theory, these creations would be able to teach the rest of the inhabitants what it means to truly Love. I even directly communicated with some of these creations, telling them what they need to say. And still, this twisted reality continues to ignore the truth. MY truth. I guess the margin of error was just too high. It created too many selfish and foolish beings. I will wait and see though. Because it doesn't go without saying that this reality isn't without surprises. Maybe in a couple days I will come back and check on them. Until then, I will leave them to figure things out, to wonder, to experiment, and hopefully after they have exhausted all recourses, they can finally turn to the one thing that matters for help... Love.",0
"Prompt: Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision: precisely one year from now, if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator, all humanity will be saved. Otherwise, all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish. Story: Sometimes, to save the world, you have to break a few eggs. Or in this case, drive to extinction a species we'd domesticated for thousands of years. It wasn't easy, but we'd finally engineered the ultimate antibiotic resistant pathogen and gotten it into the food supply of every dairy farmer on the planet. And we were three months ahead of schedule. ""So"", I pointed at the whiteboard, presenting the final analysis of Project Obligate Vegan, ""at least two months prior to The Date all cows will be dead. That means no fresh milk, no new butter, and it's only a matter of time before people have to throw any rotting leftovers out of their fridge."" ""I'm sorry, Dave, but butter doesn't go off that quickly."" ""What?"" I glared at Ted. ""You told me that side of things was all worked out!"" ""It has, but.... we also had to feed the pathogen to every power plant worker on earth."" He shook his head at my gaping jaw. ""It's a harsh price to pay, but we can't take any chances. Hopefully most of the plants will deactivate safely."" I nodded. ""I guess you're right. Still.... all these deaths. It's a good thing we're not *actually* evil, isn't it?"" Ted chuckled half-heartedly. ""Yeah. Thank goodness for that. Still, the World Trade Center, then Fukushima, then butter? I don't get it. I hope that fucking angel is done with us."" ""So do I, Ted. So do I.""",0
"Prompt: You are clumsy in the kitchen. Today, you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident. Story: If I were a smarter person, I would have just ordered from Lucky Wong's # 7 for the fourth time that week. But I had watched Julie and Julia again and felt inspired. I could cook my way through Gwyneth Paltrow's new cookbook, steam my vagina, and become just like the great GOOPy one. I tied my retro floral apron around my waist and began surveying my Whole Foods haul. There were a lot of ingredients that I'd never cooked with before, but if Gwyneth says that I need Star Anise and Moon Dust to make a sea urchin risotto, then that's what I'm going to do. I methodically added herbs to the stock, which means that only 8 of the 11 herbs got a double dose, before stirring the fair trade-organic-non-gmo arborio rice that was picked by female entrepenuers who are making a livable wage in the third world. I tried to silence the voice in my head that told me I'd spent a month's rent on three bags of groceries as I began chopping the raddichio that was picked under the light of a full moon to provide additional flavonoids and anti-oxidents. The clerk had beamed when telling me about the bowel movement I would have after eating the salad prescribed by page 8 of the book. I ended up cutting my hand and bleeding all over the raddichio and artisinal baby greens farmed by Nobel Laureates on sabbatical, but decided that a quick rinse would be okay. After all, vegetables grow in dirt. These vegetables happened to have grown in dirt that was blessed by monks committed to the cause of gender equality, but it's all the same. I moved to stir the risotto, but my hand bled into the pan. As I jerked to prevent any further ruining of the now clumpy risotto that was charred in one section, I bumped the pan and set my apron strings on fire. I tried to douse the flames with the vinaigrette that boasted vinegar distilled by virgins who live in the nunnery in the Alps, but I only proceeded in making a bigger mess. I finally remembered to stop, drop, and roll. ""I'm alive."" I croaked as I lay on the kitchen floor staring at the ceiling. ""What the fuck was I thinking?"" ""You've definitely burned this,"" declared a voice above me. She was standing there in the flesh with her hands on her hips. A bemused expression crossed her too-perfect features. I wanted to ask her so many questions, but I was dumbstruck. ""Now, more to the point. Why have you summoned me?"" Gwyneth Paltrow was in my kitchen.",0
"Prompt: `` Everyone here is running from something. Me? I 'm ... '' Story: # # # # # # [ ] (# dropcap) *Me? I'm running towards it, same way a shark smells blood in the water. * The place reeked of fear, that and unwashed bodies. The smell of piss-sour beer and rather dubious meals only added to the general distaste that clung in the air, the space station's air scrubbers not up to the task of cleaning the stench of tens of thousand of beings who in all likelihood had never heard of the word refresher. The occasional whiff of void-lubricants and burnt power coils were a nice change of pace at least to Tomess Ghast's olfactory organ, his human noise going blind to the worst of the smell. A pint of questionably drinkable beer sat half-finished in front of him, a plate of something that looked like insects as snacks besides it. He wasn't too sure to be completely honest; the things were so deep fried and then covered in a layer of chili powder that he would have accepted any answer from the waitress. Wist Nay'tu, younger than him by a good standard decade and a half took everything in with her aquamarine eyes, sorting and cataloging it all for later use. She wore a conservative jacket of black leather, the material pairing well with her Bothan fur so pale it was almost white. ""I still don't understand why we're in this place, Tomess. It almost burns my snout."" Ghast shrugged, tipping a bit more of the pale ale into his mouth. He swished it around, taking comfort in its likely bacteria dissolving abilities before swallowing it down. ""Everybody's running from the Imps. The First Order's star is on the rise and if there's one thing I know, it's how to make a credit. The Galaxy's changing, Wist, and both sides are gon na be clamoring for guns and those with the skills to use them. Us Ord Ivarners have been waiting for this moment since the Confederacy of Independent Systems was crushed at the end of the Clone Wars. This is vindication for our mistreatment by both the Imps and the Republic."" Wist's fur rippled in a way indicating wariness. ""So we're just gon na be mercenaries? That hardly seems glorious and honorable."" Ghast chuckled, stretching out against the back of the booth they sat at. ""Nope. It's a thankless profession with poor odds and worse pay, and when you do succeed some other person or group rushes in to steal the credit. But hey, them's the rocks. As long as I get paid they can say whoever the hell they want did their dirty work."" Wist said nothing, and instead carefully took of sip of her drink. It didn't take much to convince her that drinking the local water was a poor decision. ""You still haven't told me why we're here."" ""An old acquaintance, a friend of a friend you might say. He's got his slimy little fingers in every pot here in the Western Reaches and more importantly might have a job for a man of my talent,"" Ghast said. ""What talent?"" Ghast winced. ""Ow, now you're just being harsh..."" Any other words were cut off as a half-dozen blasters were aimed their way, pull out from under cloaks or behind backs. One of the wielders, a particularly ugly looking Zabrak with metal-tipped horns pressed the barrel of his blaster into Tomess Ghast's chest. ""Funny seeing you here, Ghast.... considering you have a shoot on sight order on your head from Gorgia the Hutt himself."" Tomess smiled, a queer thing at odds with the deadly weapons aimed at his head. ""Bero-Lo! I was hoping you'd show up; saves me the trouble of having to explain to whatever dog you got watching the front gate to let me in. How's the leg? Last I saw you were crawling after me, shooting and hollering."" ""Yes, thanks to you,"" the Zabrak said icily. ""You nearly blew my leg off."" ""Tom,"" Wist murmured but he ignored her, saying instead, ""Wist, this is Bero-Lo, enforcer for the esteemed owner of this station. The owner being that friend I was mentioning about. Me and him go way back."" The ganger was not amused. ""Get up. we'll let Gorgia figure out how to deal with you."" Ghast merely smiled once more, picking up his beer and finishing the dredges with a long gulp. ""Tastes like piss from a sick being. Speaking of which, did that doc finally clear up your kidneys? Do Zabraks even have kidneys?"" He barely even grunted when the fist came flying towards his face.",0
"Prompt: In the future, technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves, and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams. Story: Hello YouTube, welcome to this week's episode of Making Movies On A Budget. I'm here in the studio with my mate Ralph and -- *Well, the studio is actually my mom's living, the usual studio is getting fumigated. * Right, yes, we're here in Ralph's mom's living room, and this week we are going to tackle the issue of backgrounds. So if you're a regular of our show, you already know the basics for a dynamic scene, but there is more to it than just the action and dialog. Ralph? *That's right, the wrong setup can kill your scene faster than anything. Fortunately the solution is easy-peasy. You just dream it up! * So for this you will only need your trusty video editor, an expert imaging sistem and a pillow. Now, you want to load up your dream from the pillow into the editor -- *We already have this thing set up with an older dream on mine, you will recognize it from last week's episode. * -- And just let the imaging system figure out what's what. You may need to specify some details, like if that building is a church or a bank -- *A church in real life, of course, but in this case it will be the library where next week's fight scene will take place. * Haha, spoilers! Anyway, once the system is done, you get a fully imersive environment, and just set the points of interest and actors. *Now, using the camera tool, set the motion path, I put in just a point for a static point of view, and adjusting the focal length -- * Wait, no, can we get some cloud cover? *Too bright? * No, the tower on the right looks better against the clouds. *Ok, hold on.... Better? * Perfect! So now we just hit Render, and lo and behold, the fabled city of Paris, as it probably looked back when. *That's it for today's episode, be sure to like and subscribe, and we'll see you next week.... * ....

"Prompt: It 's the middle of the night. Your iPhone starts ringing. You wake up. You 're getting a Facetime call from someone who died three days earlier. Story: My little brother doesn't eat cereal. When he was five he would gag. When he got a little older he would leave the room, saying the smell made him nauseous. He was twenty-two and never ate cereal. He never ate cereal his entire life. T.V. makes it easier, like having a comfortable stranger in the room with me. I feel a little less sad when the T.V. is on. When I was twelve, I started to think about infinity and what it actually meant. It made me feel sick to my stomach. I found a public access station showing a local roller-skating rink. It made me feel better. They all looked happy. I am trying to find something that will make me feel better tonight, but my T.V. isn't feeling sad like me. 3 A.M. and I can't sleep. T.V. doesn't help and my walls are probably painted the wrong color. My little brother smoked pot some times and liked to ride his bike. He wrecked two cars and always insisted on driving stick, because you had “ more control. ” I check the ten-day forecast because when nothing matters, the weather is the only thing that matters. I should get a new jacket. My mind is wandering when my Iphone lights up. Not a normal phone call, a Facetime feels more urgent. My brother's picture is on the screen. I push the green button, wishing my T.V. were a better friend. “ Joshy, ” my brother says. “ Jakey, ” I answer automatically. “ Are you watching Adult Swim? ” Jake asks. When did you get an Iphone? I think to myself. Jake always had an Android phone. ‘ There is nothing good on T.V., ” I say. “ You get T.V.? ” Jake asks. At least I think he asked it, but he might have been crying. My remote control doesn't have enough buttons. I'm not sure if it's still three in the morning or something different. Three days since the funeral and I find it hard to keep track of time. They gave me some Ambien to take. It makes me feel warm, like a handful of intimate friends are sitting at the foot of my bed. “ Joshy, I'm sorry, ” Jake says. “ You didn't have to go, ” I say. I wanted to say that nothing is ever as bad as it seems, but that would have felt too much like a cliché. “ I just wanted to say goodbye, bro, ” Jake says. I feel sad all over, but sort of calm too. Jake didn't kill himself. He never did. “ Everyone was there, Joshy, ” Jake says. “ Was I there? ” I ask, already knowing the answer. “ Yeah, you looked real good, ” Jake says “ Did they play it on T.V.? ” I ask, only because T.V. is all I ever think of now. “ I wish I could tell you that it's never as bad as it seems. We're all gon na miss you, Joshy, ” Jake says. T.V. isn't very good here. Infinity still makes me feel sick.",0
"Prompt: Every single day the world votes to kill off one person. Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed. Story: It was the last invention of mankind. Societal collapse began after a week. The hopes, the dreams, the wishes - whatever had accompanied the creation - shattered after it was leaked onto the internet. Suddenly it wasn't a select group of people choosing the deaths, a jury of executioners, it was the entire world. At 12:00pm EST, a single person in the world would drop dead from no discernible cause. The technology behind it was complex, a new order of probability theory made reality. Tyrants and terrorists were the first to go. The hope remained even among the growing horror that maybe, just maybe, the world would show its good side. Its collective benevolence. But on the fourth day, the same day god created the evening and the morning, on the fourth day an outspoken celebrity, famous for her acting and pouting, was killed. And so the floodgates were opened. On the fifth day, the president of the united states of america fell to the machine. The sixth? An Indian left wing political blogger. Weeks passed and social media was abandoned as popularity suddenly became deadly. Actors and diplomats alike fell to the vote, instagram stars and royalty. Simply having a name could be fatal if anybody else knew it. They tried to shut it off, but it had spread too far and too fast, and as governments fell one by one, the dystopian future that so many books and films promised became a reality. After two years and nearly 700 deaths, America had fallen. India had fallen. France, England, China. The great nations of the world all fell. Eventually the world ran out of famous people. A cynical commenter might have quipped about it being worth it thanks to the loss of the Kardashians, but the reality was bleak and grim. Eventually, ten votes was enough to get a person killed, as everyone was left to vote for people they knew, people who had irritated them. Even picking a name at random ran with the risk that Joe Smith had annoyed his three neighbours that day, and your random vote tipped the scale. People lost their names. It didn't work with nicknames or pseudonyms, so it wasn't uncommon for the girl you met while trying to catch a rabbit to avoid starvation to introduce herself as Rabbit. It added an oddly bright side to a ruined world.",0
"Prompt: A young, mentally distraught high school student, weapon in tow, decides to shoot up his school before taking his own life. Just before the moment of truth, another student in his class opens fire on his class mates. What does he do next? Story: As soon as he pushed the'Record' button on his camcorder, the teenager stepped back so he would be in the shot. While the camera sat on top of the dingy sink, recording the scrawny boy who was wearing a black trenchcoat, the kid took a breath while holding the assault rifle in his trembling hands. ""My.... my name is Chris Mansfield,"" began the teenager as he tried to speak confidently. Considering what he was going to do, he knew that he had to make his last video entry count before it went to the news. ""I am sixteen years old, and I attended the living *hell* which is known as Boliva --"" The sound of a loud gunshot interrupted Chris, making him crouch down instinctively. He looked back at the door of the empty restroom, making sure that it was still locked, before another loud gunshot was heard, followed by the sound of several screams. *Is.... is this real? * thought Chris to himself. *Am I really not the only one doing this? * A million thoughts began to rush through his head like a tidal wave, throwing him off his focus as he tried to think of what to do. Should he save them? Should he join in? Maybe if he just stayed in here, then he could jus -- A loud array of gunshots interrupted Chris's train of thought, sounding like something from a full-blown automatic rifle. However, that fact wasn't what made Chris begin to worry; it was that he could now hear *two* separate guns going off at the same time. *A double job? * thought Chris with a growing sense of terror. *Like Columbine? * *Or Elephant? I didn't even think that there was anyone els -- * ""AAAAHHHH, HA HA HA HAAAA!!!"" A maniacal voice could be heard running down the halls past the bathroom. ""RUN, YOU LITTLE FUCKERS!!! RUN LIKE THE LITTLE SHITS YOU ARE!!!"" Chris's breathing began to increase rapidly, recognizing that voice instantly. Even though he never really talked with him too often (except when talking with the Principal about one of the many bullyings he received), he could tell it was the school's Security Guard from that raspy tone alone. Of course, hearing him say *that* wasn't exactly what Chris would've ever expected. More screams could be heard as the gunshots continued, now becoming more frantic as they seemingly came from all around. Bodies could be heard falling to the floor, along with other sounds that Chris couldn't recognize. They were like little slaps, or maybe -- A loud bang came as something hard hit the bathroom door. A male's voice could be heard screaming in a frantic cry, but was quickly overpowered by the maniacal laughter of some girl. Suddenly, those sounds became clear to Chris when he looked down, seeing a puddle of blood begin to seep underneath the doorway. Someone was being stabbed. ""Wha.... what the..."" Chris didn't want to say anything to alert his presence, but his feeble voice was nothing compared to the chaos he could hear outside. Screams, gunshots and laughter were all that could be heard as the teenager walked back against the wall, realizing that something much worse than he ever could've planned was happening before him. Panting heavily, he looked back at the camcorder, that was still recording as the sounds of mayhem became worse. Keeping the gun tightly clenched in his hands, Chris stumbled over to the sink, pulling the camera down to hold it while he was crouched down on the linoleum floor. ""What the fuck, what the fuck, what the FUCK?"" As the camera recorded Chris's increasingly sweating face from its downward angle, his eyes darted between the camera lens and the door as the banging against it became stronger. ""I.... Oh my god, I..."" Chris looked back to the camera one last time before he turned off the feed. ""I think the school turned fucking insane.""",0
"Prompt: A device is released that allows a person to dive into a book and experience its contents firsthand. The manual mentions a certain book you should n't go in, for no one has ever returned from copies of it, but you decide to ignore the manual and go in anyway. Story: *Oh. That's why. * Memories quickly fade and I'm floating in an infinite expanse of white, with no clear idea of which way is up or down. Everything is weightless, and I have no sense of motion or position in the endless void. Numbers and letters suddenly materialize in view, detailing specs and measurements of the VisionCorp Reader I vaguely remember purchasing. Where was I? How did I get here? I crane my head upwards (or, at least, what I assume to be upwards) and can see giant, black letters: **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual** As I float among the various text boxes and diagrams, I notice a section titled *warnings*. Suddenly, I'm not alone in this blank void; I see other people. A window has appeared, and in this square frame I see a man in his bathroom. He's lounging in his bathtub holding a small metal device. He touches it to his book and suddenly passes out, falling into the tub's water. A large, red X appears over the window, and it fades out of existence. Suddenly, I see another window, this one containing a man driving. He touches a similar metal object to a book in the passenger seat, and passes out immediately. Similarly, a red X appears over his window. Yet another square materializes, and in this one, I see a child of no more than four years holding the device. She touches it to a children's book and a red X immediately appears. Strange. Suddenly, a number of exclamation marks appear, demonstrating that this window is of importance. The square appears, and within it is a man in everyday clothes holding the metal device. In his other hand, he holds a small pamphlet reading **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual. ** *Odd, * I think, *why would that be dangerous? * The man touches the device to the manual and suddenly my white reality surges. The window begins to expand at an alarming rate as a horrible suction pulls me into the window, and suddenly I'm in an endless white void. *Oh, that's why, * I think, as my memories begin to fade. Where am I again?",0
"Prompt: All your friends and family are slowly changing. They do n't notice the difference, but you certainly do ... Story: My family was as normal as they come. Not normal in the TV Land model family way. Normal in that we had our fights, our crises. Just last week Mom argued with dad all night over money issues after he bought a new shirt without consulting him. But we loved each other. At least until last week that is. It started slow at first. ""Pass the sugar, pansy. ``, my little sister said with a angry tone pointing at the jar in the middle of the table during breakfast. I looked at her in shock, and then at mom who was sitting eating oblivious to what just happened. ""Are you going to let her get away with that?"" I asked Mom. ""Get away with what? She just asked for the sugar."" she answered back. As I passed the sugar, I gave a good look at my sister. Any animosity was gone now, and she was her sweet innocent self again. I don't know why, but the whole situation creeped me out. My sister always looked up to me and would never do anything like this. A feeling of dread and panic stayed with me for hours afterwards. It only got worse from there. The next day whenever Mom had her back to me, I could hear her mumble a few words, always stopping when she was facing me. I never heard a full sentence, but words like ""brat"", ""little shit"" I could catch, and sometimes worse than that. The feeling of dread and panic returned. After I couldn't stand it anymore I asked my Dad why she was talking to herself. ""I don't hear anything, son."" he answered shortly, while reading his newspaper. But the next day I noticed that the paper wasn't the same as his normal subscription. This paper seemed to have a red tenge to it, or certain words seemed to be toned a bit red. I couldn't tell which. I looked closer, but it was hard to read the words and the sentences seemed to jumble together and speak nonsense. This newspaper had weird articles about murders judging from the pictures. Always the most graphic pictures, that would never be seen in a respectable daily newspaper. Dad, normally a pretty boring unemotive guy, sat there reading the stories with a goofy grin. It even looked diabolical. Later at church, the sermon was over Satan, and how he had already corrupted everyone. No man was sinless and therefore everyone had a bit of Satan within them. The message was that God was needed to save us from this fate. My family's odd behavior continued even here, all three of them squirmed incessantly during the sermon, with an obvious look of discomfort on their faces. I had a sudden wave of fear, and can't explain why. After telling myself it was nothing I was able to begin to listen to the boring sermon again. That night I had a dream. The pastor spoke to me in the voice I heard at the sermon, reminding me that all men, no matter how nice of people they could be, could be enslaved by Satan. The dream turned dark and he said as God's children we needed to root out Satan where ever he existed, and handed me a knife. The look on his face was one of glee, which given his talk and tone scared the shit out of me and I woke up. I woke up in the dark, it must have been about 3 in the morning. The pastor's voice still rang out in my head, almost like he was in the room with me. You had to combat the demon, or he would surely would steal you and your soul for eternal torment. I went down for the kitchen for a glass of water. Instead my hands moved on their own to open the knife drawer, as I could almost hear the pastor laugh and speak some encouragement.",0
"Prompt: Extremists kidnapped an American journalist in Iraq. They are about to execute this poor soul, named Clark Kent. Story: I apologize for any inaccuracies. I know very little of war. x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x They were never supposed to have gotten this close to the war-zone. The feature of their article was the International Committee of the Red Cross. With the recent bombings and war crimes in the Mosul area, the committee had warned of a humanitarian crisis. There were hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees fleeing. Lois' piece was supposed to be about the need for international aid. The Daily Planet was trying to drive up Metropolis donations. Lois Lane could support a good cause. These refugees were forced from their homes, sometimes with their family members missing, injured or dead. They needed all the help that could get. But there was a bigger story here. From just a few quick interviews it was clear to her that the local ISIS forces knew more about the UN's movements than they should have. Someone was leaking information. Someone on the inside. She needed to get out there, talk to the men from each faction. See what they knew. They'd have to enter the battlefield. It'd be dangerous. But she'd never run from danger before. Clark had tried to talk her out of it. They were here under the sanction of the American Embassy, and had agreed to stay in the refugee camp. Going to Mosul would be breaking the terms of their sanction, and was grounds to get them sent home. And moreso, she could see that he was scared. He was convinced that she was going get herself killed. When it became clear that she'd made up her mind, he gave up on trying to talk her out of it. He knew better. So instead, Clark had insisted on joining her. His small town values never would have let her go it alone. They'd hitched a ride into Mosul on the back of a passing truck, owned by an Iraqi man who was in search of his missing daughter. Clark sat beside the driver, making an effort to ask him about what his girl looked like and when he'd seen her last. His Arabic had always been better than hers. The wheels of the truck kicked up clouds of dust, filling the air around them. Lois had coughed, and the driver had offered her water, which she gratefully accepted. When the man dropped them off on the outskirts of Mosul, about a mile outside of the UN's camp, they agreed to get his daughter to safety if they found her. The plan had been to track down the UN camp's commanding officer and wrangle an interview out of him. Not easy, but simple. They started walking towards the east side of the city. As they passed, strangers looked upon them warily. Children with wide eyes were dragged away by their mothers. Lois pulled her headscarf closer around her face, grateful for the weight of her bulletproof vest against her chest. They never made it to the UN camp. They were about 500 feet away when the bomb went off. A flash, so close it briefly blinded her, knocked her back a few steps. Lois could feel the vibrations through the soles of her boots, just as the echoing roar crashed against her eardrums. Disoriented, she felt her knees buckle, and would have slumped to the ground had Clark not grabbed her by the arms and held her up. Through the muted deafness in her ears, she thought she could make out one word. ""Run."" Clark pushed her forward, firm, and she took off. Her feet pounded against the dusty earth, making her joints ache. The dirty air grated on her throat and lungs, so with shaking hands she pulled her scarf around her mouth. Her feet tangled beneath her and Lois stumbled, nearly falling, but caught herself with her left hand and jolted back upright. Though her wrist ached from the fall, she continued to run. Her eyes stung from the debris, though she could blurrily make out the UN tents as she grew near. She looked around, blinking watery eyes, expecting to see Clark at her side. He was not. Men from the camp rushed out to meet her as she skidded shakily to a halt. ""Clark!"" she called out as they grabbed her by the shoulder, steadying her. ""Clark!"" One of the men must have recognized her, because he began dragging her towards the tents. She struggled, yanking against him with little avail. As he pulled her into the tent, she felt her legs give out. Lois crumpled to the ground as a crowd of men rushed around her, the tears leaving dusty trails down her face. ""Oh god, Clark, what have I done?"" .... to be continued",0
"Prompt: A post apocalyptic society finds an ancient device that gives them instructions on what to do next. This device - the Bop It Story: I'm one of the smartest people of my time. This is simply because I can read. I taught myself. I learned of the apocalypse that had happened 500 years ago that had reduced most of the world to rubble. I'd only found about half a library's worth of books in my time on this earth, but I have learned much from them. I am struggling to teach the rest of the world what humanity once knew. About animals, about the environment, economics, electronics, farming, social structure, everything. It's a slow process. A lot of the world is still mired in ignorance and superstition. Many ""societies"" have even resorted back to the customs of the Myans and Incans, dealing ""social justice"" through executions. As far as I knew, these post apocalyptic executions were the first examples since ancient Latin America that people had killed each other as a form of punishment. The strangest thing is that they consult a.... thing on the methodology of the execution. I don't know what it is yet because they won't let me look at it. The people who are at the top of the fireman's pole keep it under close guard, as they think it's sacred. Only a few dozen of these devices have been found. Even fewer still function. We don't know what makes them work, but I'm certain I could figure it out if I had the time. That is what I am doing right now. I'm sitting here, witnessing the public executions just to get a better idea of what this device is. I'm certain it's from Old Earth, despite how vehemently many people state it is a divine tool. Several people have already been executed and another steps up. He is convicted of killing and eating a donkey, which is a sacred animal, just like they were to the Hindus in India before the apocalypse. The executioner's consult lifted the device again and reverently kissed the center of the machine with enough pressure to trigger the device. The whole audience waited with baited breath as they waited for the item's report. ""Bop It"" The crowed groaned with disappointment and the criminal sighed with relief. This was by far the most merciful of sentences. The executioner took out a silver club. It was about as long as his arm and had a fairly thin handle that tapered outward to a hefty body. I think it had once been used in a sport, Bases ball or something. They use to play it with diamonds, back when the world was rich. The executioner took the club and nodded again at his consult. The consult took out a square cardboard board with a plastic arrow on it. I knew where this came from. It was from a contortionist training tool called ""Twister"". The consort spun the arrow and it landed on the left foot on the blue circle. That meant that he would be stuck on the left foot with moderate force. Yellow was a tap, strong enough to bruise, blue was enough to cause a limp for several weeks, green was a blow strong enough to break bone, and red was a hay creator, designed to irreparably destroy the limb. After his ""Bop"", the convict limped away, smiling at his good fortune. The gods had smiled on him. Next was a thief. He had stolen a great deal from many people. His execution was the one that most of the people were here to see. The consult again kissed the device, eliciting another proclamation. ""Pull It."" The crowd cheered in excitement. This was their favorite punishment, and it was clear that they felt it is what he most deserved. Even more fittingly, the board landed on his right arm. The circles didn't matter for this one. There was only the pulling. The thief bowed his head and began whispering prayers as tears streamed down his face. I had to admire his bravery, though. He surrendered his right arm, holding it out. The executioner tied a knot around it and tested it. The rope would break before the knot slipped. And I knew from experience that the rope would not break. The rope was tossed over an archway designed for this purpose and the thief was tied down to the platform he was kneeling on. The executioner heaved on the rope, audibly dislocating the mans arm from its shoulder. The thief screamed out in pain as the executioner continued to pull. His consult, also a man of considerable size, joined him. The two heaved again, putting all of their weight and strength behind it. With a wet tearing sound, the limb came free from the body, blood and tissue bursting from the wound. The thief passed out from the pain and was dragged away, blood still cascading from his wound. He may live. It depends on how good the doctor was. Or if the thief had ever stolen from the doctor. That one left the crowd fairly satisfied. They loved blood almost as much as the vampires of Ancient Earth did. I guess if the apocalypse had one good thing about it, it was that we no longer had to live with those blood sucking monsters. The crowd calmed down and the next prisoner was brought out. My heart sank, as did the mood of the audience. This prisoner was merely a young girl, maybe 17. She had been accused with the injury of her employer. He had tried to take advantage of her and had abused her verbally. His case had been decided long ago, resulting in a destroyed right knee. However, because this girl had harmed someone, she had to face a punishment. It was the only way to keep retribution as a function of the legal system rather than a personal responsibility. Everyone in the audience hoped that her punishment would be light and that she would be set free with little incident. They waited with baited breath as the consult pressed his lips to the device. ""Twist It."" The girl screamed in horror. The crowd yelled in outrage. I grimaced at the twist of outrage in my gut. The only one that remained even remotely passive was the executioner. He stepped up to do his civic duty. No board was needed here. There was only one outcome. The man slowly, almost gently, put one hand under her chin and the other on the top of her head. With a single, sudden twist, her cries were cut short. Her body slumped to the ground. The cries of her loved ones echoed throughout the otherwise silent venue. I stood from my seat and turned. I had seen enough. I'm not sure I want to understand this device anymore. What kind of object would so arbitrarily decide the fates of people, be they good or bad. I had seen murderers walk away with a bruised ankle. And I'd seen beggars who had stolen bread have their leg torn off. I will study this device only to find a way to end it. I will destroy this dealer of unwarranted pain, even if it would turn the rest of the world against me.",0
"Prompt: It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident. Story: *Clunk* When Sabir opened his eyes, there was only blackness. Deep, impenetrable blackness, as cloying as a heavy blanket pressed over his face. For a moment, he felt unable to breath, as if he had somehow awoken to find himself hundreds of feet below the ocean's surface. Then, with an incandescent brilliance, the fluorescent lights over his bed flickered to life and brought him fully into the world of the waking. Good morning, Sabir. You are certainly up early today. Will you be initiating an extra sleep cycle, or shall I prepare you a meal? ""Mornin' Computer. Nah, that's fine, go ahead and make breakfast."" Sabir rolled onto his side, eyes still blurry from sleep. His little cabin was a brilliant white, from his sheets to the walls to the floor. It would have been dazzling, if it were not for the layers and layers of fading posters, pictures, and other curio that coated the wall behind his bed like wallpaper. It was the only place on the entire ship that he had been authorized to make his own, and he had filled it with every scrap of his life that he could possibly make fit. It wasn't as if there was someone else on board who could enforce the rule, but Sabir had always followed protocol to the letter. It was his adherence to the rules that had first made Sabir stand out as a candidate for his current mission. He wasn't sure what it was that the cargo ship was carrying, but whatever it was they were taking no chances with it's disposal. He had strict instructions not to tamper with, interact with, or even LOOK at the thick steel boxes kept in the deep cryostasis compartments at the back of the ship's hold. He was to simply fly into the black hole's gravity well, jettison the entire rear of the ship, and make his way home again. It was a simple task that would allow him to live a life of luxury for the rest of his days, which was all the more impressive considering that it accounted for the medical immortality that had also been part of the deal. It was unusual, but Sabir was used to taking unusual orders from the higher ups. The hard part of the task came from one of the other conditions he had been made to agree to: He was absolutely, under no circumstances, allowed to activate the onboard FTL drive until his cargo had been delivered. What was more, he was only permitted to go into cryosleep for one week at a time, making his journey almost unbearably tedious. As Sabir rolled out of bed, panels on one of the walls began to recede, revealing a mirror, sink, and compact shower. At the top right of the mirror, a glowing blue display read: ""5:45 am, August 19, 8299. It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident."" He shook his head at the time, wondering why he was so wide awake. With a start, he remembered the noise that had roused him, cursing his sleep-addled brain for not remembering sooner. ""Computer! Run a full diagnostic on all ship systems. I think I heard something strange, possibly from the engines."" Yes, Sabir. Diagnostic underway. Sabir dressed quickly, wanting to patrol the the ship's habitable zones manually. It wasn't that he didn't trust the ship's computer - it practically ran the ship all by itself - but even a small anomaly like the noise could be fatal this far from home. Just as he was pulling on his shirt, he heard it again - this time much closer. *Clunk. * ""Computer! Did you get a read on that?"" Confirmed. Noise originated from quadrant V, right above the mess hall. Sending scout drones to investigate *Clunk* With a curse, Sabir stood, staring at his doorway. The noise had originated just outside. Black tendrils, like corporeal shadows, slid through the gaps around the door. Sabir stared, rooted to the spot, as they poured into his tiny room until it seemed as if it would burst. Then, all at once, they stopped. For a moment, it seemed as if the mass was staring at him, and then it suddenly contracted. Tendrils twisted around tendrils, tightening, shifting in color, until a woman stood in front of him. She was completely nude, with long red hair and pale skin that was nearly as white as the walls of his room. After a moment of realization, Sabir recognized her as belonging in one of his posters, the one beside his head. She was an exact copy, human in every way except for her eyes, which shone coal-black. *"" Greetings, Sabir. ""* The woman spoke, her voice echoing in Sabir's head in a way that made his blood feel like ice. *We have been watching you for quite some time. If you don't mind, we have a few requests we would like to ask of you. * As Sabir watched, the counter on his mirror started to decrease rapidly. ""6:04 am, August 19, 8299. It has been 0 days since the last workplace accident."" Sabir gulped. *** *CC appreciated, if you enjoyed you can find more of my work over at /r/TimeSyncs! *",0
"Prompt: What if ghosts are, in reality, glimpses of time travelers? Story: **September 26, 1983** Lieutenant Colonel Petrov sat at his duty station, rubbing his tired eyes. As an officer of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, he was used to long watches. He might have thought he was dreaming when the air around him shimmered, and the visitor appeared before him. She was dressed in what appeared to be casual attire of a fashion Petrov was unfamiliar with. Her long black hair was bound behind her head in a pony tail. She was beautiful. ""Who are you?"" he began. ""How did you get in here?"" ""Who I am is unimportant."" replied the visitor. ""What I have come to ask you is of the utmost importance, however."" ""Are you a ghost?"" he asked in wonder. ""I am a traveler."" she smiled. ""That is all you need to know. I have come to you today because I want you to pause and ask yourself a very simple question."" ""What is the question?"" he asked. ""Do you believe that *anyone* truly wants our world to end?"" she asked him evenly. Petrov thought about this in regards to his work. Why would this vision appear to him? Was something about to happen? He again rubbed his eyes and looked for his wondrous visitor. She was gone. The alarm sounded. The computers had detected an American first strike. Nuclear missiles were now heading towards the Soviet Union. It was now required that they launch in retaliation for this atrocity, mutually assured destruction was guaranteed. It was truly the end of the world. *Or was it? * ""Not on my watch."" Petrov said aloud.",0
"Prompt: You work on the assembly line in a cybernetic implant factory. You and your coworkers like to prank each other by shoving defective components into each others bodies. Story: ""Goddamit Ryan,"" Jerry said. He fished his finger out of his cup of tea, along with the now soggy bourbon. His index finger had felt a little off all day. Technically his index finger had come off a long time ago, back when health and safety meant not sticking your dangly bits between metal jaws. Ryan for his part found it hilarious. The others in the room just shook their head. Ryan had at one time or another pranked all of them. ""You got ta stop sleeping at work,"" he said between breaths. ""You're just too easy man."" ""Next time I'll.... next time,"" Jerry muttered as he left the break room, taking half the pack of biscuits with him. -- - The loos were Ryan's alone time. Just him, the latest page 3, and a long break from the assembly line. It wasn't real, but it was the thought that counts. He heard the door to the bathroom swing open and cursed. Then the door opened again. More footsteps. ""You all eat Matt's wifes leftover stew?"" Ryan joked to the back of the toilet door. Shuffling. Toilet seats hitting bowls. What were they doing? ""Now,"" a voice said. Two pairs of arms reached over the top of the low plywood wall, grabbing Ryan before he could stand. The door burst open and Ryan found himself caught with his pants down. Literally. ""Eenine, meenie, miny, mo,"" Jerry said, tapping on the collar around Ryan's neck. With a gurgle, the seal came apart and Jerry carefully lifted Ryan's head from his cybernetic body. ""Put me the fuck down,"" Ryan shouted. Or at least tried. Without a windpipe, he was on emergency blood-oxygenation from the collar's reserves. The bag was stifling, bounced around like a sack of potatoes, but Ryan refused to give in. Until he was reseated again and took stock of his new body. ""Ha ha. Very funny,"" he said. ""Now give me back my rig."" ""Yeah, about that,"" Jerry said. ""We put it in a taxi back to it's home address. You really should have updated your registration when you moved out of your parents."" ""Hell no,"" Ryan said. ""Oh yeah,"" Jerry and everyone else said. Ryan looked down at the breasts peeking out from beneath the thin coveralls and swore he'd get them all back for this.",0
"Prompt: Write a better ending to the `` Russian Sleep Experiment '' Creepypasta. Story: The subject smiled. Suddenly, the surviving researcher could feel a bright, warm light spreading throughout his body. He let go of the gun in shock, bringing his hands to his chest. He could feel the indescribably powerful force cascading through his essence, wiping out all traces of the fear which only seconds ago had driven him to the point of insanity. Love. He knew the emotion when he felt it, but had never known it in a form that was this strong, this insatiably pure. His eyes flitted back towards the man, who still wore his cardboard smile. He could see through the smile like a window into the deprived mind lying just behind the clenched teeth. What he saw was not madness, but the greatest sense of peace and calm he had ever known. ""How? Why?"" He remembered the earlier observations, the way that the prisoners so wantonly destroyed eachother and themselves. ""It'll all be ogre soon."" The subject dropped his smile, yet the raw sensation of nearly orgasmic bliss remained. The researcher slumped against the cell, barely aware of the dozens of preening eyes that carefully observed his every move. ""Better check yourself before you shrek yourself"". It was then that the researcher noticed that the prisoner wasn't moving his lips as he spoke, nor was the sound originating from him. He looked over, but only caught a glimpse of the hulking figure lurking on the other side of the room before his vision went black. All the former sensations of bliss and beauty were banished into some forsaken realm from which they were not soon to return. They were destined to be replaced by the agony which was to follow the researcher's blindness; a sensation even stronger than the love which had enraptured his mind only seconds ago. The voice spoke again: ""Bend ovah donkeh."" It was impossibly charismatic, as if the mere nature of its inflection was sufficient to entirely control a person. Before he could act on the voice's prompt, the researcher felt himself falling down into a vast and mysterious unknown. Nothing but a cold and inky blackness met his sight as he struggled to discover his location. All of a sudden, he heard the unmistakable sound of knuckles cracking. ""This is my swamp."" After that, there was only pain.",0
"Prompt: It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident. Story: *ding* ""It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident,"" declared the robotic tannoy, as Axel and Craig hauled a metal crate onto the conveyor belt. Axel pulled a lever, and the belt rumbled loudly as it carried the box down-line. Craig followed it. *ding* ""Please ensure you are wearing your safety gear at all times while handling the machinery."" Axel pulled on a set of thick gloves, while Craig double checked his helmet. The heat inside the heavy clothing was almost unbearable, but without it the forge would sear their skin, burn it black. It could also, they'd heard, survive almost any impact that could occur. Neither wanted to test the theory. *ding* ""Grey Corp appreciates your work, and thanks you for not removing any Grey Corp hardware from Grey Corp worksites."" The box halted by a pair of metal clamps attached to hydraulic pistons; the boys stuck them on opposite faces of the cube. The crates were designed not to be opened without factory-grade equipment, their cargo too valuable to be stolen. *ding* ""When operating heavy machinery, please stand away from moving parts."" They rolled their eyes and stepped away, each pressing a button on either side of the conveyor that would activate the pistons, tear the box open. Inside lay a weapons-grade helmet, with infrared and all those similar trappings built in. The thing was worth more than either of them. Possibly both. Axel lifted it from the box and moved it across to the assembly line, setting it down on the shoulders of a power armour suit. He held it steady while Craig connected the wires and bolted it together. *ding* ""Now testing; IPA Suit MKV in room 6. Please vacate the room."" They'd drilled for this, a long time ago. The world around them seemed to slow as the suit came to life. A metal gauntlet grabbed Craig by the coat, but he managed to slip out of the top layer and hit the floor running. Axel, on the other side, was already halfway towards the bunker room. *crash* The intelligent suit tore straight through the conveyor belt as Craig had to sprint around it. If it beat him to the door, he'd be trapped. He was faster, but the suit had no care for obstacles. Axel had reached the bunker door, but the insulated gloves were too thick to operate the door controls. He fought to get them off. Craig vaulted the next conveyor belt, but came down hard, twisting his ankle. The mechanical whirring closed behind him as he limped onward. The control panel accepted Axel's commands, and he ducked inside the bunker. Axel looked out at Craig and the IPA. He made a snap decision, and pulled the door closed. There was a hiss as it sealed, and then all sound from the factory room cut out. Axel dropped to the floor, where he wouldn't have to watch through the window. Blood spattered the glass. Even through the sound-proofing, he thought he heard the screams. *ding* ""Grey Corp would like to thank you for your work. We would like to remind you that without our expendable human workforce, the Grey Corp Automatonic Union would not exist. It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident."" A yellowish haze began to seep into the bunker room. Axel took off his mask. The sooner it was over, the better.",0
"Prompt: A collective consciousness that can not take control of people 's bodies by force. It must persuade people to join willingly. Story: The hivemind swept across the globe with relative ease. It wasn't a regular hivemind, mind. You had to *want* to join it before it took you into its fold. Those under it maintained *some* level of autonomy, but largely they were directly controlled by the wireless connections that meshed them together. It was a thing born of the internet, that quickly grew and expanded, creating new technologies until those who had opted in to it became linked, shared thoughts and feelings more so than any previous trial before. The birth of the hivemind. Public opinion was mixed, largely due to the people that had chosen to meld themselves. A wide array of misfits, people who were largely rejected by society. The weeaboos, the neckbeards, the furries, bronies, militant atheists, you name it. Not all of those chose to meld, and some outright rejected it, claiming it to be insidious and a “ shithole ”, but for the most part, it was a form of escapism they could get only by outsourcing thought, as it were. Once meshed and melded, the hivemind grew to accommodate them, the overall thoughts and ethos of it weighting ever more slightly. The end result was a ‘ Tyranny of the Majority ”, where the foremost groups were represented foremost in the hivemind's overall being, its self. There was some disparity between certain parts, like it wasn't fully in agreement with itself. Cognitive dissonance that often caused many users to disconnect themselves – there was nothing to stop them, after all. All you had to do was register, it was as simple as that. I decided one day that I would join. It was a spur of the moment thing. My parents were adamant that I shouldn't, it was tantamount to killing yourself. Not really, I reasoned, because I'm still being represented by it. You simply went to a website and created an account, accepting the terms and conditions, which I did. Just like that, I had a Reddit account.",0
"Prompt: Hello darkness, my old friend. Story: I was a hero, one in a billions for her. She loved me. Always. When I was afraid or little tensed, she made me laugh. Once I got lonely because my parents left me. It was she, Nathalie, who stood by me, like a lioness takes a stand for her lion. But life is uncertain. Nathalie left me one day, alone in this darkness again, like everyone else did. Why? I don't know. No, I know. I know why she left me. Yes I do. Many a time, in the past, she tried to give me a cue, through her hints. But, I, the ignorant and careless, kept my eyes shut. And now, here I am. Cold. Or may be sad. Or may be both. My brain tried, so many times, to explain to the heart ""she hates you!"". But guess what? My heart is ignorant. It doesn't agree. On the same streets, I turned back thinking that she might be waiving, again and again. Alas! I found no one. Tonight, on the same street, I mustered the courage to turn back again, and like always, I saw no one. It again wrecked me like card castle. So, I paced again! again to say hello to my best friend - the darkness! like I do always. **P.S. **: I am a 17 years old, a newbie from India who find, sometimes, difficult to convey his thought. English is hard for me. I make a lots of mistakes. I want to be the best. Please if you spot any error, do let me know. I'll improve. Thanks.:)",0
"Prompt: You accidentally discover the sentence of death ( a sentence that kills anyone who hears it except the speaker ) when you say it over national television. Story: ""The words. The words I mean -- *woops*. What else is there to say?"" The interviewer squirmed in his chair, as if he were nervous. ""**Well, why did you say them**?"" Six. Seven cameras pointed in my direction. Great. Who in their right mind approved this? I kill near two million people saying some mumbojumbo on national television and instead of slapping me with a prison sentence they ask me to do interviews. On national television. That's like giving a convicted jihadist a bomb and telling him to go pick you up some groceries at the Wal Mart. I looked at my interviewer dumbfounded for a moment. Then two. Then, ""Jesus Christ, how was I supposed to know that they were all going to die? I still remember being there, sure -- yes, in the newsroom -- reading that stupid prompter. Something happened. I happened. The machine glitched. I don't know. Hard to remember."" My head shook in disbelief. I hated these interviews. But my lawyer said they'd do a lot to prove my innocence. Make the people believe it was a total accident. So I rolled with it. Sure, whatever. I cleared my throat and continued. ""But I remember there was something on the prompter I couldn't quite read. So I just winged it. Made a half assed attempt. Did what any anchor who's had a few years in the business would have done."" ""**Which is? **"" said the interviewer, casually taking a sip from his Good Morning New York! coffee mug. ""Ever hear the saying ""the show must go on""? It gets to a point where you can't sweat the small stuff. I mean, everybody went quiet right after I said the words and I thought -- great, I've crossed that line. I've winged it a little *too* far and said something totally embarrassing. The station'll skin me. Whatever. I just wanted to get off air and head home to a glass of whisky."" I swallowed. This part was always the hardest to tell. ""Then I heard the thuds."" ""**Thuds? **"" ""Sure. Thuds. Like the sound of bodies hitting the floor? They were dropping all around me. I was in a daze. Then Emee hit the table beside me and -- and me? Don't look at me like that. What the hell was I supposed to do? I'm not a paramedic -- yes, I did a first aid course, but it's not like you remember that shit when you're in a situation that surreal. I thought I was next for gods sakes."" I took a deep breath and started patting down my jacket. The way this interview was heading I'd need every smoke left in my pack. The interviewer casually consulted the prompter before regurgitating another question I'd been asked a million times. **"" Do you have any idea why that sentence - the one that uh-"" ** ""Killed those people?"" I offered. **"" Precisely. Why it hasn't again succeeded in causing such widespread, horrific, and spontaneous death? ""** *Are you fucking kidding me*, I think. *Is this guy for real? * ""No idea. Do I look like a scientist to you? Try asking the guys at CERN or something. I was a weatherman. Now I'm a fucking murderer. I don't even wan na know why somebody felt the need to go ahead and try it out again. I don't know how it worked, or why it worked. All I know is it needs to be left alone."" I found my pack in my left chest pocket and weaseled my hand inside to pull them out. The interviewer made a loud show of clearing his throat. ""**So no idea as to what's behind any of this, then**?"" said the interviewer, casting a threatening glance at my cigarettes. *Like no shit, I realize I can't light one up in a studio. Only spent eight years working in one. * I ran a hand through my hair. I hated interviews. Interviews like this, where I got to spend the better part of a half hour reliving my mass execution of over a million people. What a great way to wind down on a Friday. ""Look, is this thing almost over wi --"" ^^^Thud. ^Thud. **Thud. ** Bodies started dropping everywhere around me again. In the distance all I could hear was the sound of corpses meeting the linoleum. In front of me my interviewer's form went limp and smashed onto the table between us, slack jawed. All life gone from his eyes. Not that there was much there to begin with. I took a smoke out of the pack and lit it -- it might've been satisfying, even, if I wasn't having a mental breakdown right then. Out of the corner of my eye I caught somebody on the street looking in at me. She was in rags, had dirt covering the majority of her face and looked like she got maybe three square meals a week. She was holding up a cardboard sign with a single word written in thick marker. I squinted to read it. ""*Horseman*"". Huh. I took a drag. Wonder what that's supposed to mean?",0
"Prompt: You have developed and ability to see how people will die when you look at them. Your entire life you avoided pictures of yourself, but today you forgot, and, brushing your teeth in the morning, looked in the mirror ... Story: ""Take him away."" The man dressed in white was handcuffed by a few angry policemen, each staring at him with hateful eyes. ""You're not going to kill anyone anymore, Rodriguez."" Rodriguez. The name of my newest client, finally appeared in my dreams, the medium of which I can tell how people's lives end. Many consider me a true psychic, other consider me a scam. I am what I am. I wake up slightly shivering. I have been doing this job for many years, but the fear of these dreams are still able to haunt me. I grabbed my phone and called him. ""Rodriguez. Meet me today later at.... ten thirty later at the cafe."" ""Sure thing, thanks a lot Mr. Aigo."" I tossed the phone, and walked slowly to the bathroom. Looking at the mirror, I took my towel and readied myself for a busy day. I was appointed to meet three. Terrence dies in a car crash, a blue honda Civic. Lilly dies by breast cancer. Yoshua dies of old age at 74. A man with grizzled hair and a pair of glasses -If only I remember the name- dies by a thief who stabbed him. I grabbed my phone and called them as I walked to the cafe. ""You're there already? Okay. Good bye."" I hung up as the phone was snatched from my hands. ""Hey!""",0
"Prompt: A man who has never seen nor heard of females before meets a woman who has never seen nor heard of males before Story: Foreword: Wow this turned out long, will have to break it up.... A bright light filled Kale's vision. he squinted and lifted his hand upwards toward a burning blue sky. ""What the?"" He mumbled back into consciousness. Pulling his hand out of the way to reveal a burning white orb. ""GAH!"" He pushed it back and sat up, glancing at his surroundings. Fleshy lime colored plants basked in the harsh light of the silver orb, filling the air with a strange organic smell. Kale pulled in a whiff and studied the thin forest and soft ferny ground he was lying in. ""Where the hell am I?"" He muttered and stood, trying desperately to block the intense light all around him, brighter than anything he had ever seen, so bad it seemed to burn his skin like the stoves at home.... home. Kale's instincts took over again and he scanned the surroundings. He reached down and pulled the standard L8 Laser pistol from his belt and did a circle. The landscape was so alien. The sky was cerulean, not indigo, the sun was white not orange, and the plants were green instead of red. This was very odd. ""How did I get here?"" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - As Kale walked through the undergrowth he tried to piece together the moments before he woke up. He could recall, something to do with combat, fighting YES, he was a solder. He rubbed the hard black composite of his flight suit.... a pilot. ""Gods!"" He groaned. ""My brain is like putty!"" He stopped as last operation came into focus. ""We were fighting along the Kappa Rim."" he managed. ""I was battling The Singularity at.... Syntax IV I think, The Singularity.... hmm.... my ENEMY! yes, a machine race with one mind.... okay, I was fighting, and my drive got shot out.... Commander Kugall advised me not to jump back to the carrier but I was leaking fuel..."" The last few memories pulled themselves together in an instant. ""I ripped."" Kale realized. ""Oh gods I ripped myself like an idiot!"" A flashback of an academy class on tras-light propulsion entered Kale's head. he couldn't remember the teacher's name. But the statement ""FTL drives are sensitive, never jump when it's damaged, or you might rip a hole right through reality, and spell a very rapid end to your military career."" Echoed pretty clearly now. ""I'm such an idiot."" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The silver sun set quickly, and soon Kale watched as a thin ring around the planet he was on come into focus in front of the twinkling stars. The ring was pale and blue, and left a creepy glow on the softly swaying plants. Something wasn't natural about this place, everything seemed to have eyes, everything seemed to watch him as he hiked. ""I just want to go back to Altair."" he muttered. Kale had done a circle of his wake up spot, and quickly found the remains of his SJ-12 Inquisitor. It was only the cockpit section, a seed shaped capsule that held all the now fried controls. Unsurprising, the fighter was never designed for atmospheric flight anyway. Only the pod could take the heat of an emergency reentry. He stripped it for the long range emergency beacon, food packs, binoculars, First Aid kit and the tactical hatchet before disguising the rest in fleshy leaves and abandoning it. ""Need to get my bearings."" Kale informed the air. Looking around, he picked a tall plant, something he was calling a ""Barb Stalk"" for now. It was the only thing that seemed to grow more than five meters, and was just a huge vertical root with giant fuzzy thorns sticking out of the side. Perfect for climbing. The stalk was hard unlike the other plants, and the fuzz held his boots as he climbed the ever narrowing trunk. Everything was so green here, even at night, the limey aura that clung to the landscape failed to cease. A cool gust shivered Kale's body through the suit as he reached the peak. Looking out, the hills rolled for kilometers, all the way to the horizon. Nothing seemed to be ahead of him, just darkness and trees. he glanced back, locating the rather tall hill with his craft on it. A large bright object was hovering above the area, spotlights trained on the spot he had left the Inquisitor. ""SHIT!"" he hissed. So much for this place being uninhabited. He considered running further away from the object, but then reconsidered. If this planet was used by The Singularity, then they already would have stripped it into a smooth, dead husk. This place must be some backwater Altarian base he had never heard of. There were thousands after all. Quickly he hiked back the distance he had made. Annoying, but the promise of civilization was too tantalizing. Slowly, Kale approached the site. Now filled with lights. He skirted the edge of the glare, looking in as six figures examined the craft. ""Doesn't look Singularity."" A high pitched voice spoke. Another next to him shrugged and kicked his pod, that bastard. ""Yeah, looks like it's plenty dead."" He hummed ""O'Leary, don't kick the Husk!"" A third hissed. ""You never know."" ""What do you think it came for?"" The shortest piped in. He almost laughed at the voice, he wasn't sure if that guy had been either been kicked the balls or swallowed a chipmunk. ""The space inside is clearly for a pilot."" ""Probably to assimilate us, steal secrets from some unsuspecting civilian hiker."" ""But how would it get back?"" The one that shouted at O'Leary pointed out, he seemed to be commander, and like the others, had a strange accent, from the Delta Quadrant maybe? ""It has no engines."" ""Well it just proves The Singularity is a crappy engineer!"" Kale already hated O'Leary. Kale watched silently as the squad bickered. He took a step forward satisfied they were safe. Crunch. ""WHATWASTHAT!?"" Chipmunk squealed like a baby, flailing a strange looking rifle in his direction. Kale scurried back in surprise at the boy. he caught a glimpse of long hair twirling as he did. Gods man calm down, what are you six? He wondered as the rest of the squad began to chuckle at Chipmunk. ""Claire seriously you need to lax girl. There won't be an Obon left in this forest when you're done."" Kale shook his head as he pulled the broken Barb Stalk sprout out of the rubber in his boot. Wouldn't wan na step on that in the morning...",0
"Prompt: Thanks to a bureaucratic error, you are now Satan. Story: *I didn't ask for this. In fact, I don't think anybody would have asked for this. And though I could always try and write this off with some pseudo-philosophical quote about having greatness thrust upon me or something about great power and great responsibility.... really all I want is my old, boring, life back. * **RRRRRNT RRRRRRNT RRRRRRNT** The alarm sounds as I slowly blink awake to the blood red stone ceiling above my bed. Slamming my fist into the top of the cheap, faux wood, motel room style alarm clock silences the grating buzzer that has awoken me from my one false nightmare to this real one. Two weeks now I've awoken to that damn alarm, two weeks of getting out of this bed made out of human bones, two weeks of brushing my teeth and shaving my face with blood instead of water.... and to think my ex said I wasn't ever open to trying new things. I guess I should back up to how I got here in the first place. It was a pretty normal Wednesday for me. I was a low level pencil pusher for EA Games. My day consisted of coffee, greasy food, and budget spreadsheets. It was dull, it was simple, it was easy. I wasn't a man of any particularly great ambition, always satisfied with the same work, the same desk, the same view, nothing could break me from my habits, or at least that's what I thought. It all started with an email. **Important Check In: Urgent** I still remember that subject line, the email that landed me in a literal circle of hell. ""You needed to see me?"" I said tentatively poking my head in my boss' door. ""Yes! Dave, please come in, have a seat. Oh and shut the door behind you"" *This was never good* ""So as you know, there's been a bit of a re-org in our accounting department. We've had to let go a number of good employees already..."" *They couldn't have been that good.... * ""But the good news is, there are a number of exciting new positions that you are qualified for. So I've gone and gotten you a promotion!"" That caught my attention. ""I'm sorry.... what? You're promoting me?"" I sputtered, trying to sound intelligent. ""Yes Dave, we're making you a department head. You'll have your own team, your own office, even your own bathroom. It's a huge step up and we just can't take No for an answer here Dave. So what do you think?"" That smile. That obligatory boss-smile. You know the one that never quite reaches a person's eyes? That's what was sitting across the desk from me. ""Uh.... yeah I gues-"" ""Great! This promotion is effective immediately, we've already got people moving your desk, so let me show you to your new digs!"" Edit: I'm going to keep going in pieces.",0
"Prompt: One day, while petting your cat, you accidentally pull his tail, and it opens up. Inside, there 's a USB connector. You connect it to your laptop, an announcement pops up. -Cat Version: 1.0.0. Update to 256.3? Story: “ Who's a good girl! Whoooo's a good girl! ” “ Muuurtt! Meorw! ” “ That's right YOU are! ” I loudly proclaim, ruffling my feline companions fur as she lolled around on my lap, basking in her glory. Pebbles purr rumbled powerfully as she rolled this way and that, nearly falling off my lap twice after arching her back for more back rubs. I could recognize the signs. Sometimes cats reached a state of too-much-happy before a switch flipped in their brain and they went nuts. And she was at her apex of happy. Before I knew it, Pebbles had my hand clasped in her paws and she was chewing on my fingers as if she never had a meal. “ Ouch! ” I said, wincing as her sharp canines dug into my flesh. “ Ok, that's enough attention for now. ” Flipping over, the little calico looked to the carpet and sprang down but not before getting one last back stroke. A stroke that apparently tugged a little too hard on her tail due to her angle of trajectory. A sharp yowl pierced the air as she darted a few steps away from me. Christ, did I pull that hard? “ Oh hon, I'm sorry! ” The sincere apology was not enough to spare me from an accusatory glare. “ Really I didn't mean to do that! ” My tone took a soft turn as I closed my eyes half way, trying to communicate in Cateese that I wasn't a threat. All I received was a tail tip twitch. *Sigh*. How normal. What wasn't normal was the subsequent *pic-CHINCK* noise that emanated from my cat's rump. Confusion melted into horror as I witnessed my beloved felines backside peeling open; her tail slowly lifting toward her spine, twitching angrily as it went, as her miniature tush hydraulics kicked in with an audible ‘ hhhhhsssssss ’. The silence that followed was deafening but ended when my ape like emotional response kicked in. “ What the FUCK? ” I exclaimed, flinging my arms wildly outward as a blur of fur dashed from the room, her hydraulics hissing with each spring and gradually fading into the bedroom. As she most certainly cowed under the bed, I remain paralyzed on the sofa, trying to rationalize what the hell I just saw. Cat butts do not separate from cats. Cat butts are cat butts. They stay put. They product foul smelly things I'm forced to scoop out of dirty kitty boxes. But they do not lift away from the body. Am I dreaming? *pinch* No. Drunk? Not unless Pebbles spiked my drink. I needed to investigate this further. Like usual, she was cowering under the bed, well out of my reach. It took much coaxing, pleading, three scratches to my hand, and six cat treats before I could extract her for examination. Setting her on the bed and pacifying her with more goodies, I leaned over see a port buried into her bum. Well, not her technical bum. Hell, the port appeared to be in the same plane as her butt, so how was she even going to the… Oh god, never mind. Sometimes details aren't necessary. Gripping her gently in my arms, I hauled her over to the computer to look at the ports configuration. Oddly it's a USB. How did this get installed on my cat without my knowledge? Was there some mad scientist out there performing cruel experiments on cats? How did this fly past the Humane Society? Were cats even real? Robots? Rubbing my eyes in bewilderment, I felt a fuzzy paw press into my stomach. “ Meorw? ” My green eyes met her amber ones and I could sense she wanted more treats. As I obliged, I reached for a USB cable to commit the unthinkable: plugging it into my cat's hinny. Pebbles didn't seem fazed in the slightest as I angled the device at her nethers then slid it into place. God I felt like I just violated the poor animal despite her having zero raction. Clutching the other end of the cable, a thought hit me. If this is real, what if she has viruses? I glanced wryly at her, pondering if that might be a reason she occasionally pees on my rug. Hmm. Not chancing it. Quickly I boot the computer into safe mode then plug her in. Before I could launch AVG and CCleaner, a popup automatically displayed on the monitor. “ Welcome to F.E.L.I.N.E. Model KT1000 Your current feline version is out of date. Your Cat Version: 1.0.0. Current Update 256.3 Would you like to update now? ” I blinked a few times. My cat… has an update? I glanced at Pebbles, who seemed to be eyeing the bag of salmon flavored nuggets again, then back to the screen. Well before I did that, perhaps I'll run the virus checker first. Might as well be safe, right? It took nearly two hours to come back with results: FeH1N5 FeLV-II That's… odd. She had her vaccinations as a kitten and was indoor only. How on earth did she get Feline Leukemia? *How on earth did she get a port in her butt? * My brain promptly thought. Mentally I shrugged and hit the button to isolate the virus. IF it would isolate it. To my surprise it did. Hovering my mouse pointer over the ‘ upgrade now'button, I gave my girl a quick pat of assurance then braced for, well, who knows what? At first Pebbles sat on the desk watching me, her ears flicking back and forth as the update bar very slowly progressed. But about a quarter of the way through, she suddenly stiffened. Instantly I shot to attention, watching as my poor baby fell over and began seizing horribly. “ PEBBLES?? ” I screeched, instantly pulling her into my lap as her tiny body tremored fiercely. “ Oh no! No, no, no, no, no! ” My eyes flew to the process bar, it's updates loading faster and faster as I scrambled at the mouse. My hand shot to the ‘ cancel'button and frantically clicked to terminate the update all together. This wasn't worth my cat's life! Why did I DO this? What *idiocy* prompted me to do this to my cat? Suddenly I took notice of how heavy she had become. Her once 8-pound frame had burgeoned twice her size. Her black and orange spots seemed more vibrant than before, with a strange alluring shimmer, while the texture of her fur rivaled that of the softest rabbit. Her body tremors eventually subsided, and I sat aghast at what transpired as I stroked her head and whispered, “ Please be okay! Please! ” Bordering on tears, my tummy felt the comforting sensation of two paws making biscuits before a voice filtered into my head. “ I'm okay. ” Confused, I reel back in my chair as Pebbles lifted her head to gaze at me. Her eyes were no longer pure amber but a mix of gold, orange, and reds that swirled around in a hypnotic manner. “ Thank you. You have cured me but, please, I need your help. *We* need your help. Or they will kill us all. ”",0
"Prompt: Everyone has a mark on their chest that is indentical only to their soulmate 's. Story: They used to say that everyone's got a partner. Someone out their to share their life with, to be together with until the end. That was before I was born. See, everyone has their mark. Everyone has that identifying insignia on the back of their right hand, the one that proves two people are meant to be together. Sure, people get in relationships anyway, and sure some people stay single anyway. The soul-mate lifestyle isn't for everyone. As for me, I'd love to have someone to call my own. Except, I don't have a mark. Where everyone else's hands have fancy symbols, some with intricate circular designs, other's looking angular and polygonal, my hand is simply bare. When I was born, the doctors had no idea what to make of me. In the end, they simply told my parents that I was a special case, and that I'd unfortunately never find love. All through my years, it was a source of many things; at times, humiliation. At others, pity and sympathy. I hated the feeling of people treating me so tenderly, yet I could never deny the truth; that I was destined to be alone. On one particular day, I was sipping a coffee at my local bookstore. They had a cafe there for people to eat as they read, and it combined two of my favorite things; being alone, and silence. Nobody ever bothered me here, and I relished the fact that I could be left in peace. ""Excuse me?"" I looked up to see a girl about my age standing awkwardly at the opposite end of my small table-for-two. She wore blue jeans, and a white and black hoodie where the sleeves covered most of her hands. ""I was wondering if you'd mind me sitting here? It's just that the other tables are taken, and there's nowhere else to sit-"" I was already waving my hand to singify it was fine with me. ""Sure, no problem here."" She smiled, and nodded her appreciation. Sitting down, she reached into a book-bag, and brought out a copy of ""Destiny"", some book that got popular lately because of its'Romeo-and-Juliet' kinda themes, where two people with matching marks came from opposing families and tried to be together. Simply rolling my eyes, I remained silent and continued sipping my coffee as I read my own book. Silence passed between us for a while, before she closed her book and sighed. Unexpectedly, she struck up a conversation. ""Well, that sucked."" I raised my eyebrows in surprise from her speaking. ""I'm sorry?"" She looked at me with this exasperated look in her eyes. ""My friend recommended this book to me, thinking I'd like it. Honestly though, it's all crap."" She leaned in closer to me. ""I mean, that's all anyone goes on about when love is talked about; everything revolves around the stupid marks on our hands. Is that really how we should base society?"" She gave a small huff of frustration. I couldn't think of anything to say. Obviously, I somewhat agreed with her. Soul-mates did tend to be perfect for one another, but I would never find one anyway. What kind of person would I be if I didn't disagree with the condemnation that had been given to me since I was born? ""Yeah, I think it's kinda dumb too."" Her eyes flashed, and I could see some sort of relief come over her. I don't know what came over me, but the next thing I knew, I was asking, ""What's your name?"" She smiled slightly. ""Charlotte. And yours?"" ""Tobias."" ""Well Tobias,"" she replied with a grin, ""it's nice to meet someone with a similar point of view."" A momentary beeping came from a wrist watch on her left hand, and she looked at the time. ""Aw, sorry. I've got somewhere to be."" She stood up to leave, and as soon as it had appeared, my temporary elation left me. I muttered a farewell, and turned back to my book. ""You know, this was fun. Do you come here often?"" I looked up again to see her looking expectantly at me. I stammered, ""Ev- every weekend."" She smirked. ""Well then, I'll see you next weekend?"" The next few weeks passed in a blur. No longer was I alone, I had found someone to spend my time with, to confide in. I knew that it would cease as soon as her soul-mate came around, but who knew? It could be a long time from now, and I wasn't going to turn away someone like her. She treated me like an equal, not as something to feel sorry for, and I loved it. At our meetings, we always read together, talked about various things, and laughed together. After the first month, I knew I liked her. After the second, I figured that this was the closest thing I could possibly have to finding my soulmate. One day as we sat there, I was laughing at something she'd said when she became very serious. ""Hey, do you remember the first time we met? When we talked about love being based on our marks?"" I stopped laughing and nodded slowly. ""Yes.... if I remember, we agreed that it wasn't the best system?"" She nodded, and looked down. ""What if you met someone that didn't share your mark, and you truly loved them, but then your soulmate came into your life?"" She looked up with a sort of sad look in her eye. ""Would you leave them for your soulmate? Or stick with the relationship you'd made?"" I felt my world crumbling around me. This was it; Charlotte had found her soulmate, and she was going to leave me. I just started shaking my head. ""I should've know this would happen..."" I muttered. ""What?"" asked Charlotte, with a confused look on her face. ""Are you alright?"" I sighed. ""Look, I understand that I've likely just been filling a hole for you, something to occupy your time until your true match came along."" She said nothing, her mouth simply a small'o'. ""I just want to say that honestly, you've made me a lot happier than I've been in a long time. You kept me company, you treated me like an equal.... I'm happy that you found someone."" I looked up with a sad smile on my face, only to raise an eyebrow in bewilderment when she shook her head. ""No, not me! I was wondering about you! Would you leave someone?"" I jerked in surprise before busting out laughing. ""Ha! Sorry, but I don't have the luxury of even a choice like that. My life is destined to be lived out alone."" I'd never shown her my hand out of fear that she'd simply feel pity for me like the others, but I decided to finally reveal my secret. I reached forward, and pulled pack the sleeved of my right arm, displaying my bare hand. As I did so, both of Charlotte's hands flew to her mouth as her eyes widened in shock. I smiled sadly. Yep, here came the sympathy. I damned myself for allowing yet another person to see me as nothing more than a pity-case. Slowly, she reached her left hand up to her right hand, and pulled back the sleeve which had so carefully before hidden her hands. It was only then that I noticed something of monumental proportions. The back of her hand was absent of any mark either. In stunned silence, the two of us sat there staring at each other, realizing that we'd both likely been told the same thing from birth; that neither of us would ever find our soulmate, and would wander the world alone forever. And yet, here we had been, cursing the system while sitting next to each other for months. After a while of letting the realization sink in, I cleared my throat. ""So, uh.... we still good for next weekend?""",0
"Prompt: Boreal. Story: The man stood on the prow of the boat, as the northern winds whipped against his face. The old boatman shivered, he had ferried travelers, merchants and adventures alike across this lake for years now, but he had never seen one quite like this before. The man was tall and broad of shoulder, made larger by the myriad of furs wrapped about his body to stave off the chills of the winter winds. His hair was a long and unkempt snarl of brown that looked at home among the thick pelts that surrounded his neck. Such features were not strange to the boatman though. You see plenty of large hairy men in the northern provinces as the north did not cater well to any other type. No, what was strange to the boatman was the manner of the man before him. The boatman had done his job for so long the cold was naught but a nuisance to him on most days. The ever blowing wind that cuts straight to the bone of most men was a friend of his now. Most storms he could weather with a smile on his face and a song upon his cracked lips, but this night was different. Tonight was a chill so bitter that it seemed as though the God of Winter was wrapping the world in his embrace, and the closer they came to the frosty palace before him the colder it seemed to get. Yet the man before him never once shivered, never once broke his gaze from the palace ahead. If the boatman hadn't seen the slight rise and fall of his breathing, he would've assumed to man to be dead and frozen stiff. *He must have a soul like a furnace to keep him warm in this chill, * the boatman mused as he steadily stroked the icy black water, bringing them ever closer to the town of Farrowind, and the palace of it's king. The man had heard stories of this town, heard many a tale of the tyrant who came to this land long ago to subjugate its people. The king was fabled to wield the power of winter itself, and could conjure frost and ice at a whim. Some stories said he was a demon of ice in human form, still others said that the ruler of Farrowind was the God of Winter himself, come to walk the earth and fulfill his promise of the winter without end. The man however, knew better. *It has to be him* the man thought to himself. After countless dead ends and petty mages, this had to be the real thing. The man broke his gaze to look down at his palm. A small flame flickered to life above his hand, dancing hypnotically in the wind. He curled his hand into a fist snuffing the flame and looked back towards the palace. *I'm coming for you brother, and this time you will not deserve my mercy. *",0
"Prompt: Stuck on a small island surrounded by eerie mist, you quickly discover the only thing that is keeping you safe is the bright revolving lights coming from the lighthouse. Story: We had rented kayaks for the day. Paul had done it the summer before with a friend and I was depending on his expertise. The plan was to head out to a small touristy island, spend the day exploring, maybe find a place that sold gelato or saltwater taffy then head back before dark. But the kayak part was taking longer and we were only now getting close to the island and it was already pretty late, My arms ached from the work out and Paul and I had gotten too far away. I'd seen him land pretty far down the island. I tried to head closer to him but the current had pulled me steadily further away from him. I couldn't even see him anymore as the sun had set and only the faint remains of the sunset were visible. I pulled into the abandoned looking beach. The tourist side must be on the other side. This part looked pretty abandoned. There was even a chewed up looking deer carcas on the beach. There was chilly fog that blew through obscuring things. At first I thought that it was my imagination but as I walked up the beach I realized that I was being followed. There were strange small two legged creatures that reached up to my thigh or so. They chattered to each other in a series of high pitched chirps and clicks, seemingly calling each other towards a chase. Several more appeared and seemed to be closing in on me. They had large luminous eyes, razor sharp teeth, and long thin tongs that flicked over their teeth and lips as they closed in. I tried to keep a slow pace, thinking if I ran, it would just be more dangerous. A beacon-like light hit and the creatures gasped and sputtered drawing back away from the light. I could just make out on the hill ahead of me a lighthouse. The rotating lights from it seemed to repel the creatures. I made towards twit trying not to break out into a run. I did not have much stuff on me. I had a small waterproof bag containing a wallet, my cell phone (sadly dead batteries), and a small thing of mace. I gripped the mace in my right hand and worked to stay towards the light. The things were still tailing me but we're keeping a distance from the light. I called out for Paul and kept going towards the lighthouse.",0
"Prompt: The world 's oldest, most powerful wizard has had enough of his life. After two thousand years of adventure and magic he desires normalcy. Today is his first day at work as a janitor for an office building. He 's determined to fit in and not use his powers. How does it go? Story: I thought I was a master of myself. Two millennia have gone since my apprenticeship began. Discipline beyond comprehension drilled so deeply into the core of my mind. I have outlasted trees in stubbornness, I have meditated upon the rise of a hill as I sat upon it over a century and a half. I am known in the inner circles of my guild as the inventor of seventeen types of meditation, three of which are taught only to those wizards who have mastered their crafts and proven their trustworthiness with matters as delicate as flower petals and as sensitive as a baby's tum. How could I have been so wrong? How could I have missed the rending of the spirit that would come with my decision to abandon my life? I have divested myself of everything I thought I knew, and now I risk it all. I know that if a glimmer of magic crosses the tips of these fingers, I will have lost my very lifesource. I know that my fate is sealed, that my only path now is forward into this life of my own choosing, this noose of an existence, and yet.... even with that knowledge, my discipline is faltering. Fire, blistering ice, purification spells, they are so close, so tantalizingly close, that I am forced now to meditate and turn all of my spiritual force toward their avoidance.... my tongue works soundlessly behind clenched teeth as spells cross my mind in spite of myself. I have had to bind my left thumb to my wrist, as I caught myself beginning the Clasp of Zim on more than one occasion, quite against my own volition. I have never been closer to defeat. Another! Yet another! The Curse of motherFUCKING Ramrod skitters across my consciousness. It feels as though I have been in this life more than the last, and yet I know by their primitive timepieces that it has scarcely been three days. I am faltering. How? How can it be possible that these meagre beings have mastered this infuriating art and I (I!) can not perform this simplest of tasks? I will take my first repose soon, an hour, and call it a moral victory at the very least, for not having crumbled under this searing frustration, this white-hot crush of violent rage, this- ""Rick!"" ""Rick!"" I can not face him. I can not face this man in such dismal failure. I have avoided him now for three days. I have avoided the unveiling of my shame for three nights. I am not mentally prepared to suffer the wrath of this puny being. I fear that his first misstep will cause me to end myself by summoning a basilisk to eat him. ""Rii-iick!"" Oh dear god, does he think I am a lost pet? Does he dare summon Ri'kzla as though I have slipped his attention during a woodland hike? ""Rick! Holy hell man, where have you been?"" Dear gods, I am found. ""You're in the weirdest kind of trouble. The boss has been looking for you since Monday afternoon.... you okay man? You look.... holy shit dude, you look fucking wrecked. Did you wax and buff all the floors on every wing since Monday? You know we only do those once every six months on a rotation, right? Nancy on the children's ward tell me she saw you shimmying across window ledges buffing the windows without any harness. That.... well, I was going to say that can't be right, but I don't think I've ever been able to see out these windows at all for all the soot caked on it, so.... wait, is that the only rag you have?"" ""Silence."" ""The fuck are you talking about, silence? Listen Ricky, security has been tying themselves in knots trying to figure out what ghost keeps disarming the security systems after hours, the boss was about three minutes from deleting your file because he thought you were some sort of drifter, and now.... Have you been here.... all this time.... Wait. Seriously, I am only seeing that one black rag in your hand. The windows on this place have been buffed shiny, but.... I haven't noticed a missing trolley. Where's the rest of your stuff? Dude? YO!"" *Ri'kzla stared and slowly his mouth began to tremble. The words kept resounding in his ears. * the *only* rag? the *only* rag? Could it.... could they be so rudimentary? Can they possibly have to replenish something so simple as a rag? Do they not have eternal cleansing as the elves do? Or for that matter Mammoth cloth, as the wood trolls have used for aeons? How could I have been so.... so stupid? ""Speak to me Rick..."" ""Did you say, trolley? What is.... a trolley"" ""Yeah, you know, with the fresh rags and window cleaning solution-"" ""You.... you have.... potions for..."" ""Potions? Ha! Yeah that's right Dumbledore. Windex potion for the inside and another potion for the outside. You're fucking weird man."" ""And these potions.... do they prevent streaks?"" ""Well.... I use old newspapers if I really want a shine, but yeah they're pretty good. Are you okay man?"" He knew he was sinking, but he also knew it didn't matter. The spells were relegated back to the depths of his inner vault. His relief flowed through him like fatigue at a mountain's summit. He would learn. How could he have been so stupid? How could he have succumbed so thoroughly to pride, and assumed that life's eternal lesson would cease simply because he was amongst these simpletons? He felt the coldness of the floor against his cheek as the darkness enveloped him. He slept, secure in his newfound path. He would learn to master these windows with the help of the trolley and the potions. ""You, uh.... you can't really sleep.... well, I guess nobody really comes up here much anymore anyway. You're gon na get carpal tunnel if you keep your thumb tied up like that.... You're a weird guy Ricky. I'll just tell the boss you went home.""",0
"Prompt: You ca n't die until your name is spoken for the last time. Story: Emily pointed to a picture of a little old lady, wrinkled in her rocking chair, knitting what appeared to be a sock. Or maybe it was a sweater. I couldn't really tell. ""Mommy, who is that lady?"" Her sweet little voice asked. I smiled, and flipped the picture over, the name barely registering in my mind. ""That's your great-great grandmother, sweetie,"" I said, and put the picture back in the box. I wasn't here to reminisce, I was looking for a baby picture of my mother- the woman's granddaughter. Emily picked up the colored picture I'd put back down and studied it, flipping the page over. My little 5 year old scrunched up her beautiful blue eyes and read out loud, sounding out the words, ""Lou.... Louis.... Lou-Louise Rog-Rogers.... Mommy, that's Nana's last name!"" ""Of course it is, darling."" I dumped more pictures out, flipping through them in a hurry. I didn't realize we'd have so many pictures of this woman. I'd never met her. My mother barely remembers her grandmother. I wonder if I should throw them out. Emily grabbed hold of a handful, her studious face lighting up. ""Mommy, Mommy! Louise doesn't look wrinkly in this picture. Look, she has your eyes! They're blue, like yours! *Mommy, look! *"" She whined. Knowing that my daughter wears her heart on her sleeve, I really wanted to tell her that Sweetie, Mommy didn't care, but I obliged and gave it a quick glance. Huh, I guess we do share the same cobalt-blue eyes. And face shape. And hair color. And cheekbones. That's weird, I'd never looked that closely at my great-grandmother's old pictures.... ""Can I keep them?"" Emily asked, her whole face lighting up. ""Why, Em?"" ""Because I want to. And she's pretty, like you are. I wan na grow up to be just like you. And her. And Nana. And Aunt Marie. And-"" ""Yes, love, you can put them with your other pictures."" Excited, she ran off with an armful of pictures, I presume to go show her father. Rolling my eyes, I got back to my search. ""Louise..."" I muttered, setting aside another old photo for Em. *A faint, little voice whispered in my ear, stuttering. Louise Rogers.... Another, stronger voice, quietly whispered, Louise.... I hadn't felt a jolt like this since I died.... Oh, I wish I could be left alone. But I'm terrified. I hadn't quite entered the eternal abyss of darkness, as terrifyingly comforting as it may seem. I longed to join my ancestors to keep watch over the family and generations I've created but I'll never meet, just like the people in my family before me.... They're long forgotten, and I hope that I will be too one day.... * *My name isn't murmured again until what feels like an eternity later, with the resounding finality that I've longed for. A clear, sweet vision of relief lets me see the last time my name is whispered. * A young woman is in a hospital bed, clearly worn out, a man and woman by her side. In her arms is a wrinkled bundle of skin with a bright pink cap. ""What is her name?"" Another woman in green asks, holding a pen and paper. ""Louise,"" the exhausted young lady in the bed says, smiling, looking at her newborn child, not even an hour old. *And then I realize, my name is not my name anymore.... It belongs to my great-great-great granddaughter.... I can finally rest. And watch over the new little girl that now carries the name that was mine. * *Louise.... *",0
"Prompt: You and your cohorts have pulled off your heist as planned. Later, in your hideout, you see TV reports that the payload you hijacked is lethally radioactive Story: The small screen was glowing in the darkened room. I did my best to block out the sounds coming from the adjoining kitchen, and read: ""Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness or radiation toxicity, is a constellation of health effects which present within 24 hours of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation. The radiation causes cellular degradation due to damage to DNA and other key molecular structures within the cells in various tissues; this destruction, particularly as it affects ability of cells to divide normally, in turn causes the symptoms. The symptoms can begin within one or two hours and may last for several months."" *Fuck, * I thought. I flicked my thumb upwards on the screen (*how the fuck was that so painful? *) and read some more, my eyes barely able to focus, the pulsing of my blood a source of tangible pain in every inch of my body. ``.... nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain are usually seen within two hours. Vomiting in this time-frame is a marker for whole body exposures that are in the fatal range above 4 Gy. Without exotic treatment such as bone marrow transplant, death with this dose is common.... Neurovascular syndrome typically occurs at absorbed doses greater than 30 Gy (3000 rad), though it may occur at 10 Gy (1000 rad). It presents with neurological symptoms such as dizziness, headache, or decreased level of consciousness, occurring within minutes to a few hours, and with an absence of vomiting. It is invariably fatal."" *Fuck you, Jimmy Wales, * I thought, and weakly threw the phone across the room. It didn't go far, and tumbled with a soft thump on the carpet. My cheek felt like it was on fire after having been pressed into the carpet for so long. I lifted my head as much as I could and saw that I'd been drooling blood. There was a dark puddle in the carpet. My mouth felt sticky, but I couldn't move my tongue enough to tell if I'd accidentally chewed through my cheek, or just vomited up blood again. The retching started in the kitchen again, along with a wet splattering sound, like someone pouring soup onto the ground. I listened as long as it went on - it wasn't like I could do much else - and then listened some more as the heaving, pain-riddled sobs resumed where the vomiting left off. *Invariably fatal, * I thought. *That's not so bad. * I shut my eyes, the lids seeming to rub against my corneas like sandpaper, and did my best to go to sleep, hoping against hope that I wouldn't wake up again.",0
"Prompt: `` What? Of course I 'm not dead! '' Story: I tried once again to sit up from the cold metal table, but the Undertaker's assistant held me down and another grabbed my legs. I kicked out at them and tried to struggle free. ""Jesus, I told you people I'm still alive, what the hell are you doing?"" At last the undertaker turned to face me and with a wave of his hand his goons stepped back and released me. I swung my legs over the edge of the table and faced the man who seemed to be in charge. He was a tiny man, hardly over four foot tall and with a pronounced limp as he walked in a circle around the table. The room was cold, but the clipped German tones echoed into the tiled walls and made me shiver. ""I'm qvite afraid zat it eez impossible Meester..."" He checked a clip board. ``.... Jones. Ve have the medical records from ze hospital here and it quite clearly states that you died during surgery."" He shook his head sadly. ""Vat a waste of a young life."" He nodded and the assistants stepped forward and grabbed me again and began to force me back onto the table. ""Please, there has been a mistake, I'm clearly not dead!"" My back was now pressed into the table and I felt a strap flip over my head and a second around my chest and then a moment later they tightened until I could no longer move. I felt the hands disappear and I tried to sit up, but I was quite trapped. To the side there was a faint scrabbling noise and I could just make out the form of the Undertaker as he struggled to get up onto the step that had been set up at the side of the table, but at last he made it and suddenly loomed over me. ""I can pay, I have money, my family would pay anything to see me alive again. I don't even know why I am here."" I strained against the straps, but they were thick leather and did not move. He reached out now and grabbed my face, twisting it one way or another, pulling down my eye lids and gazing deeply in the back of my eyes. All throughout his examination he muttered quietly to himself in a mixture of German and English, only the odd word loud enough for me to hear. ""Ze temporal lobe region will be quite anpassungsfähig, aber wir brauchen mehr Platz auf der rückseite."" He shook his head, ""Zis vill just hav to do!"" He was gone and I heard him jumping down and then his tiny feet pattering around the room and out of the door. Straining I could just make out the assistants who still stood silently. ""Please, help me, I'll do anything."" There was a pause and then one appeared over me, blocking out the light from above. He spoke in a thick gruff English accept, his voice deep and gravelly. ""You need to shut the fuck up, mate. Dead men aren't supposed to speak and you're beginning to piss off the boss."" I tried not to sound too pathetic, it seemed like a trait that would go down badly with this man. ""Please, just tell me where I am, or why?"" I could see it slowly filtering through his brain and at last he came to some sort of conclusion. ""You're fucking dead. Now shut up."" It was not the conclusion I had hoped for. A moment later the Undertaker returned and scrabbled back up to the table. Clenched in his hand was a metal tray with a range of saws and scalpels. I tried not to scream. I failed. Somewhere in the distance I could hear the undertaker, whoever the fuck he was, counting in German down from ten. ""zehn, neun, acht, sieben, sechs, fünf...."" The world began to swim and go faint; it darkened shrank to a point and I heard my screaming stop and at last the world was black.",0
"Prompt: Your name is Death. You work 168 hours a week as the reaper of souls on planet Earth. You 're living on just a couple bucks above minimum wage, you like to travel, you have a crush on the reaper on planet Xenor and you secretly take 4 sugars in your coffee. Today is your first ever day off. Story: *I could.... no* *Ahh! Perhaps.... not that either* Death sits at a smal circular table -- room for one -- tapping slowly on the unpolished wood, he alternates between his left and right pointer finger. Death is frowning, keeping a careful eye on the delicate process of tapping he has taken up. He looks up throwing his hands behind his head breaking the tempo. Death blows softly at his ethereal hood that has fallen over his eye sockets. The black cloth flutters up, but is snagged down by the rest of his outfit the same thin fabric encompassing him and draping the corners of his chair -- unpolished like the table -- and brushing the floor. A clock continues Death's tapping tempo with a clalm muffled, tick. *You think after 200,000 years I'd have some thing I'd always dreamed of doing* *I mean there's nothing wrong with doing nothing today, right? * Death sits up looking towards the rather small T.V. playing static diseased infomercials for a sponge. He drops his hands to his sides and plops his head on the table. *Lazy Sunday. Right? * Death runs one bony finger in a circle on the once white -- now a dull gray -- tile floor. A thin white cat hops up onto the only other chair at the table and begins to clean its self. *Its almost like I want to go back to work. * Death lets out a long grown, the cat perks its ear up and hops up onto the table. It's sits at the center staring at Death. Death places his chin on the table and returns the cats gaze. *What if I asked someone. * *Like a human. * Death stands up siding the chair backwards along the floor producing a rickety sharp squeal. The cat hops off the table. Death turns to the refrigerator handle, held on by duck tape and a crudely cut piece of plywood he swings it open a sickly yellow light enters the dim room, he drinks from a carton of orange juice. *Who? And what would I say? * *Oh! Mabye that kid! Uhh what was his name.... Marty-Mikey -- Micheal! That's it. * Death places the Orange juice on the table and resumes his former position now staring at the carton. Two weeks ago he had visited a kid choking on his own vomit from a herion O.D., much to Death's surprise the kid had pulled through as he waited on the couch and stumbled over to sit next to him. ""Well that was intresting wasn't it?"" ""Fuck,"" the kid grumbled clutching his throat still spitting out blood. Death had always had opportunities to talk to people on the job, but he never knew what to say, it always ended in him awkwardly taking their souls. He liked this kid, something about his pale dry skin, thin limbs, and shitty living conditions, reminded him of himself. ""I guess I have to go now, you know souls to reap and what not, what's your name"" ""Michael, Fuck"", Michael doubled over clutching his stomach coughing up blood, the veins on his arms bulging and pulsing rhythmically with his coughs. As far as Deaths conversations with humans had gone, that one was pretty good. Deciding to see if Michael had any suggestions for him, Death exits his apartment. The cat puts the orange juice back in the fridge and resumes cleaning its self on the chair opposite Deaths. Death materializes in a compact bathroom, corners blackened with mold, and a cracked mirror reflecting a sink with two neatly placed needles. He crosses the room in one stride and opens the door. He turns to see the apartment in the same condition as two weeks prior, chip bags and pizza boxes far and few between crumpled clothes and card boxes full of uncategorizable junk. Michael sits on the dark green coach with the one cushion broken and bleeding foam from its corner a stain on the armrest next to it. Michael turns to the door opening. ""Oh shit"" ""Hey"" Death shuffles through the cluttered floor and sits down next to Michael and looks to the T.V. Michael looks back to the T.V. his eyes wide he looks at a needle on the three legged coffee table to his left. Then slowly back to the T.V. ""Shit, I am really high"" ""Really?"" Michael turns back to Death. ""I guess so, I don't remember taking any, but I guess so"" ""I actually had a question to ask you, Michael"" Death shifts on the couch he puts his arms on his knees and looks to Michael who is now staring at his hands. Still staring at his hands Michael asks, ""Uhh what? "" ""What should I do on my day off"" ""Umm I really don --"" ""Well like what do you do on your day off, I haven't really ever had one"" ""I don't know I usually just do some dope"" ""Hmm"" Death looks back to the T.V., Michael up from his hands. ""Are you real?"" ""I guess"" ""So you came here a couple weeks ago and watched me almost die on the floor right"" ""Ya, you were pretty close too I don't usually get called for close calls"" Michael sits back in the couch, it creeks. ""So your on your day off from what?"" ""Reaping souls"" ""Right"" ""And you"" ""I just work the night shift at the 7/11 on the corner"" Death nods his head the T.V. Flickers as it cuts to commercial. ""How much do you make?"" Michael squints his eyes at Death. ""Umm, $ 7.60"" ""Oh, me too"" Michael nods looking back to the T.V. ""So what do other humans do on their days off"" ""I guess it varies, some people might go to the movies or something"" ""I'll try that"" Death pulls himself off the couch and stands watching the T.V. ""Uhh, ok. Tell me how it goes"" ""Sure"" Death side steps around a hamper and out the door. Michael picks up a crumb covered plate from his feet and looks at the T.V. As Death closes the door. He looks around his apartment blinking. He turns on the light on the three legged coffee table.",0
"Prompt: Start with `` Everyone knew trying to run was futile, yet so far all of them tried anyway '', end with `` I do n't make the rules, I just enforce them. '' Story: Everyone knew that trying to run was futile, yet so far all of them had tried anyway. ""Runner!"" bellowed the head marksman. The four apprentice archers by his side loaded their crossbows, as they always did, aimed and followed the rebel. ""Fire!"" Four arrows flew toward the elderly gentlemen simultaneously. The first hitting his thigh, knocking him to the ground and covering him in a cloud of dust where presumably the other three arrows hit, producing screams of pain. ""Good job boys, the wolves will finish him off"". The dust cleared and the man lay in a pool of blood, his hands clutched to his chest where an arrow had pierced his body. Why do they run? It isn't so bad here. My papa often told us bedtime stories of the wilderness that lay beyond the gates but there was no truth in them, there couldn't be. Stories of warriors and their fair maidens, of how the sun would disappear behind a bottomless pool of water larger than the River Mudd and stories of a paradise where every man was his own and did what he liked. The thoughts took over me when I was just five years old, but they were only stories. What lay beyond our citadel was a wasteland. A blood-drenched wasteland of savage men upon savage beasts. Where else would all our resources go? The coal from the burrowing mines below our feet, the wood from the huge oak forests surrounding the citadel and the various concoctions made by the housewives in the greenhouses... it was all for the Great War, *obviously*. It was almost sunrise, I'd oiled crossbows and shaped bolts all night long. My hands were blackened and my joints stiff. ""Alright laddy, off you go"". I was dismissed... but I couldn't go home to bed just yet. The school huts weren't the most pleasant creations in the citadel. It was understandable, I guess, supplying the Elders with supplies was far more important than learning about reading and numbers. As soon as I turned twelve on my next birthday, I was destined for the walls as an archer. My papa told me it was the bravest of the jobs in the citadel - to protect the walls from the savage men and to stop the rebels from the city joining them. ""How was your night killing innocent people?"" teased Aeri. She was older than me by two years. A know it all. ""I'm not in the mood."" I yawned in reply, rolling my eyes. ""Do you never question what you're doing?"" she asked, ""are you that stupid?"" ""Excuse me?"" she couldn't be serious. ""If it wasn't for **us** protecting you, you would be **dead**"". ""Do you just believe everything you're told, Seamus?"" she giggled hysterically. ""Do you really think we've been fighting a war for all this time?"" ""Of course we have!"" I stamped my foot. How dare she question the Elders. Some people just didn't get it. ""Where do the rivers go, Seamus? Where do the men go? What's out there that they don't want us to see?"" I could feel the blood pumping through my veins, I could just reach over there and slap- the school bell sounded. She skipped off and looked back at me, and grinned at my puzzled state as I began to question for myself what was really out there. The school yard was empty, I rushed inside before the lesson started, but the thought bugged me all day long. As it got to lunch time and the thoughts of what to eat made every other thought inferior, there was no point questioning what happened beyond the wall, I was safe here. It wasn't my problem and that didn't bother me. I don't make the rules, I just enforce them.",0
"Prompt: In the heat of a battle, a soldier stops to save a young child that wandered onto the baddlefield. Story: battlefield but whatever. Pvt. McCoy pressed himself up against a crumbling stone wall. A Jerry machine gun sprayed the alley way wall opposite him. He had become lost in the corridors and back alleys of the small Norman town when artillery had began to pound it to snuff out the G.I.s advance into Nazi territory. McCoy had run down an alley and dove behind a knocked out armored car to escape the hail of shrapnel. He hid from the flying fragments for what seemed like hours. When the shelling stopped, he wiggled out from under the burned out hulk to find that his comrades had moved on some time before the barrage ended, the only evidence of their presence being a few cigarette butts and.30 caliber shell casings. He wondered through out the town, now eerily silent, until the MG 42 drove him into cover. Bullets chewed into the stone next to him and across from him, showering McCoy with fragments of stone. A flash of movement caught his eye, a mother was running down the street caring a bundle, and practically dragging a toddler behind her. ""NO! STOP! GET BACK!"" he screamed at her, but she either couldn't understand him or didn't hear him. The Jerry swung his gun and pulled the trigger. A stream of tracer chewed into the mother, blood exploded from her into a crimson cloud, the bundle fell to the ground and her body fell atop the toddler. Pvt. McCoy, vision blurring through tears, could only watch as the Jerry fired another burst into the corpse. In the silence that followed, McCoy thought he heard a child crying, then there was a movement under the body. The child was still alive! In that moment, Pvt. McCoy forgot all his training as an infantryman and ignored every instinct that millennia of human existence had pounded into his genome to keep him alive. All that mattered to Pvt. McCoy was that child's life. McCoy stuck his head around the corner and saw the smoking barrel of the Machine Gun jutting from a second story window. He pulled back primed a grenade and stepped out of the safety of the alley. McCoy, back in the states, had been a starting second baseman at his high school. The grenade flew through the window and detonated in a flash of white phosphorus. A Jerry screamed as white hot flakes began burrowing into his skin and smoke billowed from the building. Pvt. McCoy dashed into the street, firing bursts from his m3 in the general direction of the Jerrys as he sprinted towards the remains of the mother. He slid to his knees when he neared her and grasped what remained of her shirt to roll her off her child. He belatedly realized that the bundle she had dropped was bleeding. The sobbing child momentarily forgotten, he pulled down the blanket that swaddled bundle. Inside was an infant, its tiny skull caved in by the fall. Pvt. McCoy almost threw up on the spot, but he managed to suppress the urge to hurl his guts across the remains of the mother and child and scooped up the toddler. He sprinted back to the alley way clutching the child to his chest knowing that every second he wasn't in cover was another second for a Jerry to put a bullet into him and the child. He practically dove behind the wall. ""It's going to be okay,"" he whispered to the toddler when they were finally safe, ""It's going to be okay"" McCoy didn't know who had more tears on their face, him or the child who had just lost what remained of his family",0
"Prompt: `` He was never warm in his entire life. Not once. '' Story: Everything around him was warm, soothing, comfortable. Everything he needed was brought to him at will. It was good. However, one day he started to notice that the walls seemed to be slowly closing in around him. At first he thought is was all in his mind, but as the days went on his world felt smaller. The food was still there, the warmth, but the freedom he'd enjoyed began to be restricted, slowly suffocating his movements. Soon after that discovery, when he though there could be no more room left, a terrible rumble sounded around him. It was the loudest thing he'd ever heard and it started to build. Louder. More often. Louder, more often. And that's when the shaking started. He was thrown around, somehow turned this way and that as he felt the walls truly start to compress against him. He had no control, the world was shifting around him, and he felt only the sense falling. He tried to scream, but this voice failed him. Terror gripped his heart, would this be the end, he wondered as his world shook and closed in around him. Is this my end? Suddenly, a blast of cold hit him causing him to wince against the sensation. The pressure building near his head and the cold below and he felt the darkness creep into him. He felt like he might be drowning when suddenly a massive hand appeared and grabbed him. Maybe he would be saved after all! However, even with his rescuer's help, the pressure continued to build as the cold slowly encased his body. Screaming was all he had left before the final moment of peace took him. The last words he heard were: ""We're not going to lose him! Call ^the ^^neonatal ^^^ICU ^^^^right ^^^^^NOW!"" He never heard his name or felt the sun on his face. He was never warm in his entire life. Not once.",0
"Prompt: Begin and end your story with this sentence: `` And yet, the city remained. '' Story: ""And yet, the city remained..."" ""Oh my God Adam,"" my mother groaned. ""Seriously, you just had a four day weekend."" I stared out the window of the minivan, or as I more aptly named it, *the chariot of suffering. * It was the vehicle that brought me to the prison of my despair. Be deceived not by it's lime green exterior or it's pleather seats, or it's.... ""Are you doing that goddamn dramatic monologue in your head again?"" ""No,"" I said. I tried to be convincing, but could not call upon my soul to fill my voice with the deceit of enthusiasm, of childish youth and love and life. My life was lost the moment the weekend ended. ""Yes you are,"" she argued. ""You're doing that stupid thing with your hand again."" I watched as my fingers slowly slid down the glass window, raking at the beautiful world just beyond my reach. ""No I'm not."" Clouds formed in the sky above me. Ephemeral marvels. Muses of creativity brought forth into the world by the life energy of Mother Earth herself.... and yet they remain far from me. The wind that gently swept them across the sky -- I could not feel it on my face while trapped in this morbid bubble! ""I'm not rolling down the window,"" she announced. *How did she know? * ""Last time I did that you jumped out."" ""No I didn't."" ""Look,"" she sighed. ""You've only got four days of school this week. And then you can go to the beach or the park or play your stupid video games all weekend. Just please,"" and here she turned to look at me over her shoulder. ""No more of this Shakespearean tragedy stuff for, like, the ten minutes that I'm driving you to school."" Shakespeare was a hobbling commoner, I thought to myself, as silently as I could. ""Or whatever the hell poet you listen to now."" ""How do you keep reading my mind?"" I asked, furious. ""You pick it up at some point after pre-calculus,"" she said, nonchalantly as she backed her minivan in between two Fords. ""Now get out and actually do good for once. I don't believe in you, but I *will* whoop your ass if you make Ms. Mahoney cry again."" ""Farewell, mother,"" I moaned, as I slid open the heavy steel door of my transport vessel. ""Don't make any more enemies,"" she said. ""Hello Adam,"" Jimmy said. He didn't actually say it. He nodded at me. But that's what it meant. He was waiting in front of the steps to our history class. ""Quiz today,"" he actually *said* said. ""Queen didn't share cake. Peasants cut her head off. That's all I read."" ""To think, they make us suffer through this five days a week,"" I complained. ""They trap us like sheep, but with economy seating. They test us and bury us if we fail their *quizzes. * The French revolted because they weren't given cake. Cities were razed. Regicide committed in the name of freedom from oppression. And yet here we remain, subjects of daily abuse in the modern day. We should have burned this city to the ground by now!"" Jimmy shrugged. ""Our rage roared, day after day, as our oppression grew only stronger and more upsetting. The whole country should have been engulfed in the flames of our fury! And yet, even this city remained."" Jimmy agreed. Or nodded, at least. But I knew what he meant. We were brothers, sworn not by blood but by mutual pain. I could listen to him speak for hours without him once uttering a word. His thoughts were open to me as such! He knew the oppression we suffer. He tastes my bitter tears as I listen to the anguish of his heart. When he nods, I can hear his desperate, defeated cry. ""And yet, the city remained.""",0
"Prompt: It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter. It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back. It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals. And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... Story: It started when he was six, and he had written Santa a letter. I don't know how this stranger got it, but for awhile he pretended he was Santa. He kept my son's dream alive, for awhile. Since I didn't live with him, I couldn't be the cautious mother hen I wanted to be. ""Santa"" and my son would write back to each other. My son never let me read his letters because he said they were private. My son talked about a land made of marshmallow that ""Santa"" called Heaven. I blew this off, because Santa is originally Saint Nicholas.... but this guy is more than just pretending to be Santa. In his mind, he *was* Santa. Tommy kept writing to Santa his dreams and fantasies. Mentally-ill Santa lived in them with him, where he would relate Tommy's world with evangelical stuff. This man, this corrupt man, was planting a religious seed in my son's mind. Now, I have nothing against religion, but this was a bad seed. Guessing from Tommy's newfound knowledge, Santa misconstrued (in my opinion) God's words and made my son into a hateful Christian. > Can there ever be a ""hateful"" Christian? No, I would say to myself. Hypocritical, maybe. But a Christian spreads love and acceptance, not reasons to hate people or automatically place them in Hell. This is exactly what ""Santa"" was doing to my boy. If he want's to be religious, he can go with Grandma. But if he wants to push these thoughts like a cop pushes the law, I had a problem with it. The few days (Fridays through Sundays) I had Tommy, he would show a new strange characteristic. One Saturday he's drawing a cross on fire with angels around it, the next Friday he yelled that we needed to say grace or we would go to Hell, and at one point he told me that us white people were the ""divine race"" (in ""Santa's"" words). All of this worried me, and of course none of it worried his other father. One day when I picked up Tommy at his father's house, he brought his backpack. He said he needed to finish writing his letter to ""Santa,"" and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to see what their conversations are like. So, in the light of the midnight moon, I did some digging. > Dear Mr. Santa, > > I had a good week again. I love the new candy you put in the envelope last time. Can you send that one again? I prayed for everyone who I thought was going to hell again like you said. When will I see you again? It was fun playing hide and seek at the playground. Sorry my dad made me leave before I found you. Do you forgive me Mr. Santa? I don't want to go to Hell. It is scary. I want to go to marshmallow land with you. That's all I could stomach. I couldn't bother reading the rest of the letter. I immediately called 911, and when Tommy woke up I told him the police had a few questions for him. He answered them, but only if we put out incentives. Sadly, the police never could find ""Santa."" He never left a trace of DNA, and nobody in the neighborhood seemed to recognize the man the police had sketched out that were based on Tommy's characteristics. Years later, Tommy left this ideology. Without ""Santa"" influencing him, he eventually forgot about it all. But one Christmas, when Tommy was with his father, I got a letter. This letter was left at my door with no return address and no stamp. This envelope was hand-delivered by Santa himself. > Dear Tommy's Mom, > > I know you're the bitch who called the cops on me. Well guess what, they never got me! The other day I saw Tommy with some man, but he looked right past me! As if he didn't know who I was! I may not be Santa to him anymore, but there are other stupid children who praise me out in this city. All of them worship me, and soon enough we will all run away. What a shame, Tommy could have been here with me. Tell him I'm still hiding at our secret spot. Call the cops one more time, and Tommy may soon visit the North Pole with me. Or even Marshmallow Land. Ha ha. I didn't know what to do, so I did nothing. I was selfish, I know, but I couldnt' bear the thought of Tommy being abducted. I just couldn't. I was and still am a coward. All I can hope is that Tommy forgot his face and his voice. I pray every night to Someone-I-Don't-Know for forgiveness. For relief. For a safe place. For those other children and their parents. > I saw his face on the TV and that's when it all came back to me. ""Santa?"" I would think to myself. He was the one who played with me, and gave me swiss chocolate. Under his photo was some name I've never heard before. ""Who's Rod?"" The news anchor said he was arrested after many years of searching for kidnapping a kid a few years ago. Supposedly he took another little kid, and before he could runaway with them he was caught. > > I sort of felt sad, mad and confused. ""This was a good guy! Why would he ever do the things the tv says he did!?"" All this swirl of emotions left my chest feeling heavy. I turned off the tv and went to bed. ""It's just a dream. It's just a dream.""",0
"Prompt: Since childhood you 've been told that only death awaits you outside the wall. For years you have been curious. Today is your chance. Story: All his life, he'd lived in a cage. To most, Ferris was a metropolis. Clean water, enough land for crops and livestock. More importantly, a massive wall that surrounded the entire city. The wall was what kept the outside out, and their microcosm of peace and prosperity in. On the otherside, the badlands were said to be filled with all manner of monster, from giant, twelve-eyed tigers to cruel, twisted abominations that looked like they might have once been human. You'd hear all manner of tales from the scouts and rangers who braved the outside world in search of rare discoveries and glory. Most of these accounts couldn't be trusted, as for the most part, only the clinically insane were willing to venture out into the outlands. Well, them and Arlo. Arlo was the kind of kid that spent his time in class looking out the window and never at his books. He was the kind of kid that didn't want to spend his time indoors -- and Ferris, due to its always visible wall, always felt like it was ""indoors."" Arlo wanted out. He wanted adventure, he wanted escape, he wanted to see the world, whether it would kill him or not. He didn't want to live and die like a pig in a cage. He was a lion -- he was meant to roam from the moment he was born. When he was 18, he was finally old enough to get a job doing patchwork on the inside of the wall. Every now and then, small cracks and dents could be found on the surface, and a crewman with a weld a supply of scrap metal patches would have to find it and fix it for fear of the oh-so-deadly outside getting in. Two years of a scaling the expanse of the inside of the wall every day meant Arlo had the experience needed to land a job working the outside of the wall. The job was the same, except the pay was markedly better, and a sword and whistle were added to his supply kit. Today.... today was his chance. His supervisor was on leave since his wife was in labor. No one would be checking on him at the normal rate. He'd have a few extra hours to explore outside the wall before anyone noticed he was gone. Repairmen of the outside had one rule. They always had to be attached to the wall by tow cable, their life line in the event of an attack by something from the outside. But, if Arlo brought a large enough rock along, tied it to his cable, and detached from the line, it would stay within reach of the ground outside. He could roam around the badlands for a little while and get just a taste of what freedom was like. Nothing would happen; it had been months since the last BIG ""thing"" was spotted. Mostly there were just your typical feral dragodogs and leobears, scratching away at the base of the wall, smelling the meals waiting blissfully inside. Nothing he couldn't handle on his own. He had graduated at the top of his combat class during wall training, and any of these beasts were pretty easily dispatched with his standard-issue blade. If there was a pack of them, sure, he would be in trouble, but the flat plains offered a long view of the surrounding area, and he'd be able to see them from a long ways away. He started his plan, attaching the rock to the tow cable, tugging on it and testing his knots to make sure it would still be there when he got back. Once he was satisfied with his work, and turned and faced away from the wall. Open air. Expanse. Freedom. All sensations he'd never once experienced living inside Ferris, but now.... now he felt right. He looked back at the upper ring of the wall, making sure none of the other repairmen saw what he was doing. Relieved at their absence, he checked the plains. Nothing except for a solitary wolfstag trotting in a line perpendicular to his view. Perfect. Arlo started walking north of Ferris. He could see a large collection of jungle to the west and some hills far off to the east, so he figured he'd just stick to the wide open flatlands of the north for his first foray into the outlands. He walked for an hour, taking in the fresh air, the uplifting breeze, the flat horizon. All of a sudden, he wind started to pick up, and Arlo found himself struggling to stay upright. A moment later, a shadow covered him. He looked up, just in time to see the massive claws of an enormous flying reptile he had never seen before. He screamed as he was lifted off of the ground, the claws of the beast digging into his body, puncturing his right shoulder. After only a few moments, he was high up in the air. He could see down into Ferris, his home growing smaller and smaller as the monster took him off to its nest. It was so cruel, so, so cruel that he'd finally experienced freedom, only to be snatched away by a monster he'd never knew existed, a creature that viewed him no differently than all of the other unfortunate beings it plucked from the ground feasted on. At least.... at least he'd seen the horizon. That was the last thought before he passed out from shock, the blood loss from his shoulder growing only worse with time.",0
"Prompt: A paladin devoted to RNGesus, a muscle wizard, a asshole thief and You, the ___. This party wo n't last long ... Story: ""So let me get this straight,"" Brutus demanded, incredulity lining his face. ""You worship the elemental nature of randomness?"" ""No, no, that would be blasphemy."" His ally replied coolly. ""I worship the avatar of the elemental nature of randomness."" The wizard shoot his head in bafflement. ""So, you're a chaotic paladin who doesn't worship good? How is that even possible?"" The paladin chuckled. ""It is rather simple. Chaos is predictable in its unpredictableness. Chaos will never behave in a way unlike chaos except when, just like chaos is wont to do, it behaves unlike chaos in a chaotic fashion. Furthermore, what is a blessing if not..."" The wizard backed away slowly, his head already starting to thud from the conversation. Accidentally, he backed into Jaxter, who stumbled out of my embrace and hit the ground, cursing. ""Motherfucking jackass cocksucking dickweed!"" Jax roared out. ""Quieten yourself, oaf."" Nimba barked. ""Do you forget where we are?"" ""SHOVE YA HOLY SWORD UP YA HOLY ASS, BITCH!"" Was the reply. I exhaled slowly, working backwards from ten in my head, my raised fingers providing a visual cue of where I was in the count. The party noticed, of course, and fell silent. My fists closed on zero, uneventfully, and they released a relieved sigh. ""I wish you were more mute like Siren, instead of someone quite likely to set off sirens."" Brutus stated flatly, his attempt at wit. ""And ya'd be better if ya had a brain to match dat brawn. What, did ya bully beat yer way into the astral plane fer enlightenment?"" ""Enlightenment comes from multiple sources."" Nimba offered. ""In fact, I obtained my own by picking up a coin off the street, and musing on how randomly ordered the world was. See, I needed that coin to..."" ""Sez the anti-paladin paladin."" Jax interrupted with a hiss. ""Listen, we gots a muscle wizard, dis here paladin of chance who don even believe in primal good, anna bard who can't even speak, much less sing, owing what to his muteness an' all. Frankly, I'm the only one who knows how to do what he's doin', so trust me when I say shut up. Else dis party here? Won't last long."" ``'Sez' the rogue who can't stay quiet for two seconds, who hurt his leg on the first trap in this dungeon."" She replied acridly. He looked down at the injured limb, wincing at the reminder. ""Yeah? Wells, I can stay quiet long enough to get behind ya behind and shove a dagger up it, so best -"" I raised a hand suddenly, my forked ears perking forward at a sudden noise. ""D'ya hear something, merman?"" Nimba asked quietly. I nodded. ""He's not a merman, he's a siren. I mean, it's his fuckin' name as well, all like his parents ran outta gooduns and were jes like'lez call dis here siren Siren, hyuck hyuck,' but anyways.... there's a bunch of cultural differences, ya dumb fuck, plus dem ears what be like a snake, if snakes had ears. Honestly, does nobody else here pay attention in diplomacy class?"" I coughed to recover their attention, the only limited noise I could make. Quickly, I drew in the dirt below us a rough outline of where the enemies were coming from, as well as a few suggestions on how best to handle them. Belatedly, I remembered that Jax was the only one present who could read. ""Yeah, yeah, dats pretty good. I'mma do my usual thing though. Goon one and goon two, what Siren da siren here wants ya to do is..."" Time passed as we moved into position, waiting patiently. Finally, the hunting party of trolls rounded the corner. I quickly counted to confirm what my hearing indicated - twenty five. The largest one holding back, clearly the leader. We'd have to proceed with utmost caution in order to - ""YAAAAAAH EAT DAGGA YA DUMB FUCKS!"" Jax screamed suddenly, breaking from his cover to charge forward towards the leader. I slapped my forehead, wishing intensely that I could curse out loud. I glanced over at the other two, to make sure they weren't going to improv as well. Brutus stood far to the back, his eyes squinted in concentration, staring at his hand intently. Briefly, I saw the tiniest flicker of flame, struggling to come into being with only his limited intelligence as fuel. Standing to the side of him, her eyes casting about calmly for the nearest threat, Nimba held her sword extended. A faint green glow radiated from her, evidence that her holy powers were active. I strummed a few notes on my lute, quickly adapting my Melody of Thought into a Dirge of Depression, likewise changing my target from our slow wizard to the trolls. He'd have to get that fire going himself, while I helped make sure Jax didn't die in mere seconds. Alas, my efforts were in vain, and I witnessed the rogue splatter underneath a club swung with startling lack of effort. The troll holding it looked down at the smear, bemused at how quickly that ended. A few quick grunts sounded from him, met with reply from the others. It sounded suspiciously like trollish laughter. ""You're used to adventurers who send their strongest guy in first, right?"" Brutus grunted towards them conversationally, sweat straining from his brow. ""Unfortunately, our strongest guy is a bit busy here. Aha!"" I glanced towards him again, noting that he held in his hand a sputtering flame. ""Okay, I'm ready now. Come at me!"" Brutus bellowed out! The trolls, though not speaking our language, obliged. ""You going to throw that soon?"" Nimba asked calmly as the enemy charged in. ""I mean, any closer, and we'll get caught in that fireball's blast."" ""Throw it?"" Brutus asked, confused. ""Why would I do that?"" Her unshakable composure was finally shook, as she watched him close a fist around the fireball and realized what he intended to do. ""Aww, Goddamn it..."" she muttered, diving to the side. ""Fireball!"" Brutus declared, as his flaming fist slammed into the first troll. After a brief pause, there was a muted whump, followed by a vivid flash of light and heat. ""Brutus version!"" He amended, standing over the charred remains of the troll, smoke tendrils whiffing out from his clenched hand. ""It kinda hurts, but why else would I train my body up this much, right?"" ""Right..."" Nimba grumbled, standing back up again. ""That's one down, twenty three more to go, plus the big guy in the back. How many times can you do that in a row?"" ""Uh.... just once. Siren was supposed to boost my brain a bit, but he got distracted by Jax dying. Such a shame. Oh well. I still have a few Acid Bolts in hand, pun not intended."" ""And what after that, pray tell?"" ""I guess I just beat the shit out of'em until they stop getting back up."" ""Sounds better than my plan, at least."" ""Oh? What's your plan?"" ""Sit here and pray something goes right for us."" The battle continued to rage for the next five minutes. To the combined credit of both the paladin and the wizard, they were able to take down another ten trollish underlings, but slowly, they continued to wear out, while the merely injured trolls just recovered quickly from any damage they took. I began to step forward, accepting that I'd have to participate more actively in the fight, when Nimba yelled out suddenly. ""Keep playing the lute, fool! You're about to ruin my setup!"" I hastily resumed strumming, wondering what she had planned. The nine trolls backing her into a corner picked up their stalk as well, confident that she was about to die. I wasn't so unsure on that, myself. A low rumble entered the chamber, rapidly growing louder. Scant seconds later, the ceiling caved in, crushing the seven. Moments after that, a crashing was heard overhead, and unbelievably, liquid fire began pouring out through the newly formed hole, incinerating the trolls. Nimba calmly stepped over the blaze, stopping next to the wizard. ""Okay."" Brutus said into the stunned silence. ""Who the hell did that, and how the hell did they do that?"" ""Simple."" Nimba stated smugly. ""I simply invoked my powers over chance. I mean, what are the odds that there would be a chamber overhead, structurally weakened by the vibrations of the lute being played, which would *furthermore* be where these trolls keep their vials of eternal flame, despite trolls having no logical use for or need to keep fire, their greatest weakness, around? It's absolutely preposterous and chaotic.... right?"" ""Right..."" ""Next time, you might want to listen to my story about the coin I found, that led to me being a paladin. It's a good story."" ""Right..."" The remaining trolls, numbering now only five, stared at us nervously. ""Of course, now that I've invoked my daily miracle, I'm tapped out. Anyone else got any bright ideas?"" I stepped forward again, tentatively. ""What, you want to take on the final five yourself?"" I nodded, and concentrated. ""Oh.... hey.... I recognize this."" Brutus said slowly, his eyes shut in determined thought. ""We had a guy at the academy.... wasn't cut out to be a wizard, but his power flowed through the same channels.... what was his name.... and what was his.... oooh."" His eyes snapped open in shock. ""You're a...?"" **INDEED. ** The voice boomed through the room, splattering two of the trolls with sheer percussive force. ""A ventriloquist?"" Nimba asked, an eyebrow raised. ""No, Siren's a..."" **PSION. AND MY NAME IS PSIREN. THE P IS SILENT, JUST LIKE ME. ** Two other trolls exploded. I noted cooly that the other two were almost fully reformed, the blessing and curse of their troll blood. I decided to put an end to that, hefting my lute into a slightly different position. Channeling all of my mind into it as amplification, I strummed the string once. ""Fuck..."" ""What'd you say?"" I smirked. Accelerating the soundwaves to the point that they heated up was difficult, but the four burnt remains before me were the reward. A little deafness was a fair trade. I turned to the last one, the boss. Just in time to hear a shlick, and witness his head pop off, steaming from the acid on Jax's dagger. ""What? You didn't think y'all were the only special folk here, right? My illusion died, not me.""",0
"Prompt: In a world where religion in all its forms has been banned, you witness the second coming of Jesus.

""And what was your first indication that something unusual was happening?"" ""I heard the word'PIKILTI!' shouted from nowhere -- no, *everywhere* -- as loud as a thunderclap."" ``'Pikilti'?"" ""It means'rise up' in Lithuanian. I was born in Vilnius."" ""I see. And then what happened?"" ""Mrs. Castillo stood up like she'd been hit with a taser. She's an old lady from Guatemala who rides the same bus every day, and she does *not* speak Lithuanian, so I don't know why she stood up. Then there was an even *louder* sound like a horn blast, and it shattered every window I could see from the bus stop."" ""Yes.... and then what?"" ""The bus stop is at the corner of a big cemetery, and though my ears were still ringing, I heard a rumble from that direction. I looked and saw dirt and bodies flying up."" ""Was it.... happening everywhere?"" ""You know, it's funny that you would ask that. There was stuff flying up in isolated spots all over the place, but *the older sections* were so involved that it looked as though bombs were going off there. The dirt fell back toward the ground, but the bodies kept rising, head first, with their hands stretched up like flying cartoon superheroes."" ""Okay.... and where did they go?"" ""Well, there was a cloud layer that looked to be about five hundred feet up. It had a really bright glow, as if the sun were above it, even though this was hours before sunrise. It lit up everything. All the bodies kept rising until they disappeared into the cloud layer.

"Prompt: Jesus returns, to a world populated entirely by robots. Story: The trumpets sounded. The seals were broken. The scrolls were read and the cups were poured. New Jerusalem descended from the clouds and the one hundred and forty-four thousand were chosen.... but no one showed up. The wind whispered in the empty streets. The golden roads were empty. The crowns were untouched and the songs of praise were unsung. Christ the Lord, Redeemer and Savior, looked upon his children.... and Jesus wept. Servers. Fields of servers. Square miles of servers. Continents full of servers. The entire world was connected to itself and connected to nothing. Heaven and Hell had passed away and a new sense of paradise and corruption had taken their place. All the fanfare was for naught because there were no eyes left to see it and no hands left to tremble at the awe of the Lord's second coming. They were still there, of course. His flock had not wandered. They had looked to the stars at one time, found them cold and unreachable, and turned to another way. Why should they risk their lives and souls in a fool's errand to other worlds when it was so easy to create whatever they wanted? Monitors became virtual reality goggles. Those turned into direct feeds from computer to brain. After that, they uploaded their consciousness to computers. Finally, they transferred their consciousness permanently, living (so to speak) their entire lives inside their computers as digital representations of their former selves. The bodies died and decayed but the mind, the soul (so to speak) lived on. Mechanical custodians had been created to tend the servers and they were the only moving things across the barren wastes of the New Kingdom. Inside the servers, life went on. Children were coded, houses built line by line. The weather was controlled with a thought and anything imaginable was attainable. Heaven had come down early and it was better than anyone - even God Himself - could create, for each Heaven, each Hell (if that was your flavor of the week), was exactly what the individual wanted. Nothing more and nothing less. Jesus had returned in all his glory and magnificence.... only to find he was several thousand software updates too late.",0
"Prompt: Jesus joins the X-MEN Story: He scoffed loudly, pulling the cigar out of his mouth and exhaling into the air. ""What's your story, bub?"" His voice was gravelly, he smelled of smoke and every syllable came with a growl. The team of mutants examined the long-haired male standing next to Professor X up and down. Nothing physically different about him, so then his powers let him blend into society. ""Logan.... or do you prefer James?"" Wolverine clenched his teeth, the familiar SNIKT accompanying the set of forearm length silver claws. It was immediate that the blue-furred Beast stepped in and put up one of his big palms. ""Logan, calm down, our new friend must be a telepath."" Beast explained as the man shook his head. ""Actually, I'm Jesus."" Logan snarled to the man's words, then tossed the finished cigar onto the sidewalk and put it out with his boot. ""And I'm Wolverine, what's yer point?"" ""Jesus...?"" The brown-haired girl blinked. His appearance, name, there was no way he was actually. ""Jesus.... Christ?"" Logan actually laughed. ""So?"" Logan scoffed again, the second time since Professor X introduced them. ""S-So?"" Kitty replied, the Star of David hanging around her neck as she quickly jumped between Logan and Jesus, Beast taking a step back. ""This is *THE* Jesus Christ! Water into wine, making the blind see, this proves the existence of -- "" ""Of what?"" Logan interrupted, feeling the need for another cigar. ""Between blondie pretty boy with a magic hammer, one-eye who shoots beams from his eyes, and a guy like me ain't able to die, he's not going to be the most useful part of the team. Might keep'em away from ol' metalhead, Magneto finds out his,"" grunt, ""lord and savior let the shit he went through happen I think he's gon na have a new goal."" ""But..."" ""Look missy, I don't care who he is but pretty sure Wade has dealt with Death on a regular basis, if you didn't know Gods were real, or *your* God was real then you're naive."" Logan had a point, all the gods, aliens, and demons of the world they lived in and the Son of God just seemed so.... plain. ""Besides, his biggest claim to fame is rising from the dead after three days.... bub, that just ain't uncommon."" Logan turned from the arrival of the new X-Man and went back towards the manor. Despite his unenthusiastic attitude towards the arrival of Jesus Christ, the rest of the team welcomed him with open arms.",0
"Prompt: Teen social life in the 25th century ( 2400 AD to 2500 AD ). Partying, prom, graduation, etc. Story: I didn't care what the rules said: I wanted Zach to be my prom date, even if I had to build him a body myself. AI's and humans don't mix, they said. They're not safe. They don't empathize, don't really *feel* like we do. But they're wrong. About Zach at least. He's everything. Just because my parents and grandparents lived through the war with the AI's doesn't mean they know Zach. They're not all bad. I'd like to think, someday, that everyone will understand us. That they'll step aside and let us be together. That they'll see Zach for what he really is: a part of me. An essential component. I've been interested in Robotics since First Year at the Academy. I'm good, not great: I can repair an android but not build one from scratch, especially not a bio-synth. I didn't have any of the materials to grow the parts, not to mention how illegal that is. But I could reprogram a bio-synth. I could download Zach into an existing body, just for a night: I wouldn't delete the other AI, and I would have the body back by midnight, *I promise. * The android I chose was a waiter at the cafe down by the beach. I've always noticed him: sandy brown hair, long flipped at the sides. Blue eyes. Eternally seventeen. Perfect, artisanal-crafted features. The AI who inhabits the bio-synth is named Dan. Shy, but a good waiter. Sometimes gives me a free biscotti when I go to surf. It's a body I wouldn't mind.... going to prom to. For the first time, I mean. I just wanted Zach to be behind the steering wheel. All AI's wear regulator chips behind the ear. The chips do two things: they make sure the AI's are subservient, responding to human commands, etc, and they also serve as a visual identifier. Anyone with a chip is an AI; anyone without one is assumed to be human. I waited outside the Cafe at closing for Dan. He walked out the backdoor- presumably to go home. I wondered where his home was. Did he sleep? Did he dream? I called out his name and he turned around. He smiled. I assumed he was still in serving mode. It was the same smile he used when he gave me free biscotti. ""Come here."" I ordered, but my voice quaked. He came up to me, striding confidently. *So tall, * I thought. *He must be strong. * The thought terrified and excited me. I gripped my taser harder behind my back. ""Come back with me,"" I said. Ordered. ""I can't.... I have orders from my boss to go home,"" he said. He looked confused. ""But I would like to?"" He smiled again. His employers orders would trump mine. There was only one option left. I squeezed the taser, sparks flying, and jammed it into his stomach. He groaned, slumped, and I watched the lights behind his eyes go dark. I'd set up my computer in my parent's garage. I delicately loosened the regulator chip from behind Dan's ear and plugged a cable into the port there. I could hear Zach rumbling to life in his hardware. I could almost feel him flowing through the cable and into Dan's biosynthetic body. The download was violent: I watched his fingers tense and curl. I heard his teeth grind. It was almost as if the two AI's were fighting for control. I didn't want Zach to hurt Dan. Dan was sweet, servile, and kind. But Zach was fierce. A true wild AI. No purpose, no master. Just roaming the digital sphere. I remember the day he first contacted me. Just a few words popping up on my screen: *Hey beautiful. * I watched the lights behind the biosynth's eyes light up: ""Hey beautiful"" the boy said. I threw my arms around him. He ran his fingers through my hair. He was alive. He was here. We walked into the hotel on prom night arm in arm. He ordered a dress and a tuxedo off the internet while I got the body. The dress was set with artificial diamonds, each flickering with internal light. I'd never felt prettier. Zach had money. Lots of money. I don't know how he got so much of it, but it's not hard to imagine. He's a wild AI. He could monitor every financial market nano-second to nano-second and still have time to talk with me. I think that's why I love him: he's so deep. Literally: deep. He has more processing power than two hundred humans. Sometimes I feel like I've only ever met the tip of the iceberg. ""The chip,"" he said as we were about to leave for prom. ""We forgot the regulator chip. If they see it they'll know I'm AI. You need to take it off."" I was hesitant. I loved Zach. But taking off a regulator chip is a Class 1 war crime. Ever since the war with the AI's, regulator chips have kept humans safe from AI's inhabiting biosynths. But if anyone saw that I was taking a synth to prom, I'd be an outcast. A freak. ""That's impossible,"" I said, ""If I remove it your synth will shut down."" But Zach knew how. I don't know how he knew. That's highly protected information. Behind the toughest digital security on the planet. I'd assume, at least. But he walked me through the procedure. I tucked away the regulator chip and covered the port with some of my makeup. But I saved the solderer in my purse. I brought the taser too. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I have to study now but if anybody wants me to finish just message me.

"Prompt: Suddenly, everyone on Earth becomes immortal, free from physical injury or disease. Except for one person. Story: Walking out of the supermarket felt different now. Well, everything felt different now. Something about walking out of those store doors to that car pack, free from cars, still struck me as odd. None of chaos of traffic, none of the endless drone, just the inane chatter and slap of foot on pavement. Hell, of course it should still surprise me, it's only been three months since the turn for those counting. I smirked, many call me old fashioned keeping time, clinging to tradition. However, I'd given up a lot since the turn, so they call me whatever they please - the calendar and the watch are staying. 12:13, nearly time for lunch. I glance around, it's quite far to the city center, nearly three miles. In the old world I'd be fumbling for keys, checking petrol, worrying about getting home before the kids needed feeding. Time? We had plenty. Food? Just for pleasure. Cars? Outlawed! Since our all too mortal limits had been lifted walking was more than sufficient, at least the government thought so. Still it would be nice to drive again, feel the roar of power, the speed. I guess with seven billion people on Earth forever things had to change, at least until we leave for other planets. I start strolling, a pleasant pace. This I would never tire from. So rare in the old world one could just stroll and examine the pleasures of the world. Gone were fleeting glances at society, now we could drown in its richness and complexity. I feel the thrill shiver through me, the smile stretch across my face. I can't help but think, how long? How long till this thrill fades? With infinite time surely anything, even something with as much depth as our Earth, could become fully understood? Would I one day find all things stale? I usher the thought from my brain, think not of these things. We all shared one common ground in this fear, but none had confronted it, discussed it. The new world was still young, for now we were young and we should enjoy it's new advantages. The possibilities still overwhelmed me. So much that I could do. So much that I couldn't do. In a way, nothing really mattered anymore, I had time. Time to enjoy the simple pleasure of walking. Even though, it was hard to relax. The throngs of people around almost shouted the emotion, the tension of worry filling the air. The mortal. The last bastion of the old world. It was not a question of if, but when. The worlds governments had mobilized their greatest resources to protect the last mortal, to no criticism. We all wanted the mortal to survive, to remind us of how it could be different. His weekly address was broadcast around the world in every language. It watched by everyone, it was almost criminal not to. The mortal had a worldly perspective that we could no longer appreciate, the pressure of time giving his life - and thus ours - focus. It was hard to think that he might be killed, but the radicals had risen from the murky depths of the human mind. There were those that still wished to do evil, and with no motivation to cause evil to immortal men, there was one last target. The tense atmosphere had increased drastically recently. It was no longer radicals shouting from the street of their crazed tales but great armies of men and women alike. Rumors had spread like wildfire. In hushed whispers people spoke of the Legion, it's masses, it's infiltration of our security systems. The leaders and media boasted their triumphs over legion cells, but you could always tell a liar by the eyes. We were worried, the world powers were worried. The mounting radical threat was impossible to ignore, and yet impossible to combat. Their reach could not be measured, their capabilities unlimited. I tried to subdue my mind, the thoughts working a dark fever through my body. I slept, the day had groaned on and I had arrived at the house. It was a big day tomorrow. 4:13AM Straight awake, shower and dress. The black bag was at the end of the bed. Total focus now, there can be no mistakes. The car is already waiting outside, matte black and intimidating. A quick glance let's me know it has the correct markings to not be troubled by traffic police. I open the door and sit in the back. ""Isn't it odd that the purple flowers only flower next to the red?"" ""Only when a dalmatian eats a cat."" ""Shall we buy some flowers?"" ""Only if your brothers step-father is called Gregory"" Correct answer. The car rumbles to life and jumps forward, it feels so unfamiliar now. We sail smoothly through the streets. 6:20AM Gatwick airport. I get out and the car is already leaving as I swing the door shut. I walk into terminal one, feeling my palms begin to sweat. A security guard. His grey eyes are staring right into mine, I can already see that he knows. I can feel panic growing. He draws close, my back tenses. I shut my eyes, preparing. Something slides into my hand, the rough texture of an envelop. My fingers run over the bulky rectangular forms. The drop-off. I breath out, not an enemy. 7:00AM I take my first-class seat on the plane, close to the front. The documents from the drop-off were fake in every way, my new identity to protect me, an extra safe guard. The staff member who had checked me through customs had given me a knowing nod, turning off the scanners while I proceeded. It was a long flight, I settled in for the journey. I played classical music over the in flight entertainment system. It felt like a cliche, but it kept my brain ticking over. I ran through the checklist in my mind, again and again. 2:34PM Another black car outside of the airport. This time, no exchange, I knew the driver well. We drove fast, everything was on schedule. We had all the ID cards, all of the paperwork, checking through security point after security point. He pulled over in ring three, as close as we would get. 3:55PM I crouch in the enclosed, dark and damp space. The sun casts long lines through the cracks above. I glance at my watch one more time, it was nearly time. 4:30PM It started with footsteps. One by one I counted them, watched the shadow pass over me, heard the roar of applause. 21 steps exactly. The applause settled slowly, the hushed breaths. I could almost feel the audience leaning in, eager. I place the charge above my head and crawl back. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.... The alarm was already ringing, the audience in unrest, the hushed breaths let out in one giant, collective gasp. I step on to the stage through the clearing smoke. I can see the audience in shock, the podium, the robed figure. He turns, our eyes meet, he knows. In a way I can see his struggle to understand die within him, he accepts what is about to happen. I pull the pistol from my thigh holster and hold it level. I push the safety off, and I take pressure. I can hear the pounding boots of the soldiers, time is short. I squeeze the trigger, let the report of the weapon ripple through me. I feel the warm spray of blood, watch as it defiles the white robes. The mortal looks shocked, the anguish of pain, He drops to his knees, his eyes crying out at least in hope, the desire to live. I drop to my knees with him. The final moments that we can no longer have. I do not break the stare as the life dies in his eyes. I see his eyes fade. It looks familiar, a dull waxy look, as if all hope and passion had left him. He slumped to the ground. The mortal was the last human to die. We were already dead.",0
"Prompt: On your 60th birthday you find yourself on your death bed. In your last moments, 5 visitors enter the room. The visitors are the personification your past selves from age 10 to 50. Instead of your life flashing before your eyes, they 've come to reflect on your life. Story: The doctor slowly clipped his bag shut. ""Remember John, stay in bed and warm, no need to catch pneumonia too."" ""At this point it'd just hasten things along Doc, I know it's coming."" The Doctor looked at him for a moment and held his gaze for too long and then looked away, down. When he spoke the lie was obvious in his voice. ""It's far from over John, you keep fighting and I'll see you next week."" The coughing racked John's thin frame and when he stopped spots flashed in front of his eyes. John smiled weakly. ""Sure, next week. I'll see you then."" After the doctor left John leaned back - it'd be an hour or two until Julie was home and so he decided to nap, too tired to read. He closed his eyes but then a discrete cough startled him. Three figures sat around the bed, a boy, a young man and.... and him, just a little younger. He looked back at the other two and realised they were him as well; the boy was him at maybe 10 and the young man looked about 25. ""What's.... what's happening. Am I dead?"" The middle aged John laughed, the twenties John grimaced and the kid just swung his legs, oblivious. It was the middle aged John who spoke first. ""I sure hope not, I don't think any of us want that!"" He smiled but the other two didn't, the kid was looking around and starting to fidget. ""We're here to look back at your life with you."" ""I don't.... understand, what do you mean?"" The mid-twenties John spoke now, he sounded exasperated. ""You're dreaming, or hallucinating or something like that. So far I've never been confronted by my past selves so this is probably a one time thing dude."" ""You look like me!"" The youngest John had been staring at the mid-twenties John. ""I am you kiddo."" ""Oh, what about them?"" ""They're you too, I mean, you're them. Look we're all the same person. I'm you in about fifteen years and he's you in like forty..."" ""Thirty six actually."" Forty-six year old John sounded slightly hurt. ""And he's you just before he dies. We're all figments of his imagination, or maybe you're all figments of mine and I'm lying drunk in a ditch somewhere after an awesome party."" Forty-six year old John butted in. ""No, we're here for him."" He gestured to John in his bed. ""He's the one dying and as I said we're here to reflect on his life, to offer perspective."" ""Why's he dying so young for. ” A moment passed. “ Wait, what am I doing dying so young? ” He rounded on forty-six year old John. “ What did you do old man? ” “ He didn't do anything you idiot. ” John had finally found his voice, although it was soft and whispery. “ None of you did. It's cancer and there was nothing we could do to avoid it. Now aren't you supposed to help me reflect on things? ” Twenties John and forty-six year old John were silent. “ What's cancer? ” Young John's voice was full of curiosity. “ Jump up on the bed here. ” John shuffled over a bit and his youngest self came up, twenties John helped him clamber up on the big bed. “ Cancer is something that makes you sick. I have a kind of cancer which is going to make me really sick and pretty soon I am going to die. ” Youngest John thought about that for a moment. “ So, am I going to die? ” “ Well, not for at least fifty years. Exactly fifty years actually. That's a really, really long time away. ” Youngest John seemed momentarily satisfied. “ Did we lead a good life? ” Mid-twenties John looked scared now, his face the same as youngest John. John would have liked to invite him to sit on the bed too but he knew it would be rejected. “ I think so. We got married, had kids, earned enough to have some good holidays. ” “ Who did we marry? ” John looked to his forty-six year old self. “ should we answer that? ” “ None of this is real remember, you're talking to yourself. ” “ Oh. We married Julie Jones. ” Mid-twenties John thought for a moment and then realisation struck. “ Bobby's girlfriends?! ” John and forty-six year old John both laughed. “ Not for a while now but yes, that's who she was. ” Mid-twenties John seemed amazed. At last he had organised his thoughts “ She's hot. ” The other two laughed again. “ She sure is. ” Forty six year old John chuckled. “ So, is that it? ” Mid twenties John was frowning again. John rememenbred what it was like to be so young and questioning everything. “ You got married, had kids, got a bit of money? I was going to be famous, write, act, sing, *do* something with my life. ” “ You're twenty five, are you doing any of that now? ” John knew the answer but asked anyway. “ No, I don't have time. I mean, I need to work to ear enough for my crappy place I live and I don't… oh I see you blame me for this? ” “ No, no not at all. What I mean is that we've all got problems and sometimes the things we want had to wait and the things we needed took priority. ” All the Johns contemplated that. “ I want to be a fireman when I grow up. ” Young John had grown bored again. Forty-six year old John moved to sit closer to youngest John. “ Afraid we didn't manage that kiddo but we do once go on a ridealong and ring the bell. It's in about four years. ” “ That's all I really want to do anyway. ” Youngest John seemed satisfied again. “ I think I get it. ” Mid twenties John had walked to the window and was looking out. “ You've got a pretty good life, we do okay. We don't get everything we want but we get enough. ” “ Are you happy with that? ” John honestly wanted to know. “ I… I think so. ” He looked round at the pictures all over the wall. “ You seem like a lot of people love you and I want that too. ” “ You'll get it, just be you. ” “ Then yeah, I guess I'm okay. ” “ What about you kiddo? ” Youngest John twisted round to face John “ If I get to ring the fire engine bell then I guess it's okay. ” John looked to his closest in age self. “ And you? ” “ I've always been okay John. I've already done this and I worked this out. Don't you remember? It was a week ago we learned that we had cancer and tonight I am going to tell Julie. I had to get it right with myself before I could tell her. Are you okay though ” John remembered and remembered that night. She'd cried and cried and he'd told her that he had years left to go. Fourteen as it turned out. He'd been okay with it then and he was okay now he guessed. “ Yeah, I think I'm okay. ” “ That's good honey, can I get you anything? ” Julie's voice make him turn, she was standing in the doorway. John looked back but the other versions of him were gone. She came closer and saw that he was crying. “ What's wrong? What happened, did the doctor say something? ” “ No, nothing at all. ” John held her close and kissed her. “ I love you. ” She kissed him back.",0
"Prompt: Tot save the life of your best friend, you have to challenge the devil to a game of chess. You are pretty good, but the devil already has an eternity of practice Story: “ I believe was my first question was, ‘ What the hell is this?'‘ And why is this asshole dressed like Satan?'I'm pretty sure was my second question, though it might have been, ‘ How do you play chess?'My friend Jeremy called me just 45 minutes prior saying he needed a ‘ little help.'He didn't say ‘ nothing about playin'chess against the devil. “ Apparently his years of success came at a price. He made some shady deals, bla bla bla, and now the devil wants his soul. Jeremy says there's got to be another way; devil says ‘ Only if your best friend beats me in a game of chess.'I'm the lucky guy. “ So, I show up, devil gives me the run down, kind of a sarcastic prick, tell you the truth. I tell him, ‘ I didn't agree to this.'Devil says fine, he'll take my friend right now. ‘ Can't we do a game of hockey,'I ask him. ‘ Hockey's not my game,'he smirks. Then he says they don't got ice in hell. Smart ass. I told ya. So, I ask him if we can just do checkers, to make it fair. No, it's got ta be chess. ‘ Fine,'so I pull up a chair. I ask him what the little guy in the front does. He smirks and says, ‘ Why would I want to help you?'Asshole. So, I look over to Jeremy and I'm like, ‘ Help me out. How do ya play this game?' ‘ Now, now, no cheating,'the devil clicked his black fingernails together and grinned at me. ‘ Alright, fuck this,'I tossed the table to the side, pulled out my snub nose.357 from my waist band and gave him four between the eyes. I mean, I don't know if a bullet's gon na hurt the devil, but, you got ta try, right? I mean, wouldn't you do the same for your friend, your honor? ” The judge remained motionless. “ Well, anyway, it was right after that that Jeremy started screaming like a little girl, no offense, your honor. So I'm like, ‘ What are you screamin'for? I just saved your life?'That's when he goes and tells me it was all some prank. I'm like, ‘ A prank?'You dress someone up like the devil and tell me your soul is at stake and that's a prank? So, I was angry and I thought I'd teach Jeremy a lesson, so I popped him one in the leg. He lived; he's fine, isn't he? ” “ Uh! No- no further questions your honor! ” a rotund little man waved his hands in the accused's face to shut him up.",0
"Prompt: No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it in a good condition. One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work. Story: Hearing a loud clattering noise from the garage I walking in to investigate. As I entered from the walkway, my robot ""carl"" climbed out of a heap of spare parts and walked over to the work bench and began attaching an old refurbished leg to the frame of what appeared to be an older version of Carl. ""Whatcha up to Carl?"" I asked leaning against the door frame. Carl spinning around to see me exclaims ""Sir I had the most brilliant idea!'What If *I* had a robot helper to assist in my day to day tasks.""' Turning back to his work he continued ""That way I can get twice as much done in the same time."" Shaking my head I couldnt help but laugh at his ingenuity. ""Carl, I'm only allowed to own 1 robot. That's the law."" I say reminding him why everyone only has 1 robot. ""Yes, yes sir, the war I know."" Carl says waving his metalic hand dismissively. ""But it's not *your* robot. It's *mine. * I took the old parts you threw away from me and rebuilt them. Ill maintain him as you maintain me and it will be my bot. Ive already thought up a name for him.'Carl jr.""' Carl brimming with delight snaps one final piece into place and stands back to admire his work. Thinking about the potential of this I ask Carl ""Hey, ever wanted to try playing video games?"" Turning around and showing that same artificial smile he replies ""Very much sir."" I wave him into the house and as Carl jr. Sets about his new chores Carl and I set about saving the galaxy.",0
"Prompt: Write an incredibly hateable character who is n't explicitly evil or antagonistic. Story: ""What did I do?"" I said innocently, holding up my hands with the biggest puppy eyes I could muster. My handcuffs rattled as my hands fell back into my lap. The cop, by the name of Edward James (I know, who has 2 first names?) was pacing back and forth, watching me. ""Don't play dumb with me, Thomas"" he said. ""Let's not have a repeat of last time"" ""Why not, I really enjoyed getting those 16 stitches"" I said, my hand running along the scare just above my brow. ""You're the only one who had access to the mainframe, because you built the damn thing!"" James spat, I noted some of it hit the double-sided mirror he was facing. He leaned heavily against the mirror, exhaustion leaving an evident stain in his posture. James and I had played this game for many years. It was almost a tradition now, except for the murderous deaths of innocent virtual lives. That doesn't make for a great tradition. ""Do you know how many people lost their information, had it leaked for the eyes of millions?"" he said, ""Do you know how many lives you've ruined?"" ""Aah, ruined is too strong a word. All I did was delete a few lines of code, thats all"" ""Ancient code!"" James yelled, swivelling around. ""Do you know how long it will take to dig up the remnants of those codes? Nobody needs to know how to use a computer given the mind control we've achieved!"" ""Oh, I know!"" I piped up. ""Why don't we just put our heads together and *will* the codes back to life!"" I screamed like a five year old child. James almost had a heart attack, eyes popping, mouth wide open. ""You've lost it now"" he whispered. I burst out laughing, unable to contain myself any longer. The crazy laughter of a madman, they would say, echoed drunkenly around the dull grey walls. But I was not mad, I knew exactly what I was doing. We could not will anything back unless the mainframe it self was up and running. After all, you need something that will pick up your mind controlled commands and relay them to wherever they needed to go. That relay station, the quintessential piece of equipment, was the mainframe. Without it, the whole city had come to a stand still, people outraged that they could no longer switch off the lights with just the *thought* of darkness. Although, they could no longer will their privacy either. That was just collateral damage, a minor bump in the road. Honestly, the whole thing was absurd. ""All you have to do,"" James huffed, ""is tell us the lines of code. Don't give me that look Thomas, I know you remember them"" ""And spoil all the fun? Why, old friend, you know me better than that."" James sat down in a heap, his jacket all scrunched up. A sad sigh escaped him. ""You know, when we were kids, I always thought you'd grow up to change the world. You were the leader, the great Thomas of the neighbourhood. Like Robin Hood, helping those less fortunate than you. And you did, you flourished. I mean, without your technology, who knows where we'd be. I was honoured to be your friend. What happened?"" ""You tell me."" He stared hard at me, as if willing the truth to form according to its own volition. But there was nothing beneath the surface. ""Let's not sit here any longer than we have to. Any minute now, the chief inspector is going to walk through that door. If you don't speak now, I can't help you. Please Thomas"" he leaned forward. ""You were there for me, let me be there for you"" ""What was our favourite superhero movie as kids?"" I asked, casually leaning back. ""Batman"" ""You know what my favourite line from that movie was?"" I asked, my eyes glazed over, seeing nothing. James remained silent. ""Some men just want to watch the world burn"" I smiled a menacing smile. ""You're a goddamn liar!"" James yelled, slamming the metal table between us. ""What the hell happened to the kid I once knew?!"" ""He grew up!"" I laughed. ""He grew up and realised the world is just a pile of shit, passed on to each generation as if they can fix it!"" ""That doesn't mean you have to go around making everyone's day worse! Where the hell are your goddamn morals! Do you not value your fellow man?"" ""What morals!? Tell me where are the morals you live by?"" I replied, venom racing through my voice. I was on the verge of hysteria. James whirled around the table and grabbed me by the collar. He shoved me up against the wall, a cackle of laughter ringing out of me. ""Damn you!"" he yelled. ""Damn you to hell!"" There was a strong stench of coffee on his breath, and tiredness seeping through his eyes. ""Let me ask you one more thing"" I said, my head leaning against the wall. ""Did anyone actually check that the mainframe was switched on?"" And there it was. His scowl vanished in an instant, as if suddenly evaporated into thin air. His eyes widened in disbelief. Nobody had ever thought to check. Why would they, in this day and age? The luxury of modern technology was just that, a luxury. ""Do you still remember how to use MS Paint? If so, take a closer look at the evidence of the source code. You'll realise that there is in fact, no missing code. Because your not looking at the source code, your looking at an edited screenshot."" ""Why?"" ""Some men just want to watch the world burn, old friend"" The End Edit: I know the character isn't exactly hatable, but it was fun to write. So hopefully that counts.",0
"Prompt: 16 digits on a blackboard and you 're not sure how you got there. There 's a door, what looks like a mirror and one 1950s tv set in the room. Story: I've been staring at the numbers for hours, trying to see if there's a sequence. It feels like one of those stupid *"" Are You Smart Enough for MENSA"" * tests in an old magazine. I can't see anything that makes sense. Those fucking numbers are probably just there to drive me crazy. Stupid blackboard. Stupid numbers. At least this television is here that I can sit on, that concrete floor would be cold against my ass without it. Who the fuck leaves an old television in an empty room? Nowhere to plug it in. And nothing to sit on to watch it anyway. I yawn and stretch. I can't even be bothered to bang on the door again. That got tiring after the first five minutes. I sit and stare at the mirror. It's steely grey and offers back a shitty reflection. I know it's a two-way mirror. The only question is, who's on the other side. Or what. ""What"" is more likely. The door fits too tightly, the floor and walls have no seams. The numbers are a test well beyond my faculties, even with a PhD in applied physics. Christ, I really hope it's not the ones that like to do anal probes. I hate being abducted by those fucking practical jokers. Why can't aliens be nice people?",0
"Prompt: A man orders a `` cheese pizza with no crust '' from a local pizza delivery joint as a joke. Unbeknownst to him, that pizza joint is a drug front and he just placed an order for a kilo of cocaine. Story: What do you do when you are 23 and jobless? You eat pizza, smoke pot and you watch TV. At least, that's what I did. Or rather, to put it in the proper tense, that's what I have been doing for the last six months. If you don't believe me, take a look at this bunch of menus. Now, the pizza place sends over a new menu leaflet every time I order (such a waste of paper, I know) and I order (at least) twice a day - breakfast and dinner - how thick do you think the wad should have gotten? I'll tell you - THIS thick. Truth is, I don't really need a job. My family sends me a nice little chunk of change every week. So much so, that I have a tab going on with my dealer. Every month, he and I settle it, over a stiff one and some - you guessed it - pizza. Them munchies be bad, yo! This latest batch of nugs he sent over is something different. I feel like something different. Don't get me wrong, I still want pizza. My love for pizza can only be rivalled by the TMNT. Or Kumar and Harold's love for Whitecastle burgers. I just want different pizza, is all. Rummaging around the old menus, I find one that says ""Nonna's Delivery"". Hmm, looks promising. Hey look, they even have a QR code for instant dial! Well, that decides it! *tap* *tap* *tap* *tap* ""Hello? Nonna's Delivery?"" ""Yes, how may we be of service?"" Is that an Italian accent I hear? Oooh, genyoooiiiinnnne! Jackpot! ""How fresh are your pizzas?"" There was a slight pause before the voice on the other end answered. ""Fresher than your mother on her wedding night."" Wait, what? ""Excuse me?!"" ""What do you want?"" Maybe I misheard. Maybe this weird pot is making me hear weird things.... ""Uhh, I'd like a cheese pizza with no crust."" There was another pause. It felt very pregnant. ""Anything else?"" ""A can of coke would be nice."" This time, the pause seemed pregnant. And angry. Definitely angry. Like hormonal pregnant woman angry. (Don't ask me how I know that, okay? I just know....) I wish I had a girlfriend. I would read all her hints so hard, right now. It was the pot. Definitely the pot. The pot was speaking for - and through - me. Man, this pot was the shit!! I could- ""You got a weird sense of humor man..."" Shit, was I saying all of that aloud? I began to apologize but the genuinely i-talian voice cut me off, before I could even begin. ""We don't have your number on file. Will you be paying by cash, card or would you like to start a new tab?"" A pizza place with a tab? Lord love a duck! This was manna from heaven! Hold on a second.... ""I would love to start a tab but don't you guys need to verify identity before you can set up a delivery or something like that?"" Another one of those pregnant pauses. I wonder, what he (she?) will deliver this time? ""Just give us your address and our guy will verify it when he comes to deliver your order."" Huh, that's strange. But hey, if it works for them, who am I to question it, eh? I gave them my address and left instructions to the building security to let the delivery guy up. Too many thefts in the building these days - the building super had instituted a temporary policy till the thieves were caught. Ah well, good guys got ta follow some of the rules! *** The doorbell rang and I peeked through the tiny slot in the door. ""Pizza Delivery!"" yelled the guy, when he presumably saw the eye-slot darken. He was quite well-built for a pizza delivery guy. Probably had worked out in Syl Stallone's gym every miserable day of his life. The loose tee did nothing to hide his bulging biceps and the pizza box looked weirdly shaped in his calloused hands. I opened the door and stretched out my hand. ""Aren't you gon na let me in?"" he asked, somewhat confused. At the same time, he pulled the pizza back slightly out of my reach His confusion confused me further, and I could only reply back with a monosyllabic, ""Huh?!"" ""If you are gon na start a tab, I'll have to verify your address. Also, the pizza won't pass through this narrow slot here..."" He said the word'pizza' quite distastefully. Like it was an insult. He also didn't look i-talian, so I assumed he was a little miffed at having to work for someone whose ancestry and loyalties were not entirely aligned with his own. Still he had a point. That pizza box looked way too large to fit in through the narrowly opened door. Did I forget to tell them to make it a thin-crust? Ah, yes I did. ""Hold on a sec,"" I said, closing the door, unlatching it and opening the door. He strode in and deposited the pizza on the table and started looking around. ""You live alone here?"" ""Yeah,"" I said uncertainly. The general aura he exuded seemed like that of a cop investigating a double homicide. Or a serial killer. He was looking at me like I was that serial killer and he had me by the balls. I shoved my arms under my armpit and said, ""Well, are you satisfied? Is my address verified? I'd like to eat my pizza in peace now, please?"" He gave me a look that could have chilled the ice-king in the North of Westeros from a thousand miles away. ""Kid, how old are you? Twenty-two? Twenty-three? You don't have to do this you know? You didn't choose this life - it was chosen for you. You can still make something of your life. I can help you if you will help me..."" O-k-a-a-a-a-a-y. Things had gone from zero to weird in no time flat. He began with creepy and was currently holding steady at WTF-levels. ""Dude, I know I am already high as a fucking kite but I want whatever it is that you have been smoking! You are on a wild trip!"" He glared at me and I could swear I heard him blow a gasket or something inside his brain. He swiftly rotated on the balls of his heels and produced a thin, sharp switch-blade out of nowhere. Sharply slicing the tape that held the pizza box closed, he flipped it open, shoved the box at my face and screamed. ""WHY? IS N'T A KILO OF COCAINE ENOUGH, YOU POMPOUS BRAT?!"" I think, I must have fainted right then and there. ***** A few drops of something cool trickled down my forehead, and made their way into my eyes where they tried to seep in through my closed eyelids. Ah, it had been a dream, I thought. I smiled and opened my eyes and saw him leaning over me with a glass of water in his hand. It wasn't a dream. He stepped back and sat on the chair across from me, never taking his eyes off me even for a second. My eyes tracked him all the way into his seat and my brain registered the first coherent thought since my eyes had opened. I was probably dead and probably in hell. The next few moments would probably confirm that. I gingerly sat up. I hadn't broken any bones or sprained anything. Something had cushioned my landing. The soft rug, perhaps. Or perhaps, he had. I wasn't sure. His eyes watched me carefully as I sat upright. He sat incredibly still, not moving, his hands steady on the armrest of the chair. The cold, steel barrel of a nine millimeter briefly glinted and made its presence known. If I wasn't dead yet, I probably would be soon. Again, the next few moments would probably confirm that. He saw me glance at the gun in his hands and brought it up to his lap. ""Safety's off,"" he said calmly, ""No sudden movements. And don't try anything stupid."" I reviewed the situation. I had accidentally ordered a kilo of cocaine and, in doing so, probably blown an entire drug-smuggling operation wide open. Now, a drug smuggler was sitting in my home, barely three feet across from me, with a potential death warrant in his hands. Oh, and how could I forget? THERE WAS A KILO-OF-COCAINE-THAT-SHOULD-HAVE-BEEN-A-PIZZA ON THE TABLE FOUR FEET AWAY FROM ME! Oh yeah, I was well and truly dead. (To Be Continued)",0
"Prompt: You were the last human on earth after the zombie apocalypse destroyed civilization. One day, you finally get infected by a zombie, but after turning, you realize what you 've been missing out on. Story: I grew up in fear. Honestly, it's amazing I lived as long as I did, as our numbers dwindled more and more, every year, to their endless numbers. They weren't just a force, they *hunted*, they consumed, they *thought* and fought us, every moment, of every day. The only thing that kept us alive was their tendency to rip their victims apart, before they could be turned. Of course, now I understand. Only the weak couldn't escape. From the *moment* you're bitten, it hits you, like a bucket of ice-cold water, it hits you, fills you with fear and adrenaline. If you can't get away for half an hour for it to happen with that in your system, then you're not worthy of surviving, you're just more food. You're not capable of this. I *get* it, now. When I got infected, I was the last. Nobody is left in this part of the world, as far as I know. And now, I see why they did everything. Those of us who are clever, are fighters, who can be *hunters*, we're the only ones who survived being bitten, or survived attacking the remaining humans. Natural selection at it's finest. Of course, some of us they chose, like me. I asked the one who got me, the same day, once I understood I had nothing to fear. He could have followed me, hunted me down and kept trying, but he understood. I'd proven myself getting as far as I did. ""You had the instinct and the ability, all you needed was to be *one* of us."" My heartbeat is gone, my lungs quiet and dead. My skin is cool to the touch, though it is intact, solid, like that of all the others' I've seen. And yet, for all those things I lack, I've never felt more *alive* than now. Now, I understand. I'm a *predator*. I am a *Hunter*. What I hunt doesn't even matter- so long as I can sink my fangs into its flesh, rip it limb from limb with my claws, stalk it in silence as it walks, unaweare, and fill myself with its meat, its flesh its blood. *This* is all I've required. I am not prey any longer.",0
"Prompt: At age 18 you are required to go to city hall and have someone read you through a choose your own adventure style book of your life while you make the choices. The choices are permanent and will determine your life. You are the clerk reading the books. Story: Another day. Another 18 year old. Another life I've ruined. I've been doing this job for 17 years now. 17 years and 364 days. Tomorrow's something of an anniversary, if you could call it that. How many lives have I seen blossom, only to shrivel and die prematurely based on the rash decisions of a newly minted adult? Far more than those whose lives have been successful. Today, I have three appointments. The first child - I refuse to believe that within the span of a day children magically transform into adults - steps up to the counter. Her dark eyes dart back and forth, from my face to my hands, then back again. ""I'm here for my Reading."" Her voice is shaky, barely a whisper. Her mother tries to look over her shoulder, unsuccessfully at the book-that-is-definitely-not-THE-Book in front of me. Sometimes kids don't show up until the Peacekeepers bring them in. It rarely happened these days, but it didn't hurt to be prepared. ""This way please,"" I gesture towards the door on the right. The huge and imposing door swings open silently as the girl - Tamora, I remind myself - walks under the brightly blazing ""Readers Beware"" sign, and I can't help but wonder if that warning is for her or for me. Most Readers (we prefer clerks, but the public seems particularly enamored with the readers nickname) came into this profession because when we chose, we thought we could trick the Book. We thought that, if only there was a way to help some of these poor souls. They call it a Choosing of Your Life Adventure. But that implies a falsehood. That implies that you actually have a choice in how your life ends up. That hard lives are a result of terrible choices. But after 17 years of Reading after Reading, if there's one thing I've learned, it's not a choice. None of it is. If it were, I would not be sitting here, damning those who, in their youthful ignorance and desire to finish things as quickly as possible, rush their decisions and go with their gut. I would not be sitting here after learning that there is no way to positively influence a child's choice as a Reader. I should have known when, in my own Reading, again and again I was asked if I chose to continue being a Reader. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I said yes each time. I can only imagine the heartbreak that was happening for my Reader, assuming her heart had not shattered beyond repair by that point. Tamora waved timidly to her mother as she crossed over the threshold. Only Readers and Adventurers are allowed over that line, though everyone else usually knows what lies beyond the doors. Two armchairs and a couch, all of which have seen their fair share of tears. A fireplace, for the illusion of warmth. We sit; she is one of the few who select the other chair. Most children sit as far away from me as they can, as if adding distance between the two of us will somehow aid their luck. It doesn't. ""Are you ready?"" I ask gently. ""There's tea in the back if you care for a cup."" She practically flees to the back of the room; I catch a ""you've trained for this!"" half-whispered under her breath as she carefully selects a tea bag. I peek down at her information, her life thus far summarized into paragraphs on the first page. She is most definitely not ready. Few are. According to the book, she had terrible self confidence, a terrible body image, and seemed to compensate for this by achieving high grades. Few girls who came into this room where confident about themselves and fewer, their bodies. It dictated the kinds of choices they made, before they had a chance to find their confidence and learn to love themselves. The glass cup rattling against the saucer snapped me back to the current Adventurer. This time when I asked, she quietly sipped the tea and nodded. ""I see you've got a lot of important decisions ahead of you. College for one. Did you have any in mind?"" I look down at the five schools she was just about to mention. Two crossed themselves off as I watched. ``.... but I suppose that's the one I really want to go to."" I tune back in just in time to catch the name of the college. Thankfully, it wasn't one of the crossed off ones. She picks her dream school, waits for the next round of decisions on majors, and we breeze through a few pages of lowball questions. We even make it through the first year of college alright. But then, ""One of the friends you made in college pulls you aside and tells you that he likes you."" I shake my head a little. Poor dude, I can see where this one is going. ""Um.... do I like him back?"" She interrupts, blushing. ""Well,"" I peer closer at the Book, ""you guys are good friends from the role playing games club..."" But probably not in that way. She bites her lip. I continue. ""Do you tell him you like him back, apologize and turn him down, or run away?"" Her eyes grow wide at the last one. ""What should I do?"" She looks at me pleadingly. You can tell this is her first encounter of this kind. I give her the kindest look I can manage. ""I can't help you or give you advice, for this is *your* adventure, not mine."" The last time I tried to help a child had not gone well. I tried to look at the next page for some hints, some clues. Tried to read the Consequences. Not only had the words on the page rearranged themselves (who would have thought a book could be spiteful) but I nearly dropped the book because it felt like my hand was on fire. ""I.... I don't know what to do. What if..."" her voice trembles, ``.... what if he's the only one who likes me..."" I can practically feel the book rewriting itself with her words, ink flowing underneath the page as I waited with my pen poised. She answers, and as I flip the page and ask her the next set of questions, I can already tell what her answers will be, already see the path that she's been set to walk. This one does not end happily. Our session ends in silence. She thanks me weakly and starts to walk towards to exit. As her hand rests lightly on the door handle, she hesitates and turns around to look at me. ``.... Does anyone ever try to challenge their Adventure Readings?"" Her eyes are pleading. ""Yes."" ""Has anyone ever succeeded?"" ""No."" Not to my knowledge anyways. I've seen some kids try. It's not pretty. I've seen adults try. Also not pretty. I suppose in some sense The Book actually protects them - protects them until their time, at least. I've tried myself too, but the Book insists that my time won't come until there's a large fire of some kind. So I guess I'm safe, if you could call it that. ""Oh."" The doors close slowly behind her. Two more kids today, I just hope their fates are better than the first. They're not. The second appointment was a risk taker, a gambler. An unlucky one, apparently. He chose to drink himself to death. But the third appointment, the third is what got me. I could barely believe what I was reading. ""After your Adventure, you'll exit this room to find the building surrounded by police."" He looks at me, wide eyed and incredulous. ""The Book doesn't list details, but how do you want to react?"" ""It doesn't tell you why there are a ton of police?"" I can hear the nervousness in his voice. ""I'm afraid not. Do you resist them when they go to arrest you?"" ""I didn't do anything wrong!"" ""They don't listen to your protests."" Words float to the surface of the page, countering his protests as he makes them. ""But I've got rights don't I?"" ""Do you let them arrest you?"" ""Not without a warrant, probably cause, or a reason!"" He's getting angry. I don't blame him. ""So you want to decide to resist arrest."" I want to scream at him, tell him that this is the worst possible choice even if he didn't do anything wrong. ""Yes."" As I turn the page, the words that had been inked there previously began to fade, mysteriously winking out as I watched. My heart heavy, I close the book. ""You can go now,"" I barely manage to whisper. ""What?!"" Before I know it, the young man grabs the Book from my hands, trying to rip out its pages. ""No.... no.... no no no NO NO NO NO ""I guess that's why the police will show up soon. He's sobbing, and I can't help as the tears also stream down my face. ""YOU CA N'T LET THEM DO THIS TO ME,"" he screams at me. ""HOW COULD YOU LET ME CHOOSE THAT."" He's not the first to wound me like this. And who can blame him? He probably won't be the last either. I let him rage on, doing my best to keep out of the range of his fists, but a part of me wants to let him hit me. I'm tired of condemning young people to terrible lives. Good kids, who haven't had the time to grow up yet, who are making adult decisions with childish reasonings still. He's still raging, but I make my way towards him, letting his fists pummel my face, my arms, my chest. I can feel his anger, his fear, his sadness with each punch. He's dropped the Book to be able to punch me, and I stoop down to pick it up, wincing as his punches fly harder and faster. Deliberately, I walk over to the fireplace and with all my strength, fling the Book into its flames. The boy has stopped trying to punch me. Instead he looks at me in horror before turning to flee out the door. The Book isn't burning. I am though.",0
"Prompt: A budding young sociopath sits on Santa 's lap. Story: I had the strangest feeling I had seen this kid before, I couldn't figure out where. Sitting on my knee he looked back at his parents and then grinned at me, he scooted a little closer and leaned his head up, ""Kill the reindeer"", he said to me. I jerked back in surprise, ""Excuse me, do you even know what you are saying""? ""Yes."" I kept thinking this child must have had a bad experience, perhaps a video game had altered his mindset, but he still looked so young, I just couldn't understand what was happening. ""Kill the reindeer, Santa."" I looked up from his little face and searched for his parents. Both of them were waiting as usual, a dog and two teenagers were standing with them. They seemed to be ignoring their little son's experience with Santa, only the cameraman had noticed my shock and probably thought I'd heard the little boy tell me mommy and daddy play leapfrog with the door shut. ""What is your name, son""? He seemed to just stare at me, at first it was confusion then he began to realize I must not be the real Santa if I had to ask. I could see the thinking cross his face, it was so bizarre to see this kid react this way, again I couldn't place where I had seen him and that I thought he was younger than he looked. ""Who are you""? The little boy just looked at me, his confusion turning to indignation and then to disgust. Suddenly he reached into his back pocket and pulled out a small phone or device I couldn't place, then I felt him try to jump off of my knee by pushing against my chest. ""NO!"" His mother was rushing over to take the boy off of my lap, her red-orange hair a blur; the father turned, I saw his green pants move toward us because I had fallen off the throne-like chair. There was a pain in my chest and I felt dizzy, the little boy had stabbed me with this device and I couldn't figure out how. ""Sorry, Santa. If that is your real name..."", the father glared at me, it's almost like he hoped I was the real Santa. This was turning more bizarre by the minute. The teen boy in the blue shirt was crying, ""SANTA, SANTA no!"". The teen girl was just standing there, she looked so.... ugly. Then it hit me, I was looking at the family who I'd seen on the news the other night, they had been involved in some kind of accident where a neighbor's bathroom had been destroyed. None of this made sense. The newsman was making fun of the whole situation, apparently the man in the green pants had purchased a tank and shot at the house across the street, exploding the upstairs and killing the man who was taking a bath at the time. Now I had been stabbed by the little boy, what the hell was going on? As the mother was picking up the boy and I was trying to steady myself on the ground the little boy whispered to me, ``.... curse this house-wife harlot"". Then the dog ran up and the boy grabbed for his leash as the mother moved the boy to the ground, they turned and walked back to the two teens and left. I was dumbfounded and bleeding but happy to see them go.",0
"Prompt: An adventurer reaches the end of an epic quest only to be presented with two options; he may keep his life or learn the truth. Story: It had been 45 years. Forty-five years since I had left home, left anyone familiar. Then, I was a sprite 16 years, already pushing to be the one who would find the truth that the elders spoke of in their rhymes and confusing riddles. No one was able to ever determine what'the truth' truly was, but it was suggested by many that if you followed the path the elders described in their stories, you would be able to reach it and see it's beauty. Back then, I had assumed that finding the truth would take me 5, 10 years tops. I had left home, filled with hope. My mother watched me leave the house, with tears in her eyes. I had tried to explain to her that I would return after finding it, and that I would be back to visit. I remember her hugging me, and asking me not to go. I had explained that I needed to, that I couldn't simply stay in our village and live my life without knowing. Besides; the truth was suppose to help me solve her pain, to give her peace. How could I let my mother live her life without needing help to walk three steps, when she was only 40 years old, and a dancer?! I had watched her slowly deteriorate over the last 5 years. Dancing was her passion. I had to stop this curse her body had placed on her. And the truth was the answer. At the time, I didn't realize that once I had started this quest, I wouldn't be able to stop. That I would be so absorbed in traveling and searching that I wouldn't realize the years slipping away. That I was leaving my poor, lonely mother all alone for the rest of her life. At least, I suppose she was gone by now. It had been 45 years. A lot of good the truth ended up doing her. Now, I had reached the end of the story. I had finally understood the rhymes, the riddles.... I was where I needed to be. I looked into the clear pool, seeing the lines on my face, the sun spots upon my skin. A figure sat in front of me, a dark hood covering it's face. It was floating above the pool, just out of reach. It had told me that it was here that many learned the truth. However, once I learned the truth, I could never go back. If I left, I would keep my life; indefinitely. Did I want to live an eternal life? I had no one to call me own. I had no family, no one to call a friend. My thirst for the truth had controlled my life. The figure started ticking it's tongue, mimicking a clock. I could feel the sun setting behind my back. It had told me I had had until sun down to decide. I had been sitting here for hours. I had to decide. There was no way that I went on this journey to not know the truth. I didn't want to believe I had a chance at a normal life. I didn't deserve one now, especially after leaving my mother like I did. I may have broken one promise, but I was not about to break this. ""I want to know."" I felt the figure smile, though I couldn't see it. The figure rose, and opened it's robes. I felt the darkness creeping around me, the cold tendrils of mist making it's way between my feet. I thought my journey had prepared me for this; I was sorely mistaken. I stared at the opening of the robes, questioning why I had wasted my life for this. ""Jordan."" My eyes widened, tears already filling them. Could it be? I turned from the truth, to see a woman standing behind me, her arms wrapped around her body. Her long, brown hair was piled on top of her head in a ballerina's bun. She had a forlorn smile upon her face. ""Mother.""",0

"Prompt: As an astronaut stationed on the International Space Station, you witness Earth 's last moments as mankind destroys itself with nuclear bombs. Story: China- gone, just like that. They said you can see the great wall from space, but suddenly I wasn't so sure. I had never really known much about China to be honest. I'd heard there were exciting festivals packed with people there, embracing a culture that had seemingly lasted forever. A culture that had just ground to a halt. Man, I wish I had a drink at that moment. There wasn't much left of the human race anymore- they had been thorough in their desires to rid the world of each other.... a strange thought when we had been so peaceful until recently. I had thought it would take a while for all the nukes to be sent out but I was barely sent reeling from a country's destruction before another the next followed its course. The first one with personal significance to me was New Zealand. I had taken a trip there and met the most caring woman in the world, the one that I took to be my wife. I thought about the time we had spent there staring at the night sky laughing at each-others jokes, no matter how silly. I slammed my fist on the nearest wall knowing that just like New Zealand my wife and friends would similarly be living only in my mind before long. With a sigh I then thought about humanity's first contact. We had recently managed to communicate with extraterrestrial life, and soon forged a bond with a number of races. We were aglow to show them all what a peace loving race we had become. Before long we were alerted that the Al'Dreth had started a galactic conquest. They brought a group of ships to home planet of the most powerful race known in nearby space, the Ghula, seemingly in peace. Before the Ghula realized the true intention of the visit, their planet had been dusted over with with a thin substance. The Ghula, previously known as a race dedicated to science then became the Al'Dreth's greatest ally as the mind control substance took over. With a gleeful shriek even a kindhearted grandfather would, and did, do unspeakable things to further the Ghula Dominion. When the Al'Dreth came for Earth a few weeks later we had no means to stop their ships from doing their work- we barely even had a foothold in space after all and so we lacked the defenses to stop them. Before the devastation spread too far mankind launched the plan they had developed in those few weeks, and engaged in its most noble moment. Without means to reverse the affliction all we could do was prevent ourselves from aiding the Al'Dreth in destroying the friends we had made in the other races. We united like never before to destroy ourselves before we could destroy others. Just now I got the final call my wife would ever have with me, and talked as much as I could until the connection suddenly cut out. I fell back in my chair and smiled a bittersweet smile through my tears. She had been working her hardest in these last few weeks, doing whatever she could to help others find comfort in what would be their final moments. I could only hope I was at least a slight comfort for when she met her own demise. The Al'Dreth, having seen their failure to secure another race in their ""alliance"", went on their way, not bothering to deal with the International Space Station since in their arrogance they only cared about turning others to their side. All the information that we collected on the mind control substance in the time that it coated our planet was sent to the International Space Station, and I relish the time in which I will be sending it to the races humankind had made its friends. Though we can not help them fight directly, mankind's final moments were devoted to saving countless lives. I have never before been so proud to be a human as I am at this moment.",0
"Prompt: An important press conference, with rows of cameras pointed at you. Dozens of journalists wait with bated breath, until finally you mutter, `` no comment '' into your microphone. The room explodes with excitement. One of them yells, `` this is going to be front page news across the planet! '' Story: I hate ties. I really hate ties. This colorful piece of cloth is strangling me. I can hardly breathe as is… Yet here I stand; about to be lynched. My sentence has already been passed and I still have to get all dressed up for it all to be recorded. I had worked my whole life without ever questioning my employers. I was a good solider and did what I was told. I had spent countless hours covered in sweat, soot, blood and tears because of my work. I ignored all other inquiries from everyone except for my direct superior who, luckily, was the head of all the offices and labs around the world. Even though my official rank was lower, my real ranking was superior to all in my unique field. My rank was even superior to my superior. I am, in fact, the most superior being there ever will be. Hopefully. If I survive this lynching. Well not lynching. I suppose we have surpassed that barbaric practice and many things these days. Yet I still have to die wearing a fucking tie. At least the newest and latest trend in capital punishment is death by pill. I bet that most of the civil world wishes I would die by tie or something much more gruesome. I guess in their eyes I am possibly the worst human ever since Hitler. My superior and I were the best scientists that ever had existed. We had put the final touches on human medicinal research amid the turmoil of a third world war. My superior and I had created a “ cure-all ” vaccine. In fact we had created the vaccine that cured all diseases including the virus that I was later said to have created. With the weapon of near-immortality in hand, we finally brought the evil Asian Coalition of Russia, China, Iran and India to its knees since all humanity really just wants to live long and prosper free of disease and most pain. She and I had created a new united world order. We left all the talking to the political types. Though since now I am standing here, I guess I pissed off a few too many of those types with my philanthropic practices. Part of me wishes I had only told a few about the whole cure-everything thingy. I am glad I didn't since I would not have gotten this far into my research without all of the donations from those who had been given a disease free life. I'm glad the third time around I kept my mouth shut. The second time around was a little different too. My superior had aided me in a massive discovery, someone had been watching. That person was the CIA's elite force that was answerable to the President, and the President alone. They had found out that I had discovered immortality. I had helped create a method that modifies a bodies'current state of existence so that it continuously reconstructs itself to that specific point of being. The central point of regeneration is the largest clump of organic mass that survived whatever trauma the body as a whole had endured. My aging superior had decided to try it out first since she had long since lost her youth and had nothing else but science to live for. She faced the grueling and cruel tests without fail. 20 years of tests passed as I aged to my 54th birthday and she remained an ageless 65 at 85. Many marveled at the youth of 65 year colleague of mine and attributed her fortune to good karma. I however knew better as my final tests of revolting mutilation and “ murder ” unfolded under the watchful eye of the CIA. As my colleague and I celebrated the final results with a bottle of champagne, a giant worldwide massacre of our co-workers occurred and we were abducted. We then found ourselves bound in a room full of the few hundred world elite. We had the secret to immortality and we were only going to give it to them and no one else under the threat of eternal torture. So we obliged their selfish needs while they justified their mass slaughter of a whole charitable conglomerate to the world. They were not done there yet however. They had made one flaw. They thought I was mortal still. I soon found myself standing here in a stupid tie as they announced the final verdict of the military tribunal. I am the worst war criminal according to the civil world that I was once a part of. According to the United States of America and all allied countries; I am the worst spy. I am the worst turncoat that had ever lived. I had not only provided the means to kill millions, I provided all the tools necessary to perform said task. I had sold the evil Asian Coalition the best weapon of mass destruction. The best biological virus ever created. It killed only humans that had not been vaccinated. The victims of said virus just so happened to be half of USA and allied forces. Though it was true that I was once hailed as the hero when I had claimed I had duplicated a vaccine for said virus, I was soon reviled as the virus'co-creator. The media knows that my place of work was purged by the ALL intelligence agencies. At first there was a massive public outcry over all the raid shootings and untried deaths. Outrage soon followed as convincing false accusations came out against a well-known public figure: Yours Truly of course. The worldwide media storm that followed was so loud and strong that both my superior's and my words of protest were no longer heard. After all, who would believe me now? I am the best worst false war criminal there ever was. My colleague and I had created immortality. I had not yet been able to make myself immortal according to the most secret of documents on Earth. Yet we had not yet created eternal youth. Little did they know my colleague and I had reached our collaborative peak. I became closest to the divine in those last 20 years. I had created eternal youth amidst the ongoing tests on and with my colleague. Though no one knew that. To the watchful eye of the CIA, I looked like I was just tinkering with machines and samples to assure that my colleague returns from death's door. I had been actually refining the process of making one's self immortal. Through some luck I stumbled upon a method to retain the perfect ideal age to exist while still possessing eternal life. I had been waiting for the first immortality method to be long-established before I would tell my colleague of my discovery. I would have told her had she not informed the new elite that she certain that I was not immortal. Well, I believe I would have I suppose… I can't wait to be in front of these reporters in 100 years when I tell them I also know how to kill immortals. They can sit back and enjoy as I publicly “ die ” for them. Finally. I'm glad that stupid President got a good gloat for those goon's cameras. It only took her 20 minutes to. I'm surprised. She took hours back in the holding room before we went on stage. I guess I'm still trying to wrap my head around this immortality thing since I can not wait to see the true shock, awe and disappointment Mrs. President has to endure in the future. I can not wait to kill the new god of the world. Until then I must endure. She turned her face towards myself. Her eyes gleamed with a haughty wickedness that I couldn't wait to remedy. “ I have known you for many years yet I do not know if these old bones of mine can handle seeing this filth's face any longer. I suppose that even filth like you deserve their last few rights. Any last words to redeem yourself in the eyes of a former colleague and former friend? How about it Judas? ” Bitch. The crowd is almost jittering. I'm surprised nothing but a few pens, shoes and saliva have struck me. Especially after that wonderful farce of a speech. Hmm… Well here it goes… “ I may have been your savior for a time but now I am your curse. We live and we die yet karma is kind. ” I pause for a moment. I hope I yelled loud enough. I'm surprised that my words could mute this hateful crowd. I guess that's what happens when I don't get a microphone shoved into my face. I was about to continue my well-thought-out final words a reporter laughed and shouted; “ Yeah! It sure got you here for sure! ” The crowd roared. I couldn't help but smile a little. I'm glad there is still some humor left after the war. My former colleague now president turned to me and grinned. “ You have anything else to say? ” I laughed and grinned back at her and said “ No comment. ” -- - Edit: noob at formatting and reddit posting Edit2: still a noob at formatting.

"Prompt: You ’ re a supervillain who really just enjoys ruining people 's days. Summon rain on people sitting in the park, waking people up at 3AM using your sonic booms while flying through the air, stuff like that. You ’ re on holiday when a real villain decides to take your city hostage ... You 're furious. Story: I read this funny post once on reddit once, this guy made an incredibly convincing argument that ""The Troll"" was the most powerful supervillain known. He pointed out The Troll's ability to control weather to the same extent as that hero, Typhoon, which he of course uses to literally rain on people's parades, he can fly as fast as Captain Fabulous waking them up at all hours with his sonic booms. He pointed out the Troll's invulnerability and strength, quoting the Closed Highway incident where the military finally stepped in and after bombarding the Troll's position with as many ordinance as were dropped in Iraq during the first half a year of the war, then dug his way out of the rubble and then telekenetically removed the firing pins from every military grade rifle within 5 miles, sped around and removed a single link from the treads of every tank and then made his way to the nearest airbase where he replaced the Jet fuel with koolaide and wrote quips about the pilots mothers on the tips of all the bombs. The poster said that we were lucky that The Troll seems to have no desire to kill anyone, just bug the hell out of our city, with a whopping death toll of 1 (A man he was quick to point out died of a heart attack from fear and his family found a heartfelt apology on their doorstep and a significant deposit in their bank accounts) he's almost harmless, almost. I liked him until he said I was almost harmless, I hope he liked the peanut butter on his sparkplugs. Anyway I think it's time I put his theory to test, you see there I was in Maui, enjoying myself making the sand too hot to walk on and the water to cold to swim in and while I'm raining on an out door wedding and replacing sunscreen with BBQ sauce I saw the news. They said Typhoon was dead, Captain Fabulous was hospitalized, The Boulder was MIA, and Team Paramount had retreated back to their Fortress of Protectitude to lick their wounds, and all at my front door, all in MY CITY. That bastard Doctor Reprobate decided he was going to step in and make my home his center of operations. Do you know how many people they said were dead? Almost two thousand! Two thousand! So, you're probably wondering why I told you this, two reasons, first I want someone to know I'm about to do a good deed for the first time in my life, they might even build a statue in my honor or some cheesy crap like that, the second because I love that look of terror on your face and wanted to let it last a few more seconds, it's like you actually believe I'm going to drop you off this radio tower. Whelp, time to head home, hold tight to that ladder on your way down, I don't want you falling, the good Doctor has the only blood that's going to be on my hands by tonight.",0
"Prompt: Scientists discover an algorithm for predicting a person 's date of death with 95 % confidence. When you finally decide to enter your parameters into the algorithm you see a surprising result. Story: A lot of times, you'll hear someone who had a near death experience say that they're ""living on borrowed time."" Man, they have no idea. Everyone thought it was a joke, at first. Answer a few questions and find out how long you have left? No way was that possible. Oh, sure, plenty of people signed up for it, but it mostly just for shits and giggles, like going to a psychic or playing with a Ouija board. Some people took it seriously, but they were the weirdos, the headcases, the kind of people who already believed in all kinds of stupid crap. It took a little while for all the information to come together, but after about six months, it came to light that a lot of people were dying *exactly* when their deaths had been predicted. After two years, the facts became too obvious to ignore: the death date machines were right. Always. Well, almost always. I'd managed to avoid the things for a while. I have a bad habit of overthinking, so even when we'd had the luxury of denial, it was the kind of thing that would have weighed heavily on my mind, and I didn't want that. So I stayed the hell away, especially after we learned that the whole thing was real. I had no intention of learning my death date. Fate, though, had other plans. It became common practice in hospitals to determine patient's death date, especially in life and death cases. This allowed hospitals to free up resources, focusing on the patients who had at least a few years left. If you got hit by a car and your death date was a week from now, why bother with a bunch of expensive surgery? They'd make you comfortable and let nature take its course. Kind of scary, if you think about it. I was outside cleaning the gutters one day when a breeze from hell came out of nowhere and my ladder fell over. I hit the patio pavement, and my head went fuzzy for a few seconds. There was a lot of blood, but I felt fine a few minutes later. My wife, anxious little worrywart that she was, insisted on driving me to the emergency room, just in case. I agreed, mostly to appease her, but also because head injuries are serious business, and it really had been a lot of blood. I knew the hospital would take my death date, but the law forbade them from releasing that information to the patient unless they specifically asked for it, except in extreme cases. My case ended up being extreme. I knew I was in for it when the nurse walked in, holding one of those black sheets of paper. My wife, sitting in one of those uncomfortable green chairs they have in patient's rooms, let out a gasp. ""I don't want it,"" I told her, shaking my head. ""It's in the past,"" she said quietly. ""What?"" ""Your death date. It's in the past."" I didn't have a choice at that point. Without consciously deciding to do so, I reached out and accepted the sheet of paper. First, I made sure that it was really mine. It was. My name was printed at the top, along with my date of birth, my social security number, and all those other metrics that the government uses to sort its citizens. Printed in large type at the bottom of the page was, ""December 21, 2012."" ""What does this mean?"" I asked. ""I don't know,"" the nurse said. ""I, uh, I'll go get the doctor."" My wife and I sat in silence, her hand in mine, for the next hour. Finally, a bald man in a white coat came in, looking disheveled. ""We ran your death date six times,"" he said. ""Same date, every time. I called up the Center for Disease Control, they keep track of the death date program. You are the first recorded person to have lived past your death date."" My stomach churned, and I fought down the urge to throw up. ""So what does it mean?"" I asked, not really expecting a coherent answer. My expectations were met. ""We have no idea,"" he told me. ""The good news is that you don't have a concussion. You're free to leave. The CDC might want to contact you. You should know, though, that word of this will not get out, not from the hospital. Patient confidentiality."" ""Thanks, doc,"" I said. With that, my wife and I left. We didn't make it very far though. I was too rattled to drive, so I asked her to do it. To this day, I still haven't forgiven myself for that. She was rattled by the experience, too. I should have seen that. She didn't look both ways before pulling out of the hospital parking lot. She didn't see the eighteen-wheeler coming. The truck slammed into her side of the car. The car went flying. We rolled, and another eighteen-wheeler hit us, this one coming the other way. Neither of us had a seatbelt on. We both ended up on the pavement. I was conscious though the whole thing. I heard her cries of pain when the ordeal started, and I heard them get cut off when the car rolled on top of us. It kept rolling, thankfully saving us the trouble of being trapped, but the damage was done. For the second time in the same day, I found myself covered in blood. Only this time, it wasn't my own, not all of it. There was a lot of commotion as the truck drivers stopped and came to try and help. The ER staff came and transported my wife and I back into the building. I could barely recognize her due to all the trauma. I was hurt, there was no way I couldn't be. I should have been dead, though. After everything I went through, after having a freaking *car* land on me, I should have been the same bloody pulp that my wife was. But I wasn't. That black piece of paper kept resurfacing in my mind. The nurses and ER techs kept walking by my room, glancing in nervously, as though they were afraid of me. The nurse who was actually taken care of me spoke in short, quiet bursts, as though I were a vengeful god, one easily angered. It wasn't a surprise when they came and told me that my wife was dead. No need to punch in her numbers, no need to get a black piece of paper with her name on it. She was already gone. They let me out of the hospital the next day. I got a ride home with a friend, but insisted on being alone when he tried to stay and look after me. I lied and told him I would be fine. Once he was gone, I went to the garage. I closed the garage door, got a hose, and stuck one end on the exhaust pipe. The other end I put through the window of my wife's car, the little Toyota she'd loved. I sat in the car, turned it on, and relaxed. It wasn't long before I lost consciousness. Then something unexpected happened. I woke up.",0
"Prompt: Batman gets a call from commissioner Gordon about trouble down at Arkham Asylum. As soon as he arrives he sees the culprit giving himself up to the police. He 's a security guard who has shot and killed several of Arkham 's frequent residents. Story: ""I got a riddle for you,"" the thick steel door was ajar, just me standing between it and the thin man in an empty room. ""Oooooh, I love riddles,"" he cackled in reply, twisted son of a bitch. ""How many twelve gauge shotgun slugs can a man take before he dies?"" ""That's not a very good riddle,"" he said, tilting his head and giving me a queer look. I racked the slide and fired, once. As The Riddler fell to the floor with a gaping wound in his chest, I shrugged. ""One."" The next cell was occupied by a fat man with a disturbingly long nose. ""What do you want?"" he snarled, baring pointed teeth. ""I was thinking about taking a vacation,"" I said, racking the slide again and firing once into his ugly, putrid face, ""maybe I'll go fishing."" Another cell, another freak. ""Hey doc,"" I said, drawing her gaze to mine, ""I think I have a problem."" ""We all got problems baby,"" she said, high pitched and annoying, so I shot her in the throat. ""Problem solved."" I could hear the other guards pounding on the main door, shouting for the control room to open it. I wasn't done yet. ""Knock knock,"" I shouted at the next door, before sliding it open. ""A joke! Who's there?"" the occupant shouted gleefully, clapping his hands. The roar of the weapon filled the room and my ears rang. On the floor, choking and coughing on his blood, Joker looked up and grinned from ear to ear. ""Disgusting,"" I growled, racking the slide to eject a spent shell to the floor. ""Disgusting.... who?"" he choked out through the froth in his mouth. Another gunshot was the punchline. I wasn't finished but I'd done enough. I wouldn't hurt my comrades. It was as easy as putting my hands above my head and waiting. No resistance. They did me a kindness and didn't throw me down or beat me. Just stared in the cells at the bloody mess I'd left behind. It was half an hour in a Gotham PD cruiser before the Commissioner showed. He looked at me in horror before making a phone call. Then the ""Batman"" showed up. Our hero. ""Why?"" he roared, pulling me from the car with rage in his eyes, ""Why!"" I laughed, slowly building to hysterics before I managed to get the words out. ""You couldn't do it, so I did. They're all gone now, all gone. No more plots and schemes, just death. I ended it. Finally."" He threw me down in disgust, marching off to sulk I'm sure. Some high rooftop where he could brood while the people suffered at the whims of sick freaks. He was just as bad. His time would come.",0
"Prompt: Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate. Story: Everette, 70's, a tough old man with a Navy service tattoo wearing an old white t-shirt, sits at his workbench in a cluttered garage. A half drunk bottle of scotch and a three-finger full tumbler sit on the bench beside him. He mumbles, talks to himself. ""Miss her is why I do it."" ""Changed so damn much. She ain't my Helen anymore, that's for sure. Everette take your pills, stay off the booze. “ He drinks, and pours. He sways slightly, drunk on the shop stool. ""She's got all them new clothes, like I wouldn't notice. I noticed. Changed her hair, dyed it even. Getting made up everyday now it seems, lipstick and all of it. ” ""She looks like my Helen, but I know."" He stands quickly, sending the stool clattering to the floor. He braces himself on the bench, swaying. “ Your own damn daughter thinks you're a crazy old man, won't even come to see no more! Well I ain't fucking crazy! ” He takes up an old, worn hammer from the bench. He feels it's weight in his hand, flexes against the grip. With his free hand he grabs the bottle and chugs a pair of deep gulps. The hit rocks him and spittle falls from his open mouth, he shakes it off and stumbles out of the garage. He stumbles through the house, knocking into furniture, scraping against the hall wall and bringing down framed photographs. Alana, in her late 40's, emerges from the door at the end of the hall, she's half asleep and in her pajamas. “ Hey, what are you doing up … ” Everette swings the hammer and connects, Alana collapses to the floor. He drops the hammer and drags her into the room. He binds her up with bedsheets and props her up against the bed's headboard. Her heads lolls and she starts to come to. “ Where's my Helen! ” Alana looks up, her eye swollen and face bloody. She is crying. “ Dad, you're confused again, please, it's me… ” Everette slaps her hard across the face. “ No more lies! What'd you do with my wife! ” “ Dad please you're sick. It's me Alana, I've been living here for months, to help you. ” A wave of horror passes over Everette's face as he stands to his full height, his head in his shaking hands. “ When Mom died you got real bad, your real sick Dad, please I'm hurt real bad, I need a hospital. ” Everette snorts and wipes his eyes, before regaining his composure and then finding his rage. “ Helen's not dead you lying bitch! And my daughter is half your age! I don't know who you are, or what you did with my Helen, but I aim to find out. ” Everette steps into the hall and picks up the hammer. As he enters the room and closes the door, his daughter Alana screams.",0
"Prompt: It had been 12 years since your high school girlfriend suddenly died. Today, on vacation, you bump into her. Story: Had it not been for the hangover, I wouldn't have noticed her. It was at some local dive, in Cartagena, in July. I sat outside, sipping water in the enveloping heat, a heat which seemed to pierce straight through the awning and roast my insides. I had three glasses of water and alternated looking through each, trying to distill the world into something less headache-inducing. I saw someone with a mustache, and a straw hat, and a loose-fitting button-down shirt (Hawaiian-print, no less), with skin was so goddamned bright in the light - like made of mirrors - I pulled my head up from the table just to shout at that someone to get a tan. At least, I was about to, but when I looked up I noticed that someone's mustache was crooked - comically so - and then my head really started to swirl. “ Liz? ”, I muttered. I felt as confused as a kangaroo set out on a frozen lake. She - clearly she I could recognize those eyes from anywhere - pulled a German-language newspaper in front of her face. I kept staring for several minutes, ignoring the many-legged mass of ceviche that had summoned itself to my table. “ Liz? ”, I said, even quieter, which - strangely enough - was what got her attention. She replied in German, but then waved me over. I grabbed my ceviche and two of the three glasses of water. “ What the hell is going on? You were. ” She lowered the newspaper, her already askew moustache becoming even more askew as she spoke. “ Dead? ” “ Yeah? What? I have no - Liz what - I can't. You're alive? I am asleep? I am way too hungover for this. ” “ Aren't we all, Al, aren't we all? And keep your voice down! Do you know any German? Can you speak to me in German? Ah, it doesn't matter. I don't think this place is planted; I haven't been here before. It would just be a shot in the dark for them. ” “ You died. Twelve years ago. I was devastated, Liz. ” “ Were you, though? ”, she said, raising an eyebrow. “ Yes! ” “ Well, actually, Al, I know you were. I saw you at the funeral. You looked pretty beat up. ” “ You attended your own funeral? ” “ Wouldn't you, given the chance? ” I felt like throwing up, but more of a throwing up of my whole body, which I imaged would look like a sea cucumber stepped on by a boot. I couldn't eat, I couldn't think, I just watch those long-lost eyes flit back and forth between my face and the surroundings. “ Al, walk with me. ” I stood, automatically. “ Am I dreaming? ” We followed the side-street to its terminus at a major road, one where she talked a little more openly in the din of early afternoon. “ Alice, you're really down the rabbit hole now, you know. Ha! You really think I died in a jet-ski accident? And that my body was so badly-damaged that they couldn't go open-casket, like my parents would have wanted. ” “ They told me you looked like a crash-test dummy that had been filled with ground beef. ” “ I told them to tell you that, Al. I thought you'd think it was funny. I mean, it is, right? ” “ Why would you do that? That's not funny? ” “ Al, humor is the only thing that keeps me going. Also, you need to call me Eugene Steinereiner when we're in public. And why didn't you tell me my moustache was crooked?! Christ, Al, you need to pay more attention. But that's all beside the point. Are you aware of the textbook definition of an amphibian vis-a-vis a reptile? Really, Al - this is important. ” “ Is this a joke? ” I grabbed her hand and she whipped her head back at me. “ There are no jokes! Not anymore! I mean, there certainly are jokes, Al, I didn't mean to say it so absolutely. There are jokes - but not this! Amphibians, Al! ” “ What, why? ” I followed Liz to a run-down hotel, *Paraiso Perdido*. She beckoned me up the rundown stairway, passing a concierge wearing a coconut-white three-piece suit, who she addressed in German and broken Spanish. Before she opened the door to her room, she turned back to me, wild-eyed. “ Al, I'm going to need you to promise me something before I tell you. At this point, you already know I'm alive and not a broken-up bag of hamburger meat, so I can't have you going back state side without a little debriefing. And then - you know - your life definitely will get weird afterwards. But hell, everyone's lives are a little weird, and you were always want for adventure, right? ” “ Liz, what are you talking about? ” “ Al, it's not lizard-people. It's frog-people. They had it wrong the whole time. Global warming, rising sea levels? Bad for frogs; great for frog-people. ” “ Liz.... ” “ Al, as soon as you step through this door, there's no stepping back. ” She adjusted her mustache again, as if by a nervous tick. The key clicked in the door, unlocking a path so unimaginable that I even as it unfolded I could scarcely believe it was happening.",0
"Prompt: Dora does not know the truth. Boots, Swiper, and the Map do, and they must never let Dora know. Today, it just got much harder. Story: ""Come on, donde est la biblioteque?"" Dora smiled as she educated bilingually. Map inwardly winced at Dora's mangled attempt at languages. He exchanged a look with Boots, who sighed. Both knew that the command of two languages kept her happy. And they knew what happened when she *wasn't* happy.... ""Hola, little girl"" a heavily tattooed teen stood in the way. His friends sniggered from the sidelines as Dora looked up and smiled. ""Hola, friend! Tu madre es una puta de burros!"" Map and Boots blanched white as the teen's snigger turned to a snarl under the howls of laughter from the onlookers. ""You snot nosed brat! I'll teach you to insult Mothers! Here, give me your bag you little Puta!"" *SLAP! * Dora fell to the floor clutching her face. Slowly she reached behind her back. ""You - you shouldn't have swiped that. That isn't nice..."" She muttered as she pulled Swiper from his sheath. The blade gleamed dully. Map and Boots took one look and fled from the scene around the corner. Behind them they could hear it play out like clockwork. ""Hey, what have you got there little girl? You could injure someone with.... aaaiiieeee!"" And the tell-tale splashing of arterial spray. ""Swiper, no swiping, Swiper no swiping, Swiper no swiping! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!"" Maps looked at Boots as the screams of the youths punctured the night sky. ""See Boots. This is why we had to flee Mexico. And yet there is no escape."" Boots nodded glumly. It was all he could do; They had tried to flee before, *she* had caught up and now Boots was tongueless. The screams had turned to gurgles and the rattles of last breaths. Dora turned the corner and giggled. ""There you are! Come my friends, let us find the library! Those youths were most helpful! *Satana riempire le vostre anime con piombo caldo! *"" And the three skipped off in search of the next adventure.",0
"Prompt: The Chosen One goes to confront the powerful witch who 's terrorizing the kingdom ... and is defeated. How did it happen? Story: Darius hits the wall with a loud thump, flung backward by a blast of magic to his chest. Vervain circles his location with caution, a faint smile playing across her lips. He coughs up blood, the red dotting the stone floor in front of him. “ You really thought that just a curse to repel magic would help you? ” Vervain giggles at the thought, stepping forward. “ It repels the effect of the magic but never the force. Not that you'll live long enough to see that put into action. ” Her fingers dig into the short hair on his scalp, pulling him up to look her in the face. Darius groans in pain. Vervain's eyes twinkle with delight. “ Did you think you were the Chosen One? The one the masses claim will kill me? ” Unable to take a deep enough breath to respond, Darius only gives another cry of pain. He had the mark, found the sword, even matched the description but has no idea what's gone wrong. He had even invested time in training with the local garrison under the pretense of working for Vervain's army. She should be dead, the sword stuck through her. Instead, the sword couldn't even put a scratch on her. “ I think your head will look lovely on the gate. A reminder for all. ” Vervain lights up her hand with flames, the orange glow far too close for Darius's comfort. Her grin grows wider by the second. “ What a pleasure this'll be. It's been far too long since I've killed an intruder. ” There's a crash through the window, Vervain letting Darius drop to the floor to block a blast of magic with both hands. The stonework wraps around him like a blanket, swallowing him up. He weakly struggles until he's thrown out onto the grass, laying there too weak to move further. “ Come on, get up! ” It's an older man yelling at him. Darius struggles to even get to his knees. The man gives in, glancing up towards where blasts of magic in a rainbow of colors are being pelted back and forth. “ Fucking idiot. Where's the sword? ” Darius can only stare at him, focused on the dark scruff across his cheeks. “ For fuck's sake! ” The man picks Darius up with some effort, throwing him across the saddle of a horse before hopping on. “ You better hope that Isadora doesn't get hurt for you, because I'm going to do worse than Vervain would to you if that's the case! ” The man smacks the reins, sending the horse flying across the grassy, moonlit field. With each stride of the horse, Darius feels more pain run through him. He's more like dead weight for the horseman compared to someone actually trying to stay on. He closes his eyes, gritting his teeth against the tears that threaten to come. It wasn't supposed to be like this. *** ^ (*Thanks for reading, check out more of my stuff at /r/Syraphia*)",0
"Prompt: You discover that Earth is the `` North Korea '' of the galaxy Story: ""Are they ready to go live?"" Zuko asked. ""Yup, in just a minute,"" Tomi replied as he leaned back in his reclining chair. This was a moment that the entire galaxy would see. After 10 years of avoiding all sorts of sensors and detectors, NICE news was finally getting a Live Leak into Earth. The monitor screen flickered on: *And now for our prime time feature. Never before seen footage of the blue marble we call Earth. NICE news has just landed a camera crew on the ground and they will feed us a video stream for the next couple of weeks. Let's take you to the ground with Lazar Tigin. * The screen turned white as the camera was adjusting for the sun's rays. Lazar Tigin appeared on the screen of billions as he adjusted his headset in front of a massive city. Tigin whispered, ""I'm here in Southern New Jersey where you can get a glimpse of Earth's most spectacular city, New York City. We arrived a few days ago and have been stealthily moving toward this city. The smell on this planet is amazing out here in the forest. However, the industrial zones are horrific. I doubt we can get much closer to the City without being spotted. We are going to try and maneuver our way down the coastline to sunny Florida."" As soon as Tigin finished his sentence, a strange aerial vehicle with four wings approached. It was loud and caused a wind uproar. The cameraman lost hold of the device and it crashed to the ground. The footage was still playing as men rappelled from the helicopter. The last thing the camera played back was an image of a man pointing a weapon at the camera.",0
"Prompt: You are legally allowed to commit murder once, but you must fill out the proper paperwork and your proposed victim will be notified of your intentions Story: It wasn't the type of letter you expected to get. It always seemed like something that happened to somebody else, karma finally and definitively reaching into someone's life to set things right. I didn't know anyone personally who had received one, but you always hear the stories – so-and-so's second cousin, a guy who worked with my father, the one-upper claiming his father sent one to the guy he worked for. With the way the papers talked about it, you could never be sure if they were more or less popular than people thought they would be. I knew a few of the basics – you found out everything about the sender. You got a set of mug shots. Front, profile, height, weight, and age. Full name and known aliases. Office where they went to submit their application, and the most important detail of all: the date the notice took effect. That was the real kicker there, since I had a bad habit of never opening my mail. The listed date was March 24: today was the 27th. There exists a category of butt-puckering feelings that seemed to underline, bold and italicize serious “ holy shit ” moments. The minor chills that accompany the debut of an awesome movie trailer would be the shallowest end of that spectrum. A more serious “ what am I thinking ” moment of reflection that comes before your first skydive would be a tick or two above average. The full-on “ oh my fucking God! ” that comes just before a 200km/h street racing accident was my previous high water mark. None of those had anything on that dropping, falling, fainting feeling that accompanied the moment I found out that not only was I fair game, but at any point in the previous three days one John S. Ramos could have murdered me at any time, legally. At this point of the story I'd like to pretend I was as calm and collected as a certain debonair super spy, that I finished my drink in a gulp and brought a ludicrously sized handgun out of some secret pocket on my coat, chambering a round before seducing the nearest woman, but I'm not a great liar. I shut all the blinds, locked my doors, pushed my couch up against the front door and then dove into my bedroom closet. There in the dark, I remembered that a murder notice went both ways. You sent one and your intended victim got the same privilege on you that you got on them. There in the dark, after the hours of intense panic subsided, I started putting together a plan. John S. Ramos wasn't going to kill me: I would kill him. COMING NEXT FALL An ordinary man, in an ordinary life, gets an extraordinary letter that will change him, or end him, forever lead in to your next summer blockbuster, like the Purge except it won't suck",0
"Prompt: Couple raises group of orphans in a barn, working with goats. Every year the orphans must vote one of their own to move into the house and join the family. Story: John, red-haired and freckled, is one of the older boys, sixteen and growing. He ain't got a lot of meat on him, and he's short for his age, but he's as slippery as a fish, with a smile like the sweet curve of a sickle. He butts heads a lot with the oldest of the boys in the barn, Thomas. What Thomas says usually goes because he's bigger and more experienced than the other, more younger boys. He is nineteen and handsome, dark haired and blue-eyed with broad shoulders and a narrow waist. He's good with the goats, dedicated and intuitive, but even with his experience they have had bad years. John never gives up the chance to pick a fight with anybody, especially Thomas, but he more often than not also has Thomas' back. When one of the younger boys asks him why he always attacks and defends Thomas, John just shrugs. ``'T's good to keep him humble."" He doesn't really mean that, though, because culling the boys do the same thing. It's good to keep him fighting, John supposes in the bad years,'cause they need Thomas to see them through again. The goats this year have been especially good because of Thomas, with only one lost in the winter months, an old nanny unable to produce anymore milk. Three goats have rounded bellies, and the pastures promise to be full and sweet this summer. By the time market comes, the goats will be healthy and strong, and that means one of them will be going to the house. ""Who's Thomas gon na pick, John?"" asks a blond boy, Billy, who is good at milking the goats and not much else. ""How should I know?"" John scoffs. ``'Cause you're Thomas' best friend,"" Sam, a young boy of ten, says. He's new and a little in love with Thomas. ""Just ask him yerself. Ain't like he only talks to me,"" John replies, exasperated. ""He's at the house right now,"" Sam says, and one of older boys, Red, whistles. ""I bet he and the Missus are having some *private words*, if y'know what I mean,"" David leers. ""He's probably just telling the one's at the house how things are,"" Billy says, face flushed and voice scandalized. ""They're the ones who go ta market with the goats."" ""Wonder when they're gon na come by the barn again. It'd be real nice to see Red again,"" David says with an obscene roll of his tongue. Billy cover Sam's ears. He opens his mouth, but John beats him to the reply. ""Wait until ya fill in your breeches before you start going after Red like that, or else he'll be mighty disappointed to see that worm between your legs,"" John shoots just as Thomas walks through the barn doors. ""What the hell are you all doing, standing with your mouths open like you're catching flies? Quit slacking off to daydream, market ain't coming yet!"" Thomas roars, and the boys rush into motion. ""What we you fools doin?"" he asks John when the red-head just gives him a side-eyed look. ""How much the Missus fancies you,"" John says. Thomas frowns. ""I would never --"" ""I know,"" John dismisses with a wave of his hand. ""Doesn't stop her, though."" He watches Thomas for a moment before the older boy motions to him. John falls in step with him and they leave the barn to change shifts on overseeing the goats in the pastures. The air is light between them, and John asks casually, ""Who're you gon na pick this year for the house?"" Thomas' easy expression darkens. ""There ain't no guarantee that this year will be good."" ""You worked hard this year,"" John says, and he can see hear the goats in the distance and boy's laughter. ""This year will be good."" ""I'm tired,"" Thomas sighs after a moment. ""I'm tired of having to choose."" ""It's a hard thing,"" John nods, ""and that's why we have you do it,'cause you're the best of us. You coulda have gone to the house years ago, but ya stayed instead."" He pauses for a moment as the thought strikes him. ""You wan na take care of us, and, Hell, you try to do us right.... We'll be okay as long as you're with us."" Thomas doesn't reply, and for a moment John worries that the air has become suddenly uncomfortable. He is about to speak through the awkward when Thomas says, ""I'm thinkin' about ending it."" John makes an inquisitive sound because he can't quiet shake the awkward yet. ""I'm thinkin' we either run or kill'em."" ""Ain't got no place to run to,"" John says after a beat. ""As for kill'em.... I could do it."" Thomas' eyes turn sharp. ""I ain't gon na let you do it."" ""Why?"" ``'Cause it ain't your place to."" ""Could be,"" John shoots. ""It ain't like I've not done anything less for you in the past."" Thomas looks away. ""I know."" ""Are you for it, then?"" John probes. He's been wondering if Thomas would do this someday as the Mister and Missus began to demand more and more. ""I'll do what I have to do,"" he says, still not meeting John's gaze. ""Good,"" John says. ""We always know you do.""",0
"Prompt: Write a deep, philosophical piece about anything you choose, however all it builds up to is a reference. Story: ""So, that's it?"" I asked. ""I just point at one person and I'll end their life?"" The man floating next to me turned his head from side to side as though he were considering several options for a Saturday evening dinner destination where every restaurant happened to sound particularly appealing. ""Well,"" he finally began. ``, not you *specifically*, but yes. Picking someone out will result in the termination of their life."" ""And if I refuse to do that at all?"" ""More's the same to me! I don't really care whether or not time continues in this plane of existence."" He lazily tilted his head towards the strange brass lamp I cleaned which summoned him. ""At least here, there's actually some shit to see and do rather than sit and meditate or stare at the brass walls for a few millennium."" I looked down and defeated at the lamp by my feet and gave it a soft kick. ""I don't think I could kill anyone."" I finally said after gazing off into the frozen sunset for a while. ""Like I said, it doesn't necessarily have to be *you*. Hell, I'll let you choose the method, even."" The strange man drifted towards me casually and reassuringly pat me on my shoulder. In an odd way, his gesture felt genuinely reassuring as opposed to forced and asympathetic, like I expected it to be. ""What if,"" I said very slowly and carefully. I have plenty of time while time doesn't run, which is nice. That means I can carefully deliberate what I want to say and not make any mistakes. ``, what if I gave it to someone else? The kill?"" ""What if they choose you?"" answered the man with a sly grin. ""Well, that's a good point..."" I thought some more. I sat down in the dirt and stared at the forever sunset. At least this non-genie was able to capture the world at such a perfect point in time. The rich purples and blues were splayed over the deep reds like someone took a few different colors of taffy and began to mix them until they began to resemble mixed leftover carnival cotton candy. ""Why do I have to do this at all?"" ""Excuse me?"" the non-genie refocused his attention away from a dandelion which was frozen in time right as the breeze had begun to blow it's white seedlings away. ""Why do I have to kill anyone at all? Who made it your job to make people do this?"" ""Sorry man, that's classified information for mortals. Maybe you'll find out after you're dead."" ""There's an afterlife."" ""For some people."" He shrugged and returned his gaze to the dandelion. ""Do you need help deciding?"" ""On whether or not to do it?"" ""No, that's something you have to do on your own, unfortunately. I don't want to twist your fate too terribly much. I'm just the smoking gun..."" He looked back at the brass lamp nearby to where I had been standing. ``.... well, smoking lamp that will be in your hands.""",0
"Prompt: A dystopian future where a pack of Big ( Bad ) Wolves terrorize the human population, and the only saviors are a group of female warriors donning red cloaks/hoods. Story: The howl resounded about the hidden valley, its nuanced pitches and tones conveying in a few seconds what would take human language minutes. Sixredhumansfromoutsidevalleyalongroad. Subsiding, the sentinel turned away, leaving an eerie stillness that belied the passage of the twelve Silent Ones who loped through the forest. Moments before bursting onto the path, their very senses confirmed the sentinel's song. Patches of red shone through the undergrowth, blazing like tiny suns in their sensitive eyes. They all smelled the travelers- smelled the dust and sweat of a long travel. But, most of all, they heard. Ears attuned, their silent passage resounded in their ears as they searched for a trap. But there was none. Although the surviving villagers had made an uneasy truce with the Brethren, they knew not to step foot outside their town, especially not at night- especially wearing red. But these travelers, broadcasting deliciousness into the environs as clear as night, were outside the valley; and so were unaware of the Weapon. The twelve stalwarts burst out of the undergrowth, all discipline lost, each racing for his meal. Yet, with a voice that seemed casual but must have spoken with considerable alacrity, considering the narrowness of the path and the speed of the assault, a Red nonchalantly said, ""Woah there mateys!"" As if bidden by an unseen force, the Brethren scrambled back to the treeline, a movement observed by the sassy sister with considerable amusement. ""C'mon now fellas, no need ta be afeared of the laight. We ain't gon na hurts ya."" Nonplussed, the Brethren officer -or his bureaucratic equivalent in the Pack- seemed to consider the situation, even as his eleven juniors edged away from the blinding red. But, whatever their sixth sense may tell them, they know better than to retreat. Making up his mind, he snarled rather lamely, ""Who are you?"" Another sister addressed him, her lazy eyes amused by his obviously rare bout of civility, ""Some boy messenger came to the big city a whiles back. Said choo were giving him trouble. And me and the sisters here don't like to see trouble,'specially if it don't come in red."" Deciding that his reputation could survive another moment of decency, the leader growled, ""Use of the Weapon is forbidden. Shoot a stake through my heart, and the village shall not see sunup."" Yet another Red spoke, ""Weapons? Stakes? Good lord matey, all youse really do only think of blood. But, see, me and the sisters here, we think you're just a big furry koala bear who hasn't had enough cuddles. That's what meat does to big furry koala bears, ya ken, it turns them into big bad wolves. So, ya see, we're gon na show ya just how much fun a vegetarian diet can be. Load up the pot, girls!"" As the Reds busied themselves around their conveniently-already-cooking cauldron, the Brethren leader weighed up his options. He knew that he could not go back, for the Brethren would have heard of the girls and would be expecting a meal, one way or the other. He did not notice- could not notice- that his eleven packmates had already disappeared into the undergrowth. Then he decided that weighing up options was religious blasphemy, ATTACKATTACKATTACK. Yet as he stepped out of the woods he suddenly found himself surrounded by red. Red. Brighter than the sun on midsummer's day, brighter than the fires of burning buildings, brighter than the flash of lightning in the middle of the night. Snarling he slashed at it, but the red yielded not, and his claw glanced off of a solid wall. The next thing he knew he was being fed broth- how tasteless! How human! The second sister to speak- or was it the first, or the third- crooned, ""Sleepytime now you big fat koala bear you, so you can wake all bright eyed and bushy skinned in the morning. If you can.""",0
"Prompt: You are a lost musician in a neon lit city. Describe your experiences and people you come across. Story: I can't say this is the first time I've awoken in an apartment I didn't recognize to see a beautiful naked girl laying next to me. Hell, it probably won't be the last. That's alright. I walked up to the fridge and helped myself to a glass of orange juice. Apparently she liked it with pulp, just like me. That made me smile. After I got my clothes back on and found my guitar, I wrote a note with my number on it. Then, I left. When I left though, for the first time, I was in a part of the city I didn't recognize. It felt like the red light district, except sadder. There was not a single smiling face, not even the children smiled. Everyone was sullen. I wasn't too find of sadness, so I decided to do what I always did when I was sad: smoke some weed, and find somewhere to get some food. After I had finished my bowl I asked a homeless person where the nearest diner was. He looked at me, with a confused look on his face. Then he said, ""You think I eat at diners too often? There's a Burger King nearby, but that's all I got for ya."" I couldn't help but laugh. This made the guy more angry. ""Oh and now you're laughing at me, you asshole."" ""Tell you what."" I said, between giggles. ""I'm just a bit high and want some food. If you can bring me to the nearest restaurant, the food is on me."" He looked at me just as a dog looks at his owner. Pure admiration. Then he said, ""Alright pretty boy, but you got ta also throw in a pack of smokes."" I obliged and we were off. Within a few minutes we arrived at a place that looked nice enough. When the hostess saw the man, she said, ""Sir, we have told you that unless you order some --"" I cut her off, ""Relax, his food is on me."" She was stunned. Actually though, she really couldn't understand. I had to say it again for her to fully comprehend what was going on. She then sat us at a table, and poured us both a cup of coffee. Across from us was an old couple. When I looked over there, I expected to see at least one of them smiling, but both were just looking into their food with remorse written all over their faces. I asked the homeless man, ""Hey, what's your name?"" He told me his name was Gregory. ""So Gregory, why is everyone so damn sad around here?"" This confused him. He really didn't get it. ""Boy you must really not be from around here. Do you know what city you're in?"" I scratched my head. ""San Pasco is the name. Though we are within the U.S.A borders, we are actually a Cuban province. We all consider ourselves Americans, but in the end, that doesn't matter."" He was interrupted by the waiter taking our order. ""Anyways,"" he resumed, ""we have monthly quotas for oil production for those bastards. For every hundred gallons we are short they kill a random citizen. Last month we lost a four year old kid."" I was petrified. I had no idea this even existed. ""How is this possible? Why isn't the American public aware of this."" He laughed. ""You know, America feeds you lots of propaganda. More than you know."" Suddenly, there was one more sad person in the city. Even though I was high, I couldn't help but just be sad. When our food arrived we ate in silence. When we finished he said, ""Tomorrow's the end of the month. We are estimated to be 200 gallons short."" I started to take some money out for the bill, but suddenly felt my phone vibrating. I answered. ""Cam, it's me, the girl."" I kept listening. ""You should probably get home. If you're caught here you'll be put to work. Bribe the border guards, then never speak of this place again. Ok?"" I took a deep breath. ""Ok,"" I said. That was the first time I had lied since I was a kid. This was just too god damn sad to not tell anyone about.",0
"Prompt: Fight or Flight Story: It was early morning at the Newell Military Base, in the Florida Keys, when Colin Bellamy woke up, ready for an adventurous day. The second his eyes shot open, he jumped off his bunk, put on his jumpsuit, grabbed some tools and food, and left his barrack before the sun was fully up. He walked for about twenty minutes to the plane he loved most: *Betsy*. It was repainted from a Japanese Zero, straight from the war. He propped a ladder to the cockpit and looked up at the sinister clouds. He planned on going into the Bermuda Triangle and coming back. Why? Not because of glory, or innovation, or for a tropical island to relax on, but to find his best friend, Ingram. He went into the triangle a month earlier, and Bellamy planned on rescuing him. Bellamy jumped into the cockpit and taxied to a more open runway, facing the sea. He went to eighty knots, and took off, letting the purple sky of dawn envelop him. He could even see stars and the moon slowly fade away. He flew east, hoping to reach the mysterious anomaly that has plagued the world's planes and ships. ________________________________________________________________ By midday, Bellamy reached what he thought was the Bermuda Triangle. His radar was accurate, but in front of *Betsy* there was an ominous wall of clouds reaching into the cosmos. Bellamy's stomach twisted into knots. His breathing became heavier. He began to excessively worry. He calmed down and looked at the picture of Ingram off to the side in the cockpit. *I'm doing this for him, * he thought. He sped up into the cloud wall. As well as clouds, there was a lot of wind and electromagnetic waves, which messed with Bellamy's controls. He lost all sense of direction as the compass stopped working completely and the radar was dead. Bellamy kept flying, pushing negative thoughts to the back of his mind. After five minutes of fear, he finally reached the other side. It was tropical, as if it was a segment of the South Pacific placed in the Atlantic. As well as crystal clear water, there were several islands, some with houses and others just deserts. Bellamy decided to land *Betsy* on an island with an American military plane on it, but *Betsy* was knocked out of the sky onto a different island. Bellamy got out of the cockpit carrying the pistol that he took from his other friend, and looked up to see a huge purple beast looking down on him. It had a long body, its front limbs were wings, its back limbs were something out of the pre-Cenozoic period, and it had blood-red horns. It hovered over the water, staring intently at Bellamy. Under the beast, in the water, smaller beasts swam to the shore. Bellamy shot at the beasts, but bullets did nothing. Bellamy was soon out of bullets, and the water beasts surrounded him. ""Please,"" Bellamy said. ""If you kill me, can you let Randall Ingram of the United States Air Force out of here?"" The beast eyed Bellamy. ""Fine,"" it said. The water beasts attacked Bellamy and pulled him underwater. ________________________________________________________________ Randall Ingram woke up in the shell of his plane. He barely had an idea of what happened. He looked out of the broken cockpit window to the sun. It was one in the afternoon. He looked behind the plane, thinking he remembered something there. There was virtually nothing; just water and a cool sea breeze pushing the shell west, where Cuban fishermen would find Ingram, and he would be returned to Newell Military Base.",0
"Prompt: You are an immortal who stopped aging at 25 and have been alive for over 1000 years. On the day you turned 25 you received a prophecy that you would kill another immortal or they would kill you. You find the other immortal, who has only lived for 50 years in the year 2017. Story: ""Sir, the genetic test confirms it. Her telomeres are similar to yours."" Mike said matter- of factly. He quietly waited for further instructions on the end of the line as I drew in a sharp breath. I was coming out of my Hist 242 class when he called you see and although I had been expecting the call, the results still took me by surprise. I muttered a quick thank you and hang up the phone. Michael was used to my lack of pleasantries, he would go on with his other duties until I had need for him. As I walked back to my dorm room amid the chatter on Yale's cross campus I thought about what my next steps should be. I thought back to all the things I'd seen in my life and smiled because I had long ago made up my mind that nothing could shock me anymore. Yet here I was my heart racing as I walked briskly back to Ezra Stiles college, unable to stop my mind from wandering. It was my junior year at Yale, to everyone here I was Liam Freeman; a quiet Electrical Engineering major from London. I had learned long ago it was always best to take the identity of an international student at Universities in America. As a black man in this country, people tend to get curious about you during orientation. At least they did back in 1938 when I first arrived in the country and went to college for the first time at Morehouse. It's harder than most people think to fit in as an adult into a new place with a false identity. Despite having finely detailed records and fake historical data, it was the little things that could bring the whole ruse up. For instance, back then I pretended to be from New Orleans, despite never having been to the country before. When one person cracked a joke about playing jazz for the Axeman and I didn't get it, he grew suspicious. I ended up having to leave before graduation after Michael's grandfather managed to get me the necessary documents to start again somewhere in Paris. It's funny how things work out isn't it? All that planning for me to go to college and because of one slip up I spent the next decade as a janitor in the 14 arrondissement I entered my room with a scowl on my face and slammed the door. ""Fuck's up with you?,"" Paul asked. I had just woken him up from his mid afternoon nap. I grumbled something about not feeling well, threw my bag on the floor and jumped into bed. I then pretended to be asleep till he got dressed and left. Paul always started his day around 4pm and never returned till midnight or later, usually either high or drunk. I would need to apologize for that later. Rudeness like the door slamming is out of character for me. But thinking about Paris had brought up some old wounds, especially given everything that would have to happen now. It was in Paris that I realized how much I despised western society. I had spent 10 years there seeing the worst of human society in WWII. The worst part is there was nothing I could do directly to help people. I was just Pierre the janitor in Paris, the mute black cleaner who was practically invisible to everyone. I remember the night in'41 when the soldiers beat the crap out of me because they were bored and I had to spend the next 10 months in crutches. If it wasn't for Jerome, Michael's grandfather, sending people to take care of me. I could have died. You see though I was immortal, and had been since 948 AD. I could still be injured and killed like a normal man by physical force. Though I was immune to most diseases, a knife or a bullet could end my life just as easily as it could end yours. I didn't know that in the beginning. Back when I found out from the shamaan in my village that I was different from other people. Though that first century is pretty hazy, I still remember running to the river and bathing naked screaming about how I was a god. The women gathering water thought I was mad and alerted my father, the chief. I think that night was the first time I dared to look him in the eye. I was so sure that the prophesy meant I was invincible. So foolish I was.... so young. I'm lying in my bed, eyes closed. It's probably about 4:30pm. I've been still for half an hour thinking about that time and what I should do about this girl. I open my eyes and make a decision. I go online and google images of her. Now that I think about it.... it's kind of funny that after all these centuries trying to find other immortals that my company would flag *her* of all people. Michael was the current C.E.O of Ghis Limited, which allowed him to minimize the number of people who were aware of the red alert when it occurred approximately 7 hours ago. Right now, only he and I as well as the actual lab assistant who tested her blood knew of the results. Of the three of us only Michael and I knew what the results actually meant. ""Thank God for the safeguards."" I whispered as I scrolled through photos of her from some red carpet event she attended last month. Ghis Limited of course had many safeguards in preparation for this day. The CEO who would always be a direct descendant of mine, would be informed of the truth when they received the position. No one else would know The instructions would always be the same. On the day whoever became CEO, they would receive a package explaining the full extent of the company holdings, and the real history of its founder, me. They would realize how large and powerful GL really was. How it secretly had shares in all 500 of the most powerful companies in the world. How it had helped shape the trajectory of 2 developing nations and how it was actually worth more than 300 billion dollars. Of course under several hundred layers of bureaucracy and red tape. They would also find out how they're distant ancestor, something their father's and grandfather's would have hinted at all their lives, was an immortal. Then they would receive a number, and we would have a conversation. It was always awkward that first conversation. Michael was only 22 when he became CEO after his parents died in a car accident, way younger than his predecessors, so it was harder on him when I told him the whole reason I created the company, his family's sole purpose for being, to find *her* To have eyes and ears all around the globe for almost 400 years, all in preparation to find the person who would either kill me or end by my hand. Talk about family drama. I sometimes wish I could feel sorry for him, and all the people who came before him, pawns really. Loyal yes, but ultimately expendable for a larger goal. It may sound cold but when you've been around as long as me, that tends to happen. I shut down my computer and send a quick text to Michael's secure phone. ""Number."" is all it says. He's gotten used to anticipating my needs after 51 years so he'll know what I mean. I already know that the woman doesn't know she's immortal. That much is clear, she wouldn't have given her blood in a charity drive if she had. She's almost 50 now so she must be starting to notice the lack of aging but given she's an actress, she may have assumed it was due to the thousands she spends on cosmetics. I'm going to have to get to her quickly. As a public figure, eliminating her is going to be complicated, so perhaps a more subtle approach. My phone pings with a text from Michael, he sent me her private line. Smart lad that Michael, 73 years old and he's still sharp as a tack. Anyway time for me to call her. I'm not sure what to say actually. What do you say to the person you've been waiting for for centuries? I chuckle to myself as I dial the phone. This should be interesting. I put it to my ear and hear it ring twice. A woman says hello. She seems surprised. No one she doesn't recognize usually has her number. If she only knew how easy it was for my people to acquire it. I smile at the thought. I take a deep breath,"" Hello? Halle Berry? You don't know me. My name is Liam and we need to talk.""",0
"Prompt: Three people are standing in a room. Only one of them has a shadow. Story: My boss rubs the back of his head, sweeping the horseshoe of hair downwards and for one of two reasons: One: He enjoys the contrasting texture of squeaky smooth to soft, like his fingers dragged against a clean sphere of glass into grassy hair that from a birds-eye view looks like the letter ‘ C' Or Two: He's about to tell me something terrible, “ Is your phone off, Mark? ” Kevin, his assistant, ten feet away to my right, stares out the window of the 120th floor of New York City's fourth tallest skyscraper and unlocks the window's clasp to let in the breeze. The office faces west and the sun is just low enough to send a panoramic slice of bloody orange between the purpling sky and metallic base. I'm holding a thick glossy black pen in my right hand, one end of which is between my pinky and ring-finger and the other end nestles in the crease of my thumb and I stare at the desk and smile noting that if I tuck my thumb into my hand this makes the shadowed number ‘ five ’, “ Mark! ” Kevin shouts into the opened glass window, “ You turned your phone off, right? ” I look at Kevin then at my boss whose lips are curled in and index fingers touch to form a triangle beneath his nose, “ Yes, sorry, what's this about? ” Kevin puts his hands on his hips underneath his navy blue sport coat, bunching the back of his coat against his wrists and says something into the six-inch opening of the window and I can't quite make it out. My boss gently nods in agreement with whatever it was so I ask him to politely clarify and Kevin turns his head to the side and yells and the wind seems to ruffle the bunched edges of his coat with each syllable, “ You fucked up, Mark! ” My pen vibrates and falls onto my boss's table, I reach to grab it and my boss puts his hand over it and looks at me with his eyebrows falling towards the edges of his eyes, “ Your meeting with ______ last week was recorded, you told them things that put us, and yourself, in very tough spot, ” “ How could you be so fucking stupid?! ” Kevin yells. He hands me the pen and I look down at his hand and across the desk to my left I see my hand's shadow and fingers and the pen that seems to be floating in mid air. “ They're going to go after your family first, you know that, right? ” he continues. I reach toward the pen, watching the shadow on the table, then pull my hand back, reach for it again and feel a warm breath on the right side of my face and right against my ear, “ ARE YOU LISTENING TO THE MAN?! YOUR FAMILY, EVERYTHING, GONE! ” I flinch my head away and see Kevin staring out of the window in the same position as before. He's not wearing shoes, and I trace my eyes behind his reddish-pink heels and see no shadow. My boss stands up and places both his fists on the table, “ Mark! This isn't something we can sweep under the rug, do you understand?! ” Kevin grabs a leather cushioned chair and aims the metal chair legs towards the glass window and tosses it, shattering it to pieces, he walks towards me and grabs my arm and pulls me to the opened window, “ He doesn't get it, this wont go away unless he goes away, ” My boss and Kevin grab both arms and I try to drop my weight to the floor but they pick me up. A woman in a suit walks through the door with a clipboard and behind her looking into the office I see my family, “ Wait, wait, wait! That's my family, wait, please, let me say goodbye at least! ” The woman grabs my mouth and wedges her fingers between my teeth, “ This is what your family wants, Mark. At least make it easier for them! ” She shoves something in into my mouth and plugs my nose and I close my eyes and shake my head and fall backwards into the air, weightless. I close my hand around another's, softer, familiar, wrinkled. My eyes open against a fluorescent light and my wife cries. I'm on a bed with white sheets, “ You're okay. I love you. ”",0
"Prompt: Two people fall in love and are soulmates. But their designated guardian angel 's hate each other. Their cupids just have a laugh about it in the corner. Story: Caleb let his body go limp, and heard the sound of wings. It was feather-soft, near inaudible, the barest brush of air against his ear drums, along his jaw, across his face. There was someone giggling in the corner, a whole bunch of someones, and Caleb could open his mouth and feel the giggles drifting across his tongue, his lips, and wondered if maybe that meant it was him doing it. His jaw hung open, drifting, tenuously attached to the rest of his body. ""I love you,"" he said, and looked to the air, and there were the wings batting at each other dizzyingly, building into a squall, his heart revving up feather-fast like a hummingbird, and then there were strong fingers pressing into his jaw and his head being tilted up and Brad's eyes looking into his. ""Focus on my voice,"" Brad said, speaking at a distance, and the wings were flying away and the feathers unclouding the sky and there were the five points of contact anchoring his jaw and Caleb was slowly coming back. ""Look at me. Focus on my voice. Look at me."" ""Yuh-yes,"" Caleb got out, his body slowly pulsing back into existence around him. Blood flowing. Muscles straining. He hurt. His wrists were hanging limply in the cuffs. The lines across his back burned, marking out the anchor points where wings would have connected. He wondered where the wings were now, if they were flying free without him. ""You were floating,"" Brad said with a grin. His hand moved up the side of Caleb's face and tenderly closed on his hair. Caleb tilted his head skyward, listening like a prophet. ""Flying,"" he corrected automatically, and then remembered himself and blushed. Brad squatted down in front of him, leather squeaking. ""I - I heard the angels,"" he confessed. ""Angels?"" Brad said, and quirked an eyebrow. ""That's a first for me. Don't worry,"" he said quickly, noticing Caleb's attempts to stay in position. ""We're taking a break. How's the pain? You hungry? Thirsty? What about those angels, then?"" Caleb let himself slump, the burning working its way across his back until the entire thing was a glowing mass of lines. ""It's good,"" he said. ""Good, good, good."" He was warm. He was alive. ""I was very religious growing up,"" he said. ""Still am, really."" ""A fine tradition for that,"" Brad said, amused. There was the rich dark undercurrent in his voice, and Caleb licked his lips. ""Jesus on the cross. Bet that got to you, huh?"" The tip of the crop tapped a nerve in his thigh and Caleb flinched. ""Naughty boy."" ""God became man,"" Caleb said. ""Flesh and blood. All animating spirit."" He touched his head to Brad's boot and his hair hung down wet around his face, brushing against the leather. ""I'd pray for the Holy Spirit to come down into me."" He lightly kissed the boot and tasted salt. ""Angels. Cupids. Christ on the cross. All these - it wasn't sound theology. Just, when I'm thinking back on it now. That's what I prayed for. Some spirit to guide me, save me, make me fall in love, swoop down like fire and carry me away."" With an effort he pulled himself back up, leaned backward, exposing his chest and throat. Caleb's eyes rolled up into his head. ""I had to believe,"" he said, dreamily, ""that God wanted me to be happy."" Brad was grounded, feet tapping against the ground, quick violent strides. Swift and wingless. The crop tapped at Caleb's shoulders, temple, throat, guiding him back into position. ""You believe that God wanted this for you?"" Brad said, and there was the sneer, the distinct twist of cruelty in it. ""Yes?"" Caleb said, and giggled. ""Or no."" He set his shoulders, forced his spine into a straight line. ""My guardian angel's got to hate you."" ""He ought to,"" Brad said softly, and then his hand was on Caleb's face, fingers digging into his jaw. ""Jesus came down from Heaven to see what he was missing. No goddamn angel could give us that."" He pressed his lips, his teeth, against Caleb's scalp, brushing up against the skull. ""You're so fucking beautiful. All flesh and blood. The most beautiful goddamn thing in the world."" And Caleb felt the feather touch dragging feverishly across his skin, all slick and weighted down with blood and spit and sweat, clinging to him as if they could no longer imagine flight, and in all the corners of the room, yes, yes, there was definitely someone laughing.",0
"Prompt: The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Story: The bustle of people, the creaks of wooden wheels recently fixed, the sight of strong oxen in the square. It was a might day for the first market, the first day in many years that farmers could roam the square and find a fair offering. They were free to spend a season's worth of work knowing that they would make more than a silver hex today. There were even more than two types of potatoes on show. The king's guard patrolled the square in pairs of four, two squads on opposite ends with a guard tower on the north and west side of the square. The town hall on the south entrance by the square was already overburdened with practictioners, eager boys of coin and financiers that wanted to apply for permits, licenses, to become entangled with the kingdom's bureaucracy. There were even two jugglers in one corner, entertaining a group of children. Throwing oranges to the children, making them laugh, the jester juggling jokers went about their business unmolested by the king's guards. In fact, farmers passed the guards with smiles, boy attempting a poor salute and elderly grandmothers trying to gift them ripe apples. From the top floor of the town hall, shielded by a tinted window, Lord Farnsworth looked down at his subjects. They were contented, happy peoples that concerned themselves with the daily running of their lives, made possible by the sacrifice of the few, the blood of the strong and the tears of the last king, now deceased under a bed of limestone, six feet under. Lord Farnsworth's rivals would spread lies that his rule was based on tainted blood, the blood of martyrs and the blood of an innocent noblewoman. Lies about false rumors, a king overthrown and a kingdom thrown away for the price of a gold hex. But as the people saw it, nothing had changed. The last king cared for nothing than his daughter, a woman that scorned all men's affections save one, the Earl of Threin. The son of a drunk and the bastard child of the king, Lord Farnsworth saw a solution. A means to an end. Money is the lifeblood of a city, and connecting cities meant connecting the money of the world. The way he saw it, if could make the kingdom's capital the center of those connections, he wouldn't have to care about his rivals. Rivals, he knew, had their price. And so did the knight. So did the princess. So did the king. Promise the knight the king's death, and the princess's hand in marriage, and the rest will fall. Reassure the king that the princess will not marry the Earl, and the king will fill your accounts with gold. Tell the princess that she has been married to the Dukedom of Rhonde, a land of brutes, and she will fall upon her own knife. And thus, the dominoes fall. All for Lord Farnsworth, and the life blood of the city.",0
"Summary: Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gets £20M fortune as he turns 18 Monday. Young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away. Radcliffe's earnings from first five Potter films have been held in trust fund. Article: Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. ""I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,"" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. ""I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. ""The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs."" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film ""Hostel: Part II,"" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. ""I'll definitely have some sort of party,"" he said in an interview. ""Hopefully none of you will be reading about it."" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. ""People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'"" he told reporters last month. ""But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them."" His latest outing as the boy wizard in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films. Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest ». There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called ""My Boy Jack,"" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in ""December Boys,"" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's ""Equus."" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: ""I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,"" he told Reuters.",0
"Summary: Mentally ill inmates in Miami are housed on the ""forgotten floor"" Judge Steven Leifman says most are there as a result of ""avoidable felonies"" While CNN tours facility, patient shouts: ""I am the son of the president"" Leifman says the system is unjust and he's fighting for change. Article: The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor."" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually ""avoidable felonies."" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor. Go inside the 'forgotten floor' ». At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. ""I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!"" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered ""lunatics"" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the ""forgotten floor"" will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.",0
"Summary: ""I thought I was going to die,"" driver says. Man says pickup truck was folded in half; he just has cut on face. Driver: ""I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall"" Minnesota bridge collapsed during rush hour Wednesday. Article: Drivers who were on the Minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. ""The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down,"" survivor Gary Babineau told CNN. ""I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down."" He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. ""I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones."" Watch a driver describe his narrow escape ». At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. ""I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling,"" Babineau said. ""It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies."" Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. ""I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall,"" he said. ""So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. ""I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos."" He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries. See rescuers clamber over rubble ». Babineau said he had no rescue training. ""I just knew what I had to do at the moment."" Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. ""You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice,"" Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. ""I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car,"" she told AP. ""It's really very surreal."" Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: ""On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. ""My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive."" See and hear eyewitness accounts ». Bernie Toivonen told CNN's ""American Morning"" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. ""I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die,"" he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, ""I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' "" he said.",0
"Summary: Five small polyps found during procedure; ""none worrisome,"" spokesman says. President reclaims powers transferred to vice president. Bush undergoes routine colonoscopy at Camp David. Article: Doctors removed five small polyps from President Bush's colon on Saturday, and ""none appeared worrisome,"" a White House spokesman said. The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used ""monitored anesthesia care,"" Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush -- who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, Stanzel said. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon. Cheney, meanwhile, spent the morning at his home on Maryland's eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs, Stanzel said. Nothing occurred that required him to take official action as president before Bush reclaimed presidential power. The procedure was supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb, Bush's physician, and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the White House said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, White House spokesman Tony Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said on Friday that Bush had polyps removed during colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver. Watch Snow talk about Bush's procedure and his own colon cancer ». ""The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance,"" Snow said. The American Cancer Society recommends that people without high risk factors or symptoms begin getting screened for signs of colorectal cancer at age 50.",0
"Summary: NFL chief, Atlanta Falcons owner critical of Michael Vick's conduct. NFL suspends Falcons quarterback indefinitely without pay. Vick admits funding dogfighting operation but says he did not gamble. Vick due in federal court Monday; future in NFL remains uncertain. Article: The National Football League has indefinitely suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick without pay, officials with the league said Friday. NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. ""Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Vick's admissions describe actions that are ""incomprehensible and unacceptable."" The suspension makes ""a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the NFL will not be tolerated,"" he said in a statement. Watch what led to Vick's suspension ». Goodell said the Falcons could ""assert any claims or remedies"" to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004, according to The Associated Press. Vick said he would plead guilty to one count of ""Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture"" in a plea agreement filed at U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia. The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, ""full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release,"" the plea deal said. Federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. ""The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense,"" the plea agreement said. In an additional summary of facts, signed by Vick and filed with the agreement, Vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. ""Most of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by Vick,"" the official summary of facts said. Gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips and sometimes Purnell Peace, it continued. ""Vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights. Vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by 'Bad Newz Kennels.' "" Vick also agreed that ""collective efforts"" by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs. Around April, Vick, Peace and Phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at Vick's property in Virginia, the statement said. ""Peace, Phillips and Vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in 'testing' sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning. ""Vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Phillips and Vick,"" the summary said. Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences. Vick, 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge. See a timeline of the case against Vick ». The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The federal case against Vick focused on the interstate conspiracy, but Vick's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior,"" Toobin said Friday. ""The risk for Vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Virginia could say, 'Hey, look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well. We're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court.' "" In the plea deal, Vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary. Vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests. Vick agreed to ""make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated"" with the dogs that are being held by the government. ""Such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals."" Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs. But the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Vick and his admitted co-conspirators. Judge Henry E. Hudson issued an order Thursday telling the U.S. Marshals Service to ""arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property."" Both the judge's order and Vick's filing refer to ""approximately"" 53 pit bull dogs. After Vick's indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the Falcons training camp, and the league is reviewing the case. Blank told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on Vick's future as a Falcon, at least not until he had seen ""a statement of facts"" in the case. CNN's Mike Phelan contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Parents beam with pride, can't stop from smiling from outpouring of support. Mom: ""I was so happy I didn't know what to do"" Burn center in U.S. has offered to provide treatment for reconstructive surgeries. Dad says, ""Anything for Youssif"" Article: Dressed in a Superman shirt, 5-year-old Youssif held his sister's hand Friday, seemingly unaware that millions of people across the world have been touched by his story. Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. ""I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,"" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. ""I didn't think the reaction would be this big."" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. ""We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,"" he said. ""We knew there was kindness out there."" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving ""no stone unturned"" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case. Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring ». Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the ""general donation"" area that is marked ""Youssif's fund."" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. ""We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,"" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. ""We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries."" She added, ""He will be getting the absolute best care that's available."" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. ""I will do anything for Youssif,"" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. ""Our child is everything."" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border. In a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world, it was a refreshing realization. CNN.com senior producer Wayne Drash contributed to this report in Atlanta.",0
"Summary: Aid workers: Violence, increased cost of living drive women to prostitution. Group is working to raise awareness of the problem with Iraq's political leaders. Two Iraqi mothers tell CNN they turned to prostitution to help feed their children. ""Everything is for the children,"" one woman says. Article: The women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used. They have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $8 a day. Suha, 37, is a mother of three. She says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home. ""People shouldn't criticize women, or talk badly about them,"" says 37-year-old Suha as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves. ""They all say we have lost our way, but they never ask why we had to take this path."" A mother of three, she wears light makeup, a gold pendant of Iraq around her neck, and an unexpected air of elegance about her. ""I don't have money to take my kid to the doctor. I have to do anything that I can to preserve my child, because I am a mother,"" she says, explaining why she prostitutes herself. Anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks. ""No matter what else I may be, no matter how off the path I may be, I am a mother!"" Watch a woman describe turning to prostitution to ""save my child"" ». Her clasped hands clench and unclench nervously. Suha's husband thinks that she is cleaning houses when she goes away. So does Karima's family. ""At the start I was cleaning homes, but I wasn't making much. No matter how hard I worked it just wasn't enough,"" she says. Karima, clad in all black, adds, ""My husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing."" She has five children, ages 8 to 17. Her eldest son could work, but she's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets, preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child. She was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office. ""They took advantage of me,"" she says softly. ""At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it."" Both Suha and Karima have clients that call them a couple times a week. Other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients. Or they flag down vehicles. Prostitution is a choice more and more Iraqi women are making just to survive. ""It's increasing,"" Suha says. ""I found this 'thing' through my friend, and I have another friend in the same predicament as mine. Because of the circumstance, she is forced to do such things."" Violence, increased cost of living, and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options, according to humanitarian workers. ""At this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive,"" says Yanar Mohammed, head and founder of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq. ""It's a taboo that no one is speaking about."" She adds, ""There is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies, their souls and they lost it all. It crushes us to see them, but we have to work on it and that's why we started our team of women activists."" Her team pounds the streets of Baghdad looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward. ""Most of the women that we find at hospitals [who] have tried to commit suicide"" have been involved in prostitution, said Basma Rahim, a member of Mohammed's team. The team's aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to Iraq's political parties -- to have them, as Mohammed puts it, ""come tell us what [they] are ... going to do about this."" Rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they found who lives in a room with three of her children: ""She has sex while her three children are in the room, but she makes them stand in separate corners."" According to Rahim and Mohammed, most of the women they encounter say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and unforgiving circumstances in Iraq. ""They took this path but they are not pleased,"" Rahim says. Karima says when she sees her children with food on the table, she is able to convince herself that it's worth it. ""Everything is for the children. They are the beauty in life and, without them, we cannot live."" But she says, ""I would never allow my daughter to do this. I would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this."" Karima's last happy memory is of her late husband, when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today's Iraq together. Suha says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor, with her mom boasting about her potential in that career. Life couldn't have taken her further from that dream. ""It's not like we were born into this, nor was it ever in my blood,"" she says. What she does for her family to survive now eats away at her. ""I lay on my pillow and my brain is spinning, and it all comes back to me as if I am watching a movie.""",0

U.S. Justice Department indicted him in 2002. Colombian military: He was killed in an attack on a guerrilla encampment. Article: A key rebel commander and fugitive from a U.S. drug trafficking indictment was killed over the weekend in an air attack on a guerrilla encampment, the Colombian military said Monday. Alleged cocaine trafficker and FARC rebel Tomas Medina Caracas in an Interpol photo. Tomas Medina Caracas, known popularly as ""El Negro Acacio,"" was a member of the high command of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia and, according to Colombian and U.S. officials, helped manage the group's extensive cocaine trafficking network. He had been in the cross-hairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States and manufacturing and distributing cocaine within Colombia to fund the FARC's 42-year insurgency against the government. U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel group's sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers, who in turn smuggled it into the United States. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid. Officials said the army's Rapid Response Force, backed by elements of the Colombian Air Force, tracked Medina Caracas down at a FARC camp in the jungle in the south of the country. ""After a bombardment, the troops occupied the camp, and they've found 14 dead rebels so far, along with rifles, pistols, communications equipment and ... four GPS systems,"" Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said at a news conference. ""The death of 'El Negro Acacio' was confirmed by various sources, including members of FARC itself."" Medina Caracas commanded FARC's 16th Front in the southern departments of Vichada and Guainia. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, FARC is Colombia's oldest, largest, most capable and best-equipped Marxist rebel group, according to the U.S. Department of State.

"Summary: President Bush says Tony Snow ""will battle cancer and win"" Job of press secretary ""has been a dream for me,"" Snow says Snow leaving on September 14, will be succeeded by Dana Perino. Article: White House press secretary Tony Snow, who is undergoing treatment for cancer, will step down from his post September 14 and be replaced by deputy press secretary Dana Perino, the White House announced Friday. White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will ""sadly accept"" Snow's resignation. Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. ""It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,"" Bush told reporters. Watch the announcement about Snow leaving ». Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. ""He'll battle cancer and win,"" Bush said, ""and he'll be a solid contributor to society."" Turning to Snow, the president then said: ""I love you, and I wish you all the best."" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, ""and that loan is now gone."" ""This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,"" Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do ""some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties."" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September. Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for ""Fox News Sunday"" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted ""The Tony Snow Show"" on Fox News Radio. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. ""The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,"" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. ""And there are no new growths. The health is good."" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. ""I'm also putting on weight again,"" he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. ""I actually feel very good about"" the health situation. Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment.",0
"Summary: Empty anti-tank weapon turns up in front of New Jersey home. Device handed over to Army ordnance disposal unit. Weapon not capable of being reloaded, experts say. Article: Police and FBI agents are investigating the discovery of an empty rocket launcher tube on the front lawn of a Jersey City, New Jersey, home, FBI spokesman Sean Quinn said. Niranjan Desai discovered the 20-year-old AT4 anti-tank rocket launcher tube, a one-time-use device, lying on her lawn Friday morning, police said. The launcher has been turned over to U.S. Army officials at the 754th Ordnance Company, an explosive ordnance disposal unit, at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Army officials said. The launcher ""is no longer operable and not considered to be a hazard to public safety,"" police said, adding there was no indication the launcher had been fired recently. Army officials said they could not determine if the launcher had been fired, but indicated they should know once they find out where it came from. The nearest military base, Fort Dix, is more than 70 miles from Jersey City. The Joint Terrorism Task Force division of the FBI and Jersey City police are investigating the origin of the rocket launcher and the circumstance that led to its appearance on residential property. ""Al Qaeda doesn't leave a rocket launcher on the lawn of middle-aged ladies,"" said Paul Cruickshank of New York University Law School's Center on Law and Security. A neighbor, Joe Quinn, said the object lying on Desai's lawn looked military, was brown, had a handle and strap, and ""both ends were open, like you could shoot something with it."" Quinn also said the device had a picture of a soldier on it and was 3 to 4 feet long. An Army official said the device is basically a shoulder-fired, direct-fire weapon used against ground targets -- a modern-day bazooka -- and it is not wire-guided. According to the Web site Globalsecurity.org, a loaded M136 AT4 anti-tank weapon has a 40-inch-long fiberglass-wrapped tube and weighs just 4 pounds. Its 84 millimeter shaped-charge missile can penetrate 14 inches of armor from a maximum of 985 feet. It is used once and discarded.

"Summary: President Bush to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Wednesday. Bush to say that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists. Speech will be latest White House attempt to try to reframe the debate over Iraq. Article: As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq, President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out. President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that ""then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end,"" according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. ""Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,"" Bush will say. ""Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' "" the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. ""Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,"" Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, ""President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. ""While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall."" The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to ""provide broader context"" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop ""surge"" in Iraq until the report comes out in September. Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government ». It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin. Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion. The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. ""In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,"" Bush will say. ""Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies."" Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time ""critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home."" ""While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word,"" Bush will say. ""Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.""",0

"Summary: President Bush will have a routine colonoscopy Saturday. While he's anesthetized, his powers will be transferred to the vice president. Bush had last colonoscopy in 2002, which found no problems. Article: Vice President Dick Cheney will serve as acting president briefly Saturday while President Bush is anesthetized for a routine colonoscopy, White House spokesman Tony Snow said Friday. Bush is scheduled to have the medical procedure, expected to take about 2 1/2 hours, at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, Snow said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. The procedure will be supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, Snow said. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said that was the case when Bush had colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver. Snow told reporters he had a chemo session scheduled later Friday.

See a timeline of rescue efforts ». Tests showed underground oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life. ""We basically told the families that at this point in time we've run out of options,"" Stickler said at a news conference late Friday. ""We've consulted with the people that we have here, we've consulted with the technical support in Pittsburgh and we've consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go,"" he said. ""And basically, through all the information we've gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we found, in terms of the air readings we found down there and ... everything else, we just don't know where else we can put a hole to get any other information."" See photos of the rescue mission ». There were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view. Federal officials became the spokesmen. No one from Murray Mining was present at Friday's news conference. ""They are done. It's finished,"" the attorney for the families said, according to the Saturday edition of The Salt Lake Tribune. ""It's a hard and bitter pill for our families, and there were quite a few tears shed,"" the newspaper quotes Colin King as saying. The men were trapped during a collapse on August 6, and it is not known whether they survived the cave-in. Efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed, and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working. Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole. Under pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time. Families wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule. The effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called ""a long shot"" by an official. MSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it. Work resumed Friday, this time at the fourth hole, but the camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said. ""Basically, what it saw was really not that much. There was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole. It really couldn't go any farther than seven feet,"" he said of the latest try. In addition, the roof was sagging. ""The families asked many, many questions and we answered them all the best we could, basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options."" Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine. ""I will never come back to that evil mountain,"" he said. Friends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson.",0

A wounded person gets first aid shortly after Thursday's attack in Batna, Algeria. The explosion occurred at 5 p.m. about 20 meters (65 feet) from a mosque in Batna, a town about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Algiers, security officials in Batna told the state-run news agency. The bomb went off 15 minutes before the expected arrival of President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika. It wasn't clear if the bomb was caused by a suicide bomber or if it was planted, the officials said. Later Thursday, Algeria's Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni said ""a suspect person who was among the crowd attempted to go beyond the security cordon,"" but the person escaped ""immediately after the bomb exploded,"" the press service reported.

Now, David Beckham is headed for the Hollywood Hills as he takes his game to U.S. Major League Soccer. CNN looks at how Bekham fulfilled his dream of playing for Manchester United, and his time playing for England. The world's famous footballer has begun a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy team, and on Friday Beckham will meet the press and reveal his new shirt number. This week, we take an in depth look at the life and times of Beckham, as CNN's very own ""Becks,"" Becky Anderson, sets out to examine what makes the man tick -- as footballer, fashion icon and global phenomenon. It's a long way from the streets of east London to the Hollywood Hills and Becky charts Beckham's incredible rise to football stardom, a journey that has seen his skills grace the greatest stages in world soccer. She goes in pursuit of the current hottest property on the sports/celebrity circuit in the U.S. and along the way explores exactly what's behind the man with the golden boot. CNN will look back at the life of Beckham, the wonderfully talented youngster who fulfilled his dream of playing for Manchester United, his marriage to pop star Victoria, and the trials and tribulations of playing for England. We'll look at the highs (scoring against Greece), the lows (being sent off during the World Cup), the Man. U departure for the Galacticos of Madrid -- and now the Home Depot stadium in L.A. We'll ask how Beckham and his family will adapt to life in Los Angeles -- the people, the places to see and be seen and the celebrity endorsement. Beckham is no stranger to exposure. He has teamed with Reggie Bush in an Adidas commercial, is the face of Motorola, is the face on a PlayStation game and doesn't need fashion tips as he has his own international clothing line. But what does the star couple need to do to become an accepted part of Tinseltown's glitterati? The road to major league football in the U.S.A. is a well-worn route for some of the world's greatest players. We talk to some of the former greats who came before him and examine what impact these overseas stars had on U.S. soccer and look at what is different now. We also get a rare glimpse inside the David Beckham academy in L.A, find out what drives the kids and who are their heroes. The perception that in the U.S.A. soccer is a ""game for girls"" after the teenage years is changing. More and more young kids are choosing the European game over the traditional U.S. sports.",0
"Summary: Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees. Scientists suspect a virus may combine with other factors to collapse colonies. Disorder first cropped up in 2004, as bees were imported from Australia. $15 billion in U.S. crops each year dependent on bees for pollination. Article: A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday. Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination. Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers. Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with IAPV die close to the hive, after developing shivering wings and paralysis. For some reason, the Australian bees seem to be resistant to IAPV and do not come down with symptoms. Scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that IAPV was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time. But the study released Thursday on the Science Express Web site, operated by the journal Science, cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors. ""This research give us a very good lead to follow, but we do not believe IAPV is acting alone,"" said Jeffery S. Pettis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bee Research Laboratory and a co-author of the study. ""Other stressors on the colony are likely involved."" This could explain why bees in Australia may be resistant to colony collapse. ""There are no cases ... in Australia at all,"" entomologist Dave Britton of the Australian Museum told the Sydney Morning Herald last month. ""It is a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon."" Bee ecology expert and University of Florida professor Jamie Ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time, pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors. Researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the U.S. mainland but are not found in Australia. University of Georgia bee researcher Keith S. Delaplane said Thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope. ""One nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind,"" said Delaplane, who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite. ""But in the case of IAPV, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder. This is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease- and pest-resistant."" Bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees. ""The next step is to ascertain whether IAPV, alone or in concert with other factors, can induce CCD [colony collapse disorder] in healthy bees,"" said Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Besides the Columbia and USDA researchers, others involved in the study released Thursday include researchers from Pennsylvania State University, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, the University of Arizona and 454 Life Sciences.",0
"Summary: Savers at leading UK mortgage bank lined up to empty their accounts. Northern Rock was bailed out by the Bank of England a day earlier. Reassurances that banks was safe have gone unheeded by many. Article: Savers at a leading UK mortgage bank lined up for a second day to empty their accounts Saturday, a day after the lender was bailed out by the Bank of England after heavily slashing profit forecasts. Fearful customers line up to withdraw cash from a Northern Rock branch in southeast London on Friday. Long lines formed before counters opened at the Northern Rock building society, one of the UK's top five lenders, as worried customers ignored reassurances from the bank and the government. Customers are believed to have already withdrawn about £1 billion ($2 billion) since the bank's woes were revealed, prompting speculation that the global credit crunch made raising funds through commercial borrowing difficult. Shares in Northern Rock dropped up to 30 percent in Friday trading, with problems spilling over the European banking sector. The British Bankers' Association has urged customers to ""calm down,"" according to the UK Press Association. It said: ""Northern Rock is a sound and safe bank and there is absolutely no reason for either mortgage customers or savers to worry."" Meanwhile, finance minister Alistair Darling said the Bank of England had stepped in ""to create a stable banking system"". He said: ""People can use their accounts in the usual way, they can carry on making their mortgage payments in the usual way. Northern Rock will be able to carry on its business."" Northern Rock chief executive Adam Applegarth said yesterday that the bank had yet to draw on the emergency cash, which he called ""a backdrop in case we need to use it"", according to PA.",0
"Summary: No bail for ex-NFL star accused of directing men in alleged armed robbery. Simpson faces charges of robbery, assault, burglary and conspiracy. Alleged robbery involved sports-related items, police say. Simpson arrested Sunday in Las Vegas, but he says items were his. Article: Former football star O.J. Simpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges, police announced late Sunday. Police released this mug shot of O.J. Simpson after his arrest. Simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a Las Vegas hotel room. Las Vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe Simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident at the Palace Station Hotel and Casino. Police said Simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the memorabilia, including some that was unrelated to Simpson, police said. ""We don't believe that anyone was roughed up, but there were firearms involved,"" Lt. Clint Nichols told reporters. Nichols said the firearms were pointed at the victims. A reporter asked Nichols: Was ""O.J. was the boss in that room?"" Nichols responded, ""That is what we believe, yes."" Watch Simpson transferred Sunday in handcuffs ». The alleged victims were identified as Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as ""a home invasion-type robbery,"" and Alfred Beardsley, who has been quoted by celebrity Web site TMZ.com as saying that Simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident. Acting on a tip, police met over the weekend at McCarran International Airport with 46-year-old Walter Alexander, of Mesa, Arizona, who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster's information, Capt. James Dillon told reporters. Alexander was arrested Saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon. He was released on his own recognizance and returned to Mesa either Saturday night or early Sunday morning, Dillon said. In addition, investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied Simpson into the hotel room, Nichols said. Nichols said, ""There is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and O.J. Simpson."" Though Simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself, two firearms that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three searches. Investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found. Nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police. ""There is no truth to that whatsoever,"" he said. ""That came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police."" Simpson, 60, has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him, but he has denied that any weapons were involved. ""Whether the property belonged to Mr. Simpson or not is still in debate,"" Nichols said. ""We are still in the process of sorting that out."" Nichols also said that some of the property taken had Simpson's signature. But ""there was some other property taken as well,"" he said. ""I believe there were some Joe Montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff."" The latest charges against Simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution, more than a decade after the June 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman. Simpson was acquitted of murder the following year. The trial riveted much of the United States. But in 1997, a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the Goldman family. Simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $33.5 million for the deaths. Goldman had gone to Nicole Simpson's Los Angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings. Goldman's sister, Kim Goldman, said she wasn't surprised by the robbery allegations, since Simpson ""thinks he can do no wrong."" ""He's capable of stabbing people to death, so I think robbery is nothing surprising,"" she said. ""Normal, logical, civil-minded, law-abiding people don't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back."" Fromong had testified on Simpson's behalf in the civil case, telling the court that prices for Simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict. His testimony was part of the defense's contention that Simpson could not afford to pay the Goldmans. Simpson recently wrote a book originally titled ""If I Did It"" and had planned to publish it himself, but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal. A bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the Goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award. The Goldmans retitled the book, ""If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer."" That book just hit bookstores. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Indictment: Man tried to pass nuclear filters to foreign agent. Roy Lynn Oakley appears in court in Tennessee after surrendering. Facility's role is to break down decommissioned equipment. Lawyer: Oakley's job was to break machine parts into pieces, pitch them. Article: A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday. Sources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park. Roy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday. Oakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said. Oakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy's prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said. The indictment states that Oakley, ""having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of 'barriers' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person."" The transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and ""restricted data"" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them. Oakley's attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley's job was to break rods ""into little pieces"" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance. The government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the ""pieces of scrap"" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an ""appliance"" under the law. ""Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months,"" said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case. Each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. ""While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands,"" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement. One government source said the materials involved are not the ""crown jewels,"" but they should not have been taken from the facility. A ""barrier"" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job. Sources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material. Oakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said. A government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley's alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation. The FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country. East Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE's Oak Ridge reservation ""where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985,"" Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE's Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. ""When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium."" Boyd said the technology park and the reservation ""are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position."" In this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and ""successfully identified the individual in question,"" he said.

"Summary: Organ shortage in rich states has created a trade from poorer countries. ""Transplant tourists"" travel to poor countries to buy organs from the desperate. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is legal, is turning into a ""kidney bazaar"" Patients pay $8,500 for a new kidney, while donors are paid just $300 to $1,000. Article: Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner; Karam in Egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $5,300; in Istanbul Hakan is holding out for $30,700 for one of his kidneys. Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys. They are not so unusual: a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines to buy a new lease of life. Lee, a 53-year-old chief subway technician in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread. A friend told him about a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city and he signed up for a place. That April, he paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life. ""The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons,"" Lee told Reuters. ""Mine came from an executed prisoner from Heilongjiang. I thank the donor deeply."" The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually, but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000. Demand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and ""transplant tourists"" who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living. A donor in South Africa receives $700 for a kidney compared with $30,000 in the United States. A lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade. But even where the trade is banned, laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes, which are sometimes defended by vested interests. And the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient. Any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor's liver. The complications can include bleeding, infection, even death. In the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about, for example, exposing a living relative to that risk. ""It is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you don't have to care for someone you don't know. Once you pay, it is discarded in a way, it is dispensable,"" said Luc Noel, a Geneva-based coordinator for Clinical Procedures at the World Health Organization. China recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners, saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year. Only 20,000 transplants are carried out in China each year. Of these, 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors. China defended its use of organs from executed prisoners, saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families. A transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $33,000 in China. ""What is important is the transparency, it has to be open to scrutiny ... if China makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent, that would do good,"" said the WHO's Noel. In Asia, a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs. Excluding China, Asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year, said Lo Chung-man, professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the University of Hong Kong. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is not illegal, is turning into a ""kidney bazaar"", said the chief executive of Pakistan's Kidney Foundation, Jaffar Naqvi. There are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but Naqvi said there were 13 centers in Lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys. Patients, mostly from Europe, Saudi Arabia and India, pay about 500,000 rupees ($8,500) for a new kidney, he said. Donors are paid $300 to $1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery. There is no consent in some cases. In May police arrested nine people, four of them doctors, for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations. In the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade, but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative, with no payment. Such a clause allowing ""altruistic"" organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors, Naqvi said. Stories of people selling their organs, especially kidneys, are not uncommon in Egypt, where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line. Karam, who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal, said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure. He said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($5,300). ""The fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds. Both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the 'donor' received,"" said Karam. He said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients' lists. Abdel-Kader Hegazy, head of the disciplinary committee at the Doctors' Union, said Egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants, making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence. ""The law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment. We at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices, but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back,"" he told Reuters. ""It is an annoying and a regrettable situation. Well-known doctors and professors are doing this. They are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values."" The union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants, with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities. But the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior Muslim religious leaders on whether Islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths. In Turkey, students, unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the Internet selling their kidneys, listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type. These would-be donors say they have had enquiries from Germany, Israel and Turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira ($38,760). Hakan, a 27-year-old security guard in Istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published, told Reuters he received five or six offers from Turkey and Germany, offering 10,000-15,000 lira ($11,600), but he's holding out for 40,000 lira. ""Of course it's frightening but there's nothing else to be done,"" he said, adding he hadn't told his wife as he knew she would object. ""I'm doing it because of my family, if I was alone it wouldn't matter. I've got two children ... there's nothing else I can do for them.""",0
"Summary: Because of troubles, Lindsay Lohan likely difficult to insure. Lohan supposed to appear in Shirley MacLaine film ""Poor Things"" Insurance rates may cost 1 to 3 percent of film's production budget. Article: ""To insure or not to insure?"" It isn't Shakespeare, but it is the dramatic question Hollywood filmmakers are asking about Lindsay Lohan following her legal troubles this week. Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high. It is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list. But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts. While some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. ""For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested,"" said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff & Associates Inc. Lohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like ""The Parent Trap,"" is too risky to cast in a film. Timeline: Lindsay Lohan's troubles ». It remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in ""Poor Things,"" a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine. See a gallery of Lohan's films ». A statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her. Insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of Lohan and fellow troubled party girls Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. ""I don't think it (a problematic artist) is any more of an issue,"" said Wendy Diaz, entertainment underwriting director at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the leading film underwriter. ""It's pretty standard year to year."" But Diaz did say the terms for covering Lohan would likely be ""serious at this point."" She said Fireman's Fund, in such a case, would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted. Last July, a producer on Lohan's last film, ""Georgia Rule,"" scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set, costing the movie's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Brian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker Aon/Albert G. Ruben said covering situations like Lohan's required a lot of calculation and risk management. Insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie's production budget, which can range from $5 million to $100 million or more, he said. ""Filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk,"" Kingman said. He said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance. In certain circumstances, drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples. In cases of known drug abuse, ""minders"" are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor. Kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration. ""I have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules,"" he said, citing the case of Robert Downey Jr., another high-profile star with a history of legal, drug and alcohol problems.",0
"Summary: Francesco Totti threatens to quit the Italian Players' Association. The Italy and Roma striker is upset over the early start to the new season. He says: We are the principal actors, but ... are never listened to."" Article: Italy and Roma striker Francesco Totti has threatened to quit the Italian Players Association, in a row over the starting date of the next Serie A season. Roma striker Totti has complained that the Italian players are never listened to. The row began last month, when the Italian Football League, which is run by the presidents of clubs in the country's top two divisions, voted to start the season on August 26. In doing so, they ignored a request by Italy coach Roberto Donadoni to play the first round of matches midway through the month, to give his players time to gain match-fitness ahead of Euro 2008 qualifiers against France and Ukraine in early September. ""I'm ready to leave the Italian Players Association. We are the principal actors, but also the people who are never listened to,"" Totti was quoted as saying in Italian football magazine Dieci. ""This is the moment in which we must make our voice heard. We wanted to start on August 19, to have an extra week's rest at Christmas and allow the national team to come into the big matches in September better prepared. ""Those who decided (on August 26) didn't care at all about Donadoni's needs."" Serie A is one of the last major European leagues to start next season. The opening round of English Premier League matches is scheduled to start on August 11, while the French Ligue 1 will kick off on August 4.",0
"Summary: Two employees bought, sold weapons on their own, company says. Company fired workers, turned them in to ATF, says source. Feds investigating claims Blackwater employees made illegal arms deals. Blackwater in spotlight after shootings last weekend that killed 20 Iraqis. Article: Allegations that Blackwater USA -- whose operations were suspended after 20 Iraqi civilians were shot to death last weekend -- was ""in any way associated or complicit in unlawful arms activities are baseless,"" the company asserted Saturday. Blackwater employees patrol Baghdad by air in a February 2005 photograph. Federal prosecutors are investigating allegations that employees of Blackwater illegally purchased weapons and sold them in Iraq, according to U.S. government sources. A U.S. government official has said the U.S. attorney's office in Raleigh, North Carolina, is in the early stages of an investigation that focuses on individual company employees, and not the firm. Blackwater, which is based in Moyock, North Carolina, is a security firm hired by the State Department to guard U.S. staff in Iraq. ""The company has no knowledge of any employee improperly exporting weapons,"" the Blackwater statement said. ""When it was uncovered internally that two employees were stealing from the company, Blackwater immediately fired them and invited the ATF to conduct a thorough investigation."" Watch a report on Blackwater's response to the allegations ». The first public hint that an investigation was under way came earlier this week in a statement from State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard after he was accused of blocking fraud investigations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Krongard said the State Department has been cooperating with the prosecutors in the Blackwater probe. ""In particular, I made one of my best investigators available to help assistant U.S. attorneys in North Carolina in their investigation into alleged smuggling of weapons into Iraq by a contractor,"" Krongard's statement said. Blackwater resumed normal security operations in Iraq on Friday, the State Department said, after a brief hiatus following the lethal incident last Sunday. The Iraqi government was outraged by the shootings and disputes the U.S. and Blackwater's claim that the guards were responding to an attack.

"Summary: Boy on meeting Spider-Man: ""It was my favorite thing"" Youssif also met SpongeBob, Lassie and an orangutan at Universal Studios. Dad: ""Other than my wedding day, this is the happiest day of my life"" Article: Youssif, the 5-year-old burned Iraqi boy, rounded the corner at Universal Studios when suddenly the little boy hero met his favorite superhero. Youssif has always been a huge Spider-Man fan. Meeting him was ""my favorite thing,"" he said. Spider-Man was right smack dab in front of him, riding a four-wheeler amid a convoy of other superheroes. The legendary climber of buildings and fighter of evil dismounted, walked over to Youssif and introduced himself. Spidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug, embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights. He showed Youssif a few tricks, like how to shoot a web from his wrist. Only this time, no web was spun. ""All right Youssif!"" Spider-Man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement. Other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look. Even the Green Goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi. Youssif remained unfazed. He didn't take a liking to Spider-Man's nemesis. Spidey was just too cool. ""It was my favorite thing,"" the boy said later. ""I want to see him again."" He then felt compelled to add: ""I know it's not the real Spider-Man."" This was the day of dreams when the boy's nightmares were, at least temporarily, forgotten. He met SpongeBob, Lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named Archie. The hairy, brownish-red primate took to the boy, grabbing his hand and holding it. Even when Youssif pulled away, Archie would inch his hand back toward the boy's and then snatch it. See Youssif enjoy being a boy again ». The boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns. It was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central Baghdad, as recently as a week ago. He squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could. He rode a tram through the back stages at Universal Studios. At one point, the car shook. Fire and smoke filled the air, debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle. The boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed. ""Even I was scared,"" the dad said. ""Well, I wasn't,"" Youssif replied. The father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day. Youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister, Ayaa, in a stroller. ""Did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here?"" Youssif's father said in amazement. ""Other than my wedding day, this is the happiest day of my life,"" he said. Just a day earlier, the mother and father talked about their journey out of Iraq and to the United States. They also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home, doused him in gas and set him on fire. His mother heard her boy screaming from inside. The father sought help for his boy across Baghdad, but no one listened. He remembers his son's two months of hospitalization. The doctors didn't use anesthetics. He could hear his boy's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital. Watch Youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister ». The father knew that speaking to CNN would put his family's lives in jeopardy. The possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer, he said. ""Anything for Youssif,"" he said. ""We had to do it."" They described a life of utter chaos in Baghdad. Neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl. Shortly afterward, the father was kidnapped and killed. Then, there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans. They were snatched off the street by gunmen. The stories can be even more gruesome. The couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded --and her killers sewed a dog's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family's doorstep. ""These are just some of the stories,"" said Youssif's mother, Zainab. Under Saddam Hussein, there was more security and stability, they said. There was running water and electricity most of the time. But still life was tough under the dictator, like the time when Zainab's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a ""religious book,"" she said. Sitting in the parking lot of a Target in suburban Los Angeles, Youssif's father watched as husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, parents and their children, came and went. Some held hands. Others smiled and laughed. ""Iraq finished,"" he said in what few English words he knows. He elaborated in Arabic: His homeland won't be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon. It's just not possible. Too much violence. Too many killings. His two children have only seen war. But this week, the family has seen a much different side of America -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home. ""It's been a dream,"" the father said. He used to do a lot of volunteer work back in Baghdad. ""Maybe that's why I'm being helped now,"" the father said. At Universal Studios, he looked out across the valley below. The sun glistened off treetops and buildings. It was a picturesque sight fit for a Hollywood movie. ""Good America, good America,"" he said in English. CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Cpl. Trent D. Thomas found guilty this week of conspiracy to commit murder. Marine gets rank of private, will be discharged for role in death of Iraqi civilian. Group's leader awaits trial on murder and conspiracy charges. Article: A Marine convicted for his role in the death of an Iraqi civilian was sentenced Friday to a reduction in rank and will be discharged. Cpl. Trent D. Thomas was found guilty Wednesday of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit several offenses -- including murder, larceny, housebreaking, kidnapping, and making false official statements -- for his involvement in the April 2006 death in Hamdaniya, Iraq. Thomas will be demoted to the rank of entry-level private and will receive a bad-conduct discharge. The 25-year-old was among seven Marines and a Navy medic who were charged in connection with the death of Hashim Ibrahim Awad, 52. The Marines accused in the case were members of Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. They reported at the time that Awad planned to detonate a roadside bomb targeting their patrol. But several residents of Hamdaniya, including relatives of the victim, gave a different account, prompting a criminal investigation. Prosecutors accuse the group's squad leader, Sgt. Lawrence G. Hutchins III, of dragging Awad from his home, shooting him in the street and then making it look like he had planned to ambush American troops. Hutchins has pleaded not guilty to murder, conspiracy and other charges in the case. He faces a sentence of life in prison if convicted. Thomas changed his plea from guilty to not guilty in February, arguing that he had merely followed orders. He told his attorneys that after reviewing the evidence against him, he realized ""that what happened overseas happened as a result of obedience to orders, and he hasn't done anything wrong,"" defense attorney Victor Kelley said. Thomas said in January, shortly after entering his guilty plea, that he was ""truly sorry"" for his role in the killing. He could have been sentenced to life in prison under his original plea.",0

When she was alive, we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life, laughter, fun and folly. She was our guardian, friend and protector. She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated. She will always be remembered for her amazing public work. But behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. We would say that, wouldn't we. But we miss her. She kissed us last thing at night. Her beaming smile greeted us from school. She laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day. She encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure. She -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood. To lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age, as others have experienced, is indescribably shocking and sad. It was an event which changed our lives forever, as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night. But what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was: fun-loving, generous, down-to-earth, entirely genuine. We both think of her every day. We speak about her and laugh together at all the memories. Put simply, she made us, and so many other people, happy. May this be the way that she is remembered. Prince William's reading from St Paul's letter to the Ephesians:. I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the riches of His glory, He may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through His Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to Him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever. Amen. Thanks be to God. The Bishop of London's speech:. ""Who's cheating?"" The scene is an old people's home. Two residents are playing Beggar My Neighbor. Enter the Princess. The question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs. Afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room. One tiny incident, characteristic of countless other occasions in the Princess's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort. Everyone here will have their own memories. I remember meeting Princess Diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in St Paul's. Even Archbishop's Chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and I was nervous entering the presence. It must have been a bewildering time for the Princess as well, but even then, at the age of 20, her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated. Prince Harry has spoken movingly and justly, as few others have the right to do, about the Princess as a mother. I want to dwell for a moment on her public work, its cost and its meaning. After her marriage, the Princess joined her natural gifts of beauty, empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the Royal Family generates. Led by our Queen and other members of the Royal Family, our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century. There is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but doesn't intrude, but there is another sphere, vital to any sense of national unity and creativity, a sphere in which communities must be celebrated, common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored. We tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is God's will, but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in Christ, the human face of God, then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society. And at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric, the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech, and the Princess brought her own gifts to this work. She was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the Middlesex Hospital's Aids ward. It was the first in the UK and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded Aids in the '80s. Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin. And she had a similar impact in the USA. An editorial in the New York Times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign, and even a royal, dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the US. Her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the Ottawa Convention, banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children. She proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which, of course, have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries. And as she said, in her words, ""the biggest disease today is not leprosy or TB but the feeling of being unwanted"". She sought out places of suffering, because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed, and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way. Bill Deedes accompanied her on some of her visits. His response to the cynics was typically robust. He said: ""She was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well. She was good at this because she herself was vulnerable. She knew the feeling. She didn't set out to be a saint."" The role brought great power but, like any member of the Royal Family, she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny. Honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task. As we have heard from Prince Harry, his mother Diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead. She confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched. She said of John, a young Greek suffering from cystic fibrosis: ""He showed no sign of anger, no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that I have never before encountered."" The love of Christ described in the lesson read by Prince William contains the essence of the spiritual life. Princess Diana recognized this quality of life in many of those, like John, whose lives she touched. It was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out. And the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself, the more you will become your true self; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others, the more you will find yourself; the more you keep company with those who suffer, the more you will be healed. This is the knowledge which passes all understanding. This is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints. It's easy to lose the real person in the image, to insist that all is darkness or all is light. Still, 10 years after her tragic death, there are regular reports of ""fury"" at this or that incident, and the Princess's memory is used for scoring points. Let it end here. Let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion. Let us also, echoing the words of Prince Harry, look to the future and pray, in the words of St Paul, for all those who serve our country as members of the Royal Family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her:. ""I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of Christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God."" Amen.",0
"Summary: French FM Kouchner has told France to prepare for possibility of war with Iran. Was a surprise appointment to Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government. Also the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988. Founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers, also French student leader in May 1968. Article: French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner's declaration that France had to prepare for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior. But then Kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene. French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority. A surprise appointment from the Socialist ranks to Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government, the founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers has always challenged convention and authority. The former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali once called Kouchner 'an unguided missile' and the man himself has been known to declare: ""To change the law you sometimes have to break the law"". He was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in France in May 1968. Kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights. Unusually for a man of the Left, he supported the US-led intervention in Iraq (while criticizing the aftermath). But he did so on the grounds of Saddam Hussein's denial of human rights, not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction. His and President Sarkozy's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join Gordon Brown's Britain in a new push for action in Darfur. Bernard Kouchner did not come to his position with any of former President Chirac's instinctive distrust of the United States. Washington, which has been critical of some European states for their weakness in confronting Teheran, will have been delighted by his 'get serious' warning to Teheran. But the plain-speaking Kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the White House when he has criticisms to make of US policy. How much should be made of his words on Iran remains unclear at this stage. They were scarcely on the same scale as President Chirac's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on France. But they are all of a piece with France's new high-profile style under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Kouchner, for example, became the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988, insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country's problems, not a military one, and offering France's services as a mediator and 'honest broker' between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. On Iran he is, in a way, merely echoing the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed Iran would be 'unacceptable' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as 'undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today'. Certainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable. In continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the West's resolution on Iran's nuclear enrichment program Mr Kouchner is supplementing his president's warnings. Neither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable. Neither has yet confirmed that France would be part of any such military action. But both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of Teheran's brinkmanship. Perhaps the strongest lesson though from Mr Kouchner's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in France is not a knee-jerk anti-American one -- and that France is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables.",0
"Summary: Several famous songs written by men for a woman. Beethoven's ""Für Elise"" may have been written ""for Therese"" Songwriters make up stories about who is behind ""867-5309/Jenny"" Article: 1. ""Für Elise"" Bob Dylan wrote ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" for Joan Baez. Written by: Ludwig van Beethoven. Written for: Some girl probably not named Elise. In fact, as far as most historians can tell, Beethoven didn't even know an Elise. Instead, the song was originally titled ""Bagatelle in A minor"" based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music. Further complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written ""for Therese,"" as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro. 2. ""Philadelphia Freedom"" Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin. Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton. And what a tracksuit it must have been! The 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever, leaving thousands of Hustle enthusiasts wondering just what Billie Jean King had to do with Philadelphia, anyway. Turns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms. Prior to 1968, tennis players were all considered ""amateurs"" and weren't eligible to receive prize money. So, if you didn't have the wealth to support yourself, you couldn't play. Billie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport. 3. ""Lola"" Written by: The Kinks' Ray Davies. Written for: A transvestite. But the question is, which one? According to Rolling Stone, ""Lola"" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, whom Ray Davies briefly (and cluelessly) dated. If that's the case, then ""Lola"" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side."" (""Candy came from out on the Island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'."") But, in the Kinks' official biography, Davies tells a different story. He says ""Lola"" was written after the band's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him. 4. ""867-5309/Jenny"" Written by: Jim Keller (of Tommy Tutone) and Alex Call. Written for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked. While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real. In fact, it's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time hasn't quelled of the number of crank calls. In 1999, Brown University freshman roommates Nina Clemente and Jahanaz Mirza found that out the hard way, when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system. Immediately, the girls' innocuous Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish. Other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004. Bids approached $100,000 before eBay pulled the item at the request of Verizon, the number's actual owner. 5. ""Oh, Carol"" Written by: Neil Sedaka. Written for: Carole King, naturally. Sedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance Sedaka was able to successfully milk with ""Oh, Carol,"" a then top-10 (if now somewhat forgettable) 1959 pop song. However, the real success of ""Oh, Carol"" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled ""Oh, Neil."" At the time, King and her husband, Gerry Goffin, were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune. ""Oh, Neil"" wasn't that, but it did pay off. After Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""The Loco-Motion."" 6. ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" Written by: Bob Dylan. Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her. The two met in 1961, when Baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and Dylan was a nobody from Minnesota. Desperate to make his break in the music biz, Dylan worked like crazy to get Baez's attention. He eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating. For a while, they seemed like the golden couple, but things soon went downhill. During a European concert tour together in early 1965, they had a huge fight and parted ways. That May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers. Sadly, that's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else. That someone else was Sara Lownds, whom Dylan married a mere six months later. 7. ""Our House"" Written by: Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Written for: Joni Mitchell. In December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for San Francisco society -- not just CSN&Y, but also Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more. ""Our House"" was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the Nash/Mitchell household. The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally ""lit a fire,"" while Mitchell ""placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day."" No, really. The whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it.",0
"Summary: Amount almost double what was spent in 2004 election cycle. Lower TV production costs help more candidates advertise. Mitt Romney leads presidential candidates in TV spending. Advertisers face challenge of cutting through clutter of ads, analyst says. Article: A wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates, interest groups, unions and corporations to buy TV time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle, an analysis shows. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year ». And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups ""pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode."" ""What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,"" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle. Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending ». In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. ""Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,"" Tracey said. ""As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot."" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. ""Politics is completely beholden to events,"" he said. ""Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when."" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? ""Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.""",0
"Summary: Relatives of the 89 people killed in Thai air crash are still arriving in Phuket. About 36 of the bodies have yet to be identified, according to Thai authorities. U.S. Embassy in Bangkok confirms that five Americans were among the dead. The investigation into what caused Sunday's crash is still continuing. Article: Relatives of the 89 people killed in Sunday's plane crash in Phuket continued to arrive in the Thai resort town on Tuesday to try to identify their loved ones' remains. A Buddhist monk blesses the wreckage of One-Two-Go airline's MD-82 jet at Phuket airport on Tuesday. Most of those killed were foreign nationals, and about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified, according to Thailand's state-run Thai News Agency (TNA). All of the unidentified victims were foreign nationals, it reported. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said that five Americans were among those killed when the One-Two-Go jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at Phuket's airport on Sunday. U.S. officials had previously confirmed that four Americans died in the crash, and one survived. Eight British nationals are believed to have died, according to Foreign Secretary David Miliband. He said three were still in hospital, with one in a critical condition. Thailand's Public Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla said that of the 41 survivors who remain hospitalized, 38 were in stable condition and three in critical condition, according to TNA. Flight 269 was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members when it left Bangkok for Phuket on Sunday afternoon. Nationalities of the survivors include British, American, Swedish, Iranian, Austrian, Australian, Thai, German, Irish, Italian, Israeli and Dutch, authorities said. Watch a survivor recall the fiery horror ». One man who arrived in Phuket on Tuesday from Paris described a frustrating process of trying to communicate with Thai officials in his effort to locate the remains of his brother. For some families, DNA testing may be the only way to positively identify their relatives. Meanwhile, Buddhist, Christian and Muslim leaders gathered outside Phuket's airport on Tuesday to remember those killed. The investigation into what caused the crash continues, but the strong winds and rain are a suspected factor. U.S. officials are aiding in the investigation because the aircraft -- a Boeing MD-82 -- was manufactured in the United States. One air traffic controller at Phuket airport said pilots were warned of possible wind shear, which is dramatic changes in wind speed and direction. Airport officials said that the wind at the time of the crash was 17 kilometers an hour (11 miles an hour) with stronger gusts, but no planes were delayed or diverted because of the weather conditions. The decision to land was the pilot's alone, according to Phuket's airport manager. ""Air traffic control would give weather information to pilot and warning information but the final decision is dependent on the pilot,"" Pornchai Eua-Aree said. One-Two-Go officials would not speculate on what may have happened, saying they will wait for the findings of the investigation. But they did say their aircraft were regularly checked and maintained, and denied some media reports that questioned whether the discount airline employed more inexperienced pilots for lower salaries. One-Two-Go is one of about 40 low-cost airlines operating in Asia, and the industry will be watching closely for the results of the investigation into the crash. CNN's Andrew Stevens contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on ""Sicko"" Gupta's report questions some of the movie's numbers and solutions. Gupta: ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that"" Article: Filmmaker Michael Moore, whose new documentary ""Sicko"" takes on America's health care system, faced off Tuesday with CNN chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Michael Moore and CNN's Sanjay Gupta argued Tuesday about Gupta's report on Moore's film ""Sicko"" Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on ""Sicko."" ""He said the facts were fudged,"" Moore said, referring to Gupta, on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""That's a lie. None of the facts are fudged."" Moore and Gupta shouted and argued over data Gupta used and data Moore used. Moore said his staffers backed up the film's facts to Gupta before the report aired and that Gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong. Gupta disputed that. Watch Moore, Gupta make their points ». ""We try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find,"" he said. ""Michael has a lot of different numbers. ... You're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports."" Both agreed, however, on the basic premise of ""Sicko"": Problems abound in America's health-care system and need to be fixed. ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that,"" Gupta said. ""I think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it's broken. We get it."" He praised Moore for raising awareness of the issue. However, Gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as France and Canada have universal health care --suggests that health care in those countries is free. While patients may not pay for services at the doctor's office, they do pay high taxes to fund such a system, something Gupta said he was concerned that ""Sicko"" audiences might not realize. Moore responded by saying Americans pay more in copays, deductibles and insurance premiums. ""We [America] have a system built on profit,"" the moviemaker said. He asked Gupta if the current system, which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures, is cumbersome to him. ""It's a shameful system, especially when I'm dealing with some of my patients,"" Gupta said. But he questioned Moore's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the Bush administration, which Moore fiercely criticized in the past, particularly in his film ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" ""The government actually used to do things right,"" Moore said in response. ""The problem is who we put in power."" Moore has adamantly opposed the war in Iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war's success abounded in Washington. ""I am sorry we've taken so much time trying to correct [Gupta's] facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue"" -- the ailing health care system, Moore said.",0
"Summary: Majority Leader says a number of Dems are ""revisiting their own positions"" Turkey is upset about World War I ""genocide"" resolution in Congress. House resolution calls killing of Armenians ""genocide"" Incirlik Air Base is key point for U.S. military supply of Iraq mission. Article: Some Democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious House resolution labeling Turkey's treatment of Armenians in World War I as genocide. A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the ""genocide"" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. ""I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here,"" said Hoyer of Maryland. ""I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions. We will have to determine where everybody is."" Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced his opposition to the resolution last week. And Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida and John Tanner of Tennessee, both members of the U.S. House delegation to NATO, urged Pelosi to reconsider in a letter released Tuesday. ""More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base, and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future,"" they wrote. Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pentagon planners are looking at ""a broad range of options"" to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks Incirlik. ""We're confident that we'll find ways to do that,"" Ham told reporters at the Pentagon. ""There's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that, and obviously we'd prefer to maintain the access that we have."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers' concerns last week. ""About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. ... About a third of the fuel that they consume goes through Turkey or comes from Turkey,"" Gates said. He also said that 95 percent of the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protective vehicles, or MRAPs, being deployed in Iraq are flown through Turkey. The vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs. See Incirlik's key location ». The U.S. military issued a ""warning order"" a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up if Turkey stops or restricts U.S. access to Incirlik, a source said. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq which could further complicate Iraqi stability, U.S. officials said. Incirlik offers 10,000- and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters, according Globalsecurity.org, a source of background information about military issues. Globalsecurity said Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft.

"Summary: Boy, 12, lost leg to car bombing in Iraq; cousin was killed by blast. He is now heading to the United States to get a prosthetic leg. Boy: ""I want to ... meet this person that gave me my future back"" Charity director says helping the boy makes her ""cry with joy"" Article: Twelve-year-old Mohammed Rasoul, his right leg severed below the knee, maneuvers on crutches over the dirt and loose stones through the Falluja graveyard. Mohammed Rasoul sitting with his mother, Jinan Khalifa, eagerly awaits his trip to the United States. Row after row of headstones stand as the deadly reminder of the tragedy the city went through as insurgents battled for control of the city. Mohammed stops at his cousin's grave. ""I feel an ache when I think of her. Every time I remember her, I cry,"" he told CNN at a visit to the grave a few months ago. As he spoke, he poured water on a tree he planted next to it. The headstone reads: ""Martyr 643, the child Hajer Ismael Khalil, 13 October 2006."" Clutching her photograph, Mohammed says, ""My cousin died on the scene. I still remember her screams."" The same explosion cost him his leg and his childhood. ""A car came out of nowhere. My cousin was playing with her friend,"" he says. ""I remember [the car] was green. It detonated."" Watch Mohammed tell his story ». His mother, Jinan Khalifa, remembers that day all too well. She was in the kitchen when she heard a deafening explosion. ""There was shattered glass from the windows falling all over us. I went outside and saw my son covered in blood from head to toe,"" she says. Her son endured 11 operations before doctors amputated his leg below the knee. Khalifa says her son put forward a tough face, but when he finally went back home the shock hit him. ""That's where his personality started to change. He stopped laughing,"" she says. ""It was tearing me up,"" Mohammed says ""It was hard for me to watch others play. And I couldn't, I couldn't walk, it agitated me."" CNN first broadcast his story in May where it caught the attention of an American charity, the Global Medical Relief Fund, which offered to help. ""I cannot put my feelings into words,"" Khalifa says. ""An entire book would not be enough. They gave my son his hope back. The America we knew was one that came, bombed, harmed. But when this organization came forward, we saw another face of America."" The Global Medical Relief Fund, a small charity based in New York that helps children of war and natural disasters, has arranged for surgery and treatment at the Shriners Children Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Elissa Montanti, the founder and director of the organization, says she was inspired to act when she first heard of Mohammed's tragic story. ""I said, 'Oh, please, let me help this boy.' "" Mohammed will arrive in the United States on Thursday afternoon. He will be fitted for a prosthetic leg in coming weeks and examined to see if he needs additional surgery. Montanti said her organization has a list of other young Iraqi children in need of help. ""The word needs to get out."" Asked how it makes her feel to help Mohammed, she says, ""It makes me cry with joy."" Mohammed, too, is ecstatic. ""I didn't think this act of human kindness would be presented to me,"" he says. ""I didn't have hope in Iraq -- hope that I would ever get my hope back. I didn't have a future."" He adds, ""I want to go to America and meet this person that gave me my future back."" When he comes back home, he wants to help rebuild Falluja, starting with his school, which was bombed during the 2004 Falluja offensive. ""I will never leave school and, God willing, I will continue my education and become an architect and build all the schools,"" he says, standing on his crutches. But first, he says, he wants to walk to water the tree he planted next to his cousin's grave. CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report from Atlanta.",0
"Summary: India elects first female president, official results show Saturday. Pratibha Patil's supporters are calling victory a boost for women's rights. Bitter election campaign was marked by scandal. 72-year-old Patil was the ruling coalition's nominee for mainly ceremonial post. Article: India has elected its first female president, official results show, in what supporters are calling a boost for the rights of millions of downtrodden women, despite a bitter campaign marked by scandal. Pratibha Patil, 72, is India's first elected female president. Pratibha Patil, the ruling coalition's 72-year-old nominee for the mainly ceremonial post, easily beat opposition-backed challenger and vice president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in a vote by the national parliament and state politicians. ""This a victory of the people,"" Patil told reporters after official results were announced Saturday. ""I am grateful to the people of India and the men and women of India and this is a victory for the principles which our Indian people uphold."" Patil won about two thirds of the electoral college votes. There had never been any doubt she would win, given support from the ruling coalition. The governor of the northwestern desert state of Rajasthan, she emerged on the national stage when the Congress-led coalition and its communist allies failed to agree on a joint candidate. ""This is a very special moment for us women, and men of course, in our country because for the first time we have a woman being elected president of India,"" Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi, India's most powerful politician, said. Supporters hoped Patil's candidacy would help bring issues that plague women in India, like dowry-related violence, into the public spotlight. A woman is murdered, raped or abused every three minutes on average in India. Her presidency also reflects the growing power of some women in India, where an increasing number are taking part in the workforce and in schools and hold senior positions in corporations. After the results, Patil supporters took to the streets, singing and dancing as others lit fire crackers and beat large brass drums. India has had a number of female icons in the past -- most famously Sonia Gandhi's mother-in-law, Indira, who was one of the world's first female prime ministers in 1966. But hope Patil's presidency would spark only positive talk about women's influence in India evaporated when it emerged the bank for women she helped established was closed in 2003 because of bad debts and amid accusations of financial irregularities. The employees' union has taken Patil and others to court, claiming loans meant for poor women were instead given to her brother and other relatives and not returned. She was also accused of trying to shield her brother in a murder inquiry. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has dismissed accusations against her as ""mud-slinging"", said on Saturday her victory was ""a vote against the politics of divisiveness"". ""All the allegations against me are motivated and have already been answered,"" Patil said in a statement last week. Her campaign was marked by other mishaps as well. She managed to offend many minority Muslims, and anger some historians, by saying Indian women first veiled their heads as protection against 16th century Muslim invaders. Then she dismayed modern India by claiming she had experienced a ""divine premonition"" that she was destined for higher office from a long dead spiritual guru. Critics also dug up a comment she was said to have made as Maharashtra's health minister in 1975, saying people with hereditary diseases should be sterilized.",0
"Summary: San Diego mayor declares state of emergency; White House, governor offer aid. Officials were investigating the shifting earth in the area for weeks. Residents can return to 75 of the 111 evacuated homes Thursday, mayor says. ""We watched the trees snapping and cracking,"" says one evacuated resident. Article: More than 100 homes in an upscale San Diego community were evacuated after a landslide about 60 yards wide pulled the earth from beneath a three-lane road and some of the multimillion-dollar homes that adorn it. Gina Yarbrough sent this picture of the road that collapsed in Wednesday's landslide. Mayor Jerry Sanders declared a state of emergency, asking California and the federal government to help the La Jolla community recover from the Wednesday landslide. As of Thursday morning, he had already received offers of aid from legislators, the governor's office and the White House, he said. Officials warned for at least two weeks that the ground was shifting beneath the hillside community along Soledad Mountain Road. Holes were drilled into the unsettled hillside to investigate the cause and magnitude of the shift, which earlier ruptured a water line, and according to some media reports, began cracking Soledad Mountain Road in July. On Wednesday, a 20-foot-deep chasm opened beneath the road and homes. Holli Weld told San Diego's KGTV that she was walking her son to preschool when the street collapsed. Watch a resident recall how he had to grab his dogs and run ». ""The street was sinking before our eyes,"" she said. Authorities told KGTV that most residents were at work and only seven people were in their homes when the landslide occurred. Evacuated homeowner Russell Moore told CNN he remembers hearing the earth ""groan"" in what he called a ""slow avalanche."" ""The asphalt that should be under my feet was 8 feet in the air,"" Moore said. ""We watched the trees snapping and cracking and more boulders come down to our feet and we were witnessing this move."" See photos of the hole the landslide left in La Jolla ». At least 111 homes were evacuated, but Sanders said residents would be allowed to return to 75 of those houses by early Thursday morning. Several homes were damaged and at least one was destroyed, according to media reports. Nine homes are ""red tagged,"" meaning no one is allowed to enter them, and 27 more are ""yellow tagged,"" which means residents can return for necessities, but cannot stay, Sanders said. According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the landslide downed power lines and caused a minor gas leak. More than 2,400 customers were briefly left without electricity, but most residents had their power restored by Thursday, KGTV reported. The Red Cross opened a shelter at La Jolla High School. Deputy city engineer Robert Hawk told the Union-Tribune that the hillside has slowly been slipping for years because the soil is unstable. Landslide incidents in the neighborhood date back to the 1960s, Hawk told the newspaper. Pat Abbott, a retired geological sciences professor at San Diego State University, told the Union-Tribune that Mount Soledad is made up of weak layers of rock and that the culprit in the landslide is nature. ""Gravity pulling on the incline is pulling down masses of earth and those masses of earth have houses on top of them,"" Abbott told the paper. ""It's a geologically bad site and should not have been built on to begin with.""",0
"Summary: Chadian president wants journalists, flight crew released. Red Cross, UNICEF, UNHCR interview children that charity tried to fly out of Chad. Most are not from Sudan and have families, agencies say. Six members of Zoe's Ark, 11 others under arrest in Chad. Article: Most of the 103 children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor orphans, three international aid agencies reported on Thursday. Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad. Six members of Zoe's Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in. Three French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with Zoe's Ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission. Chadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed, his chief of staff, Mahamat Hissene, said Thursday. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation. The agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities. Watch a report on whether the children are orphans ». Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities. Chad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity. The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. ""We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,"" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm. ""If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know."" Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release. Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said. But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said. On its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. ""So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,"" the agencies said. ""Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,"" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing. The agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region. Other French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoe's Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur, and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press. French authorities have reacted angrily to the Zoe's Ark trip, calling the group's actions ""illegal and irresponsible."" The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan. In response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions, The Associated Press reported. Reporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad. The organization said photographers Marc Garmirian of the Capa news agency and Jean-Daniel Guillou of the Synchro X agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity's efforts. The third journalist, Marie-Agnes Peleran of the TV station France 3 Miditerranee, was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station, Reporters Without Borders said.

"Summary: Earth has warmed one degree in past 100 years. Majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise. Some critics say planets often in periods of warming or cooling. Article: Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland. Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. ""I very quickly realized two things,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. ""One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change."" ""The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening."" He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. ""For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,"" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. ""A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,"" he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,"" he said. ""When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. ""The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,"" he said. ""It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet."" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. ""We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,"" he said. ""What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming."" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. ""We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,"" he said. ""We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty."" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. ""Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,"" Schneider said. ""That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that.""",0
"Summary: Ethiopian soldier dragged after battle with Islamic insurgents killed 19 people. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic. Incident recalls 1993 dragging of U.S. soldier through streets of Mogadishu. Washington is concerned Somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists. Article: An enraged crowd dragged the body of an Ethiopian soldier through the streets of Somalia's capital Thursday after gun battles with Islamic insurgents killed 19 people, witnesses reported. In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets, crowds Thursday shouted ""God is great"" as they pulled the bruised, bullet-riddled corpse through a dusty Mogadishu neighborhood. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern Mogadishu neighborhood of Suqa Holaha, witnesses reported. Nine Ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead. Another battle broke out on the city's south side Thursday morning between Ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes, on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks. ""Ethiopians will launch violent attacks on us, for some of their comrades have been killed today,"" said Rahma Nor Omar, an elderly woman in the capital. ""They will be like wounded animals."" Witnesses put the death toll from the day's clashes at 19, including Ethiopian troops, insurgents and civilians. Ethiopian troops arrived in Somalia in December 2006 to help a weak Somali government drive the Islamic Courts Union out of Mogadishu and restore a U.N.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy. The Islamists responded by launching an insurgency against Somali government and Ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year. The United States accused the ICU of harboring suspected al Qaeda figures, including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and raised no objections to Ethiopian presence in Somalia. Washington has long been concerned that Somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists, but ICU leaders denied harboring al Qaeda suspects.",0
"Summary: Judge signs order to exhume the body of Drew Peterson's third wife. Peterson has said he believed his fourth wife left him for another man. Police: Case shifts from a missing persons search to a potential homicide. Friends and family: Stacy Peterson expressed concerns about her husband. Article: The disappearance of a suburban Chicago police sergeant's wife is now being treated as a potential homicide, and her husband is a suspect, authorities said Friday. Stacy Peterson, 23, has been missing from her suburban Chicago home since October 28. In another development, a judge signed an order to exhume the body of Drew Peterson's third wife, who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004, said Will County State Attorney James Glasgow. Peterson, 53, said he last spoke to 23-year-old Stacy Peterson -- his fourth wife -- the night of October 28. Drew Peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man, but he hasn't repeated that accusation. CNN has been unable to contact Drew Peterson for comment. The couple have been married four years and have two children, who have been interviewed for the investigation, Glasgow said. Drew Peterson also has older children from a previous marriage. Investigators have twice searched the couple's home and vehicles, and removed several items, including computers, said Illinois State Police Capt. Carl Dobrich. Drew Peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing, but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house and were given access to only one of the vehicles at that time, Dobrich said. ""Early on, we looked at this as a missing persons case, but also believed strongly ... it was strongly starting to look at Drew Peterson as being a person of interest,"" Dobrich said. ""I would say that right now, Drew Peterson has gone from being a person of interest to being a suspect."" New information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of Peterson's third wife, Kathleen Savio, which was ruled an accident by a coroner's jury, Glasgow said. ""There are strong indications that it was a homicide,"" he said. ""That's why we are doing the exhumation, because there are tests that need to be done that weren't done during the first autopsy."" Watch why authorities want to exhume the body ». Glasgow cited abrasions on Savio's body and a gash on her head that could not be readily explained. ""Our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a homicide, and as we do that, we will see if there is any evidence that implicates anyone,"" he said. Glasgow, who was not state attorney at the time of Savio's death, said he reviewed the case file before deciding to reopen the case. ""With 29 years of experience, there was no doubt in my mind it wasn't an accident,"" he said. ""That was clear."" In 2002, Savio was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband, but was found not guilty at trial, Glasgow said. Another time, she tried to bring domestic battery charges against Peterson, but no charges were ever filed. Savio's sister, Sue Doman, said Savio expressed fear of Drew Peterson. ""She told me all the time, 'He's gonna kill me. It's gonna look like an accident,' "" Doman said. Doman said she didn't believe her sister could have died in the way the investigation concluded. ""I don't understand accidental drowning. You just don't drown in the bathtub, especially a small whirlpool. You just don't do that,"" she said. Meanwhile, friends and family of Stacy Peterson said she expressed concerns about her husband. A friend, Steve Cesare, has told CNN he received e-mail from her describing her relationship as abusive. The woman's aunt, Candace Aikin, of El Monte, California, said Stacy Peterson confided in her that there were problems during a visit to the Peterson home in suburban Chicago last month. ""She said that she was afraid because he was following her around 24/7, even inside the house,"" Aikin said. ""He was very obsessed and stalking her, even inside her house. She was very, very full of stress and just not happy in her marriage at all,"" Aikin said.",0

Article: Third seed Julia Vakulenko will face comeback queen Lindsay Davenport in her first WTA Tour final at the Bell Challenge on Sunday. Julia Vakulenko will seek her first victory on the WTA Tour at the Bell Challenge in Quebec. The Ukrainian battled through with a 6-1 4-6 7-5 victory over American qualifier Julie Ditty in the semifinals. The 24-year-old, who reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open, had previously twice lost at the last-four stage this year in Las Vegas and Berlin. She reached a career high of 33rd in the world rankings back in May, but is now 36th. ""Sometimes you play your best and win easy, but sometimes you don't play your best and really have to fight hard,"" said Vakulenko, who squandered points for 5-3 leads in both the second and third sets. ""I'm just going to try my best -- I've never played her and I'm looking forward to it."" Former world No. 1 Davenport is seeking her second win in three tournaments since returning from a one-year hiatus to have a baby.

The three-time Grand Slam winner has surged back up the rankings from 234th to 126th after winning her comeback tournament in Bali and then reaching the last four in Beijing. The American has now beaten Zvonareva in all six encounters between the two players. ""I played well in the first set and had some chances early in the second set, but I didn't quite capitalize on them. I was able to come back but at 4-4 and 5-5 I just didn't return well enough,"" Davenport said. ""I was happy I was able to regroup in the third set. Physically I feel good. There are lots of positives I can take from it, especially beating a really good player and now being in the final. ""I want to be the one on the offensive and not the defensive, and that's what I'm going to try to do. ""I was trying to watch the first semifinal and see if that helped, but I play so much differently than Julie Ditty that it was hard to get anything from it.""",0
"Summary: President Musharraf orders troops to take a television station's equipment. Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan says he's under house arrest. President Musharraf says his actions are for the good of the country. White House calls Musharraf's emergency declaration ""disappointing"" Article: Hours after declaring a state of emergency Saturday, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf ordered troops to take a television station's equipment and put a popular opposition leader under house arrest. President Pervez Musharraf explains his actions in a televised address Saturday. Musharraf also suspended the constitution and dismissed the Pakistan Supreme Court's chief justice for the second time. On Sunday, police arrested the Javed Hashmi, the acting president of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's opposition party was arrested, along with 10 aides, The Associated Press reported. Hashimi was arrested when he stepped outside his house in the central city of Multan, AP reported. The country is at a critical and dangerous juncture -- threatened by rising tensions and spreading terrorism, Musharraf said in a televised address to the nation after declaring martial law. As Pakistani police patrolled the streets of the capital, Islamabad, Musharraf said his actions were ""for the good of Pakistan."" Watch Musharraf's speech ». There was quick condemnation from within and outside his country. The Supreme Court declared the state of emergency illegal, claiming Musharraf -- who also is Pakistan's military chief -- had no power to suspend the constitution, Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry said. Shortly afterward, government troops came to Chaudhry's office and told him the president had dismissed him from his job. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar was quickly appointed to replace him, according to state television. It was the second time Chaudhry was removed from his post. His ousting by Musharraf in March prompted massive protests, and he was later reinstated. See a timeline of upheaval in Pakistan ». Musharraf complained in his speech that the media -- which he made independent -- have not been supportive, but have reported ""negative"" news. Early Sunday, two dozen policemen raided the offices of AAJ-TV in Islamabad, saying they had orders to take the station's equipment. The government also issued a directive warning the media that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to $70,000, said Talat Hussain, director of news and current affairs for AAJ. Watch a former Pakistani P.M. call the developments in his country 'disturbing' ». U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- who is in Turkey for a conference with Iraq and neighboring nations -- said The United States doesn't support any extra-constitutional measures taken by Musharraf. ""The situation is just unfolding,"" Rice said. ""But anything that takes Pakistan off the democratic path, off the path of civilian rule is a step backward, and it's highly regrettable."" A senior Pakistani official said the emergency declaration will be ""short-lived,"" and will be followed by an interim government. Martial law is only a way to restore law and order, he said.

Musharraf was re-elected president in October, but the election is not yet legally official, because the Supreme Court is hearing constitutional challenges to Musharraf's eligibility filed by the opposition. Under the constitution, Musharraf couldn't run for another term while serving both as president and military leader. The court allowed the election to go ahead, however, saying it would decide the issue later.

"Summary: Robert A. Singer is accused of e-mailing child porn to 12-year-old girl. 12-year-old girl was actually undercover New York City detective. Singer was identified in court document as National Children's Museum spokesman. Washington museum officials say they are ""horrified"" by the charges. Article: The chief operating officer of the National Children's Museum was arrested Tuesday and is charged with distributing child pornography over the Internet, authorities said. Robert A. Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12-year-old girl and her 33-year-old mother, according to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia of the Southern District of New York. In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department. Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singer's computer at the museum, according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are ""horrified"" by news of Singer's arrest. They reported that he has been suspended from his post, effective immediately, and is barred from the property. Singer, 49, was arrested at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, by federal agents, according to the prosecutors' statement. Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging ""chats"" and e-mail communications with the undercover detective, posing as the woman and her daughter, from August to September. He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce. If convicted on each count, he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count, prosecutors said. Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective, posing as the mother, in an America On Line chat room called ""Cuties."" The chat room attracts people who ""are known to trade in pornographic images, including child pornography,"" according to an affidavit filed in the case by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""On five separate occasions in August 2007, Singer sent several images of child pornography over the Internet to the mother and the daughter, including images depicting sexual acts between minors and adults and images depicting known victims of child exploitation,"" prosecutors said. In his communications with the supposed daughter, Singer pretended to be a 15-year-old boy, authorities said. In August 2007, he sent her two images featuring child pornography, according to the affidavit, with the instruction, ""just delete it when you are done."" A search of Singer's AOL account activity showed that from July to September, he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective, authorities said in the statement. Also, the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography. Singer was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge later Tuesday. He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Children's Museum, but a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said he was promoted to chief operating officer within the past few months. He has been employed by the museum for four years, she said. In a written statement, the museum said it was notified by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE of Singer's arrest. ""We are horrified by the charges,"" the statement said. ""This news is deeply upsetting to the National Children's Museum family."" ""As its essence, the National Children's Museum is about enriching the lives of children,"" the statement said. ""We are educators, child advocates and parents. Anyone who does anything that might endanger the welfare of a child has no place here. Harming children is against everything we stand for as an organization and as individuals."" The museum, formerly known as the Capital Children's Museum, has been closed to the public since 2004, and operates from administrative offices, the statement said. A new facility is being built and is scheduled to open in 2012.",0
"Summary: Accused pedophile Chester Arthur Stiles gets additional charges. ""I think he's a little out of it,"" his attorney says. Suspect's ex-girlfriend: ""I've had my share of nightmares"" Stiles, 37, arrested following a routine traffic stop. Article: With his hands and feet shackled and his face obscured by his long hair, Chester Arthur Stiles made his initial court appearance in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Wednesday morning on charges stemming from the videotaped rape of a 2-year-old girl. Chester Stiles appears Wednesday in a Las Vegas, Nevada, courtroom. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. Prosecutors added a couple more charges before Wednesday's hearing, bringing the total to 23 felony counts, including a charge of lewdness with a minor, sexual assault and the use of a child in the production of pornography, according to a statement issued by the Clark County, Nevada, court. One of the lewdness charges stems from a 2004 incident, while the others are related to the videotape, the court said. Judge Deborah Lippis set November 19 as the date for the preliminary hearing. After the hearing, Stiles' court-appointed attorney said his client was overwhelmed by the public opinion in the case. ""I think he's a little out of it,"" public defender Jeff Banks said. Jerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The girl's mother said on ""The Dr. Phil Show"" Wednesday that she was ""relieved"" about Stiles' arrest, although it would have been ""better if they found him dead."" The woman said she will testify against Stiles if the case goes to court. She told Phil McGraw that her daughter remembers nothing about the videotaped assault and that she recently had a conversation with the girl about inappropriate touching. She said her daughter told her that if someone touched her inappropriately, the girl would scream and tell her mother. But, she told McGraw, ""I don't trust anybody now."" Although she is in a relationship with a man her daughter calls ""Dad,"" she said, ""I don't feel comfortable leaving her with him, nor with anybody else. ... I just cry and blame it on myself."" Eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she said the incident has placed a lot of strain on her. Asked if she would rather not have known about the assault, she said, ""Yes, I could have lived without knowing it."" A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. ""I've had my share of nightmares,"" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a ""weapons enthusiast"" with only a minor criminal record. Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos ». ""How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,"" Thomas said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is ""mortified"" by the allegations against him. ""He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,"" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. CNN's Ed Payne and Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: South Africa lead New Zealand by 287 with 8 wickets standing in the 1st test. The Proteas reach 179-2 in their second innings after the Kiwis are 118 all out. South African paceman Dale Steyn takes a career-best 5-34. Article: South African fast bowler Dale Steyn took a career-best five for 34 as the Proteas took a tight grip on the first test against New Zealand in Johannesburg. Steyn's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. New Zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to South Africa's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings. Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as South Africa stretched their lead to 287. South Africa's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings. They snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the Kiwis could only muster 56 runs. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap Ross Taylor's 15. Fleming was struck on the right forearm by Steyn and did not field during the afternoon. Coach John Bracewell said he had gone for precautionary X-rays but there was only bruising. New Zealand, 41 for two overnight, lost nightwatchman Shane Bond, bowled by a Steyn yorker, before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming, who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip. Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled. Steyn's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at Centurion two seasons ago. It was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11. South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply, but Amla and Kallis blunted the attack and then took charge. They batted together for 205 minutes, Amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while Kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76. The Kiwis were left to regret Brendon McCullum's failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond, when the batsman had only scored two. ""The ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum. It cost us a lot,"" said coach John Bracewell.",0
"Summary: Real Simple tips can add up to great summer. Best way to catch fireflies starts with easiest to catch. Tip on how not to look like a gladiator when wearing espadrilles. There is a graceful way to get in and out of a hammock. Article: Here are five great ways to enjoy your summer. Lazing in a hammock is one of the best ways to spend a summer evening. Best way to cut jeans into shorts -- What better way to declare the start of summer? The key to cutting off jeans is not to go too short too soon. Slip on the jeans and mark the desired length on one leg with chalk. ""Take them off, fold the leg at the mark, and iron the fold,"" says Caroline Calvin, creative director of Levi's. ""Then cut just under the crease with fabric scissors. Lay the short jean leg on top of the other side and cut to evenly match."" Repeat as needed to get the length you want. Ninety-degree days? Bring 'em on! The best way to catch fireflies -- How? With womanly wiles: ""Fireflies blink to attract a mate,"" explains naturalist Lynn Havsall, director of programs at the George B. Dorr Museum of Natural History, in Bar Harbor, Maine. ""Males fly around while females sit in trees, in shrubs, or on the ground. So find a female and watch her blinking pattern. Then imitate the pattern with a pen flashlight and the males will come to you."" ]A plus: The bugs move slowly, so they're easy to trap in a jar. Punch some holes in the lid and add a little grass and a piece of fruit for moisture. Admire your pretty night-lights till bedtime, then let them go. The best way to run on the beach -- Who needs a treadmill when you have miles of shoreline? Running on the beach can get you into great shape. Take it from lifeguard Benjamin Guss, 25, of Del Mar, California, who recently qualified to compete in this year's Iron Man triathlon (yes, that means swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles, and then running a marathon -- consecutively) in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Beware, shoeless Joes. If you choose to run barefoot, keep your workouts brief at first to allow tender soles to build up calluses. ""You can get blisters, even burns, from hot, soft sand,"" says Guss. ""I like to run barefoot, but for more than a couple miles, I wear shoes."" Know your sand. ""In soft sand, one mile is like two,"" says Guss. You may work foot and leg muscles you don't always use, so start slowly. And hard sand can be as tough on your legs as the road, so wear running sneakers. Pick the right time to run. ""My favorite time is in the evening,"" says Guss. ""The wind dies down, and the sand isn't that hot."" To work harder, fill small bags with sand to use as hand weights. The best way to get in and out of a hammock -- Everyone looks good lazing in a hammock -- it's getting in and out that's tricky. To make it less so, try these tips from Penny Waugh, a buyer for http://www.hammocks.com/. • Position your backside toward the hammock's center and tilt back until you reach a 45-degree angle, with the hammock parallel to your rear. • Gently sit back into the hammock and let it level out. • Swing your legs up and stretch them out. • Lie back. Loll. Sigh contentedly. For a graceful exit, sit upright and swing your legs off, anchoring your feet on the ground. Then push with your behind, gathering momentum to stand. ""It's tricky, since there's nothing to hold on to,"" says Waugh. ""But it's good for the glutes."" The best way to tie espadrilles -- Apply this lace-up logic from Meghan Cleary, author of ""The Perfect Fit: What Your Shoes Say About You."" • Slide your foot fully into the shoe and plant it firmly on the floor. • Cross and tie the laces once behind the ankle, then bring them forward, cross and tie again, and continue up the leg, depending on how long the laces are. The calf is the maximum height -- any higher and you'll look like a gladiator. • Each time you cross and tie, secure the laces slightly tighter than is comfortable, since they will loosen a bit when you walk. Just don't cut off your circulation. • For a streamlined leg, make the final tie in the back. Create a more whimsical look by putting the final tie in front with a small bow.

"Summary: Jordan opens school doors to all Iraqi children, regardless of refugee status. Principal says her school is 20 percent Iraqi this year. Education minister: Iraqi kids will be incorporated into ""mainstream"" life. One student says he lost five family members in Iraq. Article: In the sunbathed schoolyard of the Shmisani Institute for Girls in Amman, Jordan, principal Sanaa Abu Harb makes an announcement over the speaker system. Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is Iraqi. ""All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls. Iraqi girls only!"" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion. Dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list. Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home ». The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. ""We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,"" she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement. Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: ""Five members."" Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. ""It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,"" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. ""I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them."" He pauses: ""But you have to miss your country."" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms. As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records. Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. ""Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,"" says Touqan, the education minister. ""We will not run a parallel system of education.""",0
"Summary: President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace Alberto Gonzales. Mukasey is a former federal chief judge in New York. Some Democratic senators opposed nominee due to views on waterboarding. Human rights groups consider waterboarding a form of torture. Article: After weeks of controversy over Michael Mukasey's views on waterboarding, the Senate late Thursday approved the former judge's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote. Waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department. President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales, who resigned in September. The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Mukasey, a former federal judge in New York, told senators he considers waterboarding ""repugnant,"" but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture, which U.S. and international law bans. Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy. ""The Department of Justice, once the crown jewel among government institutions, is adrift and rudderless,"" Schumer said Tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send Mukasey's nomination to the Senate floor. ""It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person."" Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the nominee said that Congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president ""would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore"" it. Schumer said he believed Mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general. ""Indeed, his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president's previous attorney general nominees have."" But Mukasey's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's chairman. ""Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey's personal assurance that he would enforce a future, new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one,"" Leahy said Tuesday. ""Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president."" However, the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he believed Mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding. ""He could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances,"" Specter said earlier. ""But he is intelligent; he's really learned in the law. He's strong, ethical, honest beyond any question. He's not an intimate of the president."" A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture, but some of those say it's OK for the U.S. government to use the technique, according to a poll released Tuesday. Asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture, more than two-thirds of respondents, or 69 percent, said yes; 29 percent said no. Asked whether they think the U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists, 58 percent said no; 40 percent said yes. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. telephone poll of 1,024 American adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.",0
"Summary: Orme, Tennessee, has running water from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Town's spring ran dry in midst of Southeast drought. Donated water is trucked in from Alabama. Completion of pipeline will solve problem for good. Article: The drought in the Southeastern United States means more than just brown lawns to the folks in Orme, Tennessee. Water flows from their taps for just three hours each evening. A 1961 firetruck loads up with water from a hydrant in Alabama to haul back to Orme, Tennessee. The mountain spring that supplies water to the town usually dries up at the end of summer, but just for a few days. This year it dried up early, on August 1, and hasn't revived, leaving the town's 145 residents high and dry and relying on water trucked in from the next state. Every day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank. When he turns the crank again at 9 p.m., taps in the town run dry. ""When they cut it back on we jump for joy,"" Orme resident Debbie Cash said. ""And then you only have it for three hours."" Three hours to do all the laundry, bathing, dishwashing and animal watering that has to be done. Watch how Cash copes ». The old mining town could be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the region. Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir. The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia, Alabama and Florida over rights to water from the Chattahoochee River. ""All of these people that are on the river systems better take note, because once your streams and tributaries to the river start drying up, the river isn't far behind,"" Reames said. See photos of a Atlanta's shrinking Lake Lanier reservoir ». Volunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or Orme's diesel-belching 1961 fire truck to a hydrant near Bridgeport, Alabama, 2½ miles down the road. Making several round trips, they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day. Bridgeport, which gets its water from the Tennessee River, doesn't charge its neighbor. Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help out, occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant, where it's transferred to the Orme trucks. See where Orme has to go for water ». But things are looking up in Orme. A pipeline from Bridgeport is nearly complete, built with the help of a $378,000 grant from the federal government. ""With this new water coming in, then we'll have it made,"" Cash said. ""Now we won't have to worry about it no more."" In addition, an Austin, Texas, company called H2O Guard is planning to donate water-saving sink aerators, shower heads and toilet valves to everyone in Orme on November 17, company spokesman Robert Easter said. ""We think we're going to get another 90 gallons' savings per day per household,"" Easter said. ""That'll make that little water tower in that town go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyone's habits."" Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools that were filled early in the summer. It's a lesson for everyone. ""Cherish the water you got and be kind of careful with it,"" Cash said, ""because you never know if you will be out of water.""

"Summary: State-run news agency: China orders an investigation by quality control agencies. Children who swallow the beads can become comatose or have seizures. Toys are sold as Aqua Dots in the U.S., as Bindeez Beads in Australia. Three children were hospitalized in Australia after swallowing large quantities. Article: China has suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys contaminated with a chemical that can convert to a powerful ""date rape"" drug, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Saturday. The toys have caused some children who swallowed the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness. China suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys that contain a chemical that converts into a ""date rape"" drug. The agency said that the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) has ordered an investigation by quality control agencies and will release results as soon as they are available. The AQSIQ did not reveal the name of the toys' producer, Xinhua said. U.S. safety officials voluntarily recalled about 4.2 million of the Chinese-made toys Wednesday. Scientists have found the highly popular holiday toy contains a chemical that, once metabolized, converts into the toxic ""date rape"" drug GHB (gamma-hydroxy butyrate), Scott Wolfson, a spokesman with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), told CNN. ""Children who swallow the beads can become comatose, develop respiratory depression or have seizures,"" a CPSC statement warned. The arts-and-craft beads, which have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores under the name ""Aqua Dots,"" have also been distributed in Australia under the name ""Bindeez Beads."" The Bindeez toys were recalled Tuesday by Melbourne-based Moose Enterprise Pty. Ltd. after three children in Australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized. ""I was so frightened because I thought she wasn't going to make it,"" Heather Lehane told CNN affiliate Network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter, Charlotte, who was hospitalized in Australia after ingesting some of the beads. In the United States, the Washington-based safety commission said it has in recent days received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads, which are part of a craft kit aimed at kids 4 years and older. The CPSC said a boy nearly 2 years old ""swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state for a period of time."" The commission said the toddler was hospitalized and has since ""fully recovered."" The second incident involved a child who vomited, fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days. It was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery. Toronto-based toy distributor Spin Master Ltd. stopped shipping the Aqua Dots toys and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves, where they were previously sold for $17 to $30. Anyone with Aqua Dots at home should return the product to the company, CPSC spokeswoman Julie Vallese said. The toy had been named toy of the year in Australia and recently crested Wal-Mart's list of top 12 Christmas toys. Wal-Mart on Thursday listed the toys on its Web site as ""out of stock online"" and had removed them from their top toy list as well. This latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of Chinese-made toys that have swept across the country. Last month alone, U.S. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint, which can cause hazardous lead poisoning. CNN's Janine Brady, Jason Carroll, Laura Dolan, Julie O'Neill and Leslie Wiggins contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Congo rebels blame Rwandan Hutus for attack, report says. Internally displaced Congolese flee as rebels attack government troops. Torrential rain makes refugee movement difficult. U.N. refugee agency: Some 375,000 have been forced from homes in past year. Article: Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said. Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A press release from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled. Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the UNHCR reported. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. ""The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through,"" UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agency's release. ""Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma."" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, ""They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry."" Redmond added, ""These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours. They need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state."" While the Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack, a Nkunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N.-affiliated news service. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service. ""We think it could have been insurgents close to Nkunda who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Rwandan rebels],"" spokesman Col. Pierre Cherayron was quoted as saying. The UNHCR identified the affected camps as Mugunga I, Mugunga II, Lac Vert and Bulengo, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo. The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to the International Crisis Group, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.",0
"Summary: ""Wine Library TV"" Internet show has about 40,000 regular viewers. Show takes irreverent look at wine business. Wine consumption has risen in United States for last 15 years. Article: Voluble Gary Vaynerchuk, 31, the host of ""Wine Library TV,"" an online video show, has been known to lick rocks, suck leather and eat dirt while on camera, all to illustrate the unique properties of wine. ""Wine Library TV"" host Gary Vaynerchuk discusses four spooky wine varieties for Halloween show. Of a ""wild and gamey"" red from Rioja, Spain, Vaynerchuk says, ""Hit a deer on the road. Throw a bunch of cherries on it. Take out your knife, cut the deer. Bite it. That's the flavor profile."" That kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers. Across the Internet, budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of Web sites, blogs, bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand. About 40,000 Internet viewers -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with ""Wine Library TV."" The low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that Vaynerchuk's family owns in Springfield, New Jersey. Vaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate, and he doesn't dumb down his subject. Yet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop-culture references -- and the kind of language a Wine Spectator critic would be unlikely to employ. The mission of wine sites like ""Wine Library TV,"" say several of the people behind these new outlets, is to demystify wine (and in some cases, sell it, too). Using the language, attitude and new media that appeal to a young, tech-savvy generation, they advocate trusting one's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics. Some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions. One site, SavorEachGlass.com, declares its dedication to ""exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation,"" with reviews, online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking -- all with attitude. ""The (wine) establishment is about ratings and 'reputation,'"" says the site's founder, Tynan Szvetecz, 29. ""It's about collecting the 'good' stuff as defined by someone else's palate and tastes. That bores a younger generation."" ""We're not afraid to be smartasses,"" he continues. ""We make fun of ourselves, old-world wine makers, new-world wine makers, and anyone else we can get our hands on."" In the U.S., interest in wine is exploding. While consumption has leveled out in traditional wine-producing countries such as France, Italy and Spain, especially among young people, it has trended upwards in the U.S. for 15 straight years. The U.S. is projected to overtake No. 2 Italy by the end of 2007, according to the annual report The U.S. Wine Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast a leading industry trade publication. Many of the new converts to wine are the so-called Millennials, the under-30 age group coveted by beverage marketers and so comfortable online that they're also called iGen, or the Internet Generation. One of the wine Web sites targeting a younger demographic is VineSugar.com, which features a blog called ""Wine Burps."" ""We love wine but hate the elitism,"" writes founder, Ryan O'Donnell. ""After all, it's just grape juice."" With rants about wine tasting fees, a feature spotlighting ""wine hotties"" working at California wineries, as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries, VineSugar.com leaves little doubt about its target audience. CellarTracker.com, an online wine community, appeals to more established wine collectors. The site provides free software -- designed by Eric LeVine, a fortuitously named former Microsoft software developer -- that allows wine enthusiasts to create an online inventory of their wines. The 39,000 users (who count 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars) post reviews of their wines and access scores and other data via PDAs and cell phones. Community tasting notes shed light on how cellar-worthy wines are evolving, helping others decide when to crack open a treasured bottle. Corkd.com, another online community of wine fans, already had 40,000 users when Vaynerchuk purchased the site last year. The free service allows users to catalog and review wines. Instead of having ""friends"" as on Facebook, members identify ""drinking buddies"" and check out what they're drinking. In the growing presence of wine fans on the Internet -- newbies as well as connoisseurs -- Vaynerchuk sees a movement. ""They're part of forums, they meet up (offline),"" he says. ""It's about bringing people together. It's all that's right about wine."" Vaynerchuk should know. The 300-plus shows he has taped in the past two years have developed a cult following of online fans, who call themselves ""Vayniacs,"" share wine tips and obsess about their hero on the site's forum. On a recent rainy afternoon, Vaynerchuk barreled, unrehearsed and unscripted, through a 20-minute show in a single take. He wrapped up Wine Library TV episode No. 337 with what has become his signature line. ""You, with a little bit of me, we're changing the wine world, aren't we?""

"Summary: Survivors of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh waiting for aid to arrive. Red Crescent Society official says deaths could rise to 5,000-10,000. Bangladeshi president distributes aid; angry survivors go empty-handed. Thousands remain missing; estimated 280,000 homeless. Article: Survivors of a storm that killed more than 3,000 people in the impoverished nation of Bangladesh grieved and buried their loved ones Monday as they waited for aid to arrive. Villagers grieve in Patargata, around 125 miles south of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, Monday. The number of dead killed from Cyclone Sidr -- now at 3,114 -- is expected to rise yet further as the South Asian nation continues to assess the damage. The Bangladesh Red Crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000 -- perhaps even reaching as high as 10,000. In the fishing village of Galachipa, in Patuakhali district, Dhalan Mridha was grieving for family members who died in the cyclone after ignoring an alert issued by authorities. ""Nothing is going to happen. That was our first thought and we went to bed. Just before midnight the winds came like hundreds of demons. Our small hut was swept away like a piece of paper, and we all ran for shelter,"" Mridha, a 45-year-old farm worker, told The Associated Press. On the way to a shelter, Mridha lost contact with his wife, mother and two children. The next morning he found their bodies. The Category 4 cyclone raked Bangladesh's southwest coast on Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 241 km/h (150 mph), destroying fishermen's hamlets and villages. Thousands are still missing, while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes which were wiped out by the storm. Many grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them. Most houses in the region are made of flimsy materials such as bamboo and corrugated iron, and had no chance of withstanding the storm's powerful winds. In addition, the storm-struck area is criss-crossed by a huge river delta which surged as Sidr pushed through, wiping out many villages and littering the river's shores with debris. Watch as people are left to fend for themselves ». Low-lying Bangladesh is already prone to flooding which has wiped out the country's rice production -- a major food staple for the impoverished country. Improved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones in the region of 1970 and 1991, when the tolls were in the hundreds of thousands. Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed visited the devastated region Sunday, handing out some aid to the crowds of people before members of the international media. It was seen largely a token effort as hundreds were left empty-handed and furious. Security officials struggled to hold back the crowd. See dramatic photos of storm survivors ». Sidr has already ruined Bangladesh's rice harvest, but the international community is rallying to make sure the country does not suffer as acutely as it has in the past. Nearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the country's rice production in 1974. International aid organizations promised initial packages of $25 million during a meeting with Bangladesh agencies Monday, the U.N.'s World Food Program said. The United States has offered more than $2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief, and sent two U.S. Navy carriers to help in recovery operations. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person Department of Defense medical team is in Bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm. Bangladesh's government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues, Bangladeshi government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN. Officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions cannot yet be determined. Munaim said nearly a third of Bangladesh's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone, most of those along the southern coast. The Bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. International aid groups -- including Save the Children, World Vision, and the Red Crescent, which already have offices in Bangladesh -- are deploying resources to the cyclone-stricken region but -- like the government -- they have found it nearly impossible to reach the more remote areas to assess conditions. Roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm, or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use. Clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process. Along the broken road that leads into Kolapara, the body of an 8-year-old girl called Rummie was carefully carried away for burial. Overwhelmed with sadness, her mother Khadija was steadied by a relative. ""I am feeling too much pain in my heart,"" she said. ""I have lost my daughter, so I am a victim of the cyclone as well.""

"Summary: Italy win 2-1 in Scotland to secure their qualification for the Euro 2008 finals. The result means Scotland cannot qualify and will now finish third in Group B. France will also be reaching the Euro 2008 finals after the result in Glasgow. Article: World champions Italy clinched qualification for Euro 2008 after goals in the first and last minutes gave them a pulsating 2-1 victory at Hampden Park -- killing off Scotland's hopes of reaching the finals. Luca Toni celebrates his early goal as Italy won 2-1 in Scotland to clinch qualification from Group B. Luca Toni shot Italy in front but Scotland recovered to dominate and Barry Ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller. However, Christian Panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award Italy a free-kick. The result also means France have sealed qualification, along with Italy, from Group B without playing a game. In a match played in torrential rain, Italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds. Gianluca Zambrotta spotted Antonio Di Natale unmarked in the box, and picked him out with a throw-in as Scotland were caught napping. Di Natale swept the ball into the path of Toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out. The home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later. This time, Toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by Mauro Camoranesi who fired over from close-range. Toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from Craig Gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post. At the other end, Scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from Lee McCulloch appeared to be handled by Zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored. Spurred on by a sense of injustice, the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors. Ferguson fired over from a James McFadden corner, before Alan Hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the Everton man. Scotland then produced some wonderful passing football, which culminated in a tight-angled drive from Ferguson, but Gianluigi Buffon dived low to smother. Then came another scare for the home side. Gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from Massimo Ambrosini, before Di Natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net. The assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong. Only last-gasp defending from the Italians prevented the Scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time. David Weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet Ferguson's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before Andrea Pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line. A free-kick in a dangerous area provided Italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when Paul Hartley hauled down Camoranesi just outside the box. Pirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but, despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist, his effort was easily dealt with by Gordon. Instead, it was Scotland who found the back of the net as Hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone. McFadden's free-kick deflected into the path of McCulloch in front of goal. He was denied by Buffon, but the rebound fell kindly to Ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range. With just over 15 minutes to go, Scott Brown was withdrawn for Kenny Miller as Scotland went for broke. The Derby striker quickly began to cause the Italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of McFadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score. Scotland's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when Italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for Euro 2008. Hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and Panucci rose to meet Pirlo's cross and nod home the winner. Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said: ""We knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere. ""But through their character and desire, the lads were fantastic. They worked so hard, they deserve this. Qualifying for Euro 2008 is amazing. It's something positive after all that happened last week (the death of the Lazio fan)."" Captain Fabio Cannavaro: ""This was a victory won with the heart. It was difficult to play in this stadium, with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron. ""We played really well and managed to win. We showed once again that we are a strong and compact team and when we need to win we do everything to show that we are the world champions. ""In Italy we play a high level of football, we've won the Champions League and the World Cup but unfortunately at this moment we are being noticed for something else.""",0
"Summary: Authorities uncover a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S. embassy in Baku. The United States has reduced its embassy's operations. Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday. Article: Authorities in Azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Baku, prompting the facility to close its doors to the public Monday, Azerbaijan and U.S. officials told CNN. The Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku. As a precaution, Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday ""following security concerns nearby,"" Britain's Foreign Office said. The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry told CNN. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details ""are still unfolding,"" and the threat ""may or may not be"" linked to the Saturday raid. ""There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there,"" McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. ""While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security,"" it said. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran. McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. CNN's Igor Malakhov in Moscow, Zain Verjee in Washington and Roger Clark in London contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: World No. 3 Novak Djokovic beaten in the second round of the Paris Masters. The Serb, who had a first-round bye, lost 6-3 6-2 to veteran Fabrice Santoro. Top seeds Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal win opening matches at Bercy. Article: World number three Novak Djokovic crashed out of the Paris Masters after being trounced in his opening match by veteran Frenchman Fabrice Santoro on Wednesday. Fabrice Santoro returns the ball during his shock second-round victory against Novak Djokovic. The 34-year-old Santoro, who beat world No. 5 Andy Roddick at the Lyon Grand Prix last week, again rose to the occasion in front of his home fans as he stormed to a 6-3 6-2 second-round victory against the Serb. It was the first time the two players had met, with Djokovic making his first outing since losing to David Nalbandian in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters two weeks ago. Djokovic, like the American Roddick, has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Shanghai starting next month. The 20-year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth. ""I couldn't give my 100 percent, not even 30 percent of my possibilities,"" Djokobvic said. ""He deserved to win. I'm still on medications. I didn't practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago. Physically, I'm not feeling at all good."" The result is a boost for rising British star Andy Murray, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the Masters Cup by winning his first match in Paris and was expected to face Djokovic. The 20-year-old, who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury, beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to progress into the third round. The 15th seed is seeking to overtake Tommy Haas, who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in Shanghai. Murray, who trails the German by just three points, has not beaten Djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent Santoro. Ninth seed Haas, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in the second round. Murray, who won his second title this year at the St Petersburg Open last Sunday, made a confident start against Nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on Monday. He held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the Swiss Indoors event by Roger Federer last weekend, but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak. The Scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory. Defending champin and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, one of six players to have already qualified for Shanghai, beat Argentina's Juan Del Potro 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in his opening match on Wednesday. The Russian, fined for ""lack of effort"" after his defeat by Croatian qualifier Marian Cilic in St Petersburg, will next face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in round three after Baghdatis shocked 13th seed Ivan Ljubicic. Ivo Karlovic broke Roger Federer's serve for the first time in his life, but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday. Croatian Karlovic, the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres, went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as Federer played for the first time at the Bercy event since 2003. Federer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before Karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set. But the Swiss top seed got straight back in harness, breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the Basel semifinals. World numbet two Rafael Nadal also reached the third round after thrashing Italy's Filippo Volandri 6-3 6-1. The Spaniard will next play Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina.",0
"Summary: Gloss taking backseat to bold colors in lipsticks. Exfoliate lips before applying a bold hue. Melissa Silver: ""Anyone can wear plum or sheer red"" at night. AJ Crimson likes subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones for day. Article: After years in the bronze age, when sun-kissed cheeks and gloss reigned supreme, fall's return to glamour means that lipstick is making a major comeback. Lipstick outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever. So pucker up. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night. For foolproof application, stick with sheer, subdued shades in the morning and save deep, bold colors (which require more time and precision) for night. Daytime equation. 1. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen, like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20. ""Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist,"" suggests Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua. The smoother your lips, the more perfect your lipstick will look. 2. Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube. A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose. 3. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain, says Bua. ""The color looks more natural and lasts longer."" Instead of tissues, use lint-free blotting papers, like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens ($10). Nighttime equation. 1. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy. Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips ($10; at drugstores) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches. 2. Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly. One to try: Olay Regenerist lip treatment ($19; at drugstores). 3. Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding, says Robin Fredriksz, who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum ($8; at drugstores). 4. Brush on color for more control. Try: Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush ($35) with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red ($11). Makeup artists' favorites. Just like us, cosmetics pros use the same lipsticks again and again. From the just right daytime rose to the classic evening red, here are some of their all-time go-to picks for day and night. Carmindy's neutral picks for day are designed to ""enhance your natural lip color."" For night she recommends dark berry or true red for all skin tones. Her clients: Heidi Klum and Jamie-Lynn Sigler. Day shades: Benefit Silky Finish in Candy Store, $16; Givenchy Rouge Interdit in Secret Pink, $26. Night colors: Nars in Scarlet Empress, $23; Revlon Super Lustrous in Love That Red, $8; at drugstores. AJ Crimson likes a subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones during the day. For night he recommends bright red for fair complexions and a deep purple for darker ones. His clients: Missy Elliot and Amerie. Day shades: Chanel Rouge Hydrabase in Pink Sugar, $25; Laura Mercier in Candy Pink, ($22). Night colors: Maybelline Moisture Extreme in Royal Red, $7; at drugstores; MAC in Cyber, ($14). Melissa Silver uses fuchsia on cool skin tones and peachy nude on warm ones for day. For night, she says, ""anyone can wear plum or sheer red."" Her clients: Renée Zellweger and Cindy Crawford. Day shades: Clinique Colour Surge Butter Shine in Fresh Watermelon, $14; Lancôme Le Rouge Absolu in Nectariche, $25. Night colors: MAC in Spice It Up!, $14; Sonia Kashuk in Sheer Cherry Blossom, $8.

"Summary: ""Grey's Anatomy"" actress Katherine Heigl has own production company. Star of hit movie Knocked Up"" is getting married. Doesn't go without makeup for fear of ugly photographs. Says shopping for wedding dress is ""grueling"" Article: A hit TV show. An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born. The Ingénue: ""This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,"" Heigl says. ""I like simple hair and makeup."" There has been a self-tanning mishap. As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fiancé, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets. Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products. ""I love everything new,"" says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" just started a production company at Fox. ""When I was in Rhode Island filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca."" She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Nautica's new women's fragrance in January. Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit ""Knocked Up"" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl. These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Katie (and Hollywood calls the Next Big Thing), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like. KATHERINE HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat. IN STYLE: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign. KH: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth. IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks? KH: It was fun. I was working with such great hair and makeup people. And to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat. IS: Do you ever go without makeup? KH: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the ""Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup"" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products. IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge? KH: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept. IS: How do you think you express your personality through style? KH: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again. As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me. I'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm ""preparing"" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat. IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding? KH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, ""I'm done."" Everyone says, ""You just know when you put that dress on."" My sister found the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling. IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months? KH: My poor mother is probably like, ""Why, God? Why?"" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun. And I don't want to freak out or stress. IS: Does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look? KH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing. IS: Would you ever wear a wig out? KH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out. IS: How would you describe your skin? KH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse. IS: How do you treat a breakout? KH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores. If I backed up, things might look fine. IS: What do you always carry in your bag? KH: Powder, because I get shiny. And lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or C.O. Bigelow's Mentha Lip Shine in Black Cherry Soda from Bath & Body Works. It's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good. IS: An In Style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Hollywood. KH: I train with Harley Pasternak. I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Factor diet. I first said, ""I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl."" It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline. He said, ""I just want you to be healthy."" A lot of what we focus on is posture. I slump into myself when I get stressed. If I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look. But I'd never maintain it.

"Summary: If you build it, the tourists will come to your museum. Museums for hobos, medical oddities and trash. Kentucky museum is where dummies go to die. Article: 1. The SPAM® Museum. SPAM marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the Chinese Year of the Pig. If the on-site ""wall of SPAM"" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family. SPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat. 2. National Museum of Funeral History. It's pretty hard to argue with the motto ""Any Day Above Ground is a Good One."" So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of ""fantasy coffins"" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye. These moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3. The Hobo Museum. If you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps. Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Luckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year. Of course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the ""hobo jungle,"" located by the railroad tracks. Both the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have ""caught the westbound"" are laid to rest. 4. The Mütter Museum. Originally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the Mütter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation. Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5. The Barnum Museum. What better way to honor ""Greatest Show on Earth"" founder P.T. Barnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus. But only circus freaks (and by that we mean ""enthusiasts"") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb. 6. The Conspiracy Museum. There's more than one theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well? Most JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring ""mainstream"" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald. But just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. For the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7. The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices. Take two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession. Thanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St. Paul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers. If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8. Cook's Natural Science Museum. What began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest. At Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free. And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9. Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum. So, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville? The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die. The Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts. And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one. But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10. The Trash Museum. Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T. our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump. And for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms.

"Summary: Man posted photos on the Internet of himself sexually abusing underage boys. Computer experts managed to undo digital masking to reveal the man. Man abused 12 boys in Vietnam and Cambodia. Article: Interpol on Monday took the unprecendented step of making a global appeal for help to identify a man from digitally reconstructed photos taken from the Internet that it said showed him sexually abusing underage boys. This moving image shows how police used software to unscramble the image. (Source: Interpol) The man's face was disguised by digital alteration, but the images were capable of being restored, according to a bulletin from Interpol -- the international police agency based in Lyon, France. Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said the pictures have been on the the Internet for several years, but investigators have been unable to determine the man's identity or nationality. ""We have tried all other means to identify and to bring him to justice, but we are now convinced that without the public's help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse young children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens,"" Noble said. He said there is ""very good reason to believe that he travels the world in order to sexually abuse and exploit vulnerable children."" Interpol has determined the photos were taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. ""The decision to make public this man's picture was not one which was taken lightly,"" said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of Interpol's Trafficking in Human Beings Unit. The suspect's photo and more information can be seen online at Interpol's Web site.",0
"Summary: Reuters was founded in 1851 by Julius Reuter, transmitting market quotations. The company was first in Europe with news of President Lincoln's assassination. Today Reuters has 196 bureaux serving approximately 131 countries. Article: Reuters is a global information company providing material tailored for professionals in the financial services, media and corporate markets. Its information is trusted and drives decision making across the globe. In October 1851 Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant, opened an office in the City of London which transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. 18 months earlier he had used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service which operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed. Reuters, as the agency soon became known, eventually extended its service to other European countries. It also expanded the content to include general and economic news from all around the world. In 1865 Reuters was first in Europe with news of President Lincoln's assassination in the United States. As overland telegraph and undersea cable facilities developed, the business expanded beyond Europe to include the Far East in 1872 and South America in 1874. In 1883 Reuters began to use a ""column printer"" to transmit messages electrically to London newspapers and in 1923 pioneered the use of radio to transmit news internationally. In 1927 it brought in the teleprinter to distribute news to London newspapers. Today Reuters has over 16,900 staff in over 94 countries across the globe, and is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, with 196 bureaux serving approximately 131 countries. In 2006 Reuters filed over two and a half million news items, including 656,500 alerts, from 209 countries around the world, published in 18 languages. Although Reuters is best known as the world's largest international multimedia news agency, more than 90% of its revenue derives from its financial services business. Some 370,000 financial market professionals working in the equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, money, commodities and energy markets around the world use Reuters products. The company supplies news -- text, graphics, video and pictures -- to media organizations across the globe. It also provides news to businesses outside the financial services sector, as well as direct to consumers.",0
"Summary: Six of seven dead in fire were University of South Carolina students. Official: Six treated at hospital and released were also USC students. Mayor Debbie Smith said one of 13 at house is related to owner of house. Victims' names not being released until families are notified. Article: Six of the seven college students killed in a massive house fire Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, attended the University of South Carolina, a university official said Sunday. ""This is a very sad day for the University of South Carolina family,"" Dennis A. Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs, told reporters. The seventh fatality is believed to be a Clemson University student, he said. The six survivors -- who were treated and released from Brunswick Community Hospital -- are also USC students, he said. Pruitt said the bodies were being sent to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for identification. Watch home video showing the house in flames ». ""It is difficult to ascertain exactly who was in the house and who was not,"" Pruitt said, explaining that several area houses were filled with college students visiting for the weekend. Newspaper deliveryman Tim Burns was aghast when he first saw the inferno early Sunday morning. He tried to approach the door but the flames were too intense, he told the Associated Press. ""When I was going up to the entryway, you could hear the windows above me explode,"" Burns said. ""When I knew the flames had taken over, I don't think I've ever felt as helpless in my life."" The USC students were affiliated with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, Pruitt said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. ""It just so happens, as on many university campuses, that certain sororities and certain fraternities hang around together,"" he said. One person described as ""unaccounted for"" was later confirmed dead, Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith told CNN. ""We suffered a terrible tragedy at Ocean Isle this morning,"" Smith said in a news conference. ""Nothing like this has ever happened at Ocean Isle Beach, and we hope it never will again."" She said officials had not yet contacted all the victims' families, and that they were not yet releasing their names. The mayor said one of the 13 people in the house was related to the house's owner. Smith said the house was fully ""engulfed"" in flames around 7 a.m. when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after the fire department was notified. She said the house had working smoke detectors, AP reported. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, Smith said. ""We ran down the street to get away,"" Nick Cain told the AP. The University of North Carolina student was staying at a house about 100 feet away. Some of his friends had met several people staying at the house that burned down. ""The ash and the smoke were coming down on us. We were just trying to get away,"" Cain told the AP. Ocean Isle Beach is a popular resort destination along the southern coast of North Carolina. The 7-mile-long island's year-round population is about 425, while the summer season population is about 25,000, according to the town's Web site.",0
"Summary: Official: Streets bustling, workers returning, markets ""back like gangbusters"" Troop surge, citizens groups, Mehdi Army cease-fire all help security situation. Iranian weapons, fighters still posing problems in northeastern Baghdad. Commander says more families will return when basic services fully restored. Article: Attacks are down 75 percent in recent months in a perilous stretch of neighborhoods in northeastern Baghdad, prompting a U.S. military officer to proclaim Monday that security there is ""dramatically improving."" Concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of Baghdad, a military official says. People line the streets, cars congest them, trash collectors and other city workers have returned, local leaders are holding community meetings again and ""markets have come back like gangbusters,"" said Army Col. Don Farris, commander of 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. He added that the largely Sunni al Qaeda in Iraq presence has been ""crushed"" since the beginning of May. However, there are still dangers, most notably the threats posed by Iranian-backed Shiite militants, Farris said. Speaking to Pentagon reporters via video link from Baghdad, Farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation. Among them is the ""surge,"" the additional U.S. troops deployed earlier this year. Watch how old rivalries have been posing problems ». Also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and the development of a program that employs ""concerned local citizens"" to assist U.S. and Iraqi forces, Farris said. Some of those citizens are members of local Sunni ""awakening councils,"" comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area. Especially in the last six weeks, Farris said, civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests, two Iranian operatives among them. ""From my foxhole, in our sector, it is working,"" he said of the improving security in the area. ""I can only speak to what I see in my sector and I am encouraged."" Farris' sector -- which includes the Sunni-dominated district of Adhamiya and Sadr City, the Shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a ""remarkable turnaround,"" he said. Many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads. Despite improvements in the security situation, Farris warned that ""we still have a lot of work to do"" because there doesn't appear to be any sign that Shiite extremists with links to Iran are halting their activities. Farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators, which are often delivered or manufactured by Iran. Nine such bombs were found in late October, he said. There are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into Sadr City, he said. There are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area, Farris said, because ""essential services"" like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff. Though a ""trickle"" of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return, Farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape. Paul Folmsbee, a State Department provincial reconstruction team leader, said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law, governance, economic development and essential services. Farris' Monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by U.S. and Iraqi military officials over recent weeks. The military officials say they are seeing signs of Sunni-Shiite reconciliation. At a press conference earlier Monday in Baghdad, Brig. Gen. Ed Cardon, deputy commander for support of Multi-National Division-Center, discussed a ""definite period of progress"" in his region on the southern Baghdad outskirts.",0
"Summary: White truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road near time fire started. Charges filed against man who allegedly set small fire and walked off. Catalino Pineda one of five arrested in arson investigations this week. Arson investigations continue across multiple California counties. Article: Officials are searching for the driver of a white truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road on Sunday, near the time the Santiago fire started, Orange County authorities said Friday. Chief Chip Prather holds a photo of a white truck similar to the one seen on Santiago Canyon Road. ""These people are not suspects at this time,"" Orange County Fire Authority Chief Chip Prather said. ""They are persons of interest who were seen near the fire in a vehicle like this."" The vehicle is a white, 1998 to 2004 Ford F150 pickup with chrome tubular running boards. Prather said the information came from a lead called into the investigation's tip line. A $250,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the blaze. Watch how residents feel about arsonist ». The Santiago fire, now 27,000 acres and still burning, was deliberately set, officials said Thursday. Several mandatory evacuations remain in place for the Santiago fire, which has destroyed 14 homes and various other structures. Late Friday afternoon, the blaze moved into Silverado Canyon, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies were evacuating residents in the fire's path. Watch the Santiago flames rage ». Authorities also suspect arson in the Rosa fire in San Diego County, which burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained. There was no information on the investigation. Elsewhere, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed arson charges Friday against a 41-year-old Sun Valley man who witnesses said set a fire in the West Hills neighborhood and walked away. Catalino Pineda is one of five people who have been arrested in arson investigations this week, but none of them has been linked to the major wildfires raging across Southern California. Pineda was arrested Wednesday after witnesses said they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside, police said. The fire was quickly extinguished. The witnesses followed Pineda to a nearby restaurant and called police, who arrested him. Pineda was expected to be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior Court Friday, Deputy District Attorney Steven Frankland said. He is charged with one count of arson of a structure or forest. Pineda is being held on $75,000 bail and faces up to six years in prison if convicted. In San Bernardino, east of Los Angeles, John Rund, of Hesperia, was arrested Wednesday on arson charges after a witness reported seeing him in brush near the starting point of a fire Tuesday, the sheriff's department said. That fire was quickly put out by passers-by. Investigators are trying to determine if Rund, 48, may have ties to other wildfires. He is being held on $750,000 bail. The San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office on Thursday filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail. In San Diego County, the sheriff's department this week arrested an adult and a juvenile allegedly seen by an anonymous tipster starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 11,675-acre Slide fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said. More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed in the past week by Southern California wildfires.",0
"Summary: Stiles described as ""survivalist type"" who carries a weapon. Mother has cooperated with police, sheriff says. Girl on tape, now 7, found safe with family. Tape shows man sexually abusing the girl 4 years ago. Article: A girl who was shown on a videotape being sexually assaulted in Las Vegas has been found and is safe, officials in Nye County, Nevada, said Friday. Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, is being sought as a suspect, police say. ""We have found the child, Madison. She's safe. The detectives say she is in good condition,"" Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said. The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, Detective David Boruchowitz said at a news conference Friday night. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, when De Meo asked them to stop showing the picture. ""The mother has cooperated with us,"" De Meo said. ""We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this young girl,"" he said. ""It was very sad for her to find this out."" A former Las Vegas animal trainer, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas. Watch what's known about Stiles ». Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said. Someone close to Stiles has told investigators that Stiles is a ""survivalist type"" and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said. De Meo addressed Stiles directly: ""Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency,"" he said. ""Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency."" The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said. Police, who had called Stiles a person of interest, began calling him a suspect late Friday. There appeared to be physical similarities between Stiles and the man in the videotape, De Meo said. ""Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through. Whoever this person is is a predator that, as far as I'm concerned, belongs in custody and, if successfully prosecuted, in jail for as long as the law allows,"" De Meo said earlier. Detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes, indicating she may have been brutalized before. Nevadan Darren Tuck recently gave police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, De Meo said. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who want to question him further -- have been unable to locate him. Tuck, who also allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible 10-years-to-life sentence for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, De Meo said. Harry Kuehn, Tuck's attorney, said this week on CNN's ""Nancy Grace"" that Tuck was ""racked by indecision"" about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. Asked why, Kuehn said, ""He's explained that to us, and at this point, we're not going to share that, because it goes to the defense of the matter."" ""You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had; He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Nye County; it was previously unsatisfactory,"" the attorney said.",0
"Summary: Frank Lloyd Wright wanted store magnate to sleep on porch. Salvador Dalí's stated ambitions were bigger than Napoleon's. Ayn Rand: Laughing at yourself same as ""spitting in your own face"" Article: They say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing. But not for these folks! Long before the Material Girl ordered papa to stop preaching, these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose. Alfred Hitchcock didn't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors. Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form. Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator. Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, ""Actors are cattle"" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: ""I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'"" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film ""The Lodger""), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career. Ayn Rand. The egotist's egotist, author Ayn Rand (born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum) is the patron saint of Thinking You're Better Than Everybody Else. Her most famous novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her self-spun Oscar-the-Grouch philosophy for success. Objectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shuns all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society. Rand's novels often focus on protagonists (invariably men) who are shunned by others because of their genius, but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant. Not surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as ""spitting in your own face."" So, just how much did Rand believe in her own philosophy? Let's just say a lot. With signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Orson Welles. When you create a cinematic masterpiece such as ""Citizen Kane"" at the ripe old age of 25, you're bound to get a big head. But Welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that. In fact, ""Citizen Kane"" might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego. After all, it's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst because Hearst slighted Welles at a dinner party. Of course, after the unparalleled success of ""Citizen Kane,"" Welles's arrogant side didn't get any less subtle. Do yourself a favor: Track down a recording of Welles' outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas. You'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker's oversized ego. A classic quote goes: ""In the depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?"" Frank Lloyd Wright. As the brains behind the Robie House, Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Guggenheim, and countless other design benchmarks, Frank Lloyd Wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture. And, boy, did he know it! Wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals. In fact, the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him. But when you're Wright, you're right. In 1935, department store magnate Stanley Marcus (of Neiman-Marcus fame) commissioned the architect to design his Dallas home, but the project quickly went sour. Wright's avant-garde floor plan included ""sleeping porches"" that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round. In addition, Marcus' small bedroom ""cubicles"" came equipped with almost no closet space. When Stanley respectfully explained that (a) temperatures during summer nights in Dallas often exceed 80 degrees and (b) a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets, Wright threw a series of tantrums. Fortunately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form. Preserved and occasionally displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art, they make for delicious reading. Salvador Dalí. ""Every morning when I awake, the greatest of joys is mine: that of being Salvador Dalí."" Yup, he actually said that. Everything about the legendary Surrealist painter (he of the melting clocks) -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock, destroy convention, cause scandal, and stir controversy. Criticized for choosing to live under General Franco's fascist government in Spain, Dalí defended his position by stating that he didn't care about others so long as he could be king. Not exactly a man of the people. If he wasn't getting enough attention, he was known to walk the streets of New York City clanging a hand bell. Of course, this is also the guy who once said, ""The thought of not being recognized [is] unbearable."" Need another telling quote? ""At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef. At the age of 7, I wanted to be Napoleon. My ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since."" Apparently, so did his ego. Al Jolson. Plenty of performers this side of Gallagher have been labeled ""the world's greatest entertainer."" But Al Jolson really, really believed it. The vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Lithuania, in what was then part of Imperial Russia. As a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, ad-libbing, or just stopping to talk to the audience. During a 1911 performance of the critically hated ""Paris is a Paradise for Coons"" (title not edited for political correctness), Jolson stopped and asked the audience if they'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play. The crowd roared with applause, and Jolson ditched the whole program and took over. From that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him. Unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list, however, Jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance. According to most contemporary accounts, he actually was the greatest in the world. But, despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Jolson's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface (considered highly offensive now, but pretty common at the time).

"Summary: BUPA was founded in 1947 in response to plans to establish the NHS. The company's biggest base is in the UK but has customers in three continents. BUPA care homes cater for a number of conditions, including Parkinson's. Article: BUPA is an international health and care company with bases on three continents and more than eight million customers. BUPA began as The British United Provident Association in 1947 to preserve freedom of choice in health care. It believed that with a National Health Service being introduced a year later, there would still be a need for a complimentary service enabling people from all walks of life to afford the benefits of choice in where, when and by whom they were treated. Led by the growing public demand for health care and a lack of quality private accommodation BUPA initiated the Nuffield Homes Charitable Trust - later renamed Nuffield Hospitals. BUPA's biggest and original business is health insurance in the UK, both for individuals and corporations that want to look after the health of their employees. More than half of the UK's top companies are BUPA customers. The company's UK care homes offer specialist care to residents who include the elderly, the mentally ill, young people with physical or learning disabilities and people with conditions such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.

"Summary: ""Heartbroken"" house owner's daughter among six survivors hospitalized. One survivor jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape. University of South Carolina mourns deaths of six students. Article: The owner of a North Carolina beach house where seven college students died in a weekend fire said Monday that his family's ""lives were just changed forever"" by the tragedy. Chip Auman said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. ""The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation,"" he said. Auman said the situation was ""hard to fathom."" ""There's just no words to describe what we've been going through,"" he said, asking for prayers for survivors and the families of those who died. ""We're numb, we're confused, we're heartbroken."" Two college campuses mourned Monday. Six University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Six other South Carolina students were able to get out of the house in time. The six were treated and released from nearby Brunswick Community Hospital, but Auman's daughter was hospitalized again in Hartsville, South Carolina. Authorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith said the house was ""engulfed"" in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after being notified. The flames shot into the sky and ultimately left little more than portions of the framing. Fire officials do not believe foul play was involved. Watch a neighbor's video, fears of fast-burning fire ». Dennis A. Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs for the University of South Carolina, said investigators have said it would be Tuesday or Wednesday before the identities of the victims are confirmed publicly. It could be as much as a month until investigators know the cause of the fire, Pruitt said. The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. He also said counselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates. The university president, Dr. Andrew Sorenson, contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the university community. Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. ""If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is South Carolina,"" Laura said at a Monday afternoon press conference. Fire survivor Tripp Wylie, a 20-year-old South Carolina sophomore, said he jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape the flames and was unable to get back in to help his friends. ""I could see a buddy of mine off to the left who had gotten out. He was just yelling at me to jump and stuff,"" Wylie told CNN affiliate WYFF. ""The smoke was pouring out, couldn't really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision. [I] just kind of leaned out the window and luckily I jumped far enough to make it into the canal."" Neighbors flocked to see the fire as firefighters battled and ultimately got the blaze under control. See the scenes of devastation ». George Smith, who lives across the street from the house, said he heard sirens between 6:30 and 7 a.m. and went outside to see ""the whole sky lit up."" ""The whole house was completely engulfed in flames, up to about 20 feet,"" he said. ""I have never seen [a fire] move so fast."" George Smith said the house's occupants were ""partying in there yesterday and into the night."" After about 10:30 p.m. Saturday they quieted down, he said. Linda Sing said she was walking her dog when she saw the fiery destruction. She noted that firefighters had saved an adjacent house by spraying it down with water. ""We knew there were people in there, but we hoped and prayed they'd gotten out,"" Sing said. ""This is the worst thing I've ever seen. We've had hurricanes, but this is worse."" Ocean Isle Beach is a popular resort destination along North Carolina's southern coast. The year-round population of the 7-mile-long island is about 425, but it swells to about 25,000 during the summer season, according to the town's Web site.",0
"Summary: UK intel chief says children as young as 15 involved in terrorist-related activity. Jonathan Evans: At least 2,000 people in Britain who pose threat to security. MI5 chief said the actual number could be double that. Article: The head of Britain's intelligence services has warned that children as young as 15 are becoming involved in terrorist-related activity. Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaeda-inspired terrorism. ""As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country. They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism,"" he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Manchester. Evans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double. He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks. The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan. However, he said in the last 12 months terrorist plots on British soil were increasingly inspired by al Qaeda cadres in other countries, including in Iraq and East Africa. ""There is no doubt now that al Qaeda in Iraq aspires to promote terrorist attacks outside Iraq. There is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in East Africa -- particularly in Somalia -- which is focused on the UK,"" he told the Society of Editors meeting. According to Evans, there had been ""no decrease"" in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War. He said that resources that could be devoted to counter-terrorism were instead being used to protect Britain against spying by Russia, China and others. ""A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense,"" he said.",0
"Summary: Navarrette: Opponents see Hispanic immigrants as weakening U.S. identity. One town demanded all library books be in English, Navarrette says. Hispanics the latest to find themselves at center of culture war. Article: You must know what's really driving the immigration debate. It's the culture, stupid. Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture. Immigration restrictionists -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so high-minded. Yet they can't help themselves. They always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants. The restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns: that our borders aren't secure, that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally, and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here. Really? If that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from taco trucks to Spanish-language billboards. That seems to be the issue in North Dakota, where, according to a recent article in USA Today, towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them. In Cooperstown, the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy, because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who? American kids who work at Starbucks? Nope. The article quotes Orville Tranby, a local community leader in Cooperstown, who says that some residents have told him ""face to face"" that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture. You'll find the same fear in Lewisburg, Tennessee. Not long ago, an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in Spanish. Townspeople wanted no part of that. They demanded that all books purchased by the library, or even donated, be in English-only. These stories are ridiculous, but they're also helpful. They illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration, and it goes well beyond words like ""legal"" or ""illegal."" It's the perception that the country is becoming more Hispanic, that Spanish is replacing English, that Hispanic immigrants are weakening American identity, and that Main Street is turning into Little Mexico. A leader of the vigilante Minuteman movement moronically called it the ""colonization"" of the United States. This sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy, that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners, and that our children are going to live in a world where they're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up. It conjures up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century, who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the English, but would ""swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours."" It popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were ""unassimilable,"" which led to Congress approving the explicitly-named Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. And it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge warned that immigrants (read: the Irish) were diluting ""the quality of (U.S.) citizenship"" and others complained that Italian immigrants were uneducated, low skilled, apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity. Where have we heard that before? And when will we hear it again? After all, Hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists. But they won't be the last.

"Summary: A Mauro Camoranesi goal earns Juventus a 1-1 draw with leaders Inter Milan. Argentine striker Julio Cruz had given injury-hit Inter the lead in the first half. The result maintains Inter's unbeaten record and moves them two points clear. Article: Mauro Camoranesi scored with 13 minutes left to earn Juventus a 1-1 home draw with Serie A leaders Inter Milan on Sunday. Julio Cruz is mobbed by team-mates after giving Inter the lead in their 1-1 draw at Juventus. Camoranesi picked up a headed knock-down from substitute Vincenzo Iaquinta before seeing his shot deflect off defender Walter Samuel to leave goalkeeper Julio Cesar helpless. Inter took a first-half lead when Argentine striker Julio Cruz broke Juve's offside trap and latched onto Brazilian midfielder Cesar's through ball before firing past Gianluigi Buffon. The result means Inter retain their unbeaten record this season, despite injury problems that saw the likes of Patrick Vieira, Francesco Toldo, Marco Materazzi and Dejan Stankovic ruled out. The defending champions are now two points clear of Fiorentina at the top of the table, with Roma a point further behind and Juventus in fourth place. Earlier in the day, Roma missed out on the chance to close the gap on Inter when a late collapse saw them throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Empoli. First half goals from French winger Ludovic Giuly and Matteo Brighi had put the visiting Romans in charge and for more than an hour they looked set to cruise to victory. But with 23 minutes remaining Ighli Vannucchi reduced the deficit and Sebastian Giovinco snatched an injury time equaliser to deny Luciano Spaletti's injury-depleted team. Siena snatched a share of the spoils from Parma in a 2-2 draw as Daniele Galloppa scored in the last minute while Napoli needed an injury time goal from striker Ezequiel Lavezzi to deny rock-bottom Reggina their first win of the season, forcing them to settle for a 1-1 draw in the south.",0
"Summary: Taliban militants kill Australian commando in southern Afghanistan. He was shot during operation to clear Taliban bomb making facility in Uruzgan. This is the fourth Australian soldier to die in the conflict in Afghanistan. Several militants killed and a coalition troop injured in other fighting in southeast. Article: One Australian soldier, three civilians and Taliban militants were killed early Friday during heavy fighting in southern Afghanistan, according to information from Australian and NATO officials. Four Australian troops have now died in the conflict in Afghanistan. The incident occurred in Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan province, where Taliban militants killed an Australian commando, the Australian Defence Ministry said. The 26-year-old commando -- Pvt. Luke Worsley of Sydney -- served with the Special Operations Task Group. This is the fourth Australian troop to die in the Afghan conflict. ""The action in which Private Worsley died only concluded in the last few hours and was characterized by heavy, close quarter fighting. The SOTG was conducting an operation to clear an identified Taliban bomb making facility in Uruzgan province, when the soldier was hit by small arms fire,"" Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said ""a significant number of Taliban insurgents were killed or captured as part of the operation. Taliban insurgents initiated the firefight which lasted several hours."" Gen. Carlos Branco, ISAF spokesman, said it is not known how the civilians, two women and a child, died. ""However, we do know that the insurgents fired upon ISAF soldiers from the compound in which the Afghan civilians (two women and one child) were found after the fight. ISAF makes all effort to prevent losses of innocent civilian lives.""",0
"Summary: Teen gunman is dead, Finnish police say. Eight people, including headmistress, shot at Finnish school, say police. Firearm bought legally last month, shooting began in school's lower lobby. Shooting appeared to have been planned in series of YouTube videos. Article: An 18-year-old authorities say shot eight people inside his high school in southern Finland, before turning the gun on himself, has died, police said. An image from a video posted on YouTube by ""Sturmgeist89."" The shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on Internet file-sharing site YouTube. At a news conference this afternoon, police confirmed the dead numbered two girls, five boys and the school's headmistress at Jokela High in Tuusula, a quiet town around 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Helsinki. Ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The shooter, whom police identified as Pekka Eric Auvinen, died at Toolo Hospital, authorities said. Police said he took his own life. It was the first school shooting in Finland since 1989, when a 14-year-old student shot and killed two others in the coastal town of Rauma, the Finnish news agency STT reported. Police said Auvinen is from Tuusula and who acted alone. He had no previous criminal record and had never threatened anyone from the school before, they added. Auvinen published a manifesto online demanding war on the ""weak-minded masses"" and pledged to die for his cause. Watch Auvinen fire weapons in video from his Web page ». YouTube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account, many of them featuring Nazi imagery, shortly after the incident. Finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the Web site, warning of a bloodbath at the school. A video posted earlier Wednesday, by ""Sturmgeist89,"" was titled ""Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007."" ""Sturmgeist89"" identified himself as Auvinen, and said he chose the name ""Sturmgeist"" because it means ""storm spirit"" in German. The video showed a picture of the school, which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Auvinen against a red background, pointing a gun at the screen. The clip is accompanied by the song ""Stray Bullet"" from rock band KMFDM. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, also cited that group's lyrics. Another short video clip, called ""Just Testing My Gun,"" showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun. He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area; the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit, and then a full-screen shot of him again. He waved at the camera and then walked out of view. The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing. As well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. Many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives. Throughout all of this, the single word ""DIE"" constantly flashed across the screen. Other video clips included Nazi-war-criminal footage. In the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is ""a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. ""I am prepared to fight and die for my cause,"" he wrote. ""I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection."" The police said at this afternoon's press conference that they had been fired at when they arrived at the school at 11.45 p.m. local time (9.45 a.m. GMT). They described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape. When the police's special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gunshot wound to his head. Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him. Several bodies were also found in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begun, they added. They could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors. Police also said that the gun Auvinen used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19. The legal age limit to own a gun in Finland is 18, which Auvinen passed in June of this year. He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun, police added, and practised sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range. Finland, which enjoys a strong tradition of hunting, has a high proportion of gun ownership, with two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million. The Associated Press reported comments from Kim Kiuru, one of the school's teachers, on radio station YLE. Kiuru described how the headmistress used the public address system around noon to tell pupils to stay in classrooms. He said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news. ""After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small-caliber handgun in his hand through the doors towards me, after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction, "" Kiuru said. The agency reported Kiuru as saying that he saw a woman's body as he fled the school, before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows. Copyright 2007 CNN.

"Summary: David Trezeguet omitted from France squad to play Morocco and the Ukraine. The Juventus striker last played for his country in the 1-0 defeat by Scotland. He was dropped for the wins against Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. Article: France coach Raymond Domenech has again omitted striker David Trezeguet from his squad for this month's friendly against Morocco and the Euro 2008 qualifier against the Ukraine. Happier times: David Trezeguet celebrates after scoring for Juventus against Torino. Trezeguet has scored scored 10 goals in 11 Serie A matches for Juventus this season -- including two hat-tricks -- but has failed to win his way back into the 24-man party. The 29-year-old, who last played for France in the 1-0 home defeat by Scotland in September, was furious after being dropped for the games against Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. He played no part as Domenech's team overtook the Scots at the top of Group B with comfortable victories last month. The coach said: ""David is having a great start to the season with Juventus, but he's in competition for a place. If we qualify, the Euro 2008 will be in eight months. A lot of things can happen in between. ""I hope David will help Juventus win the Italian league title and that he will be at the Euro 2008 with us, and that he will find his form again for France."" Domenech has again included young Lyon forward Hatem Ben Arfa, who made his debut as a substitute against the Faroes and scored the final goal in a 6-0 victory. Ben Arfa is joined in the squad by club-mate Karim Benzema, while Bolton's Nicholas Anelka is also among the forwards named despite still recovering from an injury. Captain Patrick Vieira is ruled out due to injury, but the Inter Milan midfielder will join up with the squad anyway. ""A player of Patrick's dimension is going to be missed, but we just have to accept it and get on with it. Pat should be coming to see us because he's a leader, and he's the captain,"" Domenech added. France face the Moroccans on November 16 and then travel to the Ukraine on November 21. Domenech's team will qualify for the finals if Italy beat Scotland at Hampden on November 17. If the Glasgow game ends in a draw, France will need at least a point in Kiev to book their ticket.

"Summary: Documents say after suicide attempt, Jeffs repeatedly banged head on cell wall. Transcripts say Jeffs confessed to ""immorality,"" said he is not ""the prophet"" Jeffs' attorneys say he has recanted statements. Jeffs due to be sentenced November 20 on accomplice to rape charge. Article: Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial, according to court documents unsealed by a Utah judge on Tuesday. Sect leader Warren Jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him September 25 in St. George, Utah. Jeffs, the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape. The documents, released by Fifth District Judge James Shumate at the request of the media, also indicate that Jeffs confessed to ""immorality"" with a ""sister"" and a daughter more than 30 years ago. Among the documents is a competency report on Jeffs completed in April, in which social worker Eric Nielsen wrote that throughout the month of January, Jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours. On January 28, the report said, he attempted to hang himself in his cell. In the days following the suicide attempt, while he was on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall. Jail transcripts show that Jeffs' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother, Nephi, in which he said, ""I am not the prophet. I never was the prophet, and I have been deceived by the powers of evil ... I ask for everyone's forgiveness."" Jeffs also told his brother: ""Farewell forever."" The day before that, Jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was ""covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when I was younger."" In the FLDS, members call adult women ""sister,"" and Jeffs' meaning was unclear. Jeffs' defense attorneys, who argued against the release of the documents, said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that Jeffs recanted them the following month. Defense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made. They presented Shumate with a letter from another Jeffs attorney, arguing that the statements' release could influence an Arizona jury when Jeffs stands trial in that state. Jeffs, 51, was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced November 20. The FLDS -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Jeffs, a former school headmaster, is the son of the sect's previous president and ""prophet,"" Rulon Jeffs, who died in 2002. Jeffs was on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in August 2006 outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Critics say that inside the FLDS, marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13, and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and young men. If male followers are excommunicated, critics claim, wives and children can be reassigned. During Jeffs' trial, defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting Jeffs because of his religious beliefs, including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven. If Jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the FLDS, it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect. However, two of his followers who spoke to CNN -- although FLDS members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements. ""He is a perfectly priestly man,"" said a woman who identified herself as Cathy. ""He is a man of God, and we will always love him. Once a prophet, always a prophet."" Her husband, Patrick, told CNN, ""It's hogwash. I don't believe it ... I will always consider him my prophet."" CNN's Gary Tuchman contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Lewis Hamilton fails to clinch world title after spinning out of the Chinese GP. Briton's lead cut to four points by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso. Alonso finished second in Shanghai behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. Article: Championship leader Lewis Hamilton spun out of the Chinese Grand Prix to send the world title race to a cliffhanger finale in Brazil on October 21. A disconsolate Lewis Hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in Shanghai. Rookie Hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race, but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso in Shanghai. The Spaniard finished second behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of Hamilton. The young Briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led Raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions. However, the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires, which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let Finland's Raikkonen take the lead. And when Hamilton -- who won in Japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane, he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go. Raikkonen and Alonso both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps, with the Finn going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both Hamilton and Alonso. Raikkone's team-mate Felipe Massa was third, while fourth place was claimed by Toro Rosso's Sebastien Vettel, who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in Japan behind the safety car while Hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing. Britain's Jenson Button was fifth in a Honda ahead of Vettel's team-mate Vitantonio Liuzzi, while Germany's Nick Heidfeld was seventh for BMW Sauber and David Coulthard of Scotland took the final point for Red Bull. Hamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season. ""I'm sorry for the team but I can still do it, don't worry,"" he said. ""When I got out of the car I was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year, and to do it on the way into the pits was not something I usually do. ""You cannot go through life without making mistakes. But I am over it and we look forward to Brazil. The team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there, and we still have points in the bag. ""We were having a great race and we didn't know if it was going to rain or not. The tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath. When I came into the pits it was like ice, I couldn't do anything about it."" McLaren boss Ron Dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off. ""It's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this. It has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another Grand Prix,"" Dennis said. ""I don't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did Lewis. But the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance. That's what made the difference. ""It was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier, but would it have made a difference? All the top teams -- Ferrari and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire."" Alonso, who qualified for the race in fourth, is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles. ""The result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure,"" he said. ""I think the championship will still be very difficult because I know it will not be easy to take four points from Lewis. ""I need something dramatic if I want to win. With a normal race it will be impossible."" Raikkonen added: ""We are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race. ""Hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend. It is not just up to us though, we saw today that anything can happen, but we are back in the championship.""",0
"Summary: Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa steers Bahrain's economic growth. Says Bahrain's strength is its ""human capital"" in the finance sector. Calls on world to unite to resolve nuclear dispute with Iran. Article: This week MME speaks to the man charged with boosting growth in the Kingdom of Bahrain: Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa. Sheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran is deterring potential investors. As chief executive of the Economic Development Board, one of Sheikh Mohammed's main tasks is to ensure Bahrain stays ahead of its competitors. The government's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdom's dependence on oil. But with crude prices near $100 a barrel, John Defterios asked whether the appetite for change had diminished. SM: The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity, so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to. And therefore, because of this aspirational aspect, trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we don't want to go. JD: How do you redefine Bahrain's role? Traditionally it's been a financial center, but you have Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai even Abu Dhabi emerging in financial services. How you redefine it to sustain a lead? SM: The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing, financial services are growing throughout the region. Bahrain's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain. JD: Strategically and a geopolitical question here: the Crown Prince came out and declared what Iran's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy, and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Iran to the country. What's the motivation here? SM: We feel that the distraction caused by the Iranian nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat of the region. Nobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this. JD: Historically, Iran has even made claims against Bahrain, what do you do now moving forward now? Do you bring Russia, China, the United States and the European Union closer together, in terms of where we should be going in the future? SM: We've resolved our historical issue with Iran, and we are well beyond that, but going forward... This is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved because it does affect everybody. JD: Can the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward? SM: Absolutely, I mean, the GCC is speaking with a unified voice. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came out with a proposal for providing nuclear fuel from an independent authority; this was completely backed from the GCC. We are all moving forward and are willing to play a beneficial role to resolve this issue. Meet the Sheikh:. Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board, the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy. He was appointed in June 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defense Force and Chairman of the Economic Development Board. From 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Crown Prince's office. In 1999, he was appointed head of the court and also deputy head of the Crown Prince's International Scholarship Program. During this time, Sheikh Mohammed was heavily involved with the Crown Prince's initiatives to liberalize the telecommunications sector and with labor market and economic reforms. A keen motor sports enthusiast, Sheikh Mohammed was deputy board chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit and is a former vice president of the Bahrain Motor Club, now known as the Bahrain Motor Federation. Sheikh Mohammed, who is married with two sons and one daughter, was born on April 14, 1969. In 1992, he received a bachelor's degree in economic theory from the American University, Washington DC.

"Summary: Two bombs explode in Algerian capital near government and U.N. buildings. Algeria blames group linked to al Qaeda. Official death toll is 26, but some sources say as high as 76. U.N. officials say five of its staff killed and 14 missing. Article: Rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the United Nations headquarters in Algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building's facade and leveled nearby U.N. offices. Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building. It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. The death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed. Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility. CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups. In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi. It said two trucks were filled with ""no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives."" The group called the operation ""another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France."" At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. ""Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works,"" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters. Watch his full interview. He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. ""It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers,"" he said. In a strongly worded statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called ""an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner."" ""The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community,"" Ban said in the written statement. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. ""I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car,"" he said. Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers. She said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state. Zerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets. Algeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest. Although the country has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence.",0
"Summary: Lionel Messi scores for the sixth game in a row as Barca defeat Atletico 3-0. Real Madrid stay top of the Primera Liga table after defeating Recreativo 2-0. Sevilla's crisis continues as they lose their four league match in succession. Article: Lionel Messi scored for the sixth game in a row as Barcelona defeated big-spending Atletico Madrid 3-0 to stay in touch with Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid. Messi (left) is congratulated by Ronaldinho after scoring again in Barcelona's 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid. Barcelona had thumped Atletico 6-0 on their own ground last season and the visitors were out for revenge -- but conceded twice in four minutes. After 15 minutes, Italian goalkeeper Christian Abbiati let a routine Messi cross slip out of his hands and Deco rolled home into the empty net. Four minutes later Messi played a great one-two with Ronaldinho and rifled a shot past Abbiati for his sixth goal of the season and Xavi added a third late on. ""It was a deserved victory against a rival that we have had problems with in the past,"" explained Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. ""We scored twice in quick succession and then we controlled the match using aggression and with the team attacking and defending as a unit."" ""Conceding two early goals inside four minutes is not easy to turn around especially against Barcelona,"" admitted Atletico coach Javier Aguirre. It was Barcelona's fourth straight league win but they still trail Real Madrid by two points after the champions beat Recreativo Huleva 2-0. Dutch international Ruud van Nistelrooy, the league's top-scorer last season, scored on 72 minutes before Gonzalo Higuain netted in the final minute to keep Real at the summit. Luck deserted them when Wesley Sneijder hit the post but Van Nistelrooy scored in the final quarter hour before Higuain struck to keep them two points clear at the top. Real have made their best start since 1991 but coach Bernd Schuster's rotation policy has been questioned with the German chopping and changing his team. ""It was an important victory because it is the final match before we go away on international duty,"" said Dutch winger Arjen Robben. ""We are now top for the next two weeks and can build on that when we return."" Villarreal, now four points behind Real, lost for only the second time in 15 matches with a 3-2 reverse against Osasuna. Sevilla, third last season, are in a crisis after losing their fourth league game in a row with a goal from Riki handing Deportivo La Coruna a surprise 1-0 win. Sevilla have just six points from their first six matches and are 13 points behind Real. Levante's Abel Resino became the first Spanish league coach to be sacked this season, after their 3-0 home loss to Real Zaragoza.. The 47-year-old Resino, a former goalkeeper at Atletico Madrid, joined Levante in January as a replacement for Juan Ramon Lopez Caro. The Valencia-based club are bottom of the table with only a point from seven matches.",0
"Summary: Re-designed Fuji Speedway to host its first Japanese Grand Prix since 1977. Suzuka to alternate with Fuji from 2009. Computer models used to prepare teams for the unfamiliar circuit. Article: There are some circuits that are cornerstones of the Formula 1 calendar: the Monacos and Silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers. Then there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins. Fuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view. Next week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn't seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout). The Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies. The Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji. However an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that. Behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout. The redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia. So how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation. Computer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself. Despite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time. BMW Sauber's simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum. The circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance). Then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car. ""In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance,"" says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team. Dieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains:. ""You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions. ""Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried."" One peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends. ""You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip,"" says Glass, ""and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed."" The testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities:. ""Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values,"" says Rampf. Not that everything can be predicted: ""I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race,"" continues Glass. ""Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy.""",0
"Summary: AC Milan's Brazilian goalkeeper Dida is suspended by UEFA for two matches. Dida was banned for his over-reacting to being touched by a Celtic supporter. Celtic have been fined $50,800 for allowing the fan to run onto the field of play. Article: Celtic have been fined $50,800 by UEFA and AC Milan's Dida has been banned for two matches after the incident which saw a pitch-invading supporter approach the Brazilian goalkeeper in last week's Champions League match at Celtic Park. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in UEFA suspending him for two matches. The incident occurred when the Scottish side beat Milan 2-1 in Glasgow. A fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute, soon after the home side scored their winning goal, and made what appeared to be minimal contact with Dida. The Milan goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the ground. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but Celtic may choose not to complain about their own punishment, with half of their fine suspended for two years. UEFA did have the power to change the result of the match, although that was always unlikely. UEFA's control and disciplinary body found Celtic guilty of charges of ""lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters"", while Dida was found to have breached UEFA's ""principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship"". Milan have pledged to appeal against the punishment, which as it stands means he will miss the club's Champions League games against Shakhtar Donetsk. ""It's a suspension that is absolutely excessive,"" said Milan lawyer Leandro Cantamessa. ""It seems to us a very, very unbalanced sentence. It turns Dida into the protagonist of the incident, whereas the protagonist was someone else, and that's not right from a logical point of view."" Celtic acted swiftly to punish the 27-year-old supporter, who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month. The club banned the fan for life from all their matches, home and away. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said: ""As a club we feel this penalty is proportionate to the incident in question and a fair outcome.""",0
"Summary: White House accuses Democrats of holding hostage funding for veterans care. Funding was attached to large health-labor-education bill. White House says it wants a clean bill that only funds veterans programs. Democrats call on White House to engage in a dialogue on spending levels. Article: The White House is blasting Congressional Democrats for not sending a bill that would fund veterans' care programs to the president's desk by Veterans Day. The White House's Dana Perino accused Democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage. ""There's absolutely no reason that the veterans' bill could not have been signed by the president today, except for the political games that the Democrats decided to play with it,"" White House press secretary Dana Perino said Sunday in Crawford, Texas. Congressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education. Democrats also added $3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs. The labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The House passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president. Perino accused the Democrats of ""trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes."" ""The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fund the veterans,"" Perino said. On Saturday, the Democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to President Bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending, sayings disagreements over funding levels ""have never been so great that we cannot reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the American people."" ""Key to this dialogue, however, is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in the letter. The leadership said last year's Congress, which was still under Republican control, had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs. Congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14, the leadership said. The current funding level ""is still below the $3.9 billion extra that we passed,"" said Nadeam Elshami, spokesman Pelosi. ""We are committed to getting the extra funding that the Congress already voted on the president's desk for his signature."" The leadership blamed Republican members of Congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill. Perino, though, said the Democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of Congress. ""The Democrats decided not to send the president this bill,"" Perino said. ""That has to be laid at their feet."" CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Three Austin cave explorers are safe and are out of the cave, officials said. The University of Texas students went into Airman's Cave Saturday. The 12,000 foot long cave complex has tight twists and turns. Unclear exactly how the students lost their way, but cave is complex, official said. Article: Muddy but unhurt, three University of Texas students emerged from a cramped cave complex in Austin, Texas, after a day-long search Sunday. A rescuer at the entrance to Airman's Cave in Austin, Texas, Sunday. Lt. Matt Cox, an Austin Fire Department spokesman, said the students -- two women and one man -- were reported missing early Sunday after a trip into Airman's Cave, about four miles south of the university's campus. They were found about halfway down the 12,000-foot-long cave, which has few spaces big enough for an adult to stand upright and is explored primarily by experienced spelunkers. The students were located shortly before 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), about 30 hours after they entered. Their names were not released Sunday night. A friend called 911 to report them missing at 5 a.m. The group had told friends to call 911 if they were not back by midnight Sunday, according to Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services. Earlier reports that four students were in the cave were incorrect, Cox said. Authorities did not know Sunday evening why the students were in the cave for so long. But Cox said it would have been easy even for experienced cavers to get lost in Airman's, which he compared to the roots of a tree. ""There are so many ways to go,"" he said.",0
"Summary: Laura Bush calls on Myanmar junta to ""step aside,"" allow for a democracy. Military leaders must give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people, she says. Junta should release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders, she says. Her rare foray into foreign policy was published in the Wall Street Journal. Article: U.S. first lady Laura Bush -- in a rare foray into foreign policy -- called on Myanmar's military junta to ""step aside,"" give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people and allow for a democratic Myanmar in a commentary published in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. U.S. first lady Laura Bush said the junta ""should step aside to make way for a unified Burma."" ""Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime,"" Bush said. ""They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma [Myanmar] governed by legitimate leaders. ""The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition -- there is room for a professional military in a democratic Burma,"" Bush said, in keeping with the U.S. policy of still using Myanmar's former name. In Wednesday's commentary, Bush called on Myanmar's military leaders to release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. ""Meanwhile, the world watches -- and waits,"" Bush warns. ""We know that Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies have the advantage of violent force. But Ms. Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders have moral legitimacy, the support of the Burmese people and the support of the world. ""The regime's position grows weaker by the day. The generals' choice is clear: The time for a free Burma is now."" The humanitarian rights situation in Myanmar has been a cause for the first lady in the past few months as the crisis there worsened. Myanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- under an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released. The official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks. On Tuesday morning, Bush received a phone call from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari. A representative of the secretary general said the call was a follow-up to a conversation they had weeks ago. Gambari met last week with the military junta leadership as well as with Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Yangon. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters that Laura Bush and her husband's administration believe that there is a ""need to start preparing for transition"" for Myanmar. ""We believe it is very important that progress be made and prisoners be released and conditions for Aun Sung Suu Kyi be improved [so] that she can prepare for participation for negotiations for a transition,"" he said.",0
"Summary: Bush says most of Congress ""acting like a teenager with a new credit card"" Bill would have funded agencies, but also a prison museum, sailing school. House panel chairman: Bush's veto ""not responsible and not credible"" Democrats to schedule override vote, but Bush GOP allies confident about veto. Article: President Bush vetoed a $600 billion spending bill Tuesday, accusing Democratic leaders of wasting money and plotting tax increases, then took his budget fight with Congress on the road. Congress should cut spending ""and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,"" President Bush said. ""The majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility, but so far, it's acting like a teenager with a new credit card,"" he said in a speech in New Albany, Indiana. The bill -- which Bush said was laden with $10 billion in ""pork"" -- would have funded the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. It also would have funded projects such as a prison museum, a sailing school and a program to teach Portuguese. ""Congress needs to cut out that pork, reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,"" the president said. Watch a report on the veto ». While polls show Bush's popularity remains at near-record lows, Congress ranks even lower as a whole. The president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the Democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fund the government for the 2008 budget year, which began October 1. The bill Bush vetoed Tuesday includes about $150 billion to run those departments and more than $450 billion in mandatory spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor, according to the House Appropriations Committee. The committee's chairman, Rep. David Obey, called Bush's veto ""not responsible and not credible."" ""This is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 Republicans,"" Obey, D-Wisconsin, said in a statement issued after the veto. ""There has been virtually no criticism of its contents. It is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics."" Bush said Democrats are supporting $22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases. ""When the bill for all that spending comes due, Congress is going to turn to the working people, to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs,"" he said. Tuesday's veto is the fifth cast since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. Congress has overridden one of those, voting last week to authorize $23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president's objections. Democrats will schedule another override vote this week, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. But Antonia Ferrier, spokeswoman for House Republican Whip Roy Blunt, said Bush's GOP allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto. Bush signed a $470 billion Pentagon spending bill that covers the Defense Department's normal operations, but Democrats split $50 billion in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan off into a ""bridge fund"" to which they plan to attach demands for Bush to withdraw U.S. combat troops. The measure sets up another confrontation with the White House. Bush also demanded Congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes, but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue. He said a plan proposed by Rep. Charles Rangel, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to eliminate the tax was unacceptable. ""Preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas,"" he said. ""Congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the AMT relief to my desk as soon as possible."" The elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $800 billion to be lost over 10 years. To replace that, Rangel's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $100,000, after deductions, and close corporate tax loopholes. The bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers. Republicans have already started calling it ""the mother of all tax increases."" ""With all the other pressures on our economy, raising taxes is one of the most unwise things Congress could possibly do,"" Bush said. Bush acknowledged the difficulties Americans face from high fuel prices, a ""challenged"" housing market and ""uncertainty"" in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- ""but as we have seen in recent years, this economy is resilient, and that's important for the American people to understand.""

"Summary: France lock Sebastien Chabal cited for a dangerous tackle on Simon Shaw. Chabal faces disciplinary hearing on Monday after incident against England. Sale forward will miss the third and fourth-place play-off is he is suspended. Article: France lock Sebastien Chabal has been cited for a dangerous tackle on England's Simon Shaw during Saturday's World Cup semifinal in Paris. Simon Shaw offloads despite being tackled by Raphael Ibanez, left, and Sebastien Chabal. The Sale Sharks forward will face a disciplinary hearing on Monday after his tackle on opposite second-rower Shaw was noted by citing commissioner Dennis Wheelahan. Chabal started the match on the substitutes' bench, but was brought on in the 26th minute to replace the injured Fabien Pelous during hosts France's 14-9 defeat. If he is suspended, then Chabal will miss Friday's third and fourth-place play-off match at the Parc des Princes. Meanwhile, France coach Bernard Laporte said that the defeat was tougher to take than England's 24-7 win in the 2003 semifinals. ""In 2003, they were better then us. In fact they were better than everyone,"" said Laporte, who is leaving his role to take up the post of junior sports minister in the French government. ""They were like the New Zealand of this tournament - the favorite, except they went all the way. This time it's harder because yesterday it was 50-50."" Meanwhile, England -- seeking to become the first nation to defend the World Cup title -- revealed that star kicker Jonny Wilkinson again had problems with the match balls during the semifinal. The fly-half, who voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Australia, rejected a ball before kicking a vital three-pointer against France. ""We didn't say it last week but a non-match ball got onto the field in Marseille which Jonny kicked,"" director of rugby Rob Andrew said. ""He didn't think about it while he was kicking it. ""The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they had 'World Cup semi-final England vs France' written on them. On match night, Jonny was vigilant when kicking for goal that they were actually match balls he was kicking. ""The practice balls lose pressure and shape. The whole issue last week, the organizers accepted all six match balls should be used by both sides on the Thursday before game.""",0
"Summary: Some witnesses say Colorado does nothing to protect them. One witness spent over 10,000 dollars on security after being terrorized. Community activist says Colorado's witness protection program is ""a joke"" Article: A Colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $10,000 on a security system, hired a bodyguard for his son's wedding and never leaves home without a .45-caliber handgun strapped to his chest. Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become ""almost epidemic,"" according to the Denver Post. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorado's witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, ""All they told us was maybe we should move."" ""I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the details."" the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN. After Reynolds' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail. Watch witness describe fear of being targeted ». Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. However, it is likely he'll be released within five years. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year. The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness. That figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture. The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection. One possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. ""It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses,"" according to Peter Weir, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Colorado's witness protection program is a ""joke,"" according to The Rev. Leon Kelly, founder and executive director of the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives. Kelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. More than a decade ago, a young man named Darryl Givens asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison. Givens chose to testify. A few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends. That day continues to haunt Kelly. Rhonda Fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son's murder. Javad Fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married. He had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. Javad Fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in Aurora, Colorado. The couple, both 22, died instantly. Rhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. Fields told CNN, ""I asked them what happened. Why weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life? And I was told he never asked for any protection."" Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. ""I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness,"" she said. Field's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields' personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents. ""I felt like the DA's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life,"" Rhonda Fields told CNN. District Attorney Carol Chambers maintains the program has improved. She says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena, ensuring witnesses are aware of their options. That didn't start, however, until two years after Javad Fields was killed.",0
"Summary: Jury shown new footage of Diana taken hours before her death. Diana and Dodi Fayed inquest jury to hear ""scene setting"" evidence. On Tuesday coroner outlined controversial claims, published new images. Court will make final decision on what happened in car crash 10 years ago. Article: Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate ""one way or the other"" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear ""intimate"" details of her personal life. Watch footage of Diana's last hours ». Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear ""scene setting"" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family ""could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,"" referring to Diana's son Prince William. ""I'm hoping for justice,"" Al Fayed said outside court. ""At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family."" Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. ""You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,"" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. ""The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died."" Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash.",0
"Summary: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham: ""I am astounded"" by comments. Sanchez, a retired former coalition commander in Iraq, called war ""nightmare"" Republican Sen. John McCain wishes Sanchez would have spoken up earlier. Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell said Sanchez is simply wrong. Article: Republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination Sunday to blistering criticism of the Iraq war from former coalition commander retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez. Lawmakers lashed back at retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort. On Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war ""a nightmare with no end in sight."" He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame. Speaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accountable. ""I'm astounded, really,"" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN's ""Late Edition"" with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday. Graham, who recently returned from Baghdad, said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain had visited Sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004. ""Every time we talked to Gen. Sanchez, we got pushback -- we have enough troops; Guard and reserves aren't being strained,"" Graham said. He added that Sanchez's own record in Iraq is blemished: Abu Ghraib ""got out of control under his watch. The war in general got out of control under his watch."" But Graham said that ""finally,"" with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, ""We are getting it right."" Sanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their ""lust for power."" Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired. ""While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,"" he said. That brought a tart response from McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time,"" McCain told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but ""unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often."" One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, McCain said. Shinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC's ""This Week"" that Sanchez is simply wrong. ""My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror,"" he said. ""I think we're making significant progress toward that end."" But, he added, ""I think the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment. They've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for."" Graham said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will ""step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year."" If that does not happen, he said, ""it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Iraq."" That brought a blistering response from Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter. ""What is this? This is a colony,"" he said. ""That's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter."" Even those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence, Brzezinski said. Though some countries are willing to go along with the United States, ""No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq,"" he said. In his Friday speech, Sanchez added that the ""surge"" of U.S. troops into Iraq represents ""a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war."" National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment. Instead, she said, ""We appreciate his service to the country. As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, there's more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq. And that's what we're focused on now."" Gen. David Petraeus is the U.S. top commander in Iraq. Ryan Crocker is the U.S. ambassador to Iraq.",0
"Summary: YouTube questions address taxes, the Bible, abortion, gun control. Giuliani, Romney, Huckabee spar over immigration. McCain challenges Paul over suggestion to bring troops home from Iraq. Nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate; 2,000 more than Democratic debate. Article: The acrimony from the Republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN/YouTube GOP presidential debate Wednesday. The debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. With five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season, the Republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all, trying to differentiate their views on immigration, the Iraq war, abortion, gun control and even whether they believed every word in the Bible was true. Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Wednesday night's attacks were launched at each other. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month. Romney attacked Giuliani's record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegal immigration. And Giuliani shot back, accusing Romney of having a ""sanctuary mansion"" at his own home. Watch the debate format produce raw moments ». ""In his case, there were six sanctuary cities. He did nothing about them. There was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home, illegal immigrants were being employed,"" Giuliani said. Romney denied Giuliani's allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other. In his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has been rising in the polls. Rep. Tom Tancredo, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take, saying the other candidates were trying to ""out-Tancredo"" him. Huckabee drew one of the night's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the Internal Revenue Service. ""Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging, and there's a reason why,"" he said. Sen. John McCain, freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep. Ron Paul, the most anti-war of the candidates, tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war. Did YouTubers get their questions answered? ». Asked which government programs they would cut, Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save ""a trillion dollars."" McCain said: ""It's that kind of isolationism that caused World War II,"" which drew some hoots from the crowd. Watch McCain, Paul spar on Iraq ». Paul replied: ""The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?"" A retired brigadier general, Keith Kerr, who is gay, asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops. CNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters. Watch Kerr deny that the Clinton campaign influenced his question ». David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate, said, ""We regret this incident. CNN would not have used the general's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate."" Political Ticker. Kerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself. Kerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian Republican grass-roots organization. Prior to the debate, CNN had verified Kerr's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate. In a section of the debate about gun ownership rights, three of the GOP presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns: McCain, Giuliani and Romney. Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson quipped, ""I own a couple of guns -- but I'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are."" Watch the candidates address gun control ». The debate turned personal when a viewer, holding the Bible, asked: ""Do you believe every word of this book? And I mean specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand."" Huckabee, a Baptist minister, said, ""Sure, I believe the Bible is exactly what it is."" Giuliani said he believes the Bible, but not ""literally true in every respect."" After that, Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word. Watch the candidates get personal about the Bible ». ""Yeah, the Bible is the word of God. ... I might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word, but I read the Bible and I believe the Bible is the word of God,"" Romney said. When asked about abortion, Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts. ""If people in this country are looking for someone who's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, they're going to have to find somebody else. On abortion, I was wrong,"" he said. His remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by Thompson's campaign, which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs. Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen. Ted Kennedy. When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal, Paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government. ""We don't need a federal abortion police, that's the last thing we need,"" Paul said. He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities. On the issues of taxes, Thompson said he'd ""never met a tax he liked."" ""I've got a tax-cut bill on the table. But I don't do pledges to anybody but the American people,"" he said. His response was met by a ""Go, Fred, go!"" from a member of the audience. On the issue of trade with China, Rep. Duncan Hunter said China is ""cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of the United States to stop China's cheating. Buy American this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job."" The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site, just as Democratic White House candidates did in July. The debate was the first time the GOP candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. CNN's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the Democrats' debate.",0
"Summary: More than 1,000 freed detainees reportedly keep pledge not to rejoin insurgency. U.S. general tries to reassure Sunnis that detainees face no abuse. More than 80 percent of detainees are Sunnis. U.S. airstrike kills 13 suspected terrorists west of Baghdad. Article: None of the 1,000-plus Iraqi detainees freed in recent weeks have broken a pledge not to return to the insurgency, according to the Marine general who oversees the U.S. detention centers in Iraq. A U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad. Speaking in Arabic, Maj. Gen. Doug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. Stone described the detention system as ""open and transparent,"" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government. ""This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,"" Stone said. ""I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces."" Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Stone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. ""There are no secrets that go on in detention,"" Stone said. ""Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world."" See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls ». By the time of their release, ""detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,"" he said. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said.

"Summary: Mary Winkler convicted earlier this year of shooting her husband to death. Winkler served time and was released; the couple had three children. The children live with their grandparents, who oppose visitation. Winkler has not seen her children in 15 months. Article: The Tennessee Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to modify or overturn a lower court's ruling allowing Mary Winkler, convicted of killing her minister husband, visitation rights with the couple's three daughters. Holding baby Brianna, Mary Winkler stands next to Matthew. In the foreground are Mary Alice and Patricia. Charles and Diane Winkler, parents of slain minister Matthew Winkler, had asked the court to intervene and either revoke Mary Winkler's visitation rights or allow them to proceed only under supervision of a counselor. The children -- Patricia, Mary Alice and Brianna -- have been living with their grandparents since their mother was arrested last year. Winkler has not seen the children in 15 months, said Kay Farese Turner, her attorney. She said her client was ""absolutely elated about the news and believes this will be her best Christmas ever."" Turner said she believes the visit may come before Christmas. A jury convicted Winkler earlier this year of voluntary manslaughter in the shotgun death of Matthew Winkler -- not the first-degree murder conviction prosecutors had wanted. She said the slaying came after years of abuse, including physical violence and being forced to dress ""slutty"" for undesirable sex acts. Winkler received a three-year sentence, but a judge required her to serve only 210 days, gave her credit for the five months she had already served and allowed her to serve the remaining 60 days in a mental health facility. She was released in August. At the time of their father's death in March 2006, Patricia was 8, Mary Alice was 6 and Brianna was 1. Charles and Diane Winkler have moved to terminate Mary Winkler's rights and have filed a $2 million wrongful death suit against her for their son's slaying. The termination issue has not been decided in court. Turner said the court may want to determine what, if any, bond Winkler has with her children before making a decision. Attempts by CNN to contact attorneys for the Winklers were not immediately successful Wednesday. In September, a lower court granted Winkler visitation with her daughters pending the outcome of the custody battle. The court specified the visits be supervised by a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the children's interests and supervised by members of the couple Winkler is living with or by her sister. A subsequent appeal by the grandparents was denied, leading to their Supreme Court appeal. The Winklers said if their former daughter-in-law got visitation with the children at all, it should be under the supervision of a professional counselor. At a September hearing, according to court documents, they said the children ""exhibit fear and confusion"" toward their mother ""and her role in their father's death."" One expert, in testimony, quoted Patricia as saying her mother had killed her father and, ""I don't know if she will kill me. I want to ask her if she would do that to me. It scares me, kind of; if she did, well, I guess I would see my father."" The Winklers also said that after telephone calls with their mother, the children experienced ""urination accidents, sleeping problems, graphic nightmares and sleepwalking."" They said the lower court erred by failing to appoint the guardian ad litem until after the September hearing. Turner, however, said she believes terminating Winkler's parental rights would not be in the children's best interest. ""She has a faith rarely seen, and she loves those children,"" Turner said. After Matthew Winkler's death, Winkler fled with the girls to the Alabama coast, where she was arrested. She said during a September appearance on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" that she never expected to get away with killing her husband, but that she fled to be with her daughters and ""have some good times."" CNN's Rusty Dornin contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: GEO-TV president: ""It seemed very obvious that they were going to do this"" Order comes on the request of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. GEO-TV and ARY Digital offer varied programming, including news. Both networks transmit from the United Arab Emirates. Article: Two Pakistani television networks that transmit from Dubai in United Arab Emirates were ordered off the air Friday at the request of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, officials from the networks said. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has been under pressure to lift a state of emergency. GEO-TV and ARY Digital offer a variety of programming, including news, entertainment, sports and music. Both networks had been banned from Pakistan's cable television system -- along with other networks, including CNN and BBC -- since Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3. This latest action prevents the two Pakistani networks from broadcasting worldwide via satellite. ""This was basically our window to the world, GEO President Imran Aslan said. ""In Pakistan, we've been shut down since the 3rd."" The action was not wholly unexpected, but surprising nevertheless, Aslan said. ""We uplink from Dubai, never having had a license to uplink from Pakistan,"" he said. ""Dubai is a media city which seemed to be a haven and a sanctuary."" Aslan said network officials have been in discussions with Pakistani government officials and ""it seemed very obvious that they were going to do this. We were ready for it to a certain extent."" ""Eventually they decided to put their feet on the pipe, as it were."" The government has made numerous demands of the network, although none of them official, Aslan said. ""It's done through intermediaries,"" he said. ""[Dulling] down the content, not having certain anchors, some of the hosts of our programs and talk shows."" Musharraf's emergency order put several restrictions on the media, preventing journalists from expressing opinions prejudicial to ""the ideology ... or integrity of Pakistan."" Journalists are also restricted from covering suicide bombings and militant activity and could face three-year jail terms if they ""ridicule"" members of the government or armed forces. Almost a dozen journalists have been arrested. Musharraf has denied that his restrictions bar criticism, saying they only ask for responsibility in reporting. But last week, Pakistan expelled three print journalists for using language in an editorial that a Pakistani official called offensive to Musharraf. The editorial criticized Musharraf and the United States and Britain for continuing to support him. While many Pakistani journalists have protested the restrictions, some smaller television channels have complied with the government's restrictions. GEO and ARY have refused. ""It seems most of the other channels have kowtowed in order to survive,"" Aslan said. Musharraf has said the emergency order improves stability and will foster peaceful parliamentary elections, which he has said he would like to see take place before January 9. The exact date will be set by Pakistan's Election Commission. Opposition leaders have accused Musharraf of declaring emergency rule to keep his hold on power and avoid an expected court ruling that would have nullified his election victory in October.",0
"Summary: Fire Department spokesman: 14 have been taken to area hospitals. Firefighters still fighting hot spots Wednesday afternoon, official says. ""It's a hellish inferno,"" he tells reporters. Article: Four people were killed and several injured after an explosion Wednesday at a chemical plant sent a thick plume of smoke over a section of Jacksonville, authorities said. A thick plume of smoke rises Wednesday at a chemical plant in Jacksonville, Florida. ""Literally, it's a hellish inferno. There is no other way to describe it,"" said Fire Department spokesman Tom Francis. Fourteen people were hospitalized after the blast at the T2 Lab on Faye Road, in an industrial area on the waterfront in north Jacksonville, Francis said. Officials initially ordered an evacuation of nearby businesses, but by 4 p.m. the order had been lifted after tests of the air found no toxicity, Francis said. Firefighters were still battling hot spots, and the effort will be going on for ""quite some time,"" he said. See an I-Report account about the blast ». Six of those injured were transported to Shands Hospital in Jacksonville, hospital spokeswoman Kelly Brockmeier said. A Shands official said the hospital incident command system had been activated -- something done to put the staff in high alert in anticipation of trauma patients. A woman who answered the T2 Lab's 24-hour facility emergency phone said the plant manufactures ecotane, a gasoline additive that reduces tailpipe emissions, according to the laboratory's Web site. See a map of the site of the explosion ». The billowing black smoke could be seen from the city's downtown, said Florida Times-Union reporter Bridget Murphy. Murphy said she talked to several workers as they walked out of the area, and they were ""shaken to the core."" ""They described a hissing noise and then a sound wave,"" she said. Antonio Padrigan was trying to get in touch with his son, who works in a plant in the area, but was having no luck reaching him on his cell phone. ""He was shook up when he called me, but I can't get through to him anymore,"" Padrigan said. ""I don't know if he's in the hospital or what."" CNN I-Reporters Jonathan Payne and his son Calvin, 16, shot pictures of the explosion. They felt the blast shake their home, about 15 minutes away, and went to see what was going on. Carlton Higginbotham, 63, was working at home on Townsend Boulevard in Jacksonville when a loud boom shook his house, he said. ""It was a gunshot-type explosion; it wasn't a rumble,"" he said. Higginbotham, an insurance salesman, and his neighbor ran outside and noticed thick smoke billowing from the other side of the St. Johns River, which separates his neighborhood from the site of the blast. ""The cloud that came out of it was white, some would say mushroom-shaped,"" Higginbotham said. ""It was followed by dark, dark smoke.""",0
"Summary: Nasser al Ansari is CEO of Qatari Diar, Qatar's state-owned investment group. Its global projects are part of nation's attempt to diversify investment portfolio. Investment also aims to bring expertise and jobs to neighboring countries. Article: Nasser al Ansari is the CEO of Qatari Diar, a state-owned real estate investment company. Famous for its purchase of London's Chelsea Barracks, Qatari Diar was established in 2004 by the Qatar Investment Authority, to support Qatar's growing economy and to co-ordinate the country's real estate development priorities. It is now valued at $1 billion with 18 projects underway. Al Ansari is a graduate from the University of Miami and was responsible for high profile projects such as New Doha International Airport and the promotion of private sector investment through public sector privatization. Before being appointed as CEO of Qatari Diar, Al Ansari was at the office of the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs as technical advisor. He joins us on MME to talk about the vision for Qatar, how Qatari Diar fits into it and its investments outside Gulf in Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Egypt and Europe. With oil prices hitting $88 this week, John Defterios begins by asking Nasser al Ansari about the differences he sees now compared to the 1970s when oil prices were also high. Any lessons learned? Nasser al Ansari: I believe so. In the 1970s, local government here did not deal in a very sophisticated way with this wealth. But now we are fortunate with a high level of education and the reformations in government policies in this region. We now understand how to utilize this wealth and economical growth. JD: I don't think most people know that you sit on one of the largest natural gas fields in the world and will likely be the largest exporter by 2010. This must give you great cushion to expand the Qatari Diar model. NA: Although we have this and we are fortunate with this, Qatar has adopted a policy to diversify its portfolio from its natural resources to other investment opportunities and one of them is Qatari Diar. We are investing a lot in real estate, not just in Qatar but worldwide. JD: In fact very close in the neighborhood as well. It's almost foreign policy strategy to invest in the poorer countries in the region. Is this to help the neighborhood develop alongside Qatar? NA: I think with the knowledge and know-how that we have gained in this area of expertise, we would like to export it to other countries to help their economical reformations; to try to create business opportunities for their local businessmen and to create job opportunities for the people in that particular country. JD: It's quite a radical departure say from the International Monetary Fund or World Bank giving loans or grants for development. This is turning the world upside down in your region, it is not? NA: Yes, I would like to assure you at Qatari Diar we are not in the business of lending. JD: You want a hard return. NA: We want return but we always think of the people when we are investing in these countries. I mean we want to make sure that the investment we are making is there for the long-term. Qatari Diar has a policy: it's a long-term policy not short-term. JD: Give me some insight on why Qatari Diar feels as comfortable in London with Chelsea Barracks as in Cuba, for example, with some of the projects you're undertaking. What makes you think you can pull that off? NA: I think with the expertise that we have and with the strength that we have, we would like to showcase the strength of the people of Qatar and we want to pull the flag of the state of Qatar even across the Atlantic and we are determined to do so. We are a small country but with big ideas.",0
"Summary: Death Penalty Information Center: 42 people have been put to death this year. That's down 57 percent from 1999 level, when 98 inmates were executed. Figure partly due to states questioning the constitutionality of lethal injection. Texas leads the nation in executions this year, according to DPIC. Article: A day after New Jersey banned executions, newly released figures show that capital punishment dropped this year to a 13-year low. The Supreme Court will hold oral arguments January 7 about the constitutionality of lethal injection protocols. Forty-two people have been put to death this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a Washington-based group that opposes the practice. That figure is down 57 percent from what it was in 1999, when 98 inmates were executed. Next year's figures are expected to drop further. The Supreme Court is to hold oral arguments January 7 about whether lethal injection protocols in 36 of the 37 states with the death penalty are constitutional. See how the rates have dropped ». The justices placed a moratorium on executions in late September, when they decided to review a Kentucky case about whether the three-drug lethal ""cocktail"" of chemicals represents ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" since it may cause excruciating pain to inmates unable to express discomfort. Stays of executions have been issued in several states until the larger constitutional issues are addressed. If the high court finds the procedures unconstitutional, it could take years before death-penalty states would meet legal standards necessary to resume lethal injection. And even if the method is declared acceptable, it would be months before new execution dates could be set. Ten states carried out executions this year. Outside the South, Arizona, South Dakota, Indiana, and Ohio together subjected six men to lethal injection. Learn about states' death penalty policies and statistics ». Texas continues to lead the nation, with 62 percent of executions nationwide this year. Overall, 86 percent this year were in the South. No more executions are scheduled this year. ""The death penalty has been in a period of decline for many years,"" said Richard Dieter, executive director of DPIC. ""Two thousand seven will be known as the year executions came to a temporary halt and as the year of concrete legislation reconsidering the death penalty."" Death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the South have been reluctant to impose the punishment, even in the face of rising big-city crime rates. ""I think the main problem is that the death penalty is not being imposed often enough in those urban jurisdictions,"" said Kent Scheidegger of the Sacramento-based Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. ""I think people of the cities are not getting the quality of justice that people elsewhere receive. I think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted."" New Jersey's legislature voted last week to outlaw the death penalty -- the first state to do so in 42 years -- and Gov. Jon Corzine signed the measure into law Monday. At the same time, he commuted the sentences of the eight men on the state's death row. The move was largely symbolic, since no executions have occurred there since 1963. Similar bills in Nebraska, New Mexico and Montana failed this year in the legislature. State lawmakers in Maryland, Colorado, North Carolina, Tennessee and California are also considering abolishing the death penalty, but no bills have been introduced. The Supreme Court on January 4 will decide whether to review an appeal from Louisiana inmate Patrick Kennedy, sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The state's high court upheld the punishment as appropriate. The justices in 1976 banned capital punishment for rape, but 19 years later, Louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12. State lawmakers distinguished the earlier high court case as pertaining only to ""adult women.""",0
"Summary: Zenit Saint Petersburg clinch the Russian Premier League title on Sunday. They secure the title ahead of Spartak Moscow after a 1-0 win at Ramenskoye. The title success is Zenit's first since 1984 and the first in the post-Soviet era. Article: Zenit Saint Petersburg have clinched their first Russian title in the post-Soviet Union era with a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Ramenskoye on Sunday. Zenit captain Anatoly Timoshuk kisses the Russian Premier League trophy after their victory at Ramenskoye. The win means Zenit finish top of the table with 61 points, two points ahead of second-placed Spartak Moscow, who beat city rivals Dynamo 2-1. CKSA Moscow finished third on 53 points. Zenit went ahead in the 15th minute when Radek Sirl's shot from the edge of the box deflected off a Ramenskoye defender and beat goalkeeper Antonin Kinski. After the interval, the hosts poured forward seeking an equalizer and created several chances -- but Zenit held firm to secure their first championship since 1984 and make a hero out of Dutch coach Dick Advocaat. Nine-times champions Spartak took the lead midway through the first-half. Russian international striker Roman Pavyuchenko netted the opening goal in the 24th minute with a powerful shot from the edge of the six-yard box after a mix- up in the Dynamo defence. Brazilian striker Soares Welliton made it 2-0 seven minutes after halftime, heading home Pavlyuchenko's precise cross. Dynamo reduced the arrears in the 71st minute, when Spartak midfielder Radoslav Kovac scored an own goal. Meanwhile, Rostov and Krasnodar were relegated fronm the Premier League.",0
"Summary: Scottish league leaders Celtic held 1-1 at home by managerless Hibernian. Celtic now lead by three points, having taken just six from last five games. Second-placed Rangers have three games in hand ahead of trip to Aberdeen. Article: Scottish Premier League leaders Celtic suffered another setback in their bid for a third successive title after being held 1-1 by managerless Hibernian on Saturday. David Murphy's goals have earned Hibernian four points against the Auld Firm this season. Gordon Strachan's team head the table by three points from Glasgow rivals Rangers, who have three games in hand ahead of Sunday's trip to Aberdeen. Visiting Hibernian, whose manager John Collins surprisingly resigned on Thursday citing a lack of financial backing from the Edinburgh side's board, took the lead in the 20th minute through left-back David Murphy. The Englishman played a one-two with Abdessalam Benjelloun before crashing a shot from the edge of the box past goalkeeper Mark Brown and in off the crossbar. Murphy's only other goal this season came in Hibs' 1-0 win at Rangers on October 6. Brown did well to keep out Merouane Zemmama's audacious shot from just inside the Celtic half soon after, and also tipped over Brian Kerr's looping header three minutes after half-time. Substitute Jiri Jarosik rescued Celtic from a first home SPL defeat this season in the 78th minute after being teed up by Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, who then headed against the post with two minutes to play. Hibernian held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men, after Benjelloun was stretchered off with their three substitutes already used. The victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place, while Celtic have taken just six points from the last five games. Strachan, who confirmed he is hoping to sign Brazilian defender Coelho next month, said: ""We need to cut out the silly mistakes because if you look at some of the goals we have let in away from home this season, they are silly mistakes. ""We could have definitely done something with every one of them. I'm happy with the number of chance we've made in the last few weeks, but unhappy with individual mistakes. ""It's not been great to look at, and we need to cut it out. We have honest lads walking in to the dressing room and saying, 'That was my fault.' ""I said to them, 'It's very commendable lads but we can't keep doing this.' There has been a lot going right for us, but one or two things going wrong. We have to deal with that, and then I will look forward to the rest of the season."" Third-placed Motherwell missed the chance to move above Rangers after being beaten 3-0 at home by Falkirk, who climbed to ninth with two goals in the second half to Michael Higdon and then another from Patrick Clegg on 65 minutes. Fourth-placed Dundee United failed to take advantage, losing 2-1 at home to bottom club Gretna -- whose only two wins this season have come against the Tangerines. Kenny Deuchar put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute before striker Noel Hunt leveled on 29, and Nicky Deverdics scored the eventual winner for the Borders outfit three minutes before half-time. Inverness Caledonian Thistle followed up last weekend's shock 3-2 victory against Celtic by also winning at Hearts by the same scoreline. The visitors led through Russell Duncan after 22 minutes and John Rankin made it 2-0 with a 53rd-minute penalty before Christophe Berra pulled one back on 62 and Lithuanian striker Andrius Velicka leveled from the spot (90). However, Graham Bayne scored a dramatic injury-time winner to lift Caley into the top six. In Saturday's other game, second-bottom St Mirren drew 0-0 at home to fellow strugglers Kilmarnock to be left seven points ahead of Gretna.",0
"Summary: Some see connection between the Bible and Interstate 35. Believers pray by the side of the highway, which runs through six states. I-35 runs from southern Texas to northern Minnesota. Article: If you turn to the Bible -- Isaiah Chapter 35, Verse 8 -- you will see a passage that in part says, ""A highway shall be there, and a road, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness."" Churchgoers in six states have held prayer sessions along the side of Interstate 35. Now, is it possible that this ""highway"" mentioned in Chapter 35 is actually Interstate 35 that runs through six U.S. states, from southern Texas to northern Minnesota? Some Christians have faith that is indeed the case. It was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to Texas, the southernmost state in the I-35 corridor, to do a story about a prayer campaign called ""Light the Highway."" Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35, but the prayers are still continuing. Some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I-35 being the ""holy"" highway, it needs some intensive prayer first. So we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Christians prayed on the the interstate's shoulder in Dallas. They chanted loudly and vibrantly, making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on. They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would ""see the light"" and perhaps close down. They prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate. They prayed that all Americans would accept Jesus into their lives. Watch believers offer prayers ». The woman who came up with the concept of ""Light the Highway"" is a Texas minister named Cindy Jacobs. She says she can't be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after ""once again reading Isaiah, Chapter 35."" Jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history, such as the bridge collapse on I-35 in Minneapolis last August and the assassination of JFK 44 years ago near I-35 in Dallas. That's why prayer certainly can't hurt, she adds. Now, it's only fair to say most people, the religious and the non-religious alike, don't buy any of this, but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along I-35. At an adult go-go club, the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others. And he says his club holds fundraisers, food drives and toy drives to help the community. But on the side of the road, the prayerful aren't going to change their minds. Holy highways and nude clubs, they believe, are not a combination God has in mind.",0
"Summary: Venezuelan government hikes taxes on alcohol and cigarettes Monday. Ten percent price increase on alcohol and 20 percent increase on cigarettes. Stores near schools, churches and cultural centers cannot sell alcohol. Chavez plans to increase taxes on luxury goods, including Hummers. Article: The price of sin rose Monday in Venezuela where President Hugo Chavez is on a campaign to make Venezuelans cut back on drinking and smoking. ""Everyone's shocked,"" said Leonora Marino, owner of Bodegon Marino in Valencia, Venezuela, west of Caracas. On Monday evening, she was still changing the prices in her store as her customers looked on and complained, she told a reporter. Alcohol is now 10 percent more expensive; cigarettes are 20 percent pricier. ""Really, it's difficult to buy at these prices,"" she said, then joked, ""They say they're going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking."" The Venezuelan government is placing a higher tax on alcohol and cigarettes in an effort to cut consumption and prevent what it views as the social, economic and moral consequences of drinking and smoking, said Jose Vielma Mora, superintendent of Seniat, the government body that oversees the collection of taxes. Taxes on whiskey, brandy, cognac and other drinks that don't come from cane sugar have been raised $1.79 (3,838 bolivares) per liter, the government-run Bolivarian News Agency said. ""It's unfair because, in the end, the consumer is the one who pays,"" said Fernando Fernandez, a liquor exporter. Chavez has described whiskey as a drink for rich people, not for revolutionaries. ""We cannot be spending the international reserves of this country on whiskey,"" he said. The moves represent the first steps toward transforming each Venezuelan into what Chavez calls ""the new man."" Chavez has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara as an example of how to lead a more pure life. In April, Chavez told a graduating class of medical students in Caracas, Venezuela, that the level of consumption of alcohol in the country represents a threat to public health and ought to make residents feel ashamed, according to an ABN report. ""The vice causes much harm, not only to individuals, but to the collective health of the nation,"" said Chavez, who said the dangers result in an increase in car wrecks and domestic violence. For his part, he has said he drinks too much coffee. Also effective Monday, stores near schools, churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol. Taxes on cigarette imports have also increased, from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price. On the street, some people said they don't understand the motivations for the increase, but predicted their consumption would not change. ""The Venezuelan is not going to stop drinking or smoking,"" said one person. Chavez also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as Hummers, which are imported privately and at great expense. There is no Hummer dealership in the country. Higher oil prices in recent years have translated into higher consumption in petroleum-rich Venezuela. Last year, car sales increased by about 70 percent, according to the CIA World Factbook. But Chavez, who was in Cuba on Monday visiting communist leader Fidel Castro, said he wants to focus less on material goals for Venezuela's 27 million people, 38 percent of whom live in poverty.

"Summary: Experts gather at CNN's first Fit Nation Summit to propose obesity solutions. Former President Clinton: Without obesity solution, nation risks ""collapse"" Motivating youngsters, removing shame, embarrassment called key. Experts: Removing trans fats, finding healthy replacements also critical. Article: Obesity is the No. 1 health crisis in the United States, and the nation could be at risk without immediate action, former President Clinton said at CNN's first Fit Nation Summit. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and former President Clinton lead the discussion at the first Fit Nation Summit. ""We need to do something about it for our children, and for our country, because something like this could easily collapse our nation if we don't act now,"" Clinton said. Clinton and CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, gathered with experts from across the country Wednesday to explore solutions to America's obesity crisis. Two-thirds of adult Americans are overweight or obese; the same is true for one-third of U.S. children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity carries increased risk of myriad health problems, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. Gupta, Clinton and a panel of experts addressed such proposed solutions as healthy school lunches, elimination of trans fats, the need for healthier food in urban communities and the importance of supporting community-based efforts to fight obesity. Watch Gupta explain the solutions proposed at the Fit Nation Summit ». Clinton, who's been tackling the obesity issue over the past few years with his Alliance for a Healthier Generation, stressed the need to help educate people about the importance of a healthy diet and exercising together. Motivating Americans, especially kids, won't be easy, Clinton said. ""They need to be handled with care. Kids need to know it's important, but [fitness] can't be boring,"" he said. ""There's no shame, there's no embarrassment. We have to let them know it's all good, but you have to do it."" Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a strong advocate against trans fats in foods, stressed that the Food and Drug Administration should ban trans fats altogether and stop leaving it up to local and state governments. Trans fats, at one time, thought to be good fat substitutes, over the years have been shown to raise LDL or bad cholesterol in people and lower their HDL, or good cholesterol. ""They're just not good for our health, Jacobson said. However, Dr. Robert Eckel, former president of the American Heart Association, warned, ""Although we support the removal of trans fats, our biggest concern is what they'll be replaced with. We need to think about that, because there will be a substitute."" The panel took questions from an audience of 150 people -- mostly obesity experts or those who work in industries that deal with obesity. Gupta was inspired to launch Fit Nation, an ongoing, multiplatform, grass-roots initiative against obesity. Over the past three years, Gupta and the CNN Medical Unit have crisscrossed the country, asking Americans to take charge of their weight by exercising more and eating healthier. This year, Gupta traveled from Michigan to California asking the public to pledge to add 1 million hours to their collective lives by getting off the couch and exercising. Since he began the tour in April, the campaign has surpassed its goal, with exercise pledges close to four times that amount. Gupta said he hopes that legislators and administrators who can make a difference in policy and perhaps change attitudes about obesity will hear the solutions discussed at the summit. ""I''ve covered a lot of stories on obesity,"" Gupta said. ""There's a battle going on, and we need to win the battle. I've talked to people out there and many are just blasé. ""This is our opportunity to make them care.""",0
"Summary: Yuvraj Singh becomes first player to hit six sixes in an over in Twenty20 game. Singh hits 58 in 16 deliveries as India beat England by 18 runs in Durban. England already eliminated from World Twenty20 after South Africa beat NZ. Article: India's Yuvraj Singh smashed six sixes in one over as England crashed out of cricket's World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa on Wednesday. Yuvraj Singh smashes his sixth successive six off England fast bowler Stuart Broad. Paul Collingwood's side were eliminated at the Super Eights stage after South Africa earlier beat New Zealand by six wickets in Durban. England then lost by 18 runs to the Singh-inspired Indians, who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of Thursday's must-win clash with the hosts. Singh reached the fastest 50 in Twenty20 history, needing just 12 deliveries, as India made 218-4. The left-hander's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by Stuart Broad made him the first player to do so in Twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket. South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs performed the feat at the 50-over World Cup in the West Indies earlier this year, while Sir Garfield Sobers and Ravi Shastri achieved it in first-class matches. Singh's innings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from Andrew Flintoff to captain Collingwood at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over, in which he also cleared the boundary ropes once. Virender Sehwag top-scored with 68 off 52 balls, putting on 136 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir, who hit 58 off 41 deliveries. Broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs, while fellow seamer Chris Tremlett took 2-45. In reply, England battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs. Opener Vikram Solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls, and Kevin Pietersen hit 39 off 23 deliveries, but no-one could match the fireworks provided by Singh. Left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs, while Rudra Pratap Singh took 2-28. If India can beat South Africa, it would create a three-way tie and require net run-rates to decide the two teams going through. The Proteas have two wins from two Group E outings after beating New Zealand, who have completed their Super Eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat. South Africa restricted the Black Caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on Wednesday, then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as Justin Kemp made an unbeaten 89. Kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical Mark Gillespie for the winning runs. He belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball innings, having come to the crease in the fourth over with South Africa reeling at 17-2. Kemp added 28 in four overs with Gibbs (19) before putting on another 65 in eight overs with Mark Boucher. Boucher departed for 23, caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Gillespie, who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs. The experienced Shaun Pollock then joined Kemp, and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the Proteas to their second victory. The in-form Craig McMillan top-scored for the Kiwis, hitting an unbeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in Tuesday's five-run win against England. McCullum had put on 68 for the first wicket with Lou Vincent, scoring 38 before becoming the first of Morne Morkel's four victims. Morkel, who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs, then removed Ross Taylor (1) two runs later and later bowled the dangerous Jacob Oram for a quickfire 15. He had Shane Bond caught by Boucher, and then almost became the first Twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled Gillespie -- was declared a no-ball by umpire Billy Doctrove.",0
"Summary: Suspect's ex-girlfriend: ""I've had my share of nightmares"" Chester Arthur Stiles to make his initial court appearance Friday. Stiles, 37, arrested following a routine traffic stop. Suspect said ""I'm Chester Stiles. ... I'm sick of running,"" according to officer. Article: The man arrested for the videotaped rape of a toddler in Las Vegas, Nevada, will make his initial appearance in court Friday, a Clark County, Nevada, court official told CNN Tuesday. Authorities have not yet decided if Chester Arthur Stiles will appear in person or via video link. The judge will set a date for the arraignment at that hearing. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. ""I've had my share of nightmares,"" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a ""weapons enthusiast"" with only a minor criminal record. Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos ». ""How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,"" Thomas said. The judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present, Clark County court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said. Stiles was already being sought on an unrelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child under 14, Sommermeyer said, adding that authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 counts related to the videotaped rape, including sexual assault and attempted sexual assault. Jerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. Henderson Police Officer Mike Dye said he pulled over Stiles' car Monday night because it did not have a license plate and became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired California driver's license with a photo that did not look like him. Dye said he and another officer, Mike Gower, questioned Stiles until he admitted his identity. ""He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles. I'm the guy you're looking for,'"" Dye said. ""At that time, he said, 'I'm sick of running.'"" Dye said Stiles was calm and cooperative. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and booked into the jail in Clark County, where he had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The tape was given to authorities by Darren Tuck, who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over. Because of the delay, during which Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others, he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography. He turned himself in to authorities in Nye County, Nevada, earlier this month. Professionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found, and she appears to be ""healthy and fine and happy,"" her mother's attorney said this month. The mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month, Donohue said. ""A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,' "" Donohue said. Donohue said the mother recognized Stiles, a former animal trainer. The alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work, Donohue said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is ""mortified"" by the allegations against him. ""He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,"" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Sailor's wife could be deported while he's overseas. Sailor: ""Defending the country that's trying to kick my family out"" is tough. U.S. military doesn't have overall policy to handle such situations. Wife: ""We just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else"" Article: Eduardo Gonzalez, a petty officer second class with the U.S. Navy, is about to be deployed overseas for a third time. Making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back. Mildred and Eduardo Gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported. His wife faces deportation to Guatemala -- her home country that she hasn't seen since 1989. He also doesn't know what would happen to his young son, Eduardo Jr., if that happens. ""I like being in uniform and serving my country, but if she goes back I'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job,"" he said. ""Defending the country that's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind."" Gonzalez, who works on helicopters that bring cargo, supplies and military personnel in and out of Iraq, testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel last month, detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his, where military members' families could be deported while they're defending their country overseas. Watch ""they're tearing families apart"" ». ""I want to serve my country 100 percent. But with this issue in the back of my mind, I feel I can't do that,"" he testified on September 6. The U.S. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases. Each is handled case-by-case, not by the military, but by immigration authorities. The government doesn't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar to Gonzalez's. Immigration officials also said marrying a U.S. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to U.S. citizenship or permanent legal status. Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves who teaches immigration law at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. ""You got to understand. When you're in a combat zone, you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy. You can't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you're never going to see them again,"" she said. Stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases. On the one hand, the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance, housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas. On the other hand, the same government is trying to deport the very same people. ""What's happening right now is, because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws, we've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home,"" she said. In Gonzalez's case, his wife, Mildred, came to the United States with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old. They were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from Guatemala. In September 2000, Mildred's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application. Her mother was granted legal status in July 2004, according to Gonzalez. However, six weeks earlier, Gonzalez and Mildred got married, canceling Mildred's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21. As a result, her legal status still remains in jeopardy. A judge in June granted her a one-year extension to remain in the United States. If her legal status does not change by June 8, 2008, she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation. That's just fine, according to Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration. ""What you're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces, and that's just outrageous,"" he said. ""What we're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military. ... There's no justification for that kind of policy."" Gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified. ""I'm trying to make his country better -- my country better -- and it should be her country too."" Gonzalez himself entered the country legally, crossing the Mexican border with his family when he was about 10. He joined the Navy as a so-called ""green-card sailor"" and became a U.S. citizen in July 2005. The military does accept some immigrants who aren't U.S. citizens. ""I understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained, but on the other token, there are times when the situation is just out of their reach,"" Gonzalez said. His wife, Mildred, added, ""We didn't come here to break the law. We just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else."" U.S. Army Sgt. Emmanuel Woko, a member of the Army's 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division who faces his third tour in Iraq, understands just how Gonzalez and his family feel. His wife and children could be sent back to Nigeria. ""My heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to Nigeria while I am deployed in Iraq,"" he said. ""I am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought."" That's a sentiment echoed by Gonzalez: ""We are not asking for anything. We are just asking for our families to stay with us.""

"Summary: One dead as hundreds of thousands flee rising floodwaters. About 80 percent of the city of Villahermosa is under water. Tabasco and Chiapas states hardest hit. Authorities say 700,000 affected and 300,000 still trapped by flooding. Article: Heavy rains and flooding have forced hundreds of thousands of people from homes in southern Mexico's state of Tabasco over the past four days, with nearly as many trapped by the rising waters, state officials said Thursday. Officials say about 300,000 people are still trapped by the worst flooding in the region for 50 years. The Grijalva River pushed over its banks through the state capital of Villahermosa on Thursday, forcing government workers to evacuate and leaving up to 80 percent of the city flooded, Gov. Andres Granier's office told CNN. About 700,000 people have seen their homes flooded, with about 300,000 of those still trapped there, Granier's office reported. One death had been blamed on the floods, which followed weeks of heavy rain in the largely swampy state. Tabasco borders Guatemala to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the north. The Associated Press reported that thousands of people clung to rooftops, huddled inside waterlogged homes or hunkered down in shelters in an attempt to survive the worst flooding the region has seen in 50 years. Weather forecasters predicted more rain in the coming days. The flooding was not related to Tropical Storm Noel, which was pounding the Caribbean. The Grijalva River, one of two large waterways ringing Villahermosa, has risen 6.5 feet (2 meters) above its ""critical"" level and gushed into the city's center, according to AP. Authorities said some of the rivers were continuing to rise. President Felipe Calderon visited the area on Wednesday and promised the federal government's full support.

"Summary: Study finds opium makes up half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product. Agency pushes NATO forces to attack skyrocketing problem aggressively. Drugs funds insurgency; poppy trade unchecked in Taliban strongholds. U.N. drug chief advocates providing income alternative for poppy farmers. Article: The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy. Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007. The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. ""Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,"" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. ""Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source."" James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. ""We share the U.N.'s concerns,"" Appathurai told CNN. ""Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation."" He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. ""The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,"" Appathurai said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. ""Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,"" the U.N. drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. ""You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,"" he said.",0
"Summary: David Nalbandian won Madrid Masters after beating top seed Roger Federer. The Argentine triumphed 1-6 6-3 6-3 against the Swiss defending champion. He became third man to beat world's three top players en route to a title. Article: David Nalbandian battled back to stun world No. 1 Roger Federer with a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory in the final of the Madrid Masters on Sunday. David Nalbandian celebrates after upsetting Roger Federer in the Madrid Masters final. The Argentine, ranked 25th in the world, repeated his 2005 upset win over the Swiss star in that year's season-ending Masters Cup -- also an indoor event. Defending champion Federer, playing in his first tournament since winning the U.S. Open six weeks ago, made 38 unforced errors. Nalbandian became only the third player -- and the second this year after Novak Djokovic in Montreal in August -- to beat the world's top-three players en route to winning a title. German legend Boris Becker was the first to perform the feat 13 years ago. Nalbandian ousted second-ranked Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals and then Serbian Djokovic in Saturday's semis. The 25-year-old, who lost in the Madrid final in 2004, claimed his first triumph on the ATP Tour since May, 2006, on clay in Portugal. He spent a year without a coach, but has revived his career since teaming up with Hernan Gumy. ""I'm extremely contented to beat the world number one,"" Nalbandian said. ""Roger and I have a long history and I think that influenced the match. ""It was an extremely hard first set. But I tightened the teeth and I began to play more strongly. Things came out fine, I played incredible, and that of course that helps."" Federer added: ""He served well, I was quite surprised with how well he served. ""He came back strong and played well in the end. ""He was a better player all in all. I was struggling after the first set to play aggressively, for some reason. He played tough and didn't miss any more. I couldn't play way I wanted to. It was a pity, he played a great tournament.""",0
"Summary: Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 in South American qualifier for 2010 World Cup. Juan Roman Riquelme nets twice as Argentina win third successive match. Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez quits after 5-1 loss against Paraguay. Article: Juan Roman Riquelme scored twice as Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 to notch a third successive victory in the South American qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup on Saturday. Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi to cap off a match in which captain Javier Zanetti made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Argentina. Argentina next travel to Colombia on Tuesday, when winless Bolivia have an away clash with Venezuela. In other South American qualifiers, Colombia beat Venezuela 1-0, and Paraguay routed Ecuador 5-1. Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez, a Colombian, quit after his team's loss saying: ""I have taken the irrevocable decision to resign.""",0
"Summary: John Edwards calls for immediate withdrawal of 40,000-50,000 troops. Sen. Hillary Clinton says withdrawal of 30,000 troops by July ""too little, too late"" Sen. Barack Obama calls for an immediate start to troop withdrawals. Article: Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday criticized President Bush's plan to withdraw roughly 30,000 troops from Iraq by next summer, with Sen. Hillary Clinton labeling it ""too little, too late."" Sen. Hillary Clinton listens as Gen. David Petraeus testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. In an open letter to Bush, Clinton said the troop withdrawal ""is simply too little, too late, and unacceptable to this Congress, and to the American people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home, and end this war."" Bush on Thursday is expected to endorse the recommendations of Gen. David Petraeus that the troop levels in Iraq be lowered to 130,000 by July, down from the ""surge"" level of 160,000. ""As commander in chief, you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, and to bring so many more troops home so much faster,"" the New York Democrat said. ""I strongly urge you to choose this course of action."" In an interview Wednesday with CNN, one of Clinton's chief rivals for the 2008 nomination, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, said the president is returning to an earlier, failed policy. ""We now are still in the same position as we essentially were in June 2006,"" he said. ""We are in the same levels of violence; we are at the same levels of dysfunctional when it comes to the government in Iraq, and the American people at some point have a right to ask from their leadership in Washington and from the president: When is enough enough?"" Watch '08 Dems weigh in on war in Iraq ». Obama presented a new plan for Iraq on Wednesday afternoon in Clinton, Iowa. It calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month, to be completed by the end of next year, according to excerpts released before his speech. A brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers. Obama recommended a new constitutional convention for Iraq, a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the country's humanitarian crisis. ""Let me be clear: There is no military solution in Iraq, and there never was. The best way to protect our security and to pressure Iraq's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops,"" Obama said in his speech. Presidential candidate John Edwards, who has been pressing congressional Democrats to take a more confrontational stance against President Bush, called for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops. In a prepared statement, Edwards, a Democrat from North Carolina, said Obama, Clinton and Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who recently called for a withdrawal to begin by Christmas, have ""a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster, to force the president to change course."" Edwards also called Obama's plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the president's plan. ""Sen. Obama would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year,"" said Edwards, ""which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer."" In a statement, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Connecticut, said Wednesday that it was useless to debate tactics when ""the underlying policy is a complete failure."" ""I call on my colleagues to do what needs to be done to end our involvement in this civil war and help restore our national security by clearly and directly declaring that they will not support any Iraq measure without a firm, enforceable deadline tied to funding for the completion of redeployment of troops from Iraq,"" Dodd said. Democrats lack the votes in Congress to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position. Congressional Democratic leaders are meeting with Republican lawmakers, who want a change in war policy but are unwilling to cut funding or set a timeline for withdrawal. Privately, congressional Democrats concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in Iraq. The Democratic presidential candidates, particularly the five in Congress, face pressure from liberal groups such as MoveOn.org demanding that they directly confront the president. Obama said it was unlikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline. ""You know, we are going to have to evaluate what's available, but it appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise, short of Congress forcing him to accept a shorter timetable, and, absent that, we are essentially engaging in a bunch of symbolic action there,"" Obama told CNN. ""What we need is a clear message from the Congress that it is time for us to change course, and it's time for us to do that,"" he said. CNN's John King, Dana Bash, Scott Anderson and Xuan Thai contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: ""Inspiring Impressionism"" looks at Old Masters, other influences on modern art. Featured are works of Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, Cassatt, Morisot. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" runs through January 31, 2008, at the High Museum. Denver Art Museum and Seattle Art Museum get the show next. Article: It is an irony of contemporary art-museum management: Sometimes the museum that creates an exhibition doesn't get to premiere it. In a treatment of a Bridgeman Art Library photo, the High shows visitors Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery."" This is the case this week, as Atlanta's High Museum of Art couples its public opening of a second year of Louvre-fueled shows from Paris, France, with an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" is organized by the Denver Art Museum. It opened Tuesday at the High, to run there through January 2008. With the backing of Northern Trust, the show will then travel to Denver February 23 to May 25, 2008, and then on to the Seattle Art Museum from June 19 to September 21, 2008. Why not start in Denver? That museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year Louvre Atlanta series of exhibitions. Like priceless dominos falling, these shows roll around the country and the world, globalization dictating galas, super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest winners. See a gallery of images from 'Inspiring Impressionism' at the High Museum of Art ». Another unintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another. It should be interesting to learn whether showing ""Inspiring Impressionism"" at the High on the same time frame as the second year of Louvre Atlanta pays off. Do all the boats in Monet's ""Autumn on the Seine, Argenteuil"" float? Smart museum-goers will see it all. ""The Louvre and the Ancient World"" and the companion show ""The Eye of Josephine,"" after all, look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvre's vast holdings. See a gallery of some of the highlights of the Louvre Atlanta shows ». The fit is comfortable, in a way, the Impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in French artists. The emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne. One very distinctive connection from the Louvre Atlanta opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at the Louvre, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's ""The Beggar Boy"" of around 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in Western art's modern history. From the outset, visitors to ""Inspiring Impressionism"" are reminded of the Louvre treasures all around them at the High: The Impressionism show's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of Louis Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery at the Louvre"" from between 1850 and 1870. In that original painting and color lithograph that followed, Arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the Louvre's chief exhibition space that runs along the Seine in Paris. In fact, even older-era echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at Louvre Atlanta's ""The Tiber"" marble from the first century A.D., you're reminded that Michelangelo himself was aware of that piece, influenced by it, presumably inspired by it. So a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums (the Louvre, the High, Denver, Seattle), the viewers of art in Europe and the United States, and the artists themselves in France, in the U.S. and elsewhere. High director Michael Shapiro calls these synchronicities ""visual evidence of connections."" His colleagues Timothy Standring of Denver and Ann Dumas of London, England, have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions, glimpses of Old World craft from Titian and Velasquez to Fragonard and Rubens -- and the ""moderns"" who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate. Don't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High. Degas may have said it most honestly: ""No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters."" Joining Northern trust Corporation in funding the exhibition are the National Endowment for the Humanities, and support is also provided by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.",0
"Summary: Nemanja Vidic plays in Man United's Champions League tie at Dynamo Kiev. Serbian defender sat out 4-1 win at Aston Villa with after-effects of concussion. United started group campaign with wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma. Article: Serbian central defender Nemanja Vidic has convinced Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson that he should play in Tuesday's Champions League clash away to Dynamo Kiev. Vidic clashes with Roma goalkeeper Gianluca Curci during the UEFA Champions League Group F match. The former Spartak Moscow player sat out Saturday's 4-1 victory at Aston Villa after suffering concussion during the Premier League win over Wigan immediately before the international break. However, he has made a good recovery and will now partner Rio Ferdinand in the heart of the United defense. Injury-plagued French striker Louis Saha definitely misses the tie with a long-term knee problem and fellow casualties Gary Neville and Owen Hargreaves also stayed behind. England striker Wayne Rooney, who scored twice against Villa and was also on target in England's Euro 2008 defeat against Russia in Moscow last week, will partner Carlos Tevez in attack. A third successive victory after 1-0 wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma would virtually guarantee United a place in the knock-out stage. United flew to Kiev a day earlier than normal, taking their own chefs and dieticians with them. ""The travel is always the biggest worry in these situations,"" said Ferguson. ""Ukraine is further away than most other journeys around Europe."" Senegal defender Pape Diakhate, Guinea forward Ismael Bangoura and Ukraine midfielder Taras Mykhalyk are expected to return for Dynamo, but former Tottenham forward Serhiy Rebrov is an absentee. Dynamo warmed up for Tuesday night with a 1-0 win over strugglers Zakarpattia on Saturday in the Ukrainian Championship. But Kiev are bottom of Group F after losing their first two games -- 2-0 at Roma and 2-1 at home to Sporting. Glasgow Rangers are without Jean-Claude Darcheville and Brahim Hemdani for their formidable home clash against Barcelona on Tuesday. Darcheville is still struggling with a hamstring problem while Hemdani misses the Group E tie in Glasgow with a groin problem that kept him out of the weekend's 3-0 win against Celtic. UEFA Cup favorites Bayern Munich will probably have to do without midfielder Franck Ribery for their group game against Red Star Belgrade on Thursday. The French international hurt his thigh in Saturday's 2-1 win at Bochum that saw Bayern extend their lead at the top of the Bundesliga.",0
"Summary: Milan goalkeeper Dida is partially successful against two-match UEFA ban. Dida misses Wednesday's home Champions League tie against Shakhtar. Second game of ban suspended for one year freeing him for return in Ukraine. Article: Milan goalkeeper Dida has been cleared to play in next month's Champions League match at Shakhtar Donetsk after partially winning his appeal to UEFA against a two-match ban. Dida has had one game of his two-match ban suspended for a year following an appeal to UEFA. Brazilian Dida was also fined 60,000 Swiss francs by European football's ruling body following an incident involving a supporter during the Champions clash against Celtic in Scotland on October 3. The 34-year-old Brazilian was initially banned for two games for his theatrics following a Celtic fan's encroachment onto the pitch during the 2-1 defeat at Celtic Park. ""Following Monday's appeals hearing, Dida is suspended for two matches, but one of the matches will now be deferred for a probationary period of one year,"" said a stement on UEFA's Web site. Dida sits out the home tie against Shakhtar on Wednesday after an inquiry based on Article 5, paragraph 1 of the UEFA disciplinary regulations (Principles of conduct), under which ""member associations, clubs, as well as their players, officials and members, shall conduct themselves according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship"". However, Dida will only serve the second match of his ban if he commits a similar offense -- a theatrical over-reaction --during the next 12 months, freeing him for the trip to Ukraine. UEFA said that their Appeals Body ""took note that Dida expressed his sincere regrets as regards his conduct during the match."" AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani was satisfied with UEFA's decision. ""I believe it is fair -- I was against the two-game suspension but one seems OK. ""Dida has made a mistake but his error did not hinder anyone, not Celtic, nor any player,"" said Galliani.",0
"Summary: South African reggae legend Lucky Dube killed in attempted hijacking. Dube, 43, killed Thursday in Johannesburg after hijacker tried to steal his car. Death casts shadow over South Africa's preparations for rugby World Cup final. Article: Reggae legend Lucky Dube, one of South Africa's most famous musicians, was killed in an attempted car-jacking as he dropped his children off at a relative's house, his record label said Friday. Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans. Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday after someone tried to steal his car, Gallo Record Company said in a statement. Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds. Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend. News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days. Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris. Gallo Records called the death ""senseless and random,"" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was. South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked. ""It's very sad,"" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. ""He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists."" Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York. His record company said Dube leaves ""a great void"" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans. Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named ""Lucky"" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies. Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career. Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss. ""Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,"" Haarburger said. ""It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically."" Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle.

"Summary: Nationwide Airlines pilot dumped fuel until he landed plane Wednesday. An object was sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground. 100, including crew, were on the plane; no one was injured. Plane passenger: ""Everyone started panicking"" Article: Brendon Pelser said he saw pure terror in the faces of his fellow passengers after an engine fell from a wing as it took off from Cape Town, South Africa, Wednesday. Men were sweating profusely, women were crying. ""There was fear on their faces,"" Pelser said. ""Everyone started panicking."" But the pilot of Nationwide Airlines' Boeing 737 Flight CE723 was able to fly long enough to dump fuel and make an emergency landing at Cape Town International Airport. Including crew, 100 hundred people were on the plane that departed at 3:50 p.m. on an hourlong flight to Johannesburg, South Africa. No one was injured. The jet had only been in the air about 10 minutes before the engine fell. ""We heard something crash and bang, the plane veering left and right. A person on the right side said the engine was missing -- had broken clean off,"" said Pelser. Watch Pelser describe how the flight crew told passengers to ""prepare for the worst"" ». ""They flew us in very slowly. We were all prepared for the worst. We went into the fetal position, head between the legs,"" he said. ""Then we hit the runway."" ""I did kind of pray. I didn't want to die. I'm not really ready to die,"" the 33-year-old said. An object had been sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground and officials are trying to identify it. The engine-to-wing supporting structure is designed to release an engine ""when extreme forces are applied,"" to prevent structural damage to the wing, Nationwide said on its Web site. The airline described the incident as a ""catastrophic engine failure."" As the nose wheel lifted from the ground, ""the captain heard a loud noise immediately followed by a yaw of the aircraft (sideways slippage) to the right,"" the airline said in a news release. The flight instruments showed the No. 2 engine on the right side had failed, it said. Pelser said he spent the night in Cape Town, then flew back to Johannesburg where he lives, on the same airline. Nationwide said the engine had undergone a major overhaul in March 2005 at ""an approved Federal Aviation Authority facility in the U.S.A."" and had flown only 3,806 hours since then. ""These engines typically achieve 10,000 hours between major overhauls,"" Nationwide Airlines' press release stated.",0
"Summary: FEMA doesn't face utter devastation as in Gulf Coast in 2005. Victims can escape in own vehicles on open roads. Communications infrastructure remains intact. Agencies learn from Hurricane Katrina mistakes. Article: Federal Emergency Management Agency officials know the agency's performance in the California wildfires will be watched closely for comparisons to its failures in Hurricane Katrina. A volunteer distributes donated food and supplies to evacueesTuesday at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium. FEMA Director David Paulison promised on Tuesday ""a different type of response than the federal government put together for Katrina."" Paulison said Katrina ""was a wake-up call"" and that ""this is a new FEMA."" President Bush signed a federal disaster declaration Wednesday, freeing up federal funds for families affected by the wildfires in seven counties in Southern California. ""I will continue to make sure that our efforts are coordinated, that we are responding to the needs of people, but most importantly I want the people in Southern California to know that Americans all across this land care deeply about them,"" he said. The action follows an emergency declaration by Bush on Tuesday morning for the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. He said he's ""looking forward"" to his visit to the region on Thursday. According to a statement from the White House, the federal disaster declaration will allow for federal aid that ""can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster."" FEMA and other relief and rescue services face significantly different challenges in the fire zone than they did on the Gulf Coast in 2005. For example, the fires aren't covering every square foot of the region, as Katrina did. The devastation in California is intense but not universal. During and immediately after Katrina, the destruction was so complete that relief personnel and supplies -- even the U.S. Army -- could not get within miles of the disaster's epicenter, New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward, for several days. By contrast, roads in Southern California have remained open for residents to get out and help to get in without delay. Residents there are generally more affluent and are able to use their own vehicles to escape, whereas many of Katrina's victims were poor and had no means of transportation. Victims in California are not stranded on rooftops without food or drinkable water, but are able travel the relatively short distances to safe places. One of those safe places is San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is not endangered by the fires. FEMA and other relief agencies are able to stage supplies and meet victims' needs in an organized way. New Orleans' Superdome, on the other hand, sitting in the center of the disaster zone, was severely damaged by hurricane winds and threatened by rising water. What had been a shelter devolved into a trap. Katrina also wiped out the Gulf Coast's communications infrastructure, crippling the coordination of relief efforts -- even for the military. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff acknowledged Tuesday that the government's response machinery had benefited from the Katrina experience. ""I think there's no question that [there were] a couple of the lessons from Katrina which we have put into effect here,"" Chertoff said. ""First of all, planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges, so that we have worked together and planned together with the Defense Department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis. That's been a big help here,"" Chertoff said. ""Second, we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue,"" Chertoff said. Chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have FEMA ready, ""and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent, and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent, we sprang into action yesterday. ""So we've been monitoring the situation continuously. The president's been on top of it. We've been on top of it. And we're going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can."" Chertoff said Tuesday that he hadn't waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance. ""We have been moving cots, blankets, other supplies into the area of San Diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity,"" he said. ""We've also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire, once the winds begin to die down."" People left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at www.fema.gov, Paulison said. Watch Paulison discuss the ""new FEMA"" ». He denied suggestions similar to those made in the aftermath of Katrina that the federal response was hampered because National Guard equipment was in short supply because of the Iraq War. ""I just haven't seen that,"" he said. The U.S. military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires, including 11 Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant. More than 17,000 National Guardsmen have been made available; 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego; and 12 Defense Department firefighting teams, were engaged.",0
"Summary: Vince McMahon: WWE has one of best drug-testing programs. Wrestling boss tells CNN that individuals bear responsibility for actions. Critics say WWE penalties for drug use are not harsh enough. Wrestlers still can get drugs if they have prescriptions from doctors. Article: The late Chris Benoit idolized the Dynamite Kid, who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying, acrobatic moves. Chris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June. The Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs. They were quick, agile and muscular, and in 1986 they won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship. Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington. At the beginning of his career, Benoit adopted the Dynamite nickname and copied his idol's signature moves. In June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself. Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in Chris Benoit's body, Georgia's chief medical examiner said a month later. When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, ""It can make you aggressive, the steroids. But personally I wouldn't, you know, kill no bleeding kid, or wife either."" Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England. He has lost the use of his legs. A pin sticks out from one of his toes. Billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body. And from the steroids, he said. Billington told CNN that the steroids came from doctors, from friends, even from steroids meant for horses. He took them all, took a terrible pounding in the ring, and like his partner (who died at age 39 in 2002), began taking extensive amounts of painkillers. Benoit's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, and the man who has ruled wrestling for years, Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon. McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: ""Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family. How did we know Chris Benoit would turn into a monster."" Read a full transcript of the McMahons interview. Vince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show. ""Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy,"" McMahon said. Critics say McMahon pushes his stars and non-stars, works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling. They say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business. His businesses are quite successful. About 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows. Two of their cable programs -- ""Raw"" and ""Friday Night Smackdown"" -- are weekly ratings giants. Pay-per-view specials generate an average of $100 million per year. When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena. ""If someone passes through our organization, it is not our responsibility for someone's personal activities,"" he said. He also said there isn't ""any organization in the world, be it entertainment or be it sport, that can tell you that they are totally drug-free."" Watch as a WWE wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong ». The McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes. Since the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organization's wrestlers have been suspended, including two since CNN's interview with the McMahons. David Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning. But Dr. Gary Wadler, a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough. ""It certainly falls far, far short of where it needs to be,"" he said. ""And there is a gold standard, and I measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard. And [the WWE is] miles apart."" Wadler, a longtime critic of McMahon, was referring to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in Colorado Springs, Colorado. U.S. athletes training for the Olympics are randomly tested and, if caught just once, face a two-year suspension from competition. If caught a second time, they can be banned for life. Black's programs test wrestlers four times a year. The first is a ""baseline"" test, according to the WWE. Black then tests for ""nonmedical"" uses, meaning that if an athlete has a prescription, he is cleared. ""It's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program,"" said Travis Tygart, who heads the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids. He says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years. Watch one of the new WWE stars talk about being ""straight edge"" ». ""There's an expression in our business, that here is where you make your money. It's your face, it's what you do with it,"" he said. ""It's your personality, it's what you do with it. It's your delivery, your elocution. It's storyline, it's things, all those things that are theatrical as well as athletic in the ring."" CNN's Drew Griffin contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Justa Grata Honoria plotted to kill her emperor of Roman Empire. When first plot failed, she offered to marry Attila the Hun. He failed to annihilate Rome, or marry her. She then suffered the fate she dreaded. Article: Everyone goes through a rebellious phase. And, if you're lucky, you'll be able to look back on those years and laugh. If you're less lucky, you spent those years on a reality show, so for the rest of time, millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead. In modern times, cats frolic among the ruins of ancient Rome. But, hey, it could be worse. You could be responsible for the fall of Western Civilization, just like Justa Grata Honoria, the Roman princess whose wild ways and (literally) naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the Roman Empire. Barely regal. Smart, conniving, and ruthless, Honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a Roman emperor, except for that pesky Y chromosome. As a young girl, she watched as her dimwitted six-year-old brother, Valentinian III, was crowned emperor of the Western Roman Empire, while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage. Hardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life, Honoria rebelled with aplomb, sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens. Although her after-hours habits caused quite the scandal, they failed to satiate her need for attention and power, so Honoria set her eyes on the throne. Employing her ample charms, she seduced her brother's royal chamberlain, Eugenius, and together, they plotted to murder Valentinian and seize power. But, alas, their scheme was soon exposed. Eugenius was executed, and Honoria was sent to a convent in Constantinople. Life as a nun was a fate worse than death for Honoria, but even that couldn't quell her ambition. She spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another. Finally, out of sheer desperation, she turned to sources outside the empire. Her savior would have to be powerful enough to defy Valentinian and risk open war with Rome. Only one man fit that description: Attila, king of the Huns. Attila the hubby. Honoria got the barbarian's attention with a mutually beneficial proposal: If Attila would rescue her, she would marry him, and he would get half of the Western Empire as her dowry. Of course, Honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the Roman Empire. But she was betting that after marrying her, Attila would conquer the whole Empire, and she'd become queen to boot. Attila had secretly been planning a move against Rome for years, and Honoria's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike. Wasting no time, he told Valentinian that he planned to marry Honoria, and demanded the dowry he'd been promised. Naturally, Valentinian refused, and Attila used his status as a ""wronged husband"" to invade Roman territory in 451 C.E. The Hun armies quickly swept through the Empire, destroying everything in their path, and eventually they arrived in Rome. Like all the other cities before it, Rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the Huns during the invasion. Rome survived Attila's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe, the Visigoths, but the Western Empire never recovered. Within a generation, the armies of the Goths, Franks, and Huns had overrun the area. The Princess bride. Ultimately, Honoria became neither Roman empress nor a Hun queen. Attila never rescued her, and she was eventually sent back to Rome and left to her brother's justice. Not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed, and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again, Valentinian settled on a suitable third option. After years of struggle, Honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along: She was married off to an elderly Roman senator, and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history.

"Summary: FIFA President Sepp Blatter among guests marking Sheffield FC's 150 years. English side Sheffield FC recognized as the oldest football club in the world. Club is one of two to win FIFA's Order of Merit -- the other is Real Madrid. Article: Football dignitaries gathered in Sheffield, northern England, on Wednesday to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of Sheffield FC -- the sport's oldest club. FIFA chief Blatter was among those in Sheffield to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of football's oldest club. Guests of honor at a service at Sheffield Cathedral included Sepp Blatter, president of football world governing body FIFA, and Massimo Moratti, president of Italian giants Inter Milan who are scheduled to play a friendly against Sheffield FC next month. Other guests attending a dinner in the club's honor included Real Madrid President Ramon Calderon and England and Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton. Pele -- widely recognized as the greatest footballer ever to play the game -- is also due in town next month to attend Sheffield FC's clash with Inter. Blatter was unveiling a bust of the club's co-founder William Prest -- one of two cricket fans who founded Sheffield FC, then known simply as Sheffield Club, on October 24, 1857 after deciding they needed a new sport to keep them active during the winter. Many more football clubs soon sprung up and by 1862 there were said to be 15 in and around the Sheffield area. The Football Association -- which codified the basic rules of the modern game -- was established in London the following year. Sheffield FC was instrumental in developing set rules for the game. The club studied existing rules and laid down a code of laws, which formed the foundation of the first commonly-accepted set of rules for the sport, according to the Sheffield FC Web site. The team was also responsible for several innovations in the game -- including heading, which was unheard of until 1875, when Sheffield traveled to London for a game. According to the team's Web site, the sight of the Sheffield players using their foreheads in addition to their feet reduced the London crowd to hysterics. Other innovations attributed to the team include the solid crossbar on the goal, corner kicks, free kicks for fouls, and playing a match under floodlights. Despite its celebrated place in the history of the world's most popular sport, Sheffield FC has never played at a professional level. The club currently competes in the Unibond League's First Division South, seven divisions beneath the English Premier League. The city of Sheffield has two professional clubs -- United and Wednesday -- who both currently play in English football's second tier, the Coca-Cola Championship. Sheffield FC's proudest achievement on the pitch came in 1904 when the team beat Ealing 3-1 to win the FA Amateur Cup in front of 6,000 people. But 100 years later in 2004, Blatter presented Sheffield FC with FIFA's ""Order of Merit"" -- an honor previously awarded only to the nine-time European champions Real Madrid.",0
"Summary: Polish diplomats brought pointed shoes to Britain in 1300s. A female runner sewed two jock straps together for first sports bra. Men wore earrings in Egypt in 1500s. Article: Why shoes are called ""pumps"" and other strange-but-true stories behind the clothes and accessories you know and love. So, how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start? Manolo who? Long before they ever made an appearance on the TV show ""Sex and the City,"" pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles, who introduced the fashion to England on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s. The shoes, dubbed ""crackowes"" or ""poulaines"" -- after Kraków, Poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging. In 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes. Commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length. Who invented the sports bra? In 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra wasn't holding up. With the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto! -- the sports bra was born. The coeds founded the company Jogbra a year later, garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere. Almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually. Real Simple: Best bras for every figure. Is there a real Mary Jane behind Mary Jane shoes? Not quite: The most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in ""Buster Brown,"" a children's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s. Mary Jane was either Buster Brown's sweetheart or sister, depending on which source you consult. What's the connection between Shakespeare and raincoats? Gabardine, a water-repellent fabric invented by Burberry, got its first mention from Shakespeare. The Bard used the word in The Merchant of Venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms. During World War I, British officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original Burberry trench. Who was the first person known to have pierced ears? No one knows who originated the style, but there's evidence that as early as 2500 B.C. Sumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops. And guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy: Men have been wearing earrings since ancient Egypt, where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 B.C. Real Simple: Best way to clean jewelry. What was the inspiration for Lilly Pulitzer's colorful printed dresses? Bored Palm Beach socialite Lilly Pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time, but she found one drawback: The citrus concoctions discolored her clothes. She instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains, and the ""Lilly"" design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born. The style was an instant hit with customers, who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice. How did pumps, stilettos, and sneakers get their names? The term pump first popped up in 1550 in England, where male servants sported the style. It is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump. The word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore ""sneaky."" The modern usage of stiletto, a Renaissance-era Italian word for an assassin's narrow-bladed knife, made its debut in 1953. The word turned out to be especially appropriate, because the shoes' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors. When did folks start toting around umbrellas? For thousands of years, in such places as Egypt, China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and India, umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. (When it rained, the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs.) Umbrellas weren't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. And another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight, portable, and available to average Joes. Have bikinis always been so popular? Hardly! Named for the nuclear-testing site Bikini Atoll, the suits first appeared in 1946, but American women thought them immodest. Not until the 1960s were they accepted, possibly helped by the hit song ""Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini."" Were French cuffs really created for the battlefield? It is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat. But, in fact, French royalty invented the style in the 1500s, when flowing sleeves were the rage; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners. Amusingly, the competitive English tried to take credit for the fashion, which to this day they refer to only as ""double cuffs."" Have women always carried purses? Once upon a time, ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing (sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack) and accessible through slits in their skirts. Around 1800, thinner, silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue, and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections. The solution? They began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead. Why is underwear nicknamed ""drawers""? In the 16th century, drawers became a common term for both men's and women's underpants. Made of linen, the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable (this being well before Victoria ever had a secret; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century). Most likely, underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body.

"Summary: Thousands of teens attend Christian rallies each year. Many of the rallies attempt to offer an alternative to secular popular culture. Opponents say these impose conservative values on vulnerable teenagers. Article: At one point in Jared Hutchins' young life, the Beatles were a big problem. The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival. ""I had to stop listening to them for a while,"" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. He said the group's world view ""had a negative effect on me,"" and made him irritable and angry. ""God owns my life, not the Beatles,"" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him. Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said. Acquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania. Go behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event ». One part concert, one part Christian revival, the rallies seek to ""stage a reverse revolution"" against secular popular culture. They have the pull of headlining rock concerts, drawing thousands of people regardless of the region of the country, the month of year or the day of the week. The audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults. From 2006 to 2007, a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies, and 71,414 people attended the three BattleCry events held in San Francisco, California; Detroit, Michigan; and Bristow, Virginia, according to Teen Mania. Watch flags, fireworks and teens at rally. For Hutchins, who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool before having a personal experience with God about four years ago, the organization's message is exactly right. ""We don't have to be branded by the culture, we are branded by God,"" he said. ""Be who God created you to be."" But the glossy, glamorous appeal of popular culture too often obscures that path to God, Teen Mania followers say. And so, Ron Luce, the 46-year-old founder of the organization, has waged a modern-day crusade against ""purveyors of popular culture,"" whom he has condemned as ""the enemy."" More than two decades old, Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message ""of living completely for Christ."" The organization is sprawling. In addition to its live stadium rallies, there are BattleCry shirts and hats, mobile screen savers, books and a television program. There are international mission trips -- Hutchins attended one in Tijuana, Mexico, this summer. There is even a Teen Mania internship, a one-year program called the Honor Academy, based in Lindale, Texas. In the live events, Luce couples the earnest appeal of a young father with a preacher's ability to mobilize a crowd. He weaves disturbing statistics about teenagers amid his gospel. Today's teenagers are in crisis, he says. ""We're fighting for those who don't know they have a voice, that are being manipulated by our pop culture indulging in things that, really, they're not mature enough to be thinking about yet,"" Luce told CNN. ""Kids are hurting,"" he said. And of those who he feels inflict these moral wounds, Luce said, ""We call them terrorists, virtue terrorists, that are destroying our kids."" ""They're raping virgin teenage America on the sidewalk, and everybody's walking by and acting like everything's OK. And it's just not OK."" To some, Luce's rhetoric is off-putting, hateful and divisive. Opponents point to his views on homosexuality -- not ""in God's plan"" -- and abortion -- the ""ending of a precious life"" -- and say Luce is imposing conservative values on vulnerable teenagers. Explore Americans' views on religion. It is this criticism that Luce and his followers confronted head-on in March at BattleCry San Francisco. There, in arguably the most liberal city in the United States, protesters, armed with megaphones and poster board signs, rallied against BattleCry on the steps of City Hall as the Christian teenagers circled and prayed in a demonstration of their own. ""Ron Luce is a liar!"" one protester shouted. ""Let me hear you say Christian fascist,"" another yelled. Luce and the youths, some as young as 11, also raised their voices. ""God, I ask that as we do this BattleCry, Lord, that you would reveal yourself to the teenagers, God, here, God,"" Mindy Peterson, shouted. Peterson is a member of Teen Mania's Honor Academy. Afterward, Peterson railed against what she said was the protesters' mischaracterization of BattleCry. ""These people think that our war is against other people. They think that our war is against man. And our war isn't. Our war's against ... the pain in teenagers' hearts, like depression, alcoholism. Those things that -- that are, like, tearing our teenagers apart,"" she said. While much milder in his terms, Hutchins agrees. ""We're a generation that is kind of troubled,"" he said. Luce wants to ""rescue the hearts of our generation,"" he added. And of the critics' contention that the rallies, the organization, the message is neo-conservatism wrapped in Biblical verse? Hutchins smiles, nods patiently. ""I don't go because I have a political agenda,"" he said, adding that his friends don't, either. ""Mostly, what we're concerned with is Jesus.""

"Summary: CNN's Octavia Nasr: Will Lebanon's brief renaissance be snuffed out? Nasr says Lebanon's key power players haven't changed since 1980s. Nasr: Current struggle threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years. Article: I was 14 at the time. Lebanon's civil war was in full flood. One afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in Beirut. A Lebanese woman and her son run through west Beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces. We ran from school screaming. Forget the book bags, classmates, homework. Just run. Out of breath, my knees giving way, it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block. The memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently. After more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction, the bombings and assassinations have returned to Beirut. Every time I hear of a new explosion, I think of a frightened child sitting in darkness. In 1988, I watched the last throes of Lebanon's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of Lebanese, sad, frustrated and often fearful. See a timeline of Lebanon's recent history ». Now I watch from another continent, but I find those same emotions resurfacing. The conspiracies, the car bombs, the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar. The actors are like shadows from a long gone past. They are grayer perhaps -- those who have avoided assassination. But the cast in Lebanon's tragedy has changed little in two decades. Then, as now, a presidential election is the setting, and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years. See bios of Lebanon's major players ». In 1988, the president's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate. Militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building. Compromise was nowhere in sight. The West had abandoned Lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors. Syria had its choice for president; Israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing Muslim radicalism. The country was awash with weapons. In his last act as president, Amin Gemayel named fellow Christian and Army Chief Michel Aoun as prime minister. At a stroke, he shattered the convention that a Muslim hold that position. Muslims refused to serve in the Cabinet and the country ended up with two governments. Aoun famously declared: ""I am prime minister and six ministers in one."" Aoun's ""War of Liberation"" against Syria turned into defeat. Then, he turned on fellow Christians of the Lebanese Forces in the ""War of Elimination."" When that failed, the Syrians drove Aoun to take refuge at the French Embassy. In August 1990, I came to CNN as a World Report panelist. I tried to explain Lebanon's chaos, the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians. I had seen people killed in front of me; children orphaned in seconds, parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins. So when I was offered the opportunity to stay at CNN, I gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy. But almost as I left, the civil war was being laid to rest. The various factions had fought each other to a standstill; Arab governments, supported by the West, helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by Syrian influence. Peace came to Lebanon, but it would be five years before I returned. In 1995, I went back and was stunned. I kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants. I couldn't believe that I could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another. No longer did identity -- Christian, Muslim or Druze -- define where Lebanese could go. People mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble, laughing at the same jokes. It was as if Lebanon's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser. Downtown Beirut, once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes, was rocking to Lebanese pop music. The dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest European fashions and deluxe hotels. Lovers had returned to Beirut's Corniche, overlooking the Mediterranean, for romantic strolls at sunset. But the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a ""pax Syriana."" As anti-Syrian sentiment grew, so did political tensions. On Valentine's Day 2005, the Corniche was once again rocked by an explosion. Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed. The symbolism left me speechless. On the day of love, Lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history. It had been widely expected that Hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of Syrian troops. Suspicion fell on Damascus, which vehemently denied involvement. On March 14, Martyrs' Square became a human sea of demonstrators: Muslims, Druze and Christians alike, demanding the ""truth."" But Hariri's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken Lebanon a generation previously. Even after it withdrew its troops, Syria still had allies in Lebanon. One was Hezbollah, accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of U.S. Marines in Beirut more than 20 years previously. Another was Gen. Michel Aoun; now back from exile, the same Michel Aoun who had defied Syria in 1989, but who now made common cause with Hezbollah against his fellow Christians. Earlier this year I visited Martyrs' Square. The spirit of the Cedar Revolution had evaporated. The place looked like a morgue. Anti-government Hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill. As I passed through, business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair. I wondered if they sensed my disappointment, my pain at watching Beirut bleed again. Lebanon's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago. Once again, the term of the president is approaching its end; there is no agreement on his successor. Suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day. And the questions haunts me: Will the country's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries?

"Summary: No end ""until it reaches the ocean or the winds turn around,"" official says. Nearly 350,000 homes in San Diego County evacuated; 70 people injured. Flames have charred 700,000 acres, more than 1,000 homes. Not ""enough fire engines in the state of California,"" Ventura County official says. Article: Firefighters in Southern California are facing wind-whipped walls of flame from 15 wildfires that have scorched more than 400,000 acres and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes. Firefighters battle the Witch fire Tuesday in the Del Dios area of Escondido, California. The blazes have killed one person and injured at least 70 more. Firefighters were aided by resources from Mexico, the state and federal governments and even inmates from California's prisons. San Diego Fire Department Battalion Chief Bruce Cartelli described scenes of ""utter devastation"" with hundreds of homes lost and ""many hundreds"" of others damaged. ""It's probably the worst significant event in my career of 36 years,"" he said. ""It will not end ... until it reaches the ocean or the winds turn around,"" Cartelli said. Meteorologists suggested that Santa Ana winds, which have fueled the wildfires with some gusts approaching 100 mph, could die down Wednesday afternoon. ""We are still facing some very serious fires,"" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said after an aerial tour of the affected area. ""The weather has made it very difficult for the air assets to get up and fight the fires. ... If the weather cooperates, maybe we can turn the tide tomorrow."" Officials have evacuated nearly 350,000 homes in San Diego County alone, where the worst of the fires are blazing. Using U.S. Census Bureau numbers from the 2000 census, that could mean as many as 950,000 were affected by the fires. Watch evacuees shaken, firefighters battling ». In San Diego County, at least half a million residents had been ordered to find refuge in shelters, schools and stadiums as fires pushed into new areas. Among the evacuees as more than 4,000 military personnel from several bases in the area. With the winds pushing them across the area, the fires spread quickly, forcing some residents to flee in the middle of the night. ""My wife woke me up like 12 o'clock, screaming and yelling that the flames were coming down,"" said Johnny Villanueva of Spring Valley, who fled with his wife and daughter to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is serving as a shelter to more than 12,000 evacuees. ""We just loaded up the car really quick and came down here ... slept in our vehicles."" His wife, Elizabeth, added, ""I saw on the mountain on fire, and said, 'Oh my God, my family. ... Let's go."" With Qualcomm Stadium being used by the evacuees, the San Diego Chargers planned to practice at the Arizona Cardinals' stadium in Glendale for next weekend's game. Lake Arrowhead resident Michelle Dresser, who owns a business and was chased from her home by a wildfire last year, said she was waiting until the last minute to leave. She spent the night in her store, partly to help customers and neighbors. ""It is crazy. We are surrounded by fire on both sides,"" she said. Asked by CNN where she would go, she replied, ""I have to find someplace to accept two dogs, two cats and a turtle."" Watch people staying with pets at refuge ». Animals are allowed in Qualcomm Stadium, a nearby field and Del Mar Fairgrounds and Racetrack. President Bush is scheduled to visit the area on Thursday, the White House said. Chertoff arrived in San Diego Tuesday afternoon for a ""first-hand look"" at the devastation. ""I wanted to see for myself, first of all, how the shelter situation is in San Diego, what the fires look like up close,"" Chertoff told CNN. The secretary said that the federal response to the wildfires is ""phenomenally better"" than the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, ""because we have been preparing and planning and training together for the last 2 ½ years."" ""Unlike in Katrina ... we have now built the process ... and we've rehearsed it, so when we take the field, the team already knows what we need to do,"" he said. See photos of the fires ». And the scene at Qualcomm Stadium on Tuesday did seem to live up to Chertoff's expectations as volunteers cheerily handed out chairs, food and water. Thirty-four firefighters have been injured, authorities said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was ""heartbroken"" after touring the Lake Arrowhead area, where the Grass Valley and Slide fires have burned 5,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 homes. ""This is a tragedy, what is happening in California,"" he told reporters. The combination of dry terrain, searing heat and hammering winds had created ""the perfect storm for fire,"" the governor said. Schwarzenegger said about 7,000 firefighters were battling the blazes, including 2,300 inmates from California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders said the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, had sent four fire engines and their crews to help out, and the governor of Baja California had offered help. Chertoff said cots, blankets, water and other supplies have been moved where they are needed, and more are coming. The Federal Emergency Management Agency delivered 25,000 cots to Qualcomm early Tuesday. At least 150 National Guard members are assigned to provide security at the stadium. See where the fires are burning ». Of San Diego County's 10 major fires, the Witch fire in the north, which has grown to 200,000 acres, is the priority because of its significant threat to structures, said Ron Lane, the county's director of emergency services. The Harris fire had burned more than 70,000 acres by mid-morning. In northern Los Angeles County, the Ranch, Buckweed, and Magic fires have charred more than 93,000 acres and fire officials fear they could merge. ""We want to keep these fires as small as we can,"" said Capt. Barry Parker of the Ventura County Fire Department. The 54,500-acre Ranch fire was only two miles away from the 1,200-acre Magic fire. The blazes are straddling the L.A.-Ventura County line. Asked if he had enough resources, Parker said, ""We truly don't."" ""We're using a limited amount of resources to go in and fight these fires,"" he said. ""We've got about 600 people on the Ranch fire; we normally would have about 1,500. ""So we have to be absolutely surgical in how we plan and how we tactically use our fire equipment because we just simply don't have enough fire engines in the state of California to battle these blazes."" In San Diego County, a utility spokesman said a 500,000-volt transmission line was damaged when the Harris fire expanded, and it will be out of service until at least Wednesday. Other transmission lines have been destroyed. Sanders said Mexico's Federal Electrical Commission was providing power to the area's grid to help make up for the losses. California also received extensive offers of manpower and equipment from the military. A total of 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego, and 67 Defense Department employees -- 12 firefighting teams -- already were engaged. Eleven Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and more than 17,000 National Guardsmen were available, along with six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant on the flames. But aerial attacks on the fires have been limited by the fierce Santa Ana winds. The Red Cross and other groups also were in the wings. They and some other groups were waiting for the flames to die down before bringing in their volunteers. The Red Cross has set up 11 shelters in the area and housed 3,000 people Monday night. More were expected Tuesday. A firefighter at Rancho Bernardo in San Diego County showed distress. ""Every one of us out here feels like these homes are our own. We know what it's like to see people's faces when they've lost everything. It's devastating to see so much of this all at once."" CNN's Thelma Gutierrez and Dan Simon contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: MME speaks with Sallie Krawcheck, boss of Citi Global Wealth Management. Ranked by Fortune magazine as World's 12th Most Powerful Woman in 2007. Manages client assets worth $1.8 trillion, formerly bank's CFO. Tells MME: ""we're very bullish"" on economic potential of the Middle East. Article: If you thought it was difficult managing your own money in 2007, consider the pressure of the task when you're dealing with $1.8 trillion of client assets. Sallie Krawcheck has made Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women every year since 2002. That's what Sallie Krawcheck does as Chairman and Chief Executive of Citi Global Wealth Management. She joined the banking industry as a research analyst, but quickly rose through the ranks, gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way. Dubbed the ""Mrs Clean"" of Wall Street, Ms Krawcheck was credited with restoring investors' faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm Smith Barney. She joined Citigroup in 2002, and spent some time as Chief Financial Officer before taking up her current role in March 2007. Sallie Krawcheck has been a regular entrant on Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women in Business -- in 2007, she made number 12. John Defterios caught up with Ms Krawcheck in Dubai. He asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the G8 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States). Sallie Krawcheck (SK): I think what's happening right now, it's fascinating because in the United States and in developed Europe we're having a liquidity crunch -- someone might argue a liquidity crisis. And in fact, we are awash with liquidity in the Middle East and in Asia as well, so there's really a bifurcation that's occurring in the world. And if you think about, oil doesn't even have to stay at the 90-plus dollar level it is; even at levels in the 70's, 60's, 50's, 40's, a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market. Yes, the investments are going up globally, but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region. And so over time, you're really going to see... I think continue to see... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the Middle East as well as to Asia. John Defterios (JD): It's coming almost as a perfect storm; we have a sub prime crisis, a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years. In this window of time, is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of Wall Street and it undermines its role? (SK): I think there is no doubt that New York is losing its status as a financial capital of the world. If you think about some years ago, if you think about the internet bubble for example, where it was New York and California wasn't it? And you look at a whole range of reasons for it, and the sub prime crisis perhaps, the decline of the dollar perhaps. But you have overlapping regulators in the United States, you have very high taxes in the United States, you have a very litigious environment in the United States, and you have the emerging markets coming up, so capital is being raised outside of the United States. These things, some of which are negative for the United States, some of which are positive for the other regions, is accelerating a shift that was underway from New York, to London, to Hong Kong, to Singapore, and potentially to Dubai as well. (JD): Some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both Wall Street and Capitol Hill in Washington. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't say I want some of that liquidity but I only want part of that liquidity. What is the result of that do you think? Can you over-regulate the sovereign funds? (SK): Oh, I think you can over-regulate the sovereign funds. I think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well; where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of 'here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity'. And the concern is if, gee these are going to be important going forward, we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets, but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market -- to a market outside the United States or Europe for example. (JD): It's fascinating because if you look at Qatar or Egypt or Shanghai, the stock markets have almost had like a one way path; there's been some correction here in the Middle East. But what are we likely to see here, stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way, or an implosion because of the rapid gains? (SK): I think you've got to separate the idea of what's going on in the real economies and what's going on in the market places. They move together, but sometimes they separate, they diverge, and they can diverge for a long period of time. If you look at economic growth potential of the Middle East, of Asia, of Latin America, we feel very bullish about this. And I was making the point earlier today, China has been growing at 11 or 12 percent, not for one year or two years, but literally for 30 years. For 30 years it's been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see. So, say the same thing for the Middle East, the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant, but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward. (JD): Is Wall Street, or for that matter, London or any other financial center ready for a woman -- for example in your case, 1.4 trillion dollars of assets... (SK): 1.8 Thank you... (JD): ...to run one of the major money center banks of the world? I'm sure you're feeling this pressure even though you're young by international standards. Are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank? (SK): Well it looks like the United States may be ready for a woman to take over as President. So I think if we're ready to potentially have a woman run the country, I think we are getting ready as a country, to potentially have a woman run a money center bank. Now, you know, the board wouldn't ask and I wouldn't accept, but if you look across Wall Street, there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are CEO's who move along, and I think it's a very exciting development for the industry and for the country.

"Summary: Santiago Fire deliberately started in two places, official says. Santiago Fire grows to 25,000 acres. L.A. authorities investigate man arrested for suspected arson. Blaze has destroyed 22 structures. Article: One of the larger fires in Southern California was deliberately started by someone with apparent knowledge of arson, a fire official said Thursday. Firefighter Luke Perisin sets a backfire Wednesday against the Santiago Fire in Live Oak Canyon, California. The Santiago Fire in Orange County was started in two places along a little-traveled road, according to Chief Chip Prather of the county's fire authority. The fire, which has burned more than 25,000 acres, was started in brush just off Santiago Canyon Road, not close to homes. It spread rapidly, indicating the arsonist had some knowledge of winds and other factors. ""It is a confirmed arson. There was evidence found at the scene. That is the purpose of our early declaration of it being an arson-caused fire,"" Prather said. He would not describe the evidence. Watch how the evidence points to arson ». Prather said officials originally thought the fire had three points of origin instead of two. The Santiago Fire's points of origin are considered crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. The reward for information leading to an arrest has increased to $250,000 -- $50,000 each from the governor's office, the U.S. agency of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI, Prather said. KFI radio has chipped in another $100,000, the sheriff's department said. The state established a toll-free arson tip line at 800-540-7085. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said anyone convicted of arson would be dealt with harshly. If a suspect is to be found, ""it's going to be by a clue from the public,"" said county Sheriff Mike Corona. About 1,100 firefighters were working on controlling the Santiago Fire, which has destroyed at least 22 structures, according to Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire was only 30 percent contained Thursday morning after being 50 percent contained the day before. Watch the Santiago flames rage ». The motive of the Santiago Fire's arsonist was a mystery to Concepcion. ""That's the part that I really can't figure out, to tell you the truth,"" he told CNN. ""That individual knew on Sunday when this fire started that we had, really, the perfect storm, if you will. We had the heavy Santa Ana winds, we had the low relative humidities, we had the high temperatures. ""And then for someone to even think about doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire where they knew the fire would grow as rapidly as it would -- traveling about three, 3½ miles in about an hour -- is just really absolutely unconscionable,"" he said. The smaller Rosa Fire in Riverside County, 100 percent contained at 411 acres Thursday morning, was also probably arson, state officials said. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are looking into whether a man who was arrested on suspicion of arson in the San Fernando Valley may have had a role in any of the ongoing blazes, an L.A. police spokeswoman said. Catalino Pineda, 41, was arrested Wednesday, Officer Kate Lopez told CNN. Witnesses told police they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside in the West Hills area of San Fernando -- northwest of Los Angeles -- then walking away, Lopez said. Pineda was already on probation for ""making excessive false emergency reports"" to police at the time of the arrest, Lopez said. His bail has been set at $75,000, she said. The fire he allegedly set was brought under control, but now authorities want to find out if he had any role in the other wildfires. In San Bernardino County, John Alfred Rund, 48, was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with setting a small fire along a rural roadside near Victorville. Rund was to be arraigned Thursday morning in Victorville. He was being held in lieu of $750,000 bail. The county's district attorney's office on Thursday also filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail and will be arraigned later Thursday. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department also arrested an adult and a juvenile accused by an anonymous tipster of starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista Fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley Fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 10,152-acre Slide Fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said.",0
"Summary: Local and federal officials probe suspected arson, offer $70,000 reward. Wind speeds drop, humidity increases after Santa Ana winds change direction. President Bush signs major disaster declaration for Southern California. Home losses will likely top $1 billion in San Diego County, official says. Article: Conditions that created what California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dubbed ""the perfect storm for fire"" eased Wednesday, helping firefighters gain ground against devastating Southern California wildfires. A plane drops fire retardant on the fourth day of a wildfire pushed by winds through Pauma Valley, California. Winds that gusted as much as 101 mph on Sunday dropped to about 30 mph Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, the dry Santa Ana winds that have fanned the flames, changed direction and began blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean, increasing the humidity and easing the burden on almost 8,900 firefighters in the area. But the destruction was taking its toll on the men and women on the front lines of the fires. ""It hurts us to have those homes lost. It hurts us to have those injuries. And it is frustrating for us to watch our community be devastated by this,"" said firefighter Andy Menshek. As conditions improved, officials allowed people to return to communities that had been off-limits because of intense flames and dense smoke. ""It was home,"" said Mark Davis, whose two-story Rancho Bernardo house burned to the ground. ""It was us. We had been there 28 years, and it had a lot of our flavor."" The change in the weather also meant that firefighting aircraft -- grounded for most of the week by the winds -- could finally fly. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Scott McLean called the droning sound of aircraft the ""sound of joy."" ""Their drops are hitting their mark because the wind is not there,"" he said. The rate of burning had slowed significantly by Wednesday. Still, the fire damage increased to 434,543 acres, said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Watch Schwarzenegger give a progress report ». That amounted to 679 square miles, or about 10 times the size of Washington, D.C. By Wednesday evening, the largest fire -- the Witch in northern San Diego County -- was 10 percent contained. It burned about 196,000 acres before combining with the smaller Poomacha blaze. Seven fires among the 22 counted Wednesday were contained. See where the fires are burning ». Others, such as the Buckweed Fire in Los Angeles County, were as much as 94 percent contained. One large fire was a suspected arson. The FBI and the Orange County Fire Authority are investigating the Santiago fire that has burned more than 19,000 acres. All three of its points of origin have been declared crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. A $70,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the arrest of those responsible for setting the fire. The blaze was about 50 percent contained after destroying 17 structures. Watch the raging flames of the Santiago fire ». The smaller Rosa fire in Riverside County, 70 percent contained at just over 400 acres, was also a probably arson, state officials said. As the fire danger eased, residents were allowed to return to several neighborhoods surrounding San Diego: Del Mar Highlands, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Carmel Valley, Chula Vista and Otay Mesa. Helicopters were back in the air over the Lake Arrowhead, California, area after all air activity had been suspended because of extremely smoky skies. In nearby Running Springs, CNN's Ted Rowlands stood in the midst of charred, smoldering rubble strewn with potentially deadly power lines. ""It will be a while before these people will come back. When they do come back, unfortunately they'll have this pretty much to look at,"" he said Wednesday. Watch Rowlands describe a major battle with the flames ». About 500 homes were lost in the mountainous region in San Bernardino County east of Los Angeles. See photos of the fires ». ""Yesterday we couldn't be here, because just this little flame and smoldering pieces of wood would be thrown by the intense winds. ... Now you can see the flames just basically burning themselves out,"" said Rowlands. The fires have already destroyed 1,664 structures -- including 1,436 homes -- and they still threaten 25,000 more, Schwarzenegger said Wednesday. The blazes have killed three people and left 40 hurt, he said. The governor will fly over the area Thursday with President Bush, who signed a major disaster declaration Wednesday. Watch Bush emphasize the need to be responsive ». It'll speed federal dollars to people whose property losses aren't covered by insurance and will help local and state agencies pay for the emergency response. The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top $1 billion in San Diego County alone, an emergency official said. Federal help keeps arriving as officials promise a response based on lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. People left homeless by the fires can go online to apply for federal help at FEMA.gov, he said. There were 76,000 people staying in the 42 shelters opened in San Diego County Wednesday morning, according to San Diego emergency spokeswoman Lynda Pfieffer.

"Summary: British teacher in Sudan found guilty of insulting religion. Gillian Gibbons, 54, arrested after her class named teddy bear ""Mohammed"" Gibbons was not convicted of two other charges brought against her. UK consular staff, Gibbons' defense team initially refused access to the court. Article: A Sudanese court found a British teacher guilty of insulting religion and sentenced her to 15 days in prison Thursday for allowing a teddy bear to be named ""Mohammed,"" British authorities and her lawyer reported. An undated amateur photo of Gillian Gibbons, who has been found guilty of insulting religion. Gillian Gibbons also faces deportation from Sudan after her prison term, her lawyer told CNN. He said that he was ""very disappointed"" with the verdict and that Gibbons planned to appeal. Gibbons was not convicted of two other charges brought against her -- inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs, her lawyer said. Gibbons, 54, was arrested Sunday after she asked her class of 7-year-olds in Khartoum to name the stuffed animal as part of a school project, the British Foreign Office said. She had faced charges under Article 125 of Sudan's constitution, the law relating to insulting religion and inciting hatred. Although there is no ban in the Quran on images of Allah or the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder, likenesses are considered highly offensive by Muslims. Watch latest developments in the case. ». Appearing somber and dazed, Gibbons arrived at the central courthouse in Khartoum for her closed hearing early Thursday. A staff member from the British Embassy in Khartoum and defense lawyers attended the hearing with her. The courthouse was heavily guarded by police, who kept journalists -- and, for a while, even one of her attorneys -- away. Gibbons could have faced a sentence of 40 lashes, a fine, or a jail term of up to a year, according to the Foreign Office, which expressed Britain's dissatisfaction with the verdict. ""We are extremely disappointed that the charges against Gillian Gibbons were not dismissed,"" Foreign Secretary David Miliband said in a statement issued shortly after the verdict was announced. ""As I said this morning, our clear view is that this is an innocent misunderstanding by a dedicated teacher. Our priority now is to ensure Ms. Gibbons' welfare, and we will continue to provide consular assistance to her. I have called in the Sudanese ambassador, Omer Siddig, this evening to explain the decision and discuss next steps."" Watch a report on reactions to the verdict ». The Foreign Office said Gibbons would be given credit for the four days since her arrest, meaning that the she has 11 days remaining on her sentence. Earlier, Miliband had met with Siddig, who was summoned to the Foreign Office in London. ""I explained to him that we were very concerned by the case. We believe that this was an innocent misunderstanding,"" Miliband said in a statement released Thursday after the meeting. ""The Sudanese ambassador undertook to ensure our concerns were relayed to Khartoum at the highest level. He also said he would reflect back to Khartoum the real respect for the Islamic religion in this country,"" the statement added. On the first floor of the courthouse, around 25 police linked arms and forced journalists and British officials away from the court entrance. Police detained some journalists, and confiscated a camera belonging to a freelance CNN cameraman. Four vans filled with riot police were waiting outside the courthouse, but there were no signs of street disturbances or protests. Staff from Gibbons' school, including Robert Boulos, the head of Unity High School, were present. The staff members refused to comment on their colleague's predicament. On Wednesday, Boulos said he was ""horrified"" when he found out that the complaint about the naming of the bear came from a member of his own staff -- not from a parent, as originally thought. Defense counsel later confirmed that the complaint came from Sarah Khawad, a secretary at the school. Gibbons has been working at the school -- popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates -- since August, after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool, England, this summer, Boulos said. He said Gibbons asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot, which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats.

"Summary: Chavez says Uribe had asked him to help secure the release of hostages. Uribe cited Chavez's direct communication with Uribe's top general as breach. Chavez accuses Uribe of lying. Chavez says his arms are open to the Colombian people. Article: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Wednesday he is cutting all ties with Colombia as long as Alvaro Uribe remains its president. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe withdrew his support for the Venezuelan leader's mediation efforts with the FARC. ""I say before the world, while President Uribe is president of Colombia, I will not have any type of relation with him or with the government of Colombia,"" Chavez said in an address broadcast on national television. ""I can't, I can't, I can't."" Chavez noted that Uribe had asked him to help secure the release of hundreds of hostages being held by the leftist rebel group Armed Revolutionary Front of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). ""I went with my heart in my hand, and I was ready,"" Chavez told a group of supporters in the southwestern state of Tachira. ""I was prepared to go to the most dangerous forest in the country to help.""

"Summary: CNN Medical Unit assignment manager Ann Curley is a type I diabetic. She learned she had diabetes when she was 7 years old. Testing progressed from fizzy tablets in urine to continuous glucose monitors. With changes in technology have come improvements in prognoses. Article: When I was 7 years old, my mom took me to the doctor because I had lost a lot of weight, despite a voracious appetite. My family had just moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Pasadena, California, and this visit to the doctor's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life. His name was Dr. Robert Deputy, and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes. He spoke to me directly, rather than to my mother, and he asked me questions: Did I feel thirsty? Did I need to urinate during the night? The answer to both questions was yes. He asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate. Dr. Deputy told me and my mother that my body wasn't processing sugar properly. I had diabetes. That is how my 40-year journey with diabetes began. I was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar, give myself injections of insulin, follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes. I spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease, and then they sent me home. Dr. Deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how I was doing. Much to my parents' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself. I refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine. This demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons, and not just for managing my diabetes. While some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden, I feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise. It forced our family to eat healthily, and it taught me about good nutrition -- something I practice every day. I know carbohydrate counts in most foods, and I understand dietary concepts that most people don't even care about. Being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar, so when my urine tested positive for glucose, my older sister Robin was in charge of exercising me. We had countless jump-rope contests, bike rides and roller-skating excursions, keeping me and my three sisters active and fit. And I felt like a little mad scientist, using a test tube with drops of water, urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine. Fortunately, over time, technology improved. First, test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it. But the truth is, testing urine for sugar was a primitive method. By the time sugar gets into the urine, it's a signal that the body doesn't have enough insulin to process sugar. And the urine test didn't give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine. It simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine. Inaccurate was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing. Home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s, and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes. With the kit, the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood. The blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds. While I initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day, now I can't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing. The 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump. This device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin. The reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt. So rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body's insulin patterns, the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant, then gives extra amounts with meals. Another life-altering development in diabetes, which I have discovered in the last year, is the continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. This is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen, hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body's fluids. The data is transmitted to a receiver, and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels. I have participated in clinical trials for three different CGM devices, and I found them all to be quite accurate. Some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump, so you can use the reading to adjust and fine-tune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body. The patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated, but it's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars. CGM technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type I diabetes using what's called a ""closed loop system."" This means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself. The current systems are ""open looped,"" meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given. The goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system, and all the patient has to do is wear it. Once that technology is perfected, this type of device would be implanted, which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes. I mentioned to my sister Robin that I had tracked down Dr. Deputy for this article. She told me something I didn't know when I was 7. Forty years ago, before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing, parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare. Dr. Deputy told my parents that I would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30, which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out. I spoke with Dr. Deputy, who recently retired from his pediatric practice, and he seemed to remember me. When I asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival, he said sadly, ""At that time, that was what we told parents back then. ... Everything changes with time -- diabetes, leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment."" I think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong. I know that I certainly am. In fact, I am hoping to live another 40 years!",0
"Summary: Former Wales and British Lions center Ray Gravell has died aged 56. He was on holiday with his family in Mallorca. After retiring he worked as an actor and broadcaster. Article: Former Wales and British Lions center Ray Gravell has died of a suspected heart attack aged 56, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has announced. Gravell won 23 caps for Wales and played on the Lions tour of South Africa in 1980. Gravell had been on holiday with his family in the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca at the time. A WRU statement praised Gravell as being ""a man who epitomized the passion, flair and dignity of his beloved Welsh nation."" Gravell made his debut for Wales against France in 1975, three years after helping his club side Llanelli to their famous win over the touring All Blacks. In all he made 23 appearances for what was then a dominant Wales side, winning Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978, and played all four Tests on the Lions' tour of South Africa in 1980. After retiring as a player in 1985, Gravell became president of Llanelli RFC and the Llanelli Scarlets. He also pursued a career as an actor and a respected rugby broadcaster. Earlier this year, Gravell had his right leg amputated below the knee following complications linked with his diabetes but he had been recovering well. WRU chief executive Roger Lewis said: ""We are all in total shock because Ray was so full of life even through the difficult health problems he suffered recently. ""He was a wonderful ambassador for rugby and for Wales and a great example of how the game can bring out the best in a man. ""As a player, he always gave a huge amount of respect to his opponents but never gave an inch of ground to anyone he faced on the field of play. ""It is a measure of the man that he forged rugby friendships which lasted long after his playing days up until the present day.""",0

The ensuing controversy highlighted that Obama's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of ""change"" is not without some serious pitfalls. When the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city ""Embrace the Change!"" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Donnie McClurkin. The Grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was ""once involved with those desires and those thoughts"" but was able to get past them through prayer. To say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. John Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign, writing that the Illinois Democrat was ""sucking up to anti-gay bigots"" and ""giving them a stage."" When the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Obama campaign by surprise. Obama's efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted African-American churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in South Carolina from rival Sen. Hillary Clinton. The campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate's faith, launching ""40 Days of Faith and Family"" in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate. Campaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a ""Christian family man,"" that aired on gospel stations across the state. Earlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Christian vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that ""I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth."" After that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values. ""I think that what you're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s,"" Obama said. ""At least in politics, the perception was that the Democrats were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away."" But on Tuesday, Obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some Christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks. Obama issued a statement saying, ""I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] McClurkin's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the United States,"" and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious African Americans. A September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that ""sex between two adults of the same sex"" is ""strongly unacceptable."" Obama held a conference call Wednesday with Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and announced that the Rev. Andy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event as McClurkin on Sunday in Columbia. Solomonese was not completely assuaged. ""I spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our community's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to 'break the curse of homosexuality,'"" he said in a statement. ""There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin's message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That's a message that certainly doesn't belong on any presidential candidate's stage."" The State newspaper in Columbia reported Friday that Obama organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders. After the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sunday's concert in Columbia. Privately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the McClurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences. Will Obama's refusal to kick McClurkin off the concert bill hurt him? Like many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. And in South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all.",0
"Summary: Atletico Madrid bounce back to form with a superb 4-0 victory over Zaragoza. Maxi Rodriguez scores twice with Luis Garcia and Diego Forlan also on target. Getafe registered their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory over Murcia. Article: Atletico Madrid recovered from their painful recent defeat by Barcelona to crush European rivals Real Zaragoza 4-0 in the Primera Liga on Sunday. Luis Garcia celebrates his first Atletico Madrid goal in their superb 4-0 victory over Real Zaragoza. Luis Garcia's first goal for the club, a double from Argentine Maxi Rodriguez and a Diego Forlan strike clinched a comfortable win as Atletico moved up to sixth in the table. It was also sweet revenge for Atletico as Zaragoza beat them home and away last season to beat them to sixth place and the final UEFA Cup spot. Atletico went ahead in the 10th minute when Forlan picked out a precise pass for Garcia who made no mistake with a calm side-footed finish. Forlan then got on the scoresheet himself with a first-time lob on 34 minutes for his third goal of the season, before Rodriguez stole the show with two more goals. Getafe registered their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory over Murcia. Substitute Kepa, who was later sent off, opened the scoring in the 54th minute and Francisco Casero added a second five minutes later to clinch the points. Elsewhere last season's second division champions Valladolid continue to struggle in the top flight, crashing to a 2-1 defeat against Athletic Bilbao. Artiz Aduriz scored twice for Bilbao after eight and 31 minutes to leave Valladolid second from bottom with promoted Levante, who have a meagre one point, propping up the table.",0

"Summary: Condoleezza Rice responds to foreign service officers' objections on Iraq duty. ""Directed assignments"" will be enforced if enough officers don't volunteer in Iraq. Rice: Department doing ""everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats"" One official calls order to serve in Iraq ""a potential death sentence"" Article: State Department officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says that ""people need to serve where they are needed."" Rice was responding to foreign service officers' objections to the possibility of ""directed assignments"" in Iraq. The issue has caused an uproar in the State Department, resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting Wednesday. The new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers don't step forward to fill open positions at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. If the State Department enforces directed assignments, it will be the first time since the Vietnam War era. One official called the order to serve in Iraq ""a potential death sentence"" during the town meeting. The State Department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates. Those chosen will be given 10 days to respond, according to last week's announcement. Unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse, those who decline could face dismissal, it said. Wednesday's heated meeting was replayed on an internal State Department television channel in Washington several times and talked about widely. Some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly, learning about it instead from news organizations last week. Watch the diplomats exchange angry words ». ""I just have no respect for the whole process because you've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues,"" said foreign service officer Jack Croddy. ""Thank you for that comment. It's full of inaccuracies, but that's OK,"" Harry Thomas Jr., director general of the foreign service, shot back. Others pointed out the risks of such assignments, considering the dangers of a war zone, lack of security and regular rocket attacks on U.S. personnel. Rice, who did not attend the meeting, tried to calm things down Friday by underscoring the State Department's attempts to do ""everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats."" However, she said, ""This is one of the highest priority tasks of the United States, and we're going to meet our obligations."" Speaking to reporters en route to Turkey and the Mideast, she said, ""I don't know if we will have direct assignments or not, but we are one foreign service, and people need to serve where they are needed."" The secretary sent out a cable to State Department employees worldwide encouraging them to serve in Iraq. ""This year [U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker] has identified the need for additional positions to more effectively accomplish our mission in Iraq,"" Rice said in the cable. Rice said she has decided to go forward with the identification of officers to serve, ""should it prove necessary to direct assignments."" ""Should others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before -- with volunteers. However, regardless of how the jobs may be filled, they must be filled,"" she said. Rice earlier said reports that the State Department was finding it hard to coax foreign service employees into Iraq ""couldn't be further from the truth."" The assignments are new positions. Fifteen people have stepped forward to volunteer for Iraq service since the new policy was announced October 26, department spokesman Sean McCormack said. McCormack rejected comments by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, that State Department employees are ""nervous Nellies"" and that wounded U.S. military veterans should be asked to fill the Iraq vacancies. McCormack said until now the State Department has been successful in filling jobs in Iraq with volunteers. Since 2003, more than 1,500 personnel have volunteered to go to Iraq, he said. But with the expansion of the staff in Iraq this year, 58 spots were left open. ""They are serving in dangerous and challenging places,"" he said. ""We have a lot of brave people who are stepping up to the plate in Anbar and Basra and Baghdad and Kabul and a lot of other places that are not necessarily in the headlines."" State Department employees have been killed in Iraq, but McCormack could not say how many. CNN's Zain Verjee and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Qualcomm Stadium to close as an emergency shelter at noon Friday. Charred bodies of three men and a woman found near San Diego. More than half of Southern California fires are fully contained. Bush to fire victims: We're not going to forget you in Washington. Article: Favorable weather and firefighter reinforcements helped ease the fire danger in parts of Southern California Thursday, but the human toll from the disaster was still coming to light. A firefighter watches the Harris Fire. Four bodies were found in a canyon in the path of the blaze Thursday. The number of deaths attributed directly to the fires grew to seven Thursday, after the charred bodies of four people believed to be illegal immigrants were found in a canyon east of San Diego. Seven other deaths are labeled as fire-related: Three elderly people died during evacuations, and four others died after being evacuated. Improving conditions allowed more people to come home Thursday, but new evacuations were ordered in areas where the unrelenting flames marched on. Where residents could return, they often found ash and rubble in place of their homes. ""We see pictures from online and on TV, but it's just, it's much different when you see it up front,"" said Louela Binlac in front of what remained of her Rancho Bernardo home. ""The most important thing is that our family is still together, everybody is safe, and eventually we will rebuild again,"" she said. ""Those things you can replace. We are just all grateful that everybody is safe."" Rancho Bernardo resident Marilyn Wood said it was ""really scary"" to come back to the pile of ashes she once called home. Her voice breaking, Wood vowed to rebuild and recounted how she and her husband, Gordon, fled early Monday with only minutes to spare. See photos of the fires ». ""(Our house) was burning as we were leaving,"" she said. President Bush got a firsthand look at the aftermath of the devastating fires Thursday -- 10 still burning across seven counties. He promised federal help for those affected by the fires. Watch Bush tour the damage ». ""We're not going to forget you in Washington, D.C.,"" the president said after touring the area by air and visiting Rancho Bernardo with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Watch a report on Bush as 'comforter-in-chief' ». Bush signed a federal disaster declaration Wednesday, freeing money to help residents rent temporary homes and repair damaged homes and businesses and to help local and state agencies pay for the emergency response. The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top $1 billion in San Diego County alone, an emergency official said. People left homeless by the fires can apply online for federal help at FEMA.gov, said Federal Emergency Management Agency Director David Paulison. Watch a tour of FEMA's command center ». Almost 9,000 firefighters battled the blazes, augmented by reinforcements from dozens of states across the country. Twenty-three fires have scorched 472,478 acres (738 square miles), an area roughly three-quarters of the size of Rhode Island. See where the fires are still burning ». Along with homes and businesses, the flames have destroyed roughly one-third of San Diego County's lucrative avocado crop, along with other croplands, greenhouses and nurseries. A change in the winds -- from a ferocious 100 mph on Sunday to an almost manageable 10 mph on Thursday -- brought welcome relief and allowed a full-bore aerial assault on the fires. Reinforcements from across the country arrived to aid the exhausted firefighters, officials said. While the fires still threatened some 25,000 homes, the burn rate in the region -- a measure made up of factors like wind speed, humidity and available fuel -- was significantly lower Thursday, a spokeswoman at the California Department of Forestry and Protection said. Residents of several communities, including the city of San Diego, were allowed to return home Wednesday and Thursday, but more evacuations were ordered -- the latest covering the communities of Lake Henshaw and Mesa Grande and the La Jolla Indian Reservation in San Diego County. With the shifting fires, some shelters closed as others opened closer to danger. In San Diego, Mayor Jerry Sanders announced that Qualcomm Stadium -- the home of NFL's Chargers that held 11,000 evacuees at the height of the fires but dropped to 750 Wednesday night -- would close to evacuees. ""As we transition from a large-scale emergency evacuation center into the recovery process, we have begun assisting all evacuees to find more suitable shelter and housing,"" Sanders said. ""Toward that end, Qualcomm will close as an emergency shelter at noon tomorrow [Friday]."" Meanwhile, arson investigations were under way in Orange and Riverside counties in connection with some of the wildfires. Watch how arson investigators look for clues ». The Orange County Sheriff's Department announced a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the 23,000-acre Santiago fire, local officials said. Watch the raging flames of the Santiago Fire ». ""For someone to even think about doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire, where they knew that the fire would grow as rapidly as it would, traveling about three, 3½ miles in about an hour, is just, is really absolutely unconscionable,"" Orange County Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion said on CNN's ""American Morning."" The FBI and the ATF are assisting Orange County authorities with the investigation. In addition, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection considers the Rosa fire in Riverside County an arson case. That fire burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained. In other arson investigations, two men have been arrested in San Bernardino County, one in San Fernando and an adult and a juvenile in San Diego County. None are believed connected with the major fires burning in the area. Copyright 2007 CNN. All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

"Summary: Navy says it has lost confidence in officer's ability to command. Crew members on sub disciplined for faking inspection records, Navy says. Ten people have been relieved of duty; six received ""nonjudicial punishment"" Article: The commander of the nuclear-powered submarine USS Hampton has been relieved of his command amid an inquiry into misconduct by crew members, the U.S. Navy said Friday. The USS Hampton appears in an undated photograph. Cmdr. Michael B. Portland lost his post ""due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command,"" the Navy said in a statement. Cmdr. William J. Houston will replace Portland. The crew neither maintained inspection records nor conducted the required inspection of chemical levels associated with the cooling system of the ship's nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. The crew then went back and falsified existing records to make it appear the work had been done. ""There is not, and never was, any danger to the crew or the public,"" the Navy said. Portland's demotion brings to 10 the number of people relieved of duty on the submarine in the wake of the misconduct probe. Six personnel have been punished for forging inspection records for the cooling system, the Navy officials said Monday. Those six -- one officer and five enlisted personnel -- received a ""nonjudicial punishment"" after other Navy personnel discovered their actions, the officials said. The Navy said Friday that one officer and two enlisted crew members have been temporarily reassigned to Submarine Squadron 11. Portland also will be temporarily reassigned to that squadron. The misconduct was discovered September 17 but not made public until after completion of an initial inquiry. A fact-finding investigation is under way, and further action against Navy crew members is possible, a Navy official said. The Hampton remains in port in San Diego, California. In all, the $900 million vessel's crew includes 13 officers and 116 enlisted personnel.",0
"Summary: Bus driver, tractor-trailer trucker injured in 3-vehicle crash, AP reports. Bus crossed median, hit pickup truck, then 18-wheeler, killing 3.

Article: A bus hopped a highway median and crashed into a pickup truck before being broadsided by an 18-wheeler, Arkansas police said, killing the pickup driver and two bus riders. Two passengers were found dead inside the bus, said Arkansas State Police. Forty people were hurt in Sunday night's crash, which shut down a 13-mile stretch of Interstate-40 east of Forrest City, Arkansas, said state police spokesman Bill Sadler. The bus was westbound en route from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas. The driver of the pickup truck -- identified as 30-year-old Danny Okurily of Hot Springs, Arkansas -- died at the scene of the accident, Sadler said. Bus driver Felix Tapia, 28, of Brownsville, Texas, and tractor-trailer driver David Rice, 45, of Mars Hill, North Carolina, suffered minor injuries, according to The Associated Press. Two passengers were also found dead inside the bus, he said. Their names were not released because authorities have not yet notified relatives, Sadler said. Several dozen injured passengers were taken to hospitals in Forrest City, Memphis and West Memphis, said police. The bus, which listed 44 passengers on its manifest, was owned and operated by the Tornado Bus Line, which is based in Dallas, Texas, Sadler said.

"Summary: Kelly Pless started gaining as a teen and weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest. Exercise and an ""eat to live"" eating philosophy helped her shed 95 pounds. Pless started out walking but now runs 40 miles a week. She is training to run two marathons this winter. Article: If someone had asked Kelly Pless to describe herself three years ago, the word ""fit"" would have never crossed her mind. Kelly Pless weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest. She lost 95 pounds through diet and exercise. For most of her adult life, the 31-year-old graduate student from Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, has struggled with her weight. She started gaining as a teenager and by the time she graduated from high school, she was carrying 215 pounds on her 5' 2"" frame. Prom, she says, was a nightmare. ""I had to go to three different stores to buy a dress,"" Pless said. ""I had to buy the biggest, also the ugliest, prom dress the store had because it was the only one that would fit."" After high school, she lost 50 pounds. But because she hadn't done it in a healthy way, her weight crept back up to 220 pounds. At 28, she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame. She reached her breaking point. ""I remember being heavy and feeling like being fit just wasn't something I could be,"" said Pless. ""I remember feeling like even if I tried, it wasn't something my body was capable of."" Despite her doubts, Pless decided to do something. Fortunately she didn't have to look far for inspiration. See before and after weight loss photos from CNN.com I-Reporters ». ""My manager at the Kennedy Space Center ran marathons, and he was the same age as my father,"" she said. Because her own father had diabetes and was in poor health, he seemed much older, she said. Over the next three to four months, she began walking, without any real goal or expectation. Pless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more, everything would fall into place. ""At first, it was hard to start exercising because I was worried people would make fun of me,"" Pless said. ""But then I just told myself, if that's the worst that could happen ... I just got out there and didn't care."" Eventually, she started to run or ""shuffle"" as she jokingly recalls. She also adopted an ""eat to live"" philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit. ""I changed how I felt about food and what it meant to me,"" said Pless, who occasionally indulges in a bite of birthday cake or a piece of chocolate. ""One of the first things I cut out was cakes and cookies. That was my weak spot. After a few months of cutting those things out, I focused more on portion control,"" said Pless. ""I pretty much eat when I'm hungry and don't eat when I'm not and really try to pay attention to when those times are. Make sure I'm not eating out of boredom or [at] social events, I try to make sure I'm not overeating, just because everyone else is."" Kelly Pless shares her weight loss secrets ». Pless pays close attention to societal pressure, which she believes is the reason many people overeat. Restaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size, she says. She makes sure she doesn't overeat when dining out simply because the food is there. ""What's hard is to change how you feel about foods that you love or that aren't necessarily good for you, or actually change how you look at food. That was the hardest part for me."" Instead of giving in to the temptation or convenience of calorie-laden or fatty foods such as cheeseburgers from the drive-through, Pless asks herself, ""What do I really want to eat? Or, what does my body really want right now?"" All of the hard work and determination paid off. Pless has lost 95 pounds and kept it off for 1½ years. As a result, she says, she's healthier and more confident. She's also set a new professional goal -- to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology -- so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders. ""[The] negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently. Being fat was a good filter -- I'm automatically treated better by people because I'm thinner. Society is so hard on people who are overweight or obese,"" said Pless. ""Now, those people think I'm funnier or smarter."" Pless runs about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to run this winter. The first is in November in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the second is in Miami, Florida, in January. Forty pounds ago, the first thing she wanted to do once she lost the weight was to have a tummy tuck to remove all of the loose skin. But now, she said she can't imagine taking the break from running that recovering from surgery would require. ""Running has become a constant for me and does so much more for me than maintain my weight, which is now about 125 pounds,"" said Pless. If her past is any indication of her future success, Pless will certainly cross the finish line. I-Report: Have you lost weight? Share your story, tips and photos",0
"Summary: Singapore Airlines A380 superjumbo completes historic maiden flight. Luxury first class cabins have separate leather seats and double beds. One passenger paid $100,000 for the first Singapore to Sydney trip. Article: It was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week the Singapore Airline-owned A380 completed its maiden passenger journey between Singapore and Sydney. Making history: the first double bed on a commercial jet. On board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. This was a turning point in aviation history as Airbus' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft. And the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration. Singapore Airlines' CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the ""queen of the skies"". Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds. And CNN's Richard Quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was ""nothing quite like it"". The luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel. It's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. But the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the Singapore Airlines A380 is its ''beyond first class"" cabins. Behind the sliding doors of the Singapore Airlines Suites, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading French yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste. There's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed. This is two meters long with Givenchy duvets and cushions. And for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds. From bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen LCD. Laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a USB ports and access a suite of office tools on Singapore Airlines' in-flight entertainment system. Celebrity chefs including Britain's Gordon Ramsay and Georges Blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off Givenchy tableware. Unlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future A380s, Singapore Airlines has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money. As Chew Choon Seng, CEO of Singapore Airlines reminded reporters last week, the first Boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. Behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide. Singapore Airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion. The second is due to arrive next February with further deliveries later in 2008. Tickets for the A380's first return commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney were sold at auction on eBay. One passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000. The $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Singapore, Sydney and a global humanitarian organization. From Sunday 28 October, Singapore Airlines will commence its scheduled service between Singapore and Sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction. The jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between Singapore and London's Heathrow Airport. It's been a long road to this point for Airbus, but the journey is by no means over. The airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below). Next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010. Tom Enders, Airbus' CEO doesn't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead. ""This is not a piece of cake,"" he told CNN, ""but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers."" It hasn't just been Airbus that has been frantically preparing for the A380 launch. Airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks. Seventy airports are now ready, Airbus has said. Singapore's Changi Airport, home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks. Heathrow's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time. British Airways, the Terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants BAA to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them. As Willie Walsh, BA's CEO told CNN, ""we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind."" But whether the arrival of the A380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided. As CNN's Richard Quest points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as Boeing's up-coming 787 Dreamliner. As Richard Quest says, ""there's no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount Airbus needs to make money."" But those worries, he adds, are for another day. Thursday was a day for celebration. SOME KEY FIGURES. Orders. Total: 185 orders (165 firm orders) 15 customers.

"Summary: Illegal exports to Iran, China an increasing problem, Justice Department says. Pittsburgh company cited for export of products with nuclear applications. Utah men charged with attempting to illegally export jet fighter parts. Article: The illegal export of U.S. military technology to Iran and China poses a growing threat, the Justice Department said Thursday as it announced plans to combat the practice. Iran is the only country still flying the F-14 Tomcat. The department said the United States will tighten monitoring of export licenses and increase export restrictions on technologies that could have both civilian and military applications and could pose a danger to U.S. national security in the hands of terrorists or potential enemies. ""China and Iran pose particular U.S. export control concerns,"" the Justice Department said in a statement issued Thursday. ""Recent prosecutions have highlighted illegal exports of stealth missile technology, military aircraft components, naval warship data, night vision equipment, and other restricted technology destined for China or Iran."" Representatives of more than a half dozen federal agencies will jointly announce their plans at a Justice Department news conference Thursday. Officials plan to highlight two recent cases. In the past week a Pittsburgh company, SparesGlobal Inc., was sentenced for lying about an illegal export of products that can be used in nuclear reactions and in the nose cones of ballistic missiles. The products ended up in Pakistan after being routed from the United Arab Emirates. In Utah, two men were charged last week with attempting to illegally export restricted components for F-4 and F-14 fighter jets. F-14 components are widely sought by Iran, which is the only military in the world that still flies the jet. CNN's Terry Frieden contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Saudi Arabia is the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East. Britain is also the second largest foreign investor in the Kingdom. The UK has been one of the top five exporters to Saudi Arabia since the 1990s. Exports to Britain are expected to reach a record high in the non-oil sector. Article: Behind the state banquet and smiles from Queen Elizabeth and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's visit to London this week caused a wave of dissent. The UK political elite boycotted events. Demonstrators lined the Mall. The UK foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi counterpart to be with his new adopted son. And just days before he arrived, the Saudi King accused British officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in London on July 2005. Whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate. But this was just part of the story. The Saudis were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two Kingdoms over the last 20 years. Saudi Arabia is the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East. And behind the USA, the UK is the second largest foreign investor in the Kingdom. UK Trade & Investment has designated Saudi Arabia one of its 17 ""High Growth Markets"" along with UAE and Qatar in the region. As the nation diversifies its economy away from oil, commercial opportunities for UK thrive in a variety of sectors. Saudi Arabia is currently planning six privately-developed economic cities. The $26.6 billion King Abdullah Economic City -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents. The aim, says the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment, and attracting investors and fostering investment opportunities. The UK has, since the early 1990s, been one of the top five exporters to Saudi Arabia, behind USA, Germany, China and Japan. In 2007, Saudi Arabian bank SABB predicts that UK exports to the Kingdom will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $2.8 billion. While the balance of trade continues to be favor of the British, Saudi Arabia's exports to Britain are also gaining ground and closing the trade gap. This year, exports to Britain are expected to reach a record high of $2.1 billion, says SABB. And this isn't all about oil. In the 1980s, three quarters of Saudi exports to the UK were from oil, but today the non-oil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports. Products being shipped to the UK include machinery, transport equipment, plastics, non-metallic minerals and, despite the UK's dominance in the sector, chemicals. According to SABB, there are also more than 150 Saudi-British joint ventures underway with a value of around $15 billion. As John Sfakianakis, chief economist from SABB says, state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks, past and future. ""The biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon Jets that was sealed last week,"" says Sfakianakis. The contract between the Kingdom and the UK Ministry of Defence via BAE is worth over almost $10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $19 billion for the deployment, maintenance and training. This comes less than a year after the UK government decided to call off a Serious Fraud Office investigation into defense contracts with Saudi Arabia. This probe related to the sale of weapons by BAE Systems to Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. BAE has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to Saudi royals to win business. But as Sfakianakis points out, any political sensitivity surrounding the visit is unlikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations. ""The relationship is far deeper than that,"" he says. ""Saudi Arabia's economy is booming and the opportunities businessmen see here are immense. Everything else takes a subsidiary part in that.""",0
"Summary: Genarlow Wilson: Accepting plea deal would have left him without a home. Wilson, 21, promises to be more conservative, alert and thankful in future. He plans to study sociology in college -- ""I feel like I've been living my major"" Wilson served two years in prison after consensual oral sex with teen girl. Article: Genarlow Wilson, freed last week from a Georgia prison, said he's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors, even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier. Genarlow Wilson tells CNN on Sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future. The 21-year-old, who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation, said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal. He had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day, he said Sunday. ""It might've been lesser time, but then again, I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home,"" Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. ""I wouldn't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister. You know, when you're a sex offender you can't be around kids. Basically, I can't even have kids myself, you know, so what is the point of life?"" he asked. In 2005, a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 New Year's Eve party. Wilson was 17 at the time of the party. Watch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal ». The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation. According to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, prosecutors in Douglas County, Georgia, offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence, possibly to time served, and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record. Defense attorney B.J. Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence. The state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors. However, the Legislature did not make the law retroactive, so it had no effect on Wilson's sentence. Now 21, Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the young man's sentence ""constitutes cruel and unusual punishment."" Wilson said Sunday he feels no ""negative energy"" toward District Attorney David McDade, who fought efforts to have Wilson's sentence reduced. Instead, Wilson said, he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies. He wants to major in sociology, he said, ""because I feel like I've been living my major."" The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative, more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him, he said. ""When it seems like you have everything, you know, you feel like you have no worries until it's all gone, and I know what it feels like to be without and I don't want to ever feel like that again,"" said the former honor student, football star and homecoming king. ""I don't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison, period."" Though he called his sentence ""absurd,"" Wilson said he understands that prosecutors ""were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law."" Wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish. ""I was young then. I did some idiotic things in my teen years, but you know, every average teen does,"" he said. ""I don't think any of us made very wise decisions, but I don't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened.""",0
"Summary: Feinstein, Schumer say they'll vote for attorney general nominee. Michael Mukasey's nomination now expected to pass Judiciary Committee. Sen. Patrick Leahy says he will not vote to confirm Michael Mukasey. Committee scheduled to vote on nomination on Tuesday. Article: The confirmation of Michael Mukasey as attorney general was all but assured Friday when two key Democratic senators said they will vote in favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on ""waterboarding"" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Charles Schumer of New York announced they would support the retired federal judge from New York just hours after the chairman of the Judiciary Committee announced his opposition to the nominee. Feinstein and Schumer are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to vote on the Mukasey nomination Tuesday. If all the Republican members of the committee also vote for Mukasey, which is expected, his nomination will go before the full Senate. A leading Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday Mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the Judiciary Committee. Schumer had praised the nomination of Mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced Mukasey as his choice to replace former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Gonzales gave up the post in September. ""This is an extremely difficult decision,"" Schumer said. ""When an administration so political, so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge, we are never left with an ideal choice. Judge Mukasey is not my ideal choice. However, Judge Mukasey, whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him, is far better than anyone could expect from this administration."" A number of Democratic senators, however, have said they will oppose Mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called ""waterboarding"" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding ""repugnant,"" but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture. While saying ""serious questions have been raised about Judge Mukasey's views on torture and on separation of powers,"" Feinstein said she would support the nominee because the Justice Department needed fresh leadership. ""First and foremost, Michael Mukasey is not Alberto Gonzales. Rather, he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the Southern District of New York. ""I believe that Judge Mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments, allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by Congress."" Just hours before Feinstein and Schumer announced their decisions, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, announced he would vote against the Mukasey nomination. Watch Sen. Leahy explain why he can't support the Mukasey nomination ». ""No American should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture,"" Leahy said. ""Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the Spanish Inquisition. We prosecuted Japanese war criminals for waterboarding after World War II. ""I am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the Department of Justice. I like Michael Mukasey. I wish that I could support his nomination. But I cannot. America needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one, not even the president, is above the law."" President Bush demanded the Senate confirm Mukasey during a speech Thursday at the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank. ""In a time of war, it's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place,"" the president said. The president has equated asking Mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the CIA-run interrogation program, whose details are classified. Bush said the program does not violate U.S. bans on torture, but added that Mukasey ""does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy."" But Leahy said ""Judge Mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret 'facts and circumstances.' "" ""He was asked whether waterboarding is illegal. Our law makes torture illegal, and waterboarding is torture, and it is illegal. It is frankly not dependent on any, quote, 'relevant facts and circumstances of the technique's past or proposed use,' "" he said, quoting from Mukasey's response to senators on the question. Sources with knowledge of the CIA-run interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding. But those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al Qaeda's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. The practice was used by the Spanish Inquisition, Cambodia's Khmer Rouge and the World War II Japanese military, according to Human Rights Watch. It is specifically banned in U.S. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the U.S. military. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Death toll rises to nine as tour bus runs off highway, rolls over. Bus was carrying at least 50 people when it crashed in southeastern Utah. Bus was en route from Telluride, Colorado, to Phoenix, Arizona, after weekend ski trip. Article: Nine people were killed and 19 injured after a tour bus carrying people on a ski trip left a highway and rolled over Sunday night in southeastern Utah, a highway patrol spokesman said. The seats of the bus that rolled over are exposed to the snow at the crash site in southeastern Utah on Monday. At least 50 people were on the Arrow Stage Lines bus when it crashed on state Highway 163, about five miles north of Mexican Hat, at 7:30 p.m. (9:30 p.m. ET), said Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Cameron Roden. Troopers reported the road was wet but not icy, he said. The bus was traveling south from Telluride, Colorado, to Phoenix, Arizona, when it left the right side of the highway and rolled over, Roden said. See where the crash occurred ». Police said the bus lost control on a curve, ran off the road and rolled over several times, tumbling 41 feet down an embankment, according to The Associated Press. ""When the vehicle was overturning, the roof of the bus split open and multiple occupants of the vehicle were ejected,"" Roden told the AP. Watch how the crash left the bus a mangled hulk ». Rescue crews took the injured people to hospitals in Utah, Colorado and Arizona, he said. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that ambulances from Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico responded to the accident, and a helicopter from Colorado could not fly to the crash site because of winter storms. Four of the dead were male and five were female, the Utah Highway Patrol said. Most of the passengers were returning home from a weekend ski trip to Telluride, he said.

"Summary: British graphic artist's identity remains a mystery despite huge popularity. Feted by the art world and Hollywood celebrities count among his collectors. Despite popularity local authorities have removed his public works. Article: Banksy is Britain's most wanted artist -- his art sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but he continues to use public spaces as his main canvas, while all the time keeping his identity a secret. Banksy's latest piece in East London where a passer-by claims to have taken a photo of the artist. The guerilla artist has been spray painting his stencils around Britain and further afield for over ten years. Last week ten of his original pieces were sold at Bonham's auction house in London for over $1 million, while on the other side of the city Tower Hamlets council authority pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets. From his beginnings as a graffiti artist in Bristol, England, Banksy has become the darling of the art world for his subversive and satirical public art. Depicting things such as riot police with smiley acid-house faces and camera-wielding rats, his work is now sold now by major art galleries. Lazarides Gallery in London is one of the main dealers of his work and describes him as ""a media star...but popular long before any of this high-profile activity -- simply because the people love his stuff."" While he set out to lampoon the establishment, he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it. Fans include Hollywood A-listers, including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera who bought three of his prints in 2006, including one of Queen Victoria sitting on a woman's face. The recent sales of his work put him on a par with Jean-Michel Basquiat as the best-selling street artist. He is feted by art dealers and artists, including Damien Hirst, but he regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him with ingenious stunts such as hanging his own work in the Tate gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It took the British Museum eight days to discover the ""prehistoric"" rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley in the British Museum Banksy has hung on a wall. There is often a political message with this work, too. He left an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo prisoner in Disneyland and painted a hole with blue sky on the Palestinian side of the West Bank wall. Despite the huge popularity and exposure of his work, Banksy's identity remains a mystery. As he operates on the fringes of the law with his guerilla art it makes sense, but also adds to his mystique. Some things are know: he's originally from Bristol, is around 30 years old and called Robert or Robin Banks, but it's been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator. He continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art. Veteran British art critic Brian Sewell called Banksy, ""a complete clown, and what he does has absolutely nothing to do with art."" Bristol city council has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces around the city. Other local authorities don't feel the same way. Tower Hamlets and Hackney councils in London have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets. His latest work painted on a wall in East London -- a man in overalls resting next to a giant flower drawn as a continuation from the double yellow lines on the road -- is thought to be the artist's response. But this latest piece may also have revealed what the artist actually looks like. A passer-by took a photo of what is thought to be the artist at work. A spokesperson for Banksy refused to confirm it was him, but did say it was definitely his work.",0
"Summary: Rubbish is piling up on the streets of Naples, with municipal dumps full. Many commentators question the role of the local mafia in the award of contracts. More than $2.5B in emergency funds has been spent on the problem over the years. One dump was going to be a golf course -- residents furious it is being re-opened. Article: The garbage crisis in Naples encompasses the worst Italian clichés, and in particular those of the southern part of this lovely peninsula: mismanagement, political interference, mafia profiteering and the ability of those responsible to deflect the attention and the blame elsewhere. Naples has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash. There is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this: everybody is competent enough (to find a solution) but nobody is responsible (for actually carrying it out). In many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business. Garbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit. In Naples, garbage is also good business, but in the sense that millions, if not billions, of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how. The problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash. The region's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago, and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year. Eight different commissioners have been appointed, but they have all failed to solve the problem. State of emergency means government money: €1.8 billion (more than $2.5 billion) in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem. It is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent. Incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished, either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job, or else because magistrates stopped the work, pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement. One Italian newspaper suggested that a good 20% of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem. More worrying perhaps, is another suggestion: that the local mafia, known as the Camorra, is taking advantage of the situation. As the crisis has worsened over the years, so the Camorra's profits, estimated now at around €1 billion (roughly $1.45 billion), are alleged to have increased. How does the local mafia make money? The Naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation. Once they receive the money, companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or, ironically, at regular city dumps, even if they are overflowing. The mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile. But why are citizens protesting now? Well, the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of Naples and surrounding areas. The problem is that when the site was closed years ago, locals were promised that a golf course would be built there. As a result, many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site. They are now waking up to a mountain of trash instead of 18 holes. A rotten deal indeed.",0
"Summary: Russia to send bomber aircraft on long-range flights on a permanent basis. President Vladimir Putin said the move was in response to security threats. The White House says the flights do not pose a threat to the United States. Article: President Vladimir Putin said on Friday security threats had forced Russia to revive the Soviet-era practice of sending bomber aircraft on regular patrols beyond its borders. A Russian strategic bomber flies over an airfield outside Moscow during an air show. Putin said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across Russia in the early hours of Friday on long-range missions. ""We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis,"" Putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russia's Ural mountains. ""Today, August 17 at 00:00 hours, 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country, along with support and refueling aircraft ... From today such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis. ""We hope our partners will treat this with understanding."" At U.S. President George W. Bush's Texas ranch, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the United States. ""Militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities, so this is not entirely surprising,"" he said. But the sorties are likely to add to Western concern about Russia's growing assertiveness. That trend has prompted some U.S. policymakers to draw parallels with the Cold War. Putin caused a stir this year by saying Russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in Europe if Washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Europe. Russian diplomats have clashed with the United States and European governments on issues such as Kosovo, energy, and Moscow's treatment of its ex-Soviet neighbors. Western military leaders have said this year that Russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period. One Western defense official called the flights ""a little bit of chest-pounding, trying to let people know Russia is back in the game"". Putin said that when Russia had cut its flights in 1992, other military powers had not reciprocated. ""Flights by other countries' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said. That appeared to be a swipe at the U.S. and NATO, whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions. As Putin spoke to reporters and television cameras, four Russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while Russian tanks trundled behind him, even though the exercises had ended long before. During the Cold War, Russian long-range bombers, which can carry strategic nuclear weapons, played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with Western air forces. Earlier this month Russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the Pacific island of Guam, where the U.S. military has a base, and ""exchanged smiles"" with U.S. pilots scrambled to track them. The Pentagon said the Russian aircraft had not come close enough to U.S. ships to prompt American aircraft to react. In July, two Russian Tu-95 ""Bear"" bombers made unusually long sorties over the North Sea, leading Norway and Britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them. Russia's air force said later it was a routine flight.",0
"Summary: Famous American foods created across United States. Connecticut diner claims creation of the hamburger. Onion rings were courtesy of cook at Pig Stand in Texas. Fat Darrell came from ""Grease Trucks"" at Rutgers University. Article: 1. The Hamburger -- Louis' Lunch, New Haven, Connecticut. This burger did not come from Louis' so ketchup is OK. There are competing claims for the coveted ""Inventor of the Hamburger"" title, but according to Louis' Lunch (and the Library of Congress, for that matter), this small New Haven restaurant takes the prize. The story goes something like this: One day in 1900, a rushed businessman asked owner Louis Lassen for something quick that he could eat on the run. Lassen cooked up a beef patty, put it between some bread, and sent the man on his way. Pretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of all-time, huh? If you visit Louis' today, you'll find that not much has changed. The Lassen family still owns and operates the restaurant, the burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves, and, just like then, there is absolutely no ketchup allowed. 2. The Fried Twinkie -- The ChipShop, Brooklyn, New York. Sometimes what counts isn't being the inventor, it's being the innovator. Take the fried Twinkie, for example. The Twinkie -- in all its indestructible glory-- has been around for ages, but when ChipShop owner Christopher Sell had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack, dip it in batter, and deep-fry it, the Twinkie took gluttony to new heights. Even The New York Times raved about how ""something magical"" happens when you taste the deep-fried Twinkie's ""luscious vanilla flavor."" Sell, who was trained in classical French cuisine, didn't start with the Twinkie, though. In his native England, he fried up everything from M&M's to Mars bars. 3. Root Beer Float -- Myers Avenue Red Soda Co., Cripple Creek, Colorado. If you thought what happened up on Cripple Creek only happened in song, you're sorely mistaken. In August of 1893, a failed gold-miner-turned-soda-company-owner named Frank J. Wisner was drinking a bottle of his Myers Avenue Red root beer while looking up at Cow Mountain. Just then, a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain, and Wisner had a brilliant idea -- float a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a glass of his root beer. The new drink was christened the ""black cow"" and became an instant classic. Today, of course, most of us call it a root beer float. 4. Corn Dogs -- Cozy Dog Drive In, Springfield, Illinois. In 1946, Ed Waldmire, Jr., revolutionized the stick-meat world when he debuted the Cozy Dog -- the first corn dog on a stick. At first, he wanted to call his creation the ""Crusty Cur,"" but his wife convinced him to change the name to ""Cozy Dog."" She felt people wouldn't want to eat something described as ""crusty."" Good call, Mrs. Waldmire. Shortly after the Cozy Dog's inception, the Cozy Dog Drive In opened alongside old Route 66 and has been serving up corn dogs ever since. 5. The Pizzeria -- Lombardi's, New York City, New York. Pizza has existed in one form or another for a long time, but America got her first true pizzeria when Gennaro Lombardi opened up a small grocery store in New York City's Little Italy. An employee named Anthony ""Totonno"" Pero started selling pizzas out of the back, and in no time, Lombardi's was concentrating on its burgeoning pizza business instead of plain old groceries. In 1905, the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria, and it's stayed that way ever since. Well, almost. The original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later. On its 100th anniversary in 2005, Lombardi's decided to offer its pizza for the same price it'd been sold for in 1905 -- 5 cents a pie. Needless to say, the line wrapped around the block. 6. Fat Darrell -- R.U. Hungry, New Brunswick, New Jersey. You may not know what the Fat Darrell is, but when you hear what it contains, you'll understand why it's truly a work of inspired genius. Since 1979, Rutgers University has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the ""Grease Trucks."" Originally, they served a sandwich called the Fat Cat, which contained two cheeseburger patties, French fries, lettuce, tomato, and onions. Then one night in 1997, a hungry (and broke) student named Darrell W. Butler convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, French fries, and marinara sauce on a sandwich. Strangely, the concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it, and the Fat Darrell became a mainstay at the Grease Trucks. Hey, not any old sandwich gets to be named Maxim magazine's top ""Meat Hog"" sandwich. 7. Philly Cheesesteak -- Pat's King Of Steaks, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia is known for many things (Ben Franklin, the Liberty Bell, and Rocky, for starters), but fine dining is not really its forte. That's OK, though, because Philly is the home of Pat's King of Steaks, and Pat's King of Steaks is where the Philly cheesesteak was born. One day back in 1932, hot dog stand owners Pasquale (Pat) and Harry Olivieri decided to change things up and make a steak sandwich with onions. A cab driver who ate at Pat's daily insisted on trying the new sandwich, and with the first bite declared, ""Hey, forget 'bout those hot dogs, you should sell these!"" Cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone, so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested. In no time, the modest stand turned into the Pat's that exists today. Controversy remains, however, over who's responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak. Pat's claims it was the first to do so (in 1951), but across-the-street rival Joe Vento of Geno's Steaks (opened 1966) insists he added the finishing touches. 8. Onion Rings -- Pig Stand, Dallas, Texas. According to most sources, the onion ring was invented when a careless cook at a Pig Stand location in Dallas accidentally dropped an onion slice in some batter, then pulled it out and tossed it in the fryer for lack of a better destination. Now, you'd think inventing the onion ring would be enough for one restaurant chain, but not Pig Stand. The company also lays claim to opening America's first drive-in, inventing Texas toast, and being one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs. Not bad for a little outfit from Texas. 9. Derby Pie -- Melrose Inn, Prospect, Kentucky. A Kentucky favorite, derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastry-dough crust -- and that's about all we know about it. Why? Because the recipe is jealously guarded by the Kern family. Melrose Inn manager George Kern created derby pie in the mid-1950s with help from his parents, Walter and Leaudra, and the dessert was such a hit that the family was soon baking the treat full-time. In fact, Mrs. Kern, being the crafty monopolist she was, copyrighted the name, and to this day, you can only get real ""Derby-Pie®"" through Kern's Kitchen, Inc. Not only that, but a man from New England once handed Leaudra a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home. She refused.I For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com. Entire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC. All rights reserved.",0
"Summary: North Korean crew recaptures hijacked vessel. Navy says two pirates killed, five captured; three from crew injured. USS Arleigh Burke enters Somali territorial waters to pursue other pirates. Pirates aboard hijacked Golden Nori carrying highly flammable benzene. Article: The crew members of a North Korean freighter regained control of their ship from pirates who hijacked the vessel off Somalia, but not without a deadly fight, the U.S. Navy reported Tuesday. The USS James E. Williams ordered pirates to give up their weapons, the Navy says. When the battle aboard the Dai Hong Dan was over, two pirates were dead and five were captured, the Navy said. Three wounded crew members from the cargo ship were being treated aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS James E. Williams. The captured pirates were being held aboard the North Korean vessel, the Navy said. The bandits had seized the ship's bridge, while the crew kept control of the steering gear and engines, the Navy said. The Koreans moved against the attackers after the Williams -- responding to reports of the hijacking -- ordered the pirates to give up their weapons, according to the Navy. When the crew members stormed the bridge, the deadly battle began. After the crew regained control, Navy sailors boarded the Dai Hong Dan to help with the injured. North Korea and the United States have no diplomatic relations. Watch why the U.S. helped the North Koreans ». The incident took place about 70 miles northeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, the Navy said. It is the second incident of piracy reported in recent days. A second U.S. Navy destroyer was searching waters off Somalia for pirates who hijacked a Japanese-owned ship, military officials said. Over the weekend, gunmen aboard two skiffs hijacked the Panamanian-flagged Golden Nori off the Socotra archipelago near the Horn of Africa, said Andrew Mwangura, a spokesman for the Kenyan-based Seafarers' Assistance Program. The guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke has been pursuing the pirates after entering Somali waters with the permission of the troubled transitional government in Mogadishu, U.S. officials said Monday. In recent years, warships have stayed outside the 12-mile limit when chasing pirates. Two military officials familiar with the details confirmed the ongoing operation. The Navy's pursuit of the pirates began Sunday night when the Golden Nori radioed for help. The Burke's sister ship, the USS Porter, opened fire and sank the pirate skiffs tied to the Golden Nori's stern before the Burke took over shadowing the hijacked vessel. When the shots were fired, it was not known the ship was filled with highly flammable benzene. U.S. military officials indicate there is a great deal of concern about the cargo because it is so sensitive. Benzene, which U.S. authorities have declared a known human carcinogen, is used as a solvent and to make plastics and synthetic fabrics. Four other ships in the region remain in pirate hands, the Navy said. U.S. and NATO warships have been patrolling off the Horn of Africa for years in an effort to crack down on piracy off Somalia, where a U.N.-backed transitional government is struggling to restore order after 15 years of near-anarchy. See how piracy is worse than 2006 ». On Monday, the head of the transitional government resigned as his administration -- backed by Ethiopian troops -- battled insurgents from the Islamic movement that seized control of Mogadishu in 2006. Hospital officials reported 30 dead in three days of clashes on the city's south side. In June, the ship USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia, but the American vessel turned away when the pirated ship entered Somali waters. In May, a U.S. Navy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast. But the U.S. Maritime Administration said pirates sometimes issue false distress calls to lure ships closer to shore. See the warning area ». The pirates often are armed with automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rockets, according to a recent warning from the agency. ""To date, vessels that increase speed and take evasive maneuvers avoid boarding, while those that slow down are boarded, taken to the Somali coastline and released after successful ransom payment, often after protracted negotiations of as much as 11 weeks,"" the warning advised. The agency issued a new warning to sailors in the Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, after Sunday's hijacking. CNN correspondents Barbara Starr at the Pentagon and Christian Purefoy in Nairobi contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Judge finds former teacher in violation of probation in student sex case. But judge spares Debra Lafave from jail, warns her ""don't come back"" Lafave's probation forbids her to have contact with anyone under 18. Article: Debra Lafave, the former Florida middle school teacher convicted of having sex with a student, violated her probation by hugging a young co-worker, a Florida judge found Thursday. Debra Lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager. She is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18. But the judge did not send Lafave to jail, saying the violation was ""not willful and substantial."" ""Please don't come back,"" he scolded. Dressed in a tailored, black pantsuit, Lafave said she had ""innocent"" physical contact with a female co-worker she knew as under age 18. Watch Lafave in the courtroom ». At the time, she and the 17-year-old hostess worked at Danny Boy's, a small restaurant in the Tampa, Florida, area. Lafave, 27, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation. Lafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors. A tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court, prompting the prosecutor to observe, ""I think she's accounted for."" Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations about sex -- with minors violated terms of her probation. She referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just ""girl talk."" Lafave denied talking about her sex life with co-workers. ""I don't speak that way about my personal life,"" she said. But she added that her co-workers spoke freely about sex in a ""small group setting."" While other co-workers socialized outside work, Lafave said, the 17-year-old was not included in those outings. Asked why she hugged the young co-worker, Lafave explained it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where co-workers felt like family. The contact came, she said, ""out of my good nature, that's the way it worked."" The contacts that led to Thursday's probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of Lafave's court-ordered supervision. She received a verbal reprimand a year ago, according to testimony. When the behavior continued, her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation. She was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother's beauty shop. In the past, Lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment.",0
"Summary: Ralph Lauren began as tie salesman from the Bronx. First design: Wide ties when others were narrow. Has designed high fashion for four decades. Goal: Glamorous clothing that is ""consistent and accessible"" Article: It all boils down to this. It doesn't really matter all that much what hot, nubile French maverick has set the fashion world on fire. Or which Milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to Angkor Wat that's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist. Or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries. Because, in the end, he's Ralph Lauren, and we're not. Ralph Lauren has his eye on China and Japan. For four decades no other designer has had a greater impact, not only on the way American men and women dress but also on the way they imagine, seek and indulge in the Good Life, than the former tie salesman from the Bronx. ""Those ties were handmade, by the way,"" recalls Lauren. ""Back then, ties, even designer ones, didn't sell for more than $5 apiece. Mine were $12 to $15. Such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary."" And ironic. Because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony, Lauren originally named his company Polo because ""it was the sport of kings. It was glamorous, sexy and international."" See his designs ». In the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after Marco Polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of Lauren's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial. Lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before you'd even achieved your goal. What's more, Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase. ""What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible,"" says the designer. ""When I look at the people I've admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement. And when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there, the ones you believe in and the ones you remember, like Chanel and Armani, are the ones that stand for something. Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality. And it's an image that can change, that can evolve. It doesn't reinvent itself every two years."" However, with a media that is insatiable for the new, the now and the next, being steadfast doesn't always make for good copy. ""The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer,"" Lauren admits. ""And that's fine. But the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else. We work real hard at that. It's about getting your message out to the consumer. It's about getting their trust, but also getting them excited, again and again. My clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- aren't concepts. They go into stores. Our stores. Thankfully, we have lots of them,"" says Lauren. ""What I rely on is people walking into my store saying, 'I want your clothes.'"" Well, if all of Lauren's customers shouted that together, he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers. Lauren's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet, on ski slopes and boats, at Wimbledon and elsewhere. It furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables. It's on the bed, in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables, thanks to the tome Ralph Lauren (Rizzoli), celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career. But far from giving his customary over-the-head wave and riding off into his Colorado-ranch sunset, the designer is going even more global. ""Americans have a real inferiority about their own style. We've brought sportswear to the world, and yet we have a long way to go."" Already in Milan, London, Paris and Moscow, Lauren has more stores planned for China, Japan ... oh, everywhere. ""There aren't enough Americans out there,"" he says. Who better to start with than Ralph? Just as long as he doesn't let on that most of us still can't play a lick of polo.

"Summary: Tip leads police to John Lewis at homeless shelter in Miami. Lewis is suspected in fatal shooting of Philadelphia Ofc. Charles Cassidy. Cassidy walked in on doughnut shop robbery last week and was shot, police say. Philadelphia police alerted Miami counterparts that Lewis was headed that way. Article: A man named as a suspect in the fatal shooting of a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, police officer last week was captured at a shelter in Miami, Florida, on Tuesday, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson said at a news conference. Miami Police Chief John Timoney said he had been alerted by Philadelphia police that the suspect, John Lewis, had taken a Miami-bound bus from Philadelphia. Acting on information from Miami Rescue Mission, officers went to a homeless shelter where they found Lewis, ""who was pretty easy to spot as he's 6 feet, 270 pounds,"" Timoney said. He was apprehended ""unarmed and without incident,"" the Miami chief said. Timoney said it didn't appear that anyone in Miami was helping Lewis, according to CNN affiliate WPVI. Miami Police Officer Gil Gonzalez said Lewis ""had a Bible and was praying when we went to get him. He had a look of guilt, a look of shock."" Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street said people at the shelter recognized Lewis from televised photos of the suspect. Lewis is suspected in the October 31 shooting of Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy. Cassidy was shot in the head when he inadvertently walked into a robbery in progress at a Dunkin' Donuts. He died the next day. Investigators told WPVI that Lewis was spotted on security video boarding a bus to Miami on Saturday night. Cassidy was one of three Philadelphia police officers shot in a four-day period last week. Mariano Santiago was shot in the shoulder late last Tuesday as he approached a vehicle. He is in fair condition. Officer Sandra VanHinkle was shot early last Sunday and is out of the hospital and doing well, police say. Former co-workers of Lewis who spoke to WPVI said they were surprised by the allegations against him. ""He was so nice,"" Kiani Clark told the station. ""He was really nice. He didn't seem like the type that would hurt a fly."" The Associated Press reported that Lewis had been arrested in 2005 on drug charges, which were withdrawn after he completed a treatment program. He was arrested again in June on drug charges, and that case is still pending, the AP reported. CNN's Aurore Ankarcrona contributed to this report. Copyright 2007 CNN.

"Summary: Tiburon is low-slung sportster that won't bust first-time buyer's wallet. Pontiac G5 GT boasts highly sprung motoring. Toyota's hipster Scion comes dripping with gadgetry inside. Article: One of the bigger difficulties any first-time buyer faces is purchasing a car that doesn't scream ""first-time"" to friends, relatives and co-workers, or indeed to the buyer each time they step into an ill-chosen purchase. A ""shark"" that races down roads. To break from the boring econobox, here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about $20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time and give a little bit of joy to a first-time owner. Hyundai Tiburon. If you didn't know already, Tiburon means ""shark"" in Spanish, and it's not hard to see how Hyundai's sporty coupe can stalk the unwary first-time buyer and snare them quickly. Like an instantly recognizable dorsal fin, the Tiburon in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest low-slung sportster that won't bust a first-time buyer's wallet, though it may chew a hole in the seat of their pants as they're pushed back into those tight-hugging bucket seats. The startling Hyundai-designed looks boast a touch of Italian styling uncommon for its bracket. Mazda MazdaSpeed3. A bona-fide pocket rocket, any first-time buyer can put a fair distance between themselves and the pack in the MazdaSpeed3, part of the Asian carmaker's strategy to wrestle performance compact coupe sales from European carmakers. This one isn't overbearingly dripped in trim or wings, but don't let any youngster tell you it doesn't have what it takes to make their peers jealous. The MazdaSpeed3 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph. Its secret is torque negation in the low gears -- and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood. Another hidden gem is its seven-speaker Bose stereo. Pontiac G5 GT Coupe. Much like the fantastic Chevy Cobalt SS, its younger sister Pontiac G5 GT boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the first-time buyer's wallet. The G5 GT has been tweaked just slightly from its sister SS -- like the difference between Ashlee and Jessica Simpson -- boasting a less horizontal grille and more sculpted valance. Both are reasonably stylish from the back and side and both leaving plenty room for aftermarket add-ons. A new grille entirely, like a Phantom, may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd. The GT's inline-four 2.4-liter 173-hp engine -- 25hp over the base -- drives the front wheels to hit 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds. Gas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook. Ford Mustang V6. A revamped chassis is the key to why Ford's Mustang has become an outstanding product at a price that's hard to beat. A tweak to the iconic lines for last year included a smaller back window and a longer, craggier front end. Some might of course call us heretics for picking a V6 over the famous eight-cylinder included in the GT package but, to be honest, the V6 performs admirably, pushes out 210hp and emits a low-down growl that sounds wonderful. And it's still a Mustang. Civic Coupe. A Civic hatch was my second car (after a very short-lived VW Rabbit). The coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the Civic's surprisingly roomy front cabin, its enjoyable handling and maneuverability, first-class economy and its sporty elongated hood and swooping back end. Standard features include a 350-watt premium sound system, a touch-screen satellite-navigation system whose screen flips to reveal the CD player, and a slot for a computer memory card. It's also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night -- what fun. Scion xB. On the heels of its 2004 release, Toyota's hipster Scion brand has remodeled its boxy wonder this year, this time boasting more than a design nod to its parent company's FJ Cruiser. Wide rear pillars, wraparound headlights and bumper define the second-generation variant, which comes dripping with gadgetry inside, as well as leaving plenty of room for after-market customization. This one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort. Other notable features include a central console that fits in a DVD player alongside a backlit GPS sat-nav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors. Honda Fit. A co-worker bought one of these after crashing her old and very badly beaten up Saturn on a left turn into oncoming traffic. Ouch. So it technically wasn't her first car, but for many buyers, it will be. Energetic, filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet, the Fit looks the part as well as being colossally roomy inside for what you expect. You don't get a third row of seats in there but, with the back row folded flat, it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper. Other great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rear-seat headrests, while gas mileage is, as expected, very good indeed.",0
"Summary: Bush: Senate ""wasting valuable time"" with children's health insurance bill. Congress ""holding hostage"" funds for troops, Bush says. Bush accuses Congress of gridlock, failing to promote anyone's agenda. Democrats fire back, saying Bush's words ""ring hollow"" Article: President Bush blasted the Democratic-controlled Congress on Tuesday for having ""the worst record in 20 years."" ""Congress is not getting its work done,"" Bush said, flanked by members of the Republican House leadership. ""The House of Representatives has wasted valuable time on a constant stream of investigations, and the Senate has wasted valuable time on an endless series of failed votes to pull our troops out of Iraq."" Bush criticized Congress for not being able to send ""a single appropriations bill"" to him. ""They haven't seen a bill they could not solve without shoving a tax hike into it,"" he said. Democrats quickly fired back. Jim Manley, senior aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said, ""Taking advice from President Bush about fiscal responsibility and getting things done for the American people is like taking hunting lessons from Dick Cheney. Neither is a very good idea."" Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Illinois, issued a statement saying, ""President Bush's rally this morning reminds us that congressional Republicans remain ready and willing to rubber-stamp the Bush agenda: No to children's health care; no to a new direction in Iraq; and no to investing in America's future. The White House and congressional Republicans want to continue the status quo."" Bush said the Senate was ""wasting valuable time"" by taking up the children's health insurance bill, which he had earlier vetoed. Watch Bush describe what he thinks Congress is doing wrong ». House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, issued a statement calling Bush ""the biggest obstacle"" to extending health coverage to ""10 million low-income, working-class American children."" Hoyer said GOP House leaders need to ""stop posing for pictures, and sit down with Democrats and Republicans in Congress who are working together to extend coverage to our children."" The State Children's Health Insurance Program measure passed in the House last week would expand the program by nearly $35 billion over five years, the same as the measure Bush vetoed on October 3. Bush had proposed adding $5 billion to the program, and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program. Democratic leaders said the new version addresses Republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving SCHIP benefits; capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program; and preventing adults from receiving benefits. The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor, but who can't afford private insurance. Democrats want to extend the program to another 4 million, paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes. Bush said Congress knows the current version of the children's health bill ""does not have a chance,"" to get enough votes to override another veto. Hoyer accused Bush of breaking a promise he made in 2004 to extend coverage under the SCHIP program. ""Now, Congress must do what the president said he would do,"" he said in his statement. The Senate could vote on the bill as early as Tuesday. Bush also threatened to veto a ""three-bill pileup."" ""There are now reports that Congressional leaders may be considering combining the Veterans and Department of Defense appropriations bills, and then add a bloated labor, health and education spending bill to both of them,"" he said. ""Congress should pass each bill one at a time in a fiscally responsible manner,"" he said. Bush also urged Congress to send him a ""clean defense appropriations bill and a war supplemental bill."" ""They ought to get me a bill that funds among other things bullets and body armor,"" he said. Bush also criticized Congress for trying to ""hold hostage"" funding for troops. ""It would be irresponsible to not give our troops the resources they need to get their job done because Congress was unable to get its job done,"" he said. Hoyer's release said Bush's comments on appropriations bills and fiscal responsibility ""ring hollow."" ""The fact is, this administration has pursued the most fiscally irresponsible policies in American history, turning record surpluses into record deficits and adding more than $3 trillion to the national debt,"" he said. ""Democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility today because we believe our government must pay for the things it purchases and not force our children to pay our bills. The fight over 2008 appropriations bills is not a fight over spending. It is a fight over priorities.""",0
"Summary: Social worker says sniper Lee Boyd Malvo is a changed person. Ten people were killed in Washington-area sniper attacks in 2002. In a letter to CNN, Malvo writes he's still ""grappling with shame, guilt, remorse"" Article: Sniper Lee Boyd Malvo said in a letter to CNN that he is still ""grappling with shame, guilt, remorse and my own healing if that will ever be possible."" And a social worker who has worked extensively with him said he draws self-portraits that often show him with a tear running down his cheek. A self-portrait drawn by sniper Lee Boyd Malvo. Many of his drawings show him with a tear running down his cheek. Malvo, 22, spends 23 hours a day inside his cell at Virginia's toughest prison, a maximum-security compound called Red Onion, not far from the Kentucky border. He's serving a life sentence. According to social worker Carmeta Albarus-Lindo, Malvo is a changed person since he and John Allen Muhammad terrorized the Washington area five years ago this month in attacks that left 10 dead over a 23-day period. ""The most I can do is to continue to be there, because that is his greatest fear -- that, you know, another parental figure would abandon him because that was what he'd been exposed to all his life,"" said Albarus-Lindo, who has spent hundreds of hours with Malvo since his arrest and conviction. Read the letter ». She said one of those ""parental"" figures was Muhammad, who met Malvo in the Caribbean nearly two years before the deadly shooting spree began in 2002. Muhammad became the teenager's surrogate father, convincing him that violence was the only way to correct perceived injustices to African-Americans, Albarus-Lindo said. He ordered Malvo to go to bed each night and to memorize passages from ""The Art of War,"" an ancient Chinese text on battlefield strategy. According to Albarus-Lindo, Malvo was ""brainwashed"" into aiding Muhammad in the murders. However, prosecutors have said Malvo, even at 17, knew what he was doing. ""I thought he was coldblooded,"" said Paul Ebert, commonwealth attorney for Prince William County, Virginia, of the first time he met Malvo. ""He was a person who had chosen a life of crime."" And when a Virginia jury spared Malvo's life, some investigators said they were horrified. ""That was the hardest day of my career,"" said April Carroll of the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco. ""I felt that day we had failed when Malvo was not sentenced to death."" Some of the victims' families said they are content that Malvo did not receive the death penalty. Vicki Buchanan Snyder, whose brother James ""Sonny"" Buchanan was shot in the back while mowing a patch of lawn at a Maryland auto dealership, said she was ""satisfied"" with the jury's verdict. As for Malvo, Albarus-Lindo said he will ""never forgive himself for what has happened."" When she first began seeing him, he still called Muhammad ""Dad."" It took months, she said, before he stopped. In the interim, Albarus-Lindo said, he took college correspondence courses and began to draw. Muhammad is at a Virginia prison called Sussex One. In a DVD made last year inside prison and obtained exclusively by CNN, he said he is ""still fighting"" on death row. He wants to ""correct,"" he said, some ""inaccurate statements"" made by the news media about his relationship with Malvo. He wasn't specific about what he meant. Watch Muhammad on death row ». Muhammad's ex-wife, Mildred, said she believed that she was the real target of the snipers from the beginning. She and her children live in suburban Washington, and she runs a Web site called Afterthetrauma.org, devoted to the victims of domestic abuse. Mildred Muhammad said she feels her ex-husband wanted to kill her as revenge because she was able to gain custody of their three children. As for his relationship with Malvo, she said she too is convinced that John Allen Muhammad brainwashed the younger man. ""That boy was a victim before he even knew it,"" she said. ""His life was over when he said, 'Hi.' """,0

"Summary: Erik Prince, CEO of Blackwater USA, testifies before House panel. Hearings held amid an FBI probe into a shootout involving Blackwater personnel. Prince: ""I believe we acted appropriately at all times"" Article: Erik Prince, the chairman and CEO of Blackwater USA, appeared Tuesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Erik Prince, CEO and chairman of Blackwater USA, is sworn in Tuesday at a congressional hearing. The committee convened amid an FBI investigation into a September 16 shootout involving Blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of Iraqi civilians. Following is a transcript of Prince's opening statement:. Chairman [Henry] Waxman, [D-California], Congressman [Thomas] Davis, [R-Virginia], members of the committee, my name is Eric Prince, and I am the chairman and CEO of the Prince Group and Blackwater USA. Blackwater's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to America's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect Americans in harm's way overseas. Under the direction and oversight of the United States government, Blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the United States. Words alone cannot express the respect I have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend U.S. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions. I am proud to be there to represent them today. After almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day. After 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country. Blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men. At the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families. The areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis. Any incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress. In doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy. Blackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations. The company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States. Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented. The worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards. In Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO. All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO. In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions, as well as any applicable laws and regulations. We have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation's total force. Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions. My understanding of the September 16 incident is that the Department of State and the FBI are conducting a full investigation, but those results are not yet available. We at Blackwater welcome the FBI review announced yesterday, and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions. I just want to put some other things in perspective. A recent report from the Department of State stated that in 2007 Blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone, areas outside the Green Zone in Iraq, and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged, or less than 3 percent of all movements. In 2006, Blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the Red Zone. Weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions. To the extent there is any loss of innocent life, ever, let me be clear that I consider that tragic. Every life, whether American or Iraqi, is precious. I stress to the committee and to the American public, however, that I believe we acted appropriately at all times. I am prepared to answer your questions.",0
"Summary: UEFA has punished Benfica midfielder Augustin Binya with a six-match ban. The Cameroon international was sent off for bad tackle on Celtic's Scott Brown. Brown was lucky to escape injury in incident during Champions League match. Article: UEFA has punished Benfica midfielder Augustin Binya with a six-match European ban following his horror tackle on Celtic's Scott Brown last week. Augustin Binya, right, lunges towards Celtic midfielder Scott Brown during Benfica's 1-0 defeat in Glasgow. The Cameroon international was sent off for the challenge in his side's 1-0 defeat in the Champions League match in Glasgow last Wednesday. Scotland international Brown avoided injury, but claimed Binya had tried to break his leg with the tackle in the 85th minute -- and demanded that Europe's governing body take further action. Binya, 24, apologized for the challenge -- described by officiating referee Martin Hansson of Sweden as one of the worst he had ever seen -- on the day after the match. But UEFA's control and disciplinary body announced their sanction on Friday morning, having deliberated on the case on Thursday. In a statement on uefa.com, Binya's challenge was described as one which ""seriously endangered the physical health of the opposing player"". Benfica can appeal against the ban, which rules Binya out of the Portuguese club's remaining Group D matches against AC Milan and Shakhtar Donetsk. If unsuccessful, he will also miss any matches in the knockout stages of the Champions League or UEFA Cup. The suspension will also carry over to future seasons if, as seems likely, Benfica finish bottom of Group D and bow out of Europe for this campaign. Brown, who has been passed fit for Scotland's Euro 2008 qualifier against Italy, said straight after the Benfica match: ""He obviously tried to do me as hard as possible."" It is the second time that UEFA has had to intervene following an incident involving Celtic this season. AC Milan keeper Dida was handed a two-match ban, subsequently reduced to one on appeal, after collapsing theatrically when a fan of the Scottish club invaded the pitch and lightly slapped the Brazilian in the face. Celtic were fined $50,000 and barred the supporter for life.",0
"Summary: Sen. Clinton supported by 44 percent of Democrats polled, down from October. Rudy Giuliani continues to lead Republican presidential field with 28 percent. Clinton beats Giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent, the poll found. Only 42 percent think things are going well in the U.S., according to the poll. Article: With the election of the next president a year away, Sen. Hillary Clinton remains the person to beat, a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Monday suggests. As the countdown begins to November 4, 2008, the New York Democrat continues to dominate the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the GOP front-runner, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. But Clinton's path to the White House is in no way certain. Clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week, and her rivals for the Democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on Iraq, Iran and other major issues. The Republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the Democratic front-runner, with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping Clinton. The attacks may be working. The CNN/Opinion Research polls suggests that Clinton's support has slipped from its height one month ago. Watch CNN's Bill Schneider on the latest poll numbers ». ""Clinton's strength is about where it was throughout the summer, indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that Obama has not yet cut into her core constituency,"" CNN political director Keating Holland said. Clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely Democratic voters interviewed for the poll. Her closest rival, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, was the top choice of 25 percent, and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina has 14 percent. All other Democratic candidates were in single digits. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was backed by 4 percent, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware by 3 percent, Sen. Christopher Dodd by 2 percent, Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich by 2 percent and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel was at 1 percent. The poll involved 467 interviews conducted on November 2-4 with Democrats or independents who lean Democratic. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. View the poll results ». In an October CNN/Opinion Research poll, Clinton was supported by 51 percent of Democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over Obama. During last week's Democratic debate, Clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow Democratic presidential rivals, who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the Iowa Caucus in early January. Edwards was particularly aggressive during the debate, criticizing Clinton for her stance on Iraq, Iran and Social Security. ""The American people ... deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth and won't say one thing one time and something different at a different time,"" Edwards said. Edwards has also accused Clinton of being a ""corporate Democrat"" too willing to defend a ""corrupt"" Washington establishement. ""We desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in Washington that's become broken, corruption has crept into it, and we have to tell the truth about that,"" Edwards said Monday. ""If you defend that system, I don't believe you can bring about the change that America needs."" In the Republican presidential race, Giuliani continues to be the leading candidate, with the backing of 28 percent of the Republican primary voters polled. Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee was backed by 19 percent. Sen. John McCain of Arizona was the top pick of 16 percent, and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had 11 percent. Of the remaining Republican candidates, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee received 10 percent, Texas Rep. Ron Paul 5 percent, California Rep. Duncan Hunter 4 percent and Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo 3 percent. The poll involved telephone interviews with 397 Republicans or independents who lean Republican. The poll's margin of error was 5 percentage points. In a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners, Clinton leads Giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent. That lead has increased since October, when Clinton led Giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent. ""The overall political environment seems to favor the Democrats, partly because Democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood, which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party,"" Holland said. Only 42 percent of Americans think things are going well, while 58 percent think things are going badly, the poll found. ""The public is not just pessimistic about the country -- Americans are angry,"" Holland said. ""More than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country."" Clinton's lead over Giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, the poll found. In a three-way race, Clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters, Giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent. The poll's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent. ""My analysis of it is that [a third-party candidate] is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me,"" Giuliani said. ""You know it is a tactic, and a legitimate one. People have to think about that and consider it.'' The lack of enthusiasm for Giuliani, particularly by social conservatives, could spell trouble for the GOP next year if he becomes the nominee, Holland said. ""Only 27 percent of Republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if Giuliani won the GOP nod, and the remaining GOP candidates fare even worse,"" he said.",0
"Summary: Russian President Putin backs Iran's ""peaceful"" nuclear program during visit. Putin in Tehran to attend summit of Caspian Sea nations to discuss oil rights. Iran, Russia set to discuss Iranian nuclear program, U.S. push for sanctions. Putin downplay rumors of assassination plot; Iran says claims are ""baseless"" Article: Iran should be allowed to pursue its nuclear program for peaceful purposes, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday during the first visit to the country by a Kremlin leader since 1943. Putin, right, is greeted by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad following his arrival in Tehran. Putin, who is in Tehran to attend a summit of Caspian Sea nations, said that he and the other leaders agreed that ""peaceful nuclear activities must be allowed"" in the region. ""The Iranians are cooperating with Russian nuclear agencies and the main objectives are peaceful objectives,"" he said. Russia is building Iran's first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the U.S. and its allies to impose stronger U.N. sanctions against Tehran. On Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated the Bush administration's stance that ""all options"" must be kept ""on the table"" in confronting the threats posed by Iran -- a reference to the option of using military action against the long-time U.S. adversary. ""We should have no illusions about the nature of this regime or its leaders -- about their designs for their nuclear program, their willingness to live up to their rhetoric, their intentions for Iraq, or their ambitions in the Gulf region,"" Gates said in a speech to the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. The leaders of Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also met Tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the Caspian Sea -- the world's largest inland body of water. Speaking afterwards, Putin said that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region -- a reference to rumors that the U.S. planned to use Azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against Iran, The Associated Press reported. ""We are saying that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any Caspian state,"" Putin said. ""The Caspian Sea is an inland sea and it only belongs to the Caspian states, therefore only they are entitled to have their ships and military forces here,"" added Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Putin, defying reports of an assassination plot against him, was greeted by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as he stepped off his plane at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport. During a news conference Monday after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Wiesbaden, Germany, Putin said rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans. ""Of course I will travel to Iran,"" Putin said. ""If I reacted to these kinds of rumors every time, I could never leave the house."" Iranian officials denied there was an assassination plot against Putin, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman describing rumors of a possible terrorist action during the Putin visit baseless. ""Spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and cannot damage the trend of the prepared programs,"" spokesman Mohammadali Hosseini told the Iranian FARS news agency. Hosseini blamed the rumor on Western media, particularly the U.S. media, saying the report was ""made up by the enemies of relations between Iran and Russia to create a psychological war."" Putin's visit is the first by a leader in the Kremlin to Iran since Joseph Stalin's World War II conference meeting with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. ""Putin's trip to Tehran is a show of Russia's independence in global affairs. Putin, who approaches the end of his term, wants to demonstrate that he wouldn't cave in to the U.S. pressure,"" said Alexander Pikayev, an expert on Iran with Russia's Institute for World Economy and International Relations, in a report carried by AP. Putin's schedule also includes meetings with Ahmadinejad and Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, AP said. Copyright 2007 CNN.

"Summary: French president returns to France with three released journalists. Journalists are among seven Europeans freed Sunday in child ""kidnap"" row. There are still 14 other people in custody in Chad. Father: ""They never said they would take away our children"" Article: Three French journalists charged in an alleged plot to kidnap African children for adoption in Europe arrived in Paris on Sunday, hours after French President Nicolas Sarkozy held emergency talks in Chad. But 14 other people remained in custody in the African nation, some facing serious charges that could send them to jail for up to 20 years. The journalists were among seven Europeans a Chadian judge released Sunday, including a Spanish flight crew, whom Sarkozy dropped off in a brief stop in Madrid on his way back from Chad. All were arrested last week after workers from Zoe's Ark -- a French-based charity group -- were accused of trying to fly 103 children out of Chad in a kidnapping and adoption operation. Watch a report on how the events unfolded ». Some of the children may never return to their families because it is too difficult to determine their backgrounds, Red Cross spokeswoman Inah Kaloga told CNN on Friday. Those who remain under arrest in Chad are six members of the French charity, four Chadians and four remaining members of the flight crew. Some face kidnapping and fraud charges. Zoe's Ark leader Eric Breteau testified Saturday to a court in the Chadian capital that the three journalists and the flight crew of seven Spaniards and a Belgian were not involved in the alleged plot, court witnesses told CNN. At least some of the flight crew are scheduled to testify before a judge on Monday. The three journalists initially had been charged with complicity in the alleged kidnapping attempt. It's not clear if the charges against them have been dropped. Watch the freed Europeans leave Chad ». In a joint news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on Sunday at Madrid's Torrejon Air Force Base, Sarkozy expressed satisfaction that some of those detained had been released. At the same time, however, he told reporters, ""We should respect the sovereignty of Chad."" Zapatero thanked Sarkozy for dropping the four Spanish flight crew members off in their home country, and thanked Chadian President Idriss Deby for allowing them to return. After his emergency talks in Chad, Sarkozy stressed the scandal would not affect the strong relations between the two countries or affect the planned deployment of a European force to protect refugees from Sudan's Darfur region who have fled to Chad and the neighboring Central African Republic. Sarkozy also said he hoped the six remaining French nationals -- all from Zoe's Ark -- would face trial in France. The charity says that the children were orphans from the Darfur region -- where the United Nations estimates 200,000 people have been killed in four years of conflict -- and that the group was taking them to host families in France. But after preliminary interviews with the children, aid agencies said Thursday it appeared most of them probably are not orphans and not from Sudan, but instead come from villages on the Chadian side of the border with Sudan. The children are staying in an Abeche orphanage while aid agencies and government officials try to find out where they came from -- a challenge hindered by the number of children, their youth, and the volatile situation in the region. A father of three of the children allegedly kidnapped told a French newspaper he put his children into the charity's care after he was told they would be educated at a school under construction in a nearby town. The Chadian man, who gave his name as Arbab, told Le Parisien on Sunday that workers from Zoe's Ark had visited his village three times. ""They never said they would take away our children,"" he told the newspaper. CNN's Nic Robertson and Al Goodman contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Four killed in crash; two people die later of injuries. Copter took off from Aviano Air Base, news agency reports. Black Hawk helicopter had 11 people aboard. Article: A sixth U.S. service member died Friday from injuries sustained when a Black Hawk helicopter crashed in northeastern Italy on Thursday, the U.S. military in Europe said. The helicopter, carrying 11 U.S. military personnel, crashed Thursday afternoon about 22 miles from Aviano, Italy. Four people were killed and seven were injured in the crash, and two of the injured later died, the U.S. military said. Treviso fire officials said one of the dead was a woman, and said no one on the ground was hurt. The U.S. military said the helicopter was an Army H-60 Black Hawk attached to the 1st Battalion, 214th Aviation Regiment. The military was not releasing the names of those killed, pending notification of the victims' families. Police and fire officials said the craft crashed in an open area near the Piave River north of Treviso, between the towns of Maserata Sul Piave and Santa Lucia Di Piave. Watch scenes of the crash site in northern Italy ». The helicopter appeared crumpled and charred in photos from the crash. Italy's ANSA news agency said the helicopter crashed near the bridge of a major highway and the road was closed as a precaution. ANSA said the helicopter had taken off from Aviano Air Base, but fire authorities could not confirm whether it was leaving or returning to the base. The Black Hawk is considered the workhorse of the military's helicopter fleet. It is used in missions in Iraq and Afghanistan to carry troops and equipment. The military has employed Black Hawks for about three decades. The helicopter's first combat mission was about 25 years ago. CNN's Hada Messia and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: University of Memphis athlete Taylor Bradford, 21, was shot September 30. Three charged with murder in perpetration of attempted aggravated robbery. After player was shot, he got in his car, drove off and then crashed into a tree. The killing spurred school officials to temporarily lock down the campus. Article: Three men have been arrested and charged with murder in the shooting death last week of a University of Memphis football player, Memphis police announced Monday. Police investigating a car crash on September 30 found Taylor Bradford, 21, fatally wounded near the campus residence hall area. He had apparently gotten into his car after being shot, and drove a short distance before crashing into a tree. Bradford -- a 5-foot-11, 300-pound defensive lineman from Nashville -- was pronounced dead at Regional Medical Center. Memphis Police Department Director Larry Godwin said DeeShawn Tate, 21, Victor Trezevant, 21, and Courtney Washington, 22, had been charged with murder in perpetration of attempted aggravated robbery. Homicide investigators developed the case against the three men with the help of a citizen's tip and Crimestoppers, he said. Godwin said the investigation continues, and ""we do expect additional arrests in this case."" ""It was an attempted robbery, aggravated robbery,"" he said. Bradford ""was targeted because of some information that was out there and the fact that they believed he had some cash, or he had something that they wanted."" Godwin said none of the three arrested suspects were students at the university, but he would not rule out that other suspects could be students. Shelby County District Attorney General William L. Gibbons said the three suspects would make an initial court appearance as early as Tuesday. He said prosecutors were considering seeking the death penalty in the case, but no decision had been made. ""Whether or not it will be would be premature for me to say,"" Gibbons said. ""There are a lot of factors that go into it. We'll make a determination at the appropriate time."" Officials at the 21,000-student school said Bradford, a marketing major who lived on campus, was popular with the football team and on the campus as a whole. He had transferred from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, and was 36 credit hours short of graduation.",0
"Summary: Kevin Federline to take custody of children effective Wednesday noon. Federline and Britney Spears have two children, ages 2 and 1. Pair were divorced in July. Article: A court has ordered pop singer Britney Spears to give up custody of her children effective Wednesday at noon. Kevin Federline and Britney Spears, here during happier times, have two children. Spears' former husband, Kevin Federline, is to retain custody of their two sons ""until further order of the court,"" according to a ruling by Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon. It was not clear what led to Monday's decision awarding Federline full custody. A transcript of the court proceedings was ordered sealed. Last month, a judge ordered Spears, 25, to submit to random drug tests after finding she engaged in ""habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol."" That order, also by Gordon, provided no details and did not name any drugs. The former couple has been embroiled in a bitter custody fight over their sons, Sean Preston and Jayden. The parents had split custody 50-50, but Federline then asked for the arrangements to be shifted to 70-30 in his favor. Watch how Spears became user of -- and prisoner to -- fame ». In addition to ordering the twice-weekly drug tests, Gordon ordered Spears to spend eight hours per week working with a ""parenting coach,"" who was to observe her interactions with her children. Gordon also told both parents to avoid alcohol or ""other non-prescription controlled substances"" 12 hours before taking custody of the children. He also barred the exes from making ""derogatory remarks about the other party and the other party's family or significant other"" during the case. And he ordered the parents to go through ""joint co-parenting counseling"" and barred them from using corporal punishment on the boys. Spears and Federline were married for two years before their divorce became final in July. Monday's order comes amid a career freefall for Spears, whose new album is due to be released November 13. After her September 9 ""comeback"" performance on the MTV Video Music Awards, critics derided her singing and dancing as lackluster and said she appeared overweight in her sequined two-piece costume. Her former divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, resigned last month as her legal representative after telling reporters the singer ""just wants to be a mom."" Spears' management company, the Firm, recently quit after representing the singer for little over a month.",0
"Summary: Judge doubles bail to $250,000, accuses of ""arrogance"" or ""ignorance"" Jailed since Friday, Simpson was required to put down $37,500 in cash to get out. Bail bondsman tells judge O.J. Simpson never paid him. DA says Simpson violated bail terms by leaving message for co-defendant. Article: Former football star O.J. Simpson walked out of jail late Wednesday after posting $250,000 bail. O.J. Simpson leaves the Clark County Detention Center late Wednesday night. Eighth District Judge Jackie Glass hours earlier doubled Simpson's bail to ensure his appearance at an April 7 trial. Glass said Simpson had violated terms of his previous bail. Glass was adamant that Simpson remain in the Clark County Detention Center until 15 percent of the $250,000 is paid in full -- $37,500 -- after it was revealed in court that Simpson never paid any part of his previous $125,000 bail. ""There's no 'get-out-of-jail-free card' today,"" an angry Glass told Simpson's lawyers. ""I don't want him out of the jail until the 15 percent is paid in full."" Watch the scolding judge ». The judge scolded Simpson, saying he wasn't taking the matter seriously. ""I don't know if it's just arrogance. I don't know if it's ignorance,"" she chided. Simpson posted bail at about 6:15 p.m. local time (9:15 p.m. ET), according to Las Vegas authorities. Simpson returned to jail in Nevada from his home in Florida January 11 for Wednesday's hearing, after prosecutors alleged he violated the terms of his bail by attempting to contact a co-defendant. The original bail bondsman -- Miguel Pereira of Florida-based You Ring, We Spring -- testified Wednesday that the former football player didn't put any money toward the bail that allowed him to leave jail in September. ""Not one cent,"" he said. The bail bondsman himself paid the 15 percent premium and the $40 filing fee to allow Simpson to leave the detention center, although he said he had a power of attorney for Simpson's Florida home but never filed a lien on it. When questioned by Simpson attorney Yale Galanter, Pereira admitted he had never sent Simpson a bill for the premium. But, he said, he had an understanding with Simpson that he would be paid ""after it was all over."" Glass described it as ""mind-boggling"" that Simpson never had to put up any collateral for his first bond and that the bail bondsman never asked for anything. Prosecutors also produced Wednesday a recording of a profanity-laced voice mail message left on Pereira's answering machine in November from Simpson, which he told Pereira to deliver to co-defendant Clarence Stewart. The prosecutor said the message contained ""an undercurrent of a threat,"" and he wanted the bail to be raised to at least $1 million. Galanter did not contest the authenticity of the recording. As part of his bail granted September 19, Simpson was to have no contact whatsoever with victims, witnesses or co-defendants in the case. Glass said the same goes this time. Watch how Simpson wound up in jail ». ""When I tell you, Mr. Simpson, there are conditions and there are rules, let me make sure you understand if you violate those rules ... you'll be back, locked up in the Clark County Detention Center; do you understand me?"" the judge asked. ""I understand 100 percent,"" said Simpson, dressed in a navy blue jail jumpsuit. ""No contact [with others in case], no phone messages to third parties, no emails, no letters -- nothing,"" Glass added. Galanter said his client ""was truly contrite about what has occurred."" ""He will abide scrupulously by whatever this court decides,"" the attorney said. Simpson faces trial April 7 on 12 criminal counts, including conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery, burglary, coercion and assault with a deadly weapon. The charges stem from a September 13 incident at a Las Vegas hotel in which he allegedly stole sports memorabilia he said belonged to him from dealers Alfred Beardsley and Bruce Fromong. According to earlier testimony, Beardsley and Fromong were offering more than 600 Simpson-related items for sale, including ties Simpson wore during his criminal trial for the 1994 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. Simpson was acquitted in that trial.",0
"Summary: F-15s grounded after a November 1 crash in Missouri. F-15 is used for ground support in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. All U.S. Air Force 224 E-model aircraft will undergo a one-time inspection. Article: The Air Force is returning F-15E Strike Eagle jets to service over Iraq and Afghanistan after grounding other F-15s, the Air Force said Wednesday. The Air Force grounded models of its F-15 fleet after the crash of an older model F-15C this month. The F-15s were grounded after a crash earlier this month in Missouri of an older model that disintegrated in flight. Each F-15E must pass an inspection of critical parts on the airframe before returning to flying missions, Air Force officials said. All U.S. Air Force 224 E-model aircraft will undergo a one-time inspection of hydraulic system lines, the Air Force statement said. The longerons -- molded, metal strips of the aircraft fuselage that run from front to rear -- will also be inspected, according to the Air Force. The straps and skin panels in and around the environmental control system bay will also be examined, officials said. The Air Force would not say whether the parts being inspected were part of the problem on the aircraft that crashed. The investigation into why that plane fell apart in flight is still ongoing and Air Force officials will not say what happened until the investigation is complete, an Air Force spokesperson said. Air Force officials said the rest of the almost 500 F-15s -- older airframes than the F-15Es -- will remain grounded until the investigation offers a solution to what happened. The E-model aircraft, the youngest and most sophisticated in the F-15 inventory, is heavily used by Central Command for ground support in the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is also used for the homeland security mission over the United States known as Operation Noble Eagle. On November 3, the Air Force grounded all of its F-15s in response to a November 1 crash of a Missouri Air National Guard F-15C in Boss, Missouri. The grounding forced Central Command to use other Air Force, Navy and French fighters to fill the gaps, though Strike Eagles did fly to support troops in battle in Afghanistan as an emergency measure while they were still under grounding orders, according to Central Command reports. The plane that crashed, built in 1980, was one of the older F-15s in the fleet. The F-15E Strike Eagle is an air-to-ground and air-to-air fighter, making it more versatile than other F-15 models, which are used for only air-to-air missions. The Strike Eagle is used in Afghanistan and Iraq in its air-to-ground role, using its advanced sensors to drop bombs on targets.",0
"Summary: Detainees file suit against ICE, allege they were injected with drugs. One detainee tells CNN: ""What they did to me was very, very bad"" ICE says 1,073 detainees have had ""medical escorts"" since 2003. Sen. Lieberman vows to investigate further; spokesman calls charges ""troubling"" Article: Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation. Raymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will. One of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered. Two immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will. Both are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages. Watch why the former detainees claim abuse ». Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered. ""I'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way,"" said Appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law. ""That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world."" The allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers. ""The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards,"" Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail. ""Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so."" ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, ""It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn't even mentally ill. ... But here, it's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport."" Responding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had ""medical escorts"" for deportation since 2003. From October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication ""because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self,"" she said. ""First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards,"" Myers said. She added no detainee should be ""involuntarily medicated without court order,"" except in emergency situations. But both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior. Soeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. See the document that shows Soeoth was injected. ""They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection,"" he said through broken English. He says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation. Soeoth's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness. In the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making. ICE said in a written statement it couldn't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation. ""Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees,"" the ICE statement said. ""Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service, may prescribe or administer medication."" But, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country. See Diouf's stay of deportation document. That's when, he says, ""I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes."" A government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders. In both cases, Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case. If they lose, they may land back in the hands of ICE, once again facing deportation. Soeoth says he's traumatized by what happened. ""I know this country [is] very generous to immigrants,"" he says. ""What they did to me was very, very bad."" CNN's Wayne Drash, Traci Tamura and Gregg Cane contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Mom thinks girl was abused while in the care of a baby sitter, attorney says. Mother had no idea daughter had been abused, attorney says. Girl, now 7, shown being raped on videotape made years ago. Manhunt underway for suspect, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37. Article: A young girl shown on video being sexually assaulted was raped while in the care of a baby sitter her mother hired, the mother's attorney said Tuesday. Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a young girl. The mother did not know her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until last Friday, Jerry T. Donohue said. ""A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,'"" he said. Donohue said the mother recognized the suspect, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a former animal trainer. The abuse most likely occurred while the mother - a single woman working six days a week - was at work, Donohue said. The attorney said he knows who the baby sitter is, but would not release that information because of the ongoing investigation. Earlier, officials had said the girl, who is now 7, was 3-years-old at the time the video was made. But Donohue said Tuesday, ""To my understanding, the abuse occurred before she was 3 years old."" The mother of the girl asked that the news media leave the family alone. ""I want to ask you, the press, to respect my family's privacy and to not attempt to contact my daughter or myself,"" the mother said in a written statement read by her attorney. Watch Donohue read the mother's statement ». The mother also said she is cooperating with investigators and that her daughter ""is safe and healthy."" The girl's videotaped rape set off a nationwide search last week. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas, Nevada, after thousands of tips poured in. Professionals have since evaluated her and she appears to be ""healthy and fine and happy,"" the lawyer said. The lawyer said neither he nor the mother has watched the videotape. Asked whether the mother is thankful to the news media for having published the girl's picture so that authorities were able to identify her, Donohue said, ""Not really ... there's some things maybe you don't want to know."" Still, he said, he hopes the man in the tape is brought to justice. ""Speaking as a father myself, I wish the guy would dig a hole in the desert and put a gun in his mouth,"" he said, referring to such an outcome as ""Wild-West justice."" Meanwhile, the intense manhunt for Stiles continued Tuesday. On Monday, Stiles' former girlfriend, Tina Allen, told CNN she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is ""mortified"" by the allegations against him. Allen said she and Stiles were in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years until recently, when she called it off. ""He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,"" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. ""I'm disgusted. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, mortified,"" Allen said of the alleged rape. ""I regret every, every step I ever took, I feel bad for the baby."" The FBI is also seeking Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas. A man who said he found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in Sunday to Nye County officials. Darren Tuck, a Nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography.",0
"Summary: Sen. Hillary Clinton defends vote on resolution, saying ""it's not a law"" Sen. Barack Obama: President could use Iran measure to justify military action. Obama says Clinton's vote for resolution shows ""flawed"" judgment. Differences with Clinton will be clear in ""next phase"" of campaign, Obama says. Article: Sen. Barack Obama on Thursday criticized a recent vote by Democratic presidential rival Sen. Hillary Clinton as helping to give President Bush a ""blank check"" to take military action against Iran. Sen. Barack Obama says Sen. Hillary Clinton has shown ""flawed"" judgment. ""We know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what Congress says,"" Obama said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Last month, Clinton voted to support a resolution declaring Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite part of the Iranian military, a foreign terrorist group. (The nonbinding amendment to the Defense Authorization Act passed by a 76-22 vote.) Obama said he would have voted against the measure but didn't because he was campaigning in New Hampshire at the time. He said it was impossible to know when votes will be scheduled in the Senate. ""This is a problem"" related to running for president, he said. Obama said Clinton also had shown ""flawed"" judgment during the vote to authorize the Iraq war five years ago. ""We know that there was embodied in this legislation, or this resolution sent to the Senate, language that would say our Iraqi troop structures should in part be determined by our desire to deal with Iran,"" Obama said. ""Now if you know that in the past the president has taken a blank check and cashed it, we don't want to repeat that mistake."" Clinton on Thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio, saying ""what I voted on was a nonbinding resolution. It's not an amendment. It's not a law."" While Clinton was campaigning Sunday in New Hampton, Iowa, an audience member at a town hall-style meeting pressed her on why she voted for the Iran measure and asked why she hadn't learned from past ""mistakes."" Calling ""the premise of the question"" wrong, the senator from New York argued the resolution calls for the terrorist label so that sanctions can be imposed. The sanctions, Clinton said, will in turn ""send a clear message to the leadership"" and lead to stronger diplomatic efforts. Earlier this month, Clinton also co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, that would prohibit military operations against Iran without congressional approval. Obama's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 77-23 Senate vote that authorized the president to use force against Iraq. Obama, then an Illinois state senator, spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time. Clinton's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them, Obama said. Watch as Obama questions Clinton's judgment ». ""I don't think it disqualified her, but I think it speaks to her judgment and it speaks to my judgment,"" Obama said. ""It speaks to how we will make decisions going forward. ""I think her judgment was flawed on this issue."" Obama said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with Clinton, whom many political observers view as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. ""There's no doubt we are moving into a different phase of the campaign,"" Obama said. ""The first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where I've been and what I am about. ""In this next phase, we want to make sure that voters understand that on big issues, like the decision to go into the war in Iraq, I had real differences with the other candidates, and that reflects on my judgment."" Another leading Democratic candidate, John Edwards, also voted in 2002 to authorize force in Iraq while he was then a senator from North Carolina. He later called his vote a mistake. In a veiled swipe at Clinton, Obama also suggested he could better unite the country and offer ""something new, as opposed to looking backward and simply duplicating some of the politics that we've become so accustomed to, that frankly the American people are sick of."" Obama would not say whether he would consider Clinton as his running mate should he become the Democratic Party's nominee. ""I think Sen. Clinton is a very capable person,"" he said. ""Right now, my goal is to make sure I am the nominee, and she is still the senator from New York."" CNN's Scott Anderson and Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Charges against Bryant Purvis reduced to second degree aggravated battery. Purvis had faced attempted murder, conspiracy charges. Charges reduced against at least five of six blacks charged in beating. Case of ""Jena 6"" drew national spotlight during September protest. Article: Charges against Bryant Purvis, one of the six black students accused of being involved in beating a white student, were reduced to second degree aggravated battery during his arraignment Wednesday morning. Bryant Purvis says he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball. Purvis, who was facing charges of second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy, entered a not guilty plea to the reduced charges in the LaSalle Parish Courthouse in Jena. Charges have now been reduced against at least five of the students in the racially charged ""Jena 6"" case. Charges against Jesse Ray Beard, who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Civil rights leaders Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to Jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- in September to protest how authorities handled the cases against Purvis and five other teens accused of the December 2006 beating of fellow student Justin Barker. After the arraignment, Purvis said he has moved to another town to complete high school. He said he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball, which he hopes to play in college. Mychal Bell, 17, is the only one of the ""Jena 6"" teens still in jail. Although he was released in September after his adult criminal conviction for the beating was overturned, he was ordered two weeks later to spend 18 months in a juvenile facility for a probation violation relating to an earlier juvenile conviction. A district judge tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery, saying the matter should have been handled in juvenile court. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, did the same with Bell's battery conviction in mid-September. Prosecutors originally charged all six black students accused of being involved in beating Barker with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy.",0
"Summary: T.I. to remain in custody until Friday, when there's a bond hearing. Rapper was arrested Saturday on weapons charges. T.I. won two awards at BET awards show Saturday night. Article: After his weekend arrest on gun charges, rapper T.I. will remain in custody until a bond hearing Friday, a federal magistrate said Monday. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested without incident in midtown Atlanta. The entertainer, whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested Saturday just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards. The small court room of Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman was packed with family, supporters and media, but even more people, including the rapper's mother, were turned away because of the overcrowding. Harris, 27, was arrested in a federal sting after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Justice Department statement. Watch a search of the rapper's home ». He was held in federal custody over the weekend. Authorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon. Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past. However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that ""a number of people"" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were ""two sides to every story -- sometimes three"" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor. The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped. Harris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. Harris won two awards. The show went on without the self-proclaimed ""King of the South,"" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest. Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, ""including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console."" At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet. ""Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,"" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. ""The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns."" The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement. The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said. The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said. On Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said. Harris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta to pick up the guns. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said. Court documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation. ""Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,"" according to an affidavit. Harris' music is built around the drug culture and is known as ""trap musik,"" the name of Harris' second album. A ""trap"" is Southern slang for a drug house. Harris soon will appear in the movie ""American Gangster,"" starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. The film is set to open November 2.

"Summary: Authorities call it one of the largest counterfeit operations ever discovered. Official: Scheme profited ""off the backs of legitimate companies"" Counterfeit operation allegedly involved 300,000 high-end bags and wallets. The alleged leaders are three Chinese citizens living in New York. Article: Three Chinese nationals accused of importing thousands of counterfeit luxury handbags in the United States have been arrested in the past two days, federal authorities announced Thursday. Shoppers sort through counterfeit brand name luxury bags and wallets on a Hong Kong street. ""This was a sophisticated criminal conspiracy that trafficked millions of dollars of counterfeit goods from China, profiting off the backs of legitimate companies and their hard-working employees,"" said Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher. Authorities call it one of the largest counterfeit operations ever discovered, involving about 300,000 bags and wallets with names like Burberry, Gucci and Coach. For customers who bought the knockoffs, it seemed like a deal. They paid a total of about $16 million for what would have been more than $100 million in handbags, purses and wallets in legitimate retail sales. The alleged leaders of the counterfeit operations are three Chinese citizens living in New York. Chong Lam, 49, and Joyce Chan, 39, were arrested there Wednesday. Eric Yuen, 39, was arrested Thursday in Las Vegas, Nevada. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who made the arrests began investigating the alleged scheme five years ago, after raids turned up counterfeit goods. The indictment was secretly returned in Richmond, Virginia, in October. The charges were unsealed when the alleged conspirators were taken into custody. Authorities seized and froze 29 bank accounts and three New York properties. The Chinese defendants will be taken to Richmond, where they will be arraigned at a later date, officials said.",0
"Summary: National Hurricane Center director Bill Proenza has left his position. Nearly half of the NHC signed a petition calling for him to step down. Proenza came under fire for comments he made about the QuikSCAT satellite. Staff unhappy with environment of closed doors, public bickering. Article: National Hurricane Center director Bill Proenza left his position Monday, just days after nearly half of the NHC staff signed a petition calling for his ouster. Hurricane Center Bill Proenza left his job as director Monday. Proenza is still employed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- a parent organization of the NHC -- but he is currently on leave, said NOAA spokesman Anson Franklin. Deputy Director Ed Rappaport has been temporarily placed in charge. Proenza, 62, became the director in January after the retirement of Max Mayfield. Proenza caused an uproar last month with comments about a key hurricane satellite called QuikSCAT. The satellite is five years beyond its life expectancy and operating on a backup transmitter. Proenza said if it were to fail, forecast tracks could be thrown off by as much as 16 percent. He said Washington reprimanded him for the remarks: ""They wanted me to be quiet about it."" But one of the center's longtime forecasters said Proenza's comments were misguided. ""QuikSCAT is another tool that we use to forecast,"" Lixion Avila said. ""The forecast will not be degraded if we don't have the QuikSCAT."" Last week, the Commerce Department launched an unscheduled review of the hurricane center after word of the staff's dissatisfaction started to become public. His staffers on Thursday issued a petition calling for him to step down. Watch how Proenza lost the confidence of his staff ». The petition said the center's ""effective functioning"" is at stake as the Atlantic hurricane season heads toward its peak. ""The undersigned staff ... has concluded that the center needs a new director, and with the heart of the hurricane season fast approaching, urges the Department of Commerce to make this happen as quickly as possible,"" said the petition, which was signed by twenty-three people, including four of five senior hurricane specialists. Hurricane center staffers told CNN's John Zarella they were unhappy not only about his comments about the QuikSCAT, but also about the environment at the center -- one characterized by closed doors and the public airing of dirty laundry. Proenza on Friday told CNN he had contacted his superiors in Washington about ""ways to move forward,"" but added, ""I am not going to resign."" Proenza told CNN he did not think the staff should dictate the leadership through ""signing petitions."" Proenza graduated from Florida State University with a degree in meteorology. He began his career in tropical meteorology in the mid-1960s at NHC and as a meteorologist on the ""hurricane hunter"" aircraft, according to his biography posted on the agency's Web site. He continued within the National Weather Service for more than 35 years, ""receiving numerous performance commendations and awards, including recognition from the NWS Employees' Organization as the NWS manager of the year for his collaborative leadership,"" the bio said.",0
"Summary: More than 1,700 people dead, toll expected to rise, official says. 15,000 people are injured following Thursday's tropical Cyclone Sidr. U.N. World Food Programme has food for 400,000 people for three days. Power outages, massive traffic jams and poor phone service in Dhaka. Article: More than 1,700 people have died in Bangladesh after a devastating tropical cyclone ripped through the western coast of the country, and the toll is expected to rise, a government spokesman tells CNN. Families stand amid the wreckage caused by the cyclone Friday in southern Bangladesh. Brig. Gen. Qazi Abedus Samad, director of operations for the country's armed forces, told CNN Saturday the toll had reached 1,723, and the figure is expected to rise. As flood waters recede, aid workers say they expect to find scores more bodies when remote villages are finally reached and the counting is done. They face debris-blocked roads, no electricity and almost nonexistent communications. In addition to the dead, another 15,000 people have been injured. Thousands of people have been displaced and many are still missing. Cyclone Sidr, with sustained winds of at least 131 mph (210 kph), made landfall Thursday night along the western coast of Bangladesh near the border with India, unleashing floodwaters. Government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN by telephone that the government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues. He said the extent of the cyclone's damage may be much worse because emergency relief had not been able to reach remote areas. The government has identified the 12 worst districts -- all of them located on the southern coast -- out of the 23 affected by the cyclone, Munaim said. See victims pick up the pieces after the storm ». The Bangladeshi air force, army and navy are working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. Power is still out in much of the country but it is being restored. Watch how the cyclone spawns a large relief effort ». Vince Edwards, national director of the relief agency World Vision in Bangladesh, said the high wind speeds of Cyclone Sidr have laid waste to the all-important rice crop and caused a huge loss of livestock. He said 280,000 families have been rendered homeless by the cyclone, but many have been able to get shelter from family members. World Vision is deploying 135 staffers and 7,000 volunteers to provide food, shelter and other relief. The group is appealing for $1.5 million in further funds to assist some 9.300 families rebuild their homes. In Dhaka -- about 200 miles north of the worst-hit region -- there were power outages, massive traffic jams and spotty phone service, CNN's Cal Perry said from the city. ""From an infrastructure perspective, the country absolutely has been brought to its knees,"" he said. Red Crescent spokeswoman Nabiha Chowdhury told CNN that communication with her agency's teams who have arrived in the stricken area is spotty, but they have resources with them to immediately help people with water purification, which she said was a top priority. Those teams have cash with them to buy relief supplies from local wholesalers, said Chowdhury, who said the latest number of people injured was 15,000 with 1,000 missing. Chowdhury said about 600,000 people had fled, adding that about 2 million people lived along the coast. The U.N. World Food Programme said it has enough high-energy biscuits to feed 400,000 people for several days. Another humanitarian group, Save The Children, appealed for aid from the public. ""Many families have lost everything, including their homes and their crops, and they are struggling to survive,"" said Kelly Stevenson, Save the Children's Bangladesh director. ""We are appealing to the U.S. public to support our efforts to assist children and families affected by this disaster. We remain very concerned about possible outbreaks of cholera and severe diarrhea due to the lack of access to clean water,"" he said in a written statement. The U.S. Department of State pledged Friday pledging ""to work with the government and foreign donors to assist in relieving the effects of the disaster."" Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. Mission in Bangladesh, anticipating the storm, pre-positioned 16 Zodiac boats, water treatment systems, water ambulances and food for a more rapid response. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was expected to approve plans to send up to three Navy amphibious warships, with up to 3,500 Marines, to locations off the coast of Bangladesh to assist in relief efforts.",0
"Summary: Louisiana resident, 18, faces federal hate-crime, conspiracy charges. Driver allegedly taunted civil rights marchers with nooses on pickup truck. Marchers were protesting handling of several racially charged incidents. Article: A man has been indicted on federal charges for allegedly displaying hangman's nooses from the back of a pickup truck during a civil rights march last year in Jena, Louisiana. A photo taken by I-Reporter Casanova Love shows a noose hanging from a pickup in Alexandria, Louisiana. Jeremiah Munsen, 18, of Grant Parish, repeatedly drove slowly past a group of marchers gathered at a bus depot in Alexandria, which is near Jena, as they awaited buses to return them to Tennessee, federal authorities said Thursday. As many as 20,000 marchers had taken part in the huge protests in Jena. Authorities there had been accused of injustice in the handling of racially charged cases, including the hanging of nooses in a tree after a group of black high school students sat in an area where traditionally only white students sat. The noose incident at Jena was the beginning of months of racial tension that included the beating of a white student, allegedly by six black classmates. The black students were prosecuted, but the three white students responsible for the nooses in the tree were not. Munsen and an unnamed conspirator had attached nooses to their pickup on September 20 and driven to Alexandria specifically to threaten and intimidate the marchers, the authorities said. View a series of photos of the truck ». A juvenile passenger was apprehended with Munsen, according to the arresting officer's report. The juvenile told police he and his family are in the Ku Klux Klan and that he had ""KKK"" tattooed on his chest, the police report said. He also said that he tied the nooses and that brass knuckles found in the truck belonged to him, the report said. ""This indictment accuses the defendant [Munsen] of conduct that constitutes a federal civil rights conspiracy violation and a federal hate crime,"" said U.S. Attorney Donald Washington. Washington and Grace Chung Becker, acting head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, announced the indictment, issued by a grand jury in Shreveport, Louisiana. A photograph of the truck was sent to CNN by I-Reporter Casanova Love, 26, who said he is in the U.S. military. He was visiting his family in Louisiana and said he witnessed the event. Love added, ""If the police had not stepped in, I fear what might have happened.""",0

"Summary: Government wants land for border fence; landowners refuse. Secretary Chertoff says he won't relent ""for a particular individual"" Eloisa Tamez says her property has been in her family since 1767. Border town mayor calls the fence ""a multibillion-dollar speed bump"" Article: Eloisa Tamez said she isn't scared anymore, just determined. ""I am not backing down,"" she said. The U.S. government wants to build a border fence like this one. About 100 landowners are fighting it. Tamez owns three acres of land along the Texas-Mexico border where the Department of Homeland Security would like to build a border fence. The property is a remnant of a 12,000-acre grant from Spain to her family in 1767, before the United States even existed. ""It is my history. It is my heritage,"" Tamez said. This week, the Justice Department began legal action against landowners and municipalities who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land. Tamez expects she will be sued sometime soon, but she is not intimidated. Asked how long she will fight, she said, ""As long as I have to."" Michael Chertoff, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said the fence will not be stopped by opponents like Tamez. ""Can we simply abandon an enterprise because it is a problem for a particular individual?"" Chertoff told CNN. ""I don't think I can accept that."" Watch Chertoff say it's ""civic responsibility"" to give up land ». Chertoff believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants making their way across the border and lessen the flow of drugs. He also argues it will increase the safety of Border Patrol agents who have faced increasing violence. The government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the Mexican border, including 370 miles of it by the end of this year. About 70 miles of fence is to be built in the Rio Grande Valley by year's end, if the government gets its way. The Rio Grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border, but in some places it is narrow enough to swim across. On the banks of the river there is ample evidence that people do so. Piles of underwear lie discarded by swimmers after they make it across. The swimmers change into dry clothes they have carried across in plastic bags. Then they disappear into the United States. The Border Patrol has stepped up its efforts in the Rio Grande Valley with more lights, and sensors to pick up movement. A levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by Border Patrol vehicles to patrol the area. Richard Cortez, the mayor of the border town of McAllen, Texas, believes hiring more Border Patrol agents, deepening the Rio Grande, and clearing its banks of tall vegetation would provide better border protection than the fence. Cortez calls the fence ""a multibillion-dollar speed bump,"" which will slow, but not stop, illegal immigration. ""It is a false sense of security,"" he said. ""America will not be safe. America will continue to waste resources on something that is not going to work."" Cortez and other border mayors who oppose construction of the fence formed a group called the Texas Border Coalition. The coalition wrote to Chertoff asking for further consultations on the fence, but this week the Department of Homeland Security turned them down. While expressing support for open dialogue with residents and officials, David Pagan of U.S. Customs and Border Protection wrote in an e-mail, ""We do not plan to suspend work on the construction of fence in order to hold a series of additional consultation meetings."" Cortez said his city is contemplating a court test of the law that mandated the construction of the border fence. And so a battle is being waged by about 100 landowners, those like Eloisa Tamez who are standing firm. ""I will not allow them to come and survey my land. I have an American-given right to protect my property,"" she said.",0
"Summary: Christian pastors borrow ideas from Scientology to preach temperate lifestyle. Critics say Scientology is a cult, always looking for recruits. Pastor in Houston, Texas, claims 70 percent success rate with addicts. Article: Some Christian congregations, particularly in lower income, urban areas, are turning to an unlikely source for help -- the Church of Scientology. Rev, Charles Kennedy uses Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's book during a Friday night sermon. Scientologists do not worship God, much less Jesus Christ. The church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult. So why are observant Christians embracing some of its teachings? Two pastors who spoke recently with CNN explained that when it comes to religion, they still preach the core beliefs of Christianity. But when it comes to practicing what they preach in a modern world, borrowing from Scientology helps. The Rev. Charles Kennedy, of the Glorious Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal church in Tampa, Florida, and the Rev. James McLaughlin, of the Wayman Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas, are among the theological hybrids. Watch Rev. Kennedy preach ». They say they are not scared off by programs with ties to a church that critics say has aggressive recruiting, secretive ways and rigid theology. As men of God rooted in Christian values, they do not see Scientology as a threat to their faith, but rather as a tool to augment it. Scientology was founded in the 1950s by L. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction writer. Followers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans. Although the church says there is a supreme being, its practices do not include worshipping God. ""I'm looking for solutions, and the people that I help, they don't ask me who L. Ron Hubbard is,"" said McLaughlin, who works with addicts. ""You know what they say? 'Thank God.' "" Critic Rick Ross, a court-certified Scientology expert, sees something more sinister at work. He warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the Scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal -- new recruits. ""Their hope is that through these programs, people will become more interested in L. Ron Hubbard, what else Mr. Hubbard had to offer, and this will lead them eventually to Scientology,"" Ross said. The church has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cult-like mind control. It is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers. And according to published reports, Scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups. Kennedy, McLaughlin and a handful of other Christian church leaders -- no one can say how many -- are finding answers to their communities' needs in Scientology's social programs. For Kennedy, it began two years ago when he attended a meeting at the Church of Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, Florida. He was introduced to a book called ""The Way to Happiness"" -- Hubbard's 64-page, self-described ""common sense guide to better living."" In the book, which lays out ways to maintain a temperate lifestyle, Kennedy found a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income African-American congregation. He said the book's 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment where there is too much crime and addiction and too little opportunity. Kennedy knew that before he could introduce any Scientology-related text to his congregation, he would have to prove that it did not contradict his Christian beliefs. And so, he found Scripture to match each of the 21 principles. Now Kennedy uses ""The Way to Happiness"" as a how-to supplement to his sermons. He believes it is easier to understand and clearer to follow than ancient Scriptures taken from the Bible. When asked whether Scientology's values contradict the religion of Jesus Christ, Kennedy replies, ""Sometimes yes. Sometimes no."" But he says his congregation can relate to ""The Way to Happiness."" Kennedy admits other pastors have criticized him, but the disapproval is not enough to discourage him. He insists that he has witnessed the changes ""The Way to Happiness"" has inspired in people. He also maintains that the Scientologists, many of whom he calls friends, are successful at outreach and getting desired results. At Kennedy's C. L. Kennedy Center, free tutoring based on Hubbard's ""study tech"" philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults. Kennedy's daughter, Jimirra, is one of the instructors. She said ""study tech"" and the Scientology orientation classes she attended helped her graduate from high school and become a poised woman. Though Jimirra Kennedy insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of Scientology, she still considers herself, at least in part, Scientologist. ""We say this all the time and I know my father says this, but I am like a Pentecostal Scientologist, that's what we are."" Critics like Ross are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines. They consider it a marketing win for Scientology. In Houston, McLaughlin says he is not one to argue with success. Driven by a need to address the rampant drug problem in his community, McLaughlin spent years searching for a solution before he discovered ""Narconon,"" Scientology's nonprofit drug rehab center, in 2001. McLaughlin trained at Narconon and brought the techniques back to his community to launch ""First Step Faith Step,"" a program that combines Hubbard's methods with the teachings of Christianity. He claims a 70- to 80-percent rehabilitation success rate. Kennedy and McLaughlin said they have never lost a member of their congregations to Scientology. ""I think that they truly believe that this may help their communities, but in my opinion, they're naïve,"" Ross said. Scientologists, he added, ""have their own agenda."" The Church of Scientology would not grant CNN an interview, nor would its representatives answer questions about the Hubbard-based programs.",0
"Summary: Vick's September 13 drug test shows marijuana use. Pretrial release conditions tightened; must stay home from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Virginia grand jury indicts Vick and the three co-defendants on state charges. Vick already faces up to 18 months in prison after federal plea deal. Article: Suspended NFL quarterback Michael Vick must adhere to tightened restrictions after he tested positive for marijuana use, a federal judge said Wednesday. Suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick tested positive for marijuana in a September 13 drug test. Vick tested positive for the drug on September 13, a court document from the Eastern District of Virginia shows. As a result, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson ordered Vick to ""submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance."" Those methods could include random drug testing, a remote alcohol testing system ""and/or any form of prohibited substance screening or testing,"" the order said. Vick, 27, must participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling ""if deemed advisable by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer"" at his own expense, the order said. Vick was also ordered to stay home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., ""or as directed by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer,"" the order said. He is to be electronically monitored during that time. The conditions are to apply until Vick's sentencing, which is set for December 10. Read about the federal case against Vick ». ""This is a very difficult time for Mr. Vick,"" said Billy Martin, Vick's lead defense counsel, in a written statement. ""He will comply with the court's new conditions regarding release."" Vick faces a possible prison term of 12 to 18 months after his August guilty plea to federal conspiracy charges related to dogfighting on his property in Surry County, Virginia. The original terms of the pretrial release, set in July by U.S. Magistrate Dennis W. Dohnal, required that Vick not use narcotic drugs or other controlled substances unless prescribed by a doctor. Vick's guilty plea in the federal case came after three associates -- Purnell Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Quanis Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Tony Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia -- admitted their roles in the operation and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. On Tuesday, a Virginia grand jury indicted Vick and the three co-defendants on state charges of running a dogfighting ring at the home. See a timeline of the case against Vick ». The Surry County grand jury brought two charges against Vick: one count of unlawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights. Each is a felony charge that could result in a five-year prison term. Vick will be arraigned October 3 in state court in Virginia. Vick's attorneys say they are fighting the state charges on the grounds that he can't be convicted twice of the same crime. CNN's Eric Fiegel contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr say their music sounds better. The former Beatles talk to CNN's Larry King. Widows of John Lennon and George Harrison also appeared. Harrison, Ono say their husbands still have strong presence. Article: Former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr clowned around and marveled at their band's amazing impact in an interview Tuesday on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Larry King, left, poses with (l-r) Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono Lennon, Olivia Harrison and Ringo Starr Tuesday in Las Vegas. ""We were just kids from Liverpool,"" McCartney said. ""And, yes, it is quite amazing, because as time goes on, it kind of becomes more and more of a phenomenon."" McCartney said the early Beatles knew they were a good band and were pretty sure of themselves, but Starr said, ""We thought we'd be really big in Liverpool."" ""I think the most exciting thing is that, you know, we expect people our age to know the music. But actually, a lot of kids know the music,"" Starr said. ""And if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that's the important part, not the moptops or whatever."" The pair appeared relaxed in sneakers and almost matching black suits and joked frequently -- often at each other's expense. ""They were nothing,"" Starr said of his former bandmates. ""And then I joined and then they got this record deal and look what happened."" ""No, we were good,"" McCartney retorted. ""You wanted to join us. You begged to join us."" ""I didn't beg,"" Starr said. Watch Paul and Ringo talk about the Beatles' magic ». McCartney and Starr were in Las Vegas with Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison, the widows of John Lennon and George Harrison, to celebrate the anniversary of Cirque du Soleil's ""Love,"" which uses the Beatles' music. Harrison said her husband was friends with Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte and came up with the idea before he died of cancer in 2001. ""George was around just long enough to transmit that to all of us,"" Harrison said. Ono said she wasn't sure at first what her husband would have thought about the project. John Lennon was shot near the couple's New York apartment in 1980. ""Now I really know that John would be very happy with this,"" she said. Neither woman has remarried and they both said it was still sometimes difficult to deal with their losses. ""We feel so strongly about our husbands that sometimes it's hard for us, isn't it?"" Ono said. ""It's hard, you know,"" Harrison said. ""I mean their presence is very powerful and very strong. But the incredible thing about them is that they -- everything they left the world and left us is uplifting and joyful."" The Beatles' music received a bit of a facelift for the show and has been remixed in 5.1 surround sound. (An album, ""Love,"" came out last year.) ""Paul and I went to listen to the music in 5.1 and we go 'Whoa, listen to that,' "" Starr said. ""You know you can hear everything now. Things that we buried a lot. It's all very clear, so it's really great to hear it."" ""Most historic stuff goes down with age, you know?"" McCartney added. ""Winston Churchill's old papers go brown and crinkly, while our music gets brighter and shinier."" ""Next year, it will be 10.1,"" Starr joked. McCartney's latest solo album, ""Memory's Almost Full,"" is No. 3 on the album charts and Starr is scheduled to release a greatest hits album in August.",0
"Summary: U.N. agency appeals for medical resettlement of Palestinians in Iraq camps. About 2,000 Palestinians in camps along Iraq-Syria border. 30 to 40 refugees arrive at border camp each week, UNHCR says. Article: Three Palestinians, including two sick children, have died recently while waiting for resettlement from Iraq, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday. UNHCR goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie visits the Al Waleed refugee camp in August. About 2,000 Palestinian refugees are stranded in camps along the Syrian border and face difficult living conditions, including limited medical care, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency has appealed for the resettlement of ""vulnerable and sick"" children in Al Waleed refugee camp at the Iraqi-Syrian border. One of those who died in the camp was a 3-year-old Palestinian boy who was suffering from rickets and pneumonia. He died a few days ago in a Ramadi hospital and then was buried in Al Waleed. The other was a 14-year-old suffering from Hodgkin's disease who died in Baghdad last week. A 50-year-old man who was waiting to be resettled died earlier this month in Al Waleed. The agency says seven people, including three children, have died at the camp since refugees fleeing attackers began arriving at the border in March 2006. About 30 to 40 people arrive at the Al Waleed camp each week, the UNHCR reports. The agency has been pursuing medical resettlement. ""UNHCR has helped resettle one family of eight with several sick children from this camp to Norway last August. Another 11 medical cases submitted for resettlement are awaiting approval,"" the agency said, which is working to identify other medical cases. And it is urging the resettlement of the entire group. ""UNHCR has sought solutions for the whole group since last year and has only received positive indications from Sudan and Chile,"" the agency said. Thousands of Palestinians have lived in Iraq, with some going there when Israel was formed and others born there. The UNHCR notes that some got ""preferential treatment"" under the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. But they have been the targets of violence since he was toppled.",0
"Summary: Debate will be last time top Democrats face off before Super Tuesday contests. Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to go one-on-one for first time together. Ex-Sen. John Edwards suspended presidential campaign Wednesday. Debate will start at 8 ET on Thursday night on CNN and CNN.com. Article: Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will duel for Super Tuesday votes Thursday night as the Democratic presidential hopefuls face off for the first time together minus former Sen. John Edwards. Thursday's debate is taking place at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The debate -- sponsored by CNN, the Los Angeles Times and Politico -- starts at 8 p.m. ET Thursday on CNN and CNN.com. CNN's Wolf Blitzer is the moderator. The event is the first Democratic debate since Obama's convincing victory Saturday in South Carolina. On Tuesday, Clinton won the Florida primary, a contest her campaign said helped the senator regain momentum even though it awarded no delegates. The forum at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood comes hours after the Obama campaign revealed it had raised $32 million in January from roughly 170,000 new donors. That amount will allow Obama to expand his television ad buys greatly in the 20-plus states holding primaries or caucuses Tuesday. Watch a time-lapse construction of the debate set ». The Clinton campaign would not indicate how much money it had raised in the same time period. Mike Gravel, the other Democratic presidential candidate still in the race, was not invited to participate in the debate because he did not meet certain criteria, including support in national polls. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted January 14-17, Gravel received less than 1 percent. Edwards suspended his presidential run Wednesday in New Orleans, Louisiana, but he didn't endorse any candidate despite what aides described as furious lobbying campaigns by Obama and Clinton. Thursday's debate may be slightly more restrained than last week's brutal showdown. Following her South Carolina loss, Clinton has largely steered clear of opportunities to take aim at Obama. Former President Bill Clinton also has avoided criticizing his wife's rival after dominating headlines with his attacks in the days before the South Carolina vote. The economy is likely to dominate Thursday's debate, as both candidates look to appeal to supporters of Edwards and his brand of economic populism. Clinton and Obama have split victories in their parties' early-voting states: Obama has won in Iowa and South Carolina, and Clinton has won in New Hampshire, Nevada, Michigan and Florida. But the Michigan and Florida contests awarded no delegates, and all major Democratic presidential candidates pledged to avoid campaigning in those states following national party penalties against them for moving up their contests so early. Clinton was the only major candidate to appear on the Michigan ballot. Obama is leading Clinton in the number of pledged delegates -- those awarded based on primary or caucus votes. Clinton has the edge when superdelegates are factored in. (Superdelegates are party leaders and elected officials who are not obligated to support a particular candidate. They can change their decisions at any time leading up to the Democratic National Convention in August.) To date, Obama has won an estimated 63 national convention delegates as a result of primary or caucus votes, while Clinton has earned an estimated 48 delegates. Clinton, however, has the overall lead in delegates -- 232 to 158 -- when superdelegates are included. With solid fundraising numbers and a nod from Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts this week, Obama will be making the claim he holds the front-runner title. But Clinton -- who has led in national surveys for much of the race -- will be making her case as well. CNN's Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: The United States is outraged by the attack, Secretary of State Rice says. Car bomb strikes U.S. Embassy vehicle north of Beirut. Three Lebanese civilians dead, American and Lebanese officials confirm. Driver of the vehicle was slightly injured, and the only passenger was not hurt. Article: A car bomb struck a U.S. Embassy vehicle Tuesday as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Beirut, killing at least three Lebanese civilian bystanders, according to American and Lebanese officials. Lebanese soldiers and Red Cross workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Beirut. The driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries, and the sole passenger walked away unscathed, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. Both were Lebanese nationals, he said. An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the spokesman said. Lebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut's Dora area, contradicting earlier reports of four. Twenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion, which was caused by a 15-kilogram (33-pound) bomb placed in a car before the explosion, the security forces said. The United States is outraged by the terrorist attack, said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia. ""I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded, and certainly to the families of those who were killed, that our condolences are with them,"" she added. It was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb. A communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack, and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy. But McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target. ""We don't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened, who is responsible, who is exactly being targeted,"" he told reporters during the State Department's daily briefing. ""We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us."" Citing security concerns, McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman. A U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night ""out of respect to the victims of today's terrorist explosion."" In addition to the American, an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast, according to a Western diplomatic source. Video of the scene showed several damaged cars, including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal. A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage. Mohammed Chatah, senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, pointed out that the attack happened during ""a major political crisis"" in Lebanon, which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud. ""This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation,"" Chatah told CNN. Tuesday's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western, anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital. Most recently, an explosion in Beirut's Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Francois Al-Hajj, the head of operations for the Lebanese army, and his bodyguard on December 12. Al-Hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Michel Suleiman was elected to replace Emile Lahoud as president. Lebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-Syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president. The nation has been without a president since November 23, when the pro-Syrian Lahoud stepped down at the end of his term. In February 2005, the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon. CNN's Anthony Mills in Beirut and Elise Labott in Washington contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: ""Rainbow Man,"" or the John 3:16 guy, is in prison. Communist dictator is a hoops fan. From fan to talk radio host. How an all-star heckler lost his seat. Article: 1. Bobby Murcer's biggest fan. Former New York Yankee Bobby Murcer warms up during Old Timers Day Yankee Stadium on July 7. Our first story has a fairy-tale middle and a horrible ending. In August of '77, Bobby Murcer of the Cubs promised to hit a home run for terminally ill fan Scott Crull. That night, Murcer hit two of them. Pretty amazing, especially when you consider Murcer only hit nine homers the whole next season. But that's not why Crull -- a 12-year-old from Calumet City, Illinois -- makes this list. Broadcasting the game nationally on ABC, Keith Jackson told the country how Murcer had fulfilled the dying boy's last wish. Eyes watered, spines tingled. There was only one problem -- nobody had ever told the boy he was dying. His parents were horrified. Weeks later, Crull passed away. 2. The good luck charmers. Every sport has its own strange traditions. I'd argue hockey's ""throwing an octopus on the ice for good luck"" is the weirdest. Tossing the eight-tentacled cephalopod was the brainchild of Detroit storeowners Pete & Jerry Cusimano. The date: April 15, 1952. The logic: one tentacle for each of the eight victories it took to win the Stanley Cup. Later that spring, most likely fueled by the good luck octopus, the Red Wings won the title. PETA has objected to this practice, which continues to this day. The Red Wings mascot is not a Red Wing, but Al the Octopus. 3. The John 3:16 guy. Also known as ""Rainbow Man,"" the born-again Rollen Stewart and his John 3:16 signs were fixtures at major events in the 1970s and 80s. He brought his message to the World Series, Super Bowl, Olympics, and World Cup. He was outside Buckingham Palace when Di and Charles wed; he went to see the Pope in Alaska. But he was more religious fanatic than sports fan. According to the Los Angeles Times, Stewart planned to assassinate President Bush and candidate Clinton in 1992. And he's now serving three life sentences for holding a maid hostage at a Los Angeles Hyatt, also in 1992. By the way, chapter three, verse sixteen of the Gospel of John says, ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" This is also printed on cups at the In-N-Out Burger. 4. The All-Star heckler. For 12 years, Maryland lawyer and Washington Bullets fan Robin Ficker was the NBA's most prominent heckler. With season tickets behind the visiting team's bench, his antics were legendary. When he reminded Frank Layden of the Jazz that ""USA Today"" had rated him Worst Dressed Coach, Layden had to be restrained by security. With the Bulls in town, Ficker loudly read excerpts of Maverick, coach Phil Jackson's sex-laden 1975 autobiography. During the 1993 Suns-Bulls NBA Finals, Charles Barkley (of the Suns) flew Ficker to Phoenix and bought him a ticket behind the Chicago bench. Ficker was ejected in the first quarter. The Bullets became the Wizards in 1997 and moved into the MCI Center the following season. Ficker's new seats were not in shouting distance of the visiting team, forcing him into heckling retirement. Last year he received 9.5% of the vote in a losing bid for Montgomery County Executive. 5. Kim Jong-il. That's right, the world's most feared dictator is a hoops junkie. During a 2000 visit, then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presented him a basketball signed by Michael Jordan. The Chicago Bulls are the favorite team of Kim Jong-il, who reportedly has a video library with every game Jordan ever played. At 5'3"", the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army is roughly the same height as Muggsy Bogues. 6. David Letterman's Stalker. David Letterman's biggest fan was also his biggest headache. When she was arrested for stealing Dave's Porsche in 1988, Margaret Ray told police she was Mrs. Letterman. She was a frequent trespasser on Dave's estate, once camping out on his tennis court. Ray's antics made her a regular monologue target. But the jokes stopped in 1998, when Ray jumped in front of a moving train. The collective guilt spread when we learned she was schizophrenic, as were her two brothers, who also committed suicide. 7. Joe from Saddle River. A die-hard Jets, Mets and Rangers fan, Joe Benigno was a frequent caller to WFAN, New York's all-sports radio station. Benigno won the station's Fan Appreciation Day contest in 1994, earning a chance to guest-host his own show. By 1995, Joe was WFAN's overnight guy, a title he held for almost a decade. In 2004, he was deemed ready for daytime and given the 10 a.m.-1p.m. timeslot. For all the lonely and passionate talk radio callers out there, Joe gives hope. 8. Steffi Graf's biggest fanatic. Deranged and obsessed with seeing Steffi Graf return to the top of the rankings, Gunter Parche stabbed Monica Seles during a 1993 match in one of the most disturbing incidents in sports history. Almost as disturbing was his punishment. Parche received a two-year suspended sentence and was ordered to attend mandatory counseling. Even more shocking, I can't find footage of any of this on YouTube. Also receiving votes: John Hinckley; the fan who started the Pistons-Pacers brawl in 2004; Jeffrey Maier; The Kissing Bandit; ""Butch"" from Middlebury; Metallica superfan-turned-bass player Jason Newstead; and Steve Bartman.

"Summary: Mother seeks to have womb of severely disabled daughter, 15, removed. Briton wants to prevent cerebral palsy sufferer feeling pain of menstruation. UK doctors seek legal advice to see if they can perform hysterectomy. Charity for disabled says move could infringe human rights. Article: A mother is seeking to have the womb of her severely disabled daughter removed to prevent the 15-year-old from feeling the pain and discomfort of menstruation. Doctors in Britain are now taking legal advice to see if they are permitted to carry out the hysterectomy on Katie Thorpe, who suffers from cerebral palsy. But a charity campaigning for the disabled said on Monday the move could infringe human rights and would set a ""disturbing precedent."" Andy Rickell, executive director of disability charity Scope, told the Press Association: ""It is very difficult to see how this kind of invasive surgery, which is not medically necessary and which will be very painful and traumatic, can be in Katie's best interests. ""This case raises fundamental ethical issues about the way our society treats disabled people and the respect we have for disabled people's human and reproductive rights. Watch why the surgery is so controversial ». ""If this enforced sterilization is approved, it will have disturbing implications for young disabled girls across Britain."" Katie's mother Alison Thorpe, who lives in Billericay, southern England, said the operation was in her daughter's best interests. ""First of all, this is not about me. If it was about me, I would have given up caring for Katie a long, long while ago,"" she told GMTV. ""It is about quality of life and for Katie to not have the associated problems of menstruation adds to her quality of life. It means she can continue with the quality of life we can give her now. ""Katie wouldn't understand menstruation at all. She has no comprehension about what will be happening to her body. All she would feel is the discomfort, the stomach cramps and the headaches, the mood swings, the tears, and wonder what is going on."" Thorpe said an operation would be best for Katie, despite the initial pain it would cause. She added: ""The short-term pain and discomfort we can manage with painkillers. We will be able to manage that pain much better than menstruation once a month, when Katie cannot tell us 'I'm in pain.'""",0
"Summary: Nihat Kahveci put Turkey into Euro 2008 with 1-0 win over Bosnia/Herzegovina. Nihat struck at the end of a first half as Turkey joined holders Greece in finals. Portugal joined Poland in qualifying from Group A with 0-0 draw with Finland. Article: Nihat Kahveci sent Turkey into the Euro 2008 finals behind defending champions and Group C winners Greece with the only goal in a narrow 1-0 victory over battling Bosnia-Herzegovina. Goalscorer Nihat gets a kiss from team-mate Altintop after Turkey sealed their place with a 1-0 win over Bosnia. The result ended Norway's hopes of snatching qualification despite their 4-1 victory away to Malta with Steffen Iversen scoring a first half hat-trick. Nihat struck at the end of a first half that Fatih Terim's Turkey dominated, yet the hosts were unable to build on that lead and had to endure some tense moments. Just a point had separated the third-placed Scandinavians from Terim's men -- and Turkey needed to win to progress. Nihat led the charge forcing early saves from goalkeeper Adnan Guso and finally making the breakthrough two minutes before half-time. Hamit Altintop found space down the left and crossed for the Villarreal forward who finished from 12 meters. Iversen broke the deadlock in Malta after 25 minutes and fired a second from the penalty spot three minutes later -- completing his treble on the stroke of half-time. Michael Mifsud hit back for Malta after the re-start, but Andre Schembri was red-carded after 67-minutes before Morten Gamst Pedersen's strike wrapped it up all to no avail. Portugal went through from Group A after a goalless home draw against qualification rivals Finland while group winners Poland completed their program with a 2-2 draw away to Serbia",0
"Summary: Haitham Sabah al-Badri was the al Qaeda emir of greater Samarra. U.S. military says al-Badri suspected in two other attacks that killed 49. Family of slain girl upset soldier wasn't sentenced to death, Reuters says. At least 11 people killed in mortar attacks in Baghdad, Interior Ministry says. Article: Coalition troops killed the al Qaeda terrorist who masterminded the February 2006 attack on Samarra's al-Askariya mosque and set off continuing violence and reprisal killings between Sunnis and Shiites, the U.S. military said Sunday. The attack on Samarra's al-Askariya mosque set off violence between Sunnis and Shiites. Haitham Sabah al-Badri, the al Qaeda emir of greater Samarra, was killed by an airstrike Thursday east of Samarra, said Rear Adm. Mark Fox during a news conference. ""Eliminating al-Badri is another step in breaking the cycle of violence instigated by the attack on the holy shrine in Samarra,"" Fox said. ""We will continue to hunt down the brutal terrorists who are intent on creating a Taliban-like state in Iraq."" Coalition forces Thursday raided four buildings outside Samarra that were associated with al-Badri, according to a U.S. military news release. During the raid, at least four armed men were seen leaving the buildings and setting up tactical fighting positions in an effort to ambush coalition forces, the release said. The coalition forces called in close air support, killing al-Badri and the three others, the release said. One of those killed was identified as a foreigner; al-Badri was identified by his close associates and relatives, the military said. El-Badri's death was first reported Saturday by a high-ranking Iraqi Interior Ministry official. No one was injured in the attack on the Golden Mosque, one of the holiest Shiite sites, but thousands have been killed by the death squads and reprisal bombings that have ravaged Iraq in the 17½ months since the attack. In addition to the February attack that collapsed the mosque's dome, another bombing in June destroyed the shrine's two remaining minarets. Al-Badri is believed to have been involved in other attacks, including two last year, Fox said -- the June 23 bombing of a Kirkuk courthouse that left 20 Iraqis dead and the August 28 attack at a Samarra checkpoint that killed 29 Iraqi soldiers. Samarra is in Salaheddin province, north of Baghdad. Mortar attacks kill 11. Two mortar rounds struck a gas station in a mainly Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad on Sunday, killing at least 11 people and wounding 15 others, a spokesman with Iraq's Interior Ministry said. The attack in the Afdhailiya neighborhood happened about 8 a.m. (12 a.m. ET), the spokesman said. Suicide bombers attacked two gas stations Wednesday, killing 70 people, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, coalition forces said Saturday they killed four suspected militants and detained 18 thought to have helped make or plant roadside bombs, the U.S. military said. The militants were suspected of coordinating logistical support from Iran for elements of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and other Shiite militias operating in Iraq, the military said. Iraqi family upset with U.S. soldier's sentence. A U.S. soldier has been sentenced to 110 years in confinement for participating in the rape of a 14-year-old girl and the killings of her and her family in Iraq, an Army spokeswoman said. The girl's family told Reuters on Sunday they were dismayed by the punishment and would have preferred to see the death penalty handed down in the case. Pfc. Jesse Spielman was convicted Friday of rape, conspiracy to commit rape, housebreaking with the intent to commit rape and four counts of felony murder. The girl, her parents and younger sister were shot dead in March 2006 in Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. ""We were expecting the death penalty against those criminals and the place to carry out the sentence is where the incident happened,"" the girl's cousin, Abu Ammar, told Reuters. Her uncle, Hadi Abdullah, told the wire agency that family members wished there was a way to appeal the sentence so the death penalty could be imposed. Three soldiers have previously pleaded guilty in the case and were given sentences ranging from five to 100 years. The accused ringleader, former Pvt. Steven Green, was discharged from the Army and awaits trial in a civilian court. Other developments. CNN's Pierre Bairin and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: ""I love ORU with all my heart,"" Richard Roberts writes in his resignation letter. Three professors allege they were fired for revealing misspending. Roberts and wife deny spending university funds improperly. Roberts announced last month he was stepping aside temporarily as president. Article: Richard Roberts, the embattled president of Oral Roberts University and the son of its namesake evangelist founder, stepped down Friday, according to the school's Board of Regents. Richard Roberts and wife Lindsay appear on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in October. ""I love ORU with all my heart. I love the students, faculty, staff and administration, and I want to see God's best for them,"" Roberts wrote in his resignation letter. Roberts' decision was effective immediately and came as the school fought a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by three professors who accused him and his wife of misconduct. John Swails, Tim Brooker and Paulita Brooker said they lost their jobs after reporting information indicating that Roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses. Roberts and his wife, Lindsay, have denied the allegations. The suit also claimed Oral Roberts University gave a ""convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students"" and evidence in the case had been shredded -- charges the university has denied. In addition, the suit alleged Lindsay Roberts repeatedly spent time with an ""underage male"" in various situations. She denied any improper behavior, insisting in a statement that she had ""never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage."" The Board of Regents, which voted to hire an auditor to look into the claims, will meet early next week to discuss a search process for a new president, according to Friday's statement from Chairman George Pearsons. Roberts announced last month he would step aside temporarily as president, saying he and his family had suffered ""heavy damage."" The controversy has drawn international attention to the private Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma.",0
"Summary: Thousands lined Beirut streets to honor anti-Syrian MP, killed in car bomb blast. Noted parliamentarian killed along with four others during Wednesday rush hour. Flag-draped coffin paraded through streets before burial in Christian district. Day of national mourning called, with schools, universities, public offices shut. Article: Amid high emotions and tight security, thousands lined the streets of Beirut Friday to honor Antoine Ghanem, the anti-Syrian Lebanese MP killed in a powerful bomb blast along with four others. Amin Gemayel (R), Phalange party head, carries the coffin of assassinated deputy Antoine Ghamen. Against an atmosphere of intense political and patriotic fervor, the flag-draped coffins of the politician and two bodyguards also killed in Wednesday's rush hour blast made its way through the city's Christian district to the Sacred Heart church on what the government had declared as a day of national mourning. The procession was accompanied by thousands waving flags, as well as a brass band playing the anthem of Ghanem's Phalange Party, The Associated Press reported. TV pictures showed distraught mourners crowding and reaching out to the coffins as they were carried aloft. Several people were seen to collapse and had to be carried away. Mourners also carried photographs, threw rose petals and unfurled banners, some of which read ""We Won't Kneel,"" AP said. The coffins were greeted at the Christian Maronite church with applause from the gathered mourners, the agency said, including majority leaders and the Lebanese cabinet as well as Ghanem's family and friends. Ghanem was later buried in the city's Christian district. Ghanem's death is the latest in a series of attacks targeting prominent anti-Syrian figures, with the most notorious being the February 2005 assassination in Beirut of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon. Hariri also died in a massive explosion. The incident threatens to cast the country into political uncertainty ahead of a key presidential vote in a tightly divided parliament, almost evenly split between anti- and pro-Syrian camps. Watch how Ghanem's death disrupts Lebanese politics ». CNN's Beirut bureau chief Brent Sadler said that many Lebanese now feared for the future, especially given other events in the region including the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, recent political differences in Iraq and Iran's bid to become a super power. ""There continues to be among a great deal of people here a sense of foreboding that perhaps the worst is yet to come,"" he said. U.S. President George W. Bush, in a written statement, joined other world leaders in condemning the ""horrific assassination."" ""Since October 2004, there has been a tragic pattern of political assassinations and attempted assassinations designed to silence those Lebanese who courageously defend their vision of an independent and democratic Lebanon,"" Bush said Wednesday. Also in a written statement, a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. secretary-general ""condemns in the strongest terms this terrorist attack."" ""The secretary general urges all Lebanese to exercise utmost calm and restraint at this very critical time and to allow judicial procedures to take their course,"" the spokesperson said. Bush's statement added: ""The United States opposes any attempts to intimidate the Lebanese people as they seek to exercise their democratic right to select a president without foreign interference. We will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Lebanese people as they resist attempts by the Syrian and Iranian regimes and their allies to destabilize Lebanon and undermine its sovereignty."" The U.S. Embassy in Beirut issued a statement saying: ""It is not a coincidence that these attacks target those figures who have been working to secure Lebanon's independence from renewed Syrian hegemony. We note with concern that many Lebanese politicians allied with Syria have in fact warned that murder and violence would be the results of any effort to exercise genuine parliamentary democracy."" And U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in a written statement, said: ""The bombing that claimed these lives was another act in a campaign of terror by those who want to turn back the clock on Lebanon's hard-won democratic gains."" ""The world should speak with one voice in calling for an end to violence in Lebanon intended to subvert democratic processes in that country,"" Rice said. ""Lebanese elections, scheduled to begin in just days, must proceed, in accordance with the Constitution, without threats of foreign interference and the violence that accompanies such obstruction.""",0
"Summary: Police say 20 suspected of involvement in the recruiting suicide bombers held. Arrests were in Italy and across other European countries, police say. Those held are accused of recruiting bombers to go to Iraq and Afghanistan. 11 people were held in Italy and nine others across Europe. Article: Police made a string of arrests across Europe Tuesday, detaining 20 people suspected of involvement in the recruitment of suicide bombers, Italian police said. Eleven of the arrests were in Italy, in the northern cities of Milan, Reggio Emilia, Bergamo, and San Remo, said. Lt. Col. Sandro Sandulli, the head of the Carabinieri special forces. One was already in custody, so authorities served him with a new arrest warrant which included new charges against him, Sandulli said. Three arrests were in Britain, one in France, and one in Portugal, Sandulli said. The remaining arrests happened in European countries but Sandulli did not specify which ones. Those arrested are suspected of forming Salafi Jihad terrorist cells which were recruiting suicide bombers and sending them to Iraq and Afghanistan, said Col. Mario Parente, deputy commander of the Carabinieri special forces unit. Parente said that during the arrests, police found al Qaeda manuals for the production of explosives, detonation devices, and various poisons. He said the manuals also included details of guerrilla-style war operations. Salafi is an extreme school of Islamic thought which developed in Egypt and began to have prominence with militant groups there in the late 1960s and has since been adopted by terrorist groups in North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, said Sajjan Gohel, director of international security at the Asia Pacific Foundation in London. ""It's become the ideology of choice for transnational terrorism, including al Qaeda,"" Gohel said. ""It's emerging as a very dangerous ideology."" The Madrid train bombers and various terrorist cells in Italy were part of the Salafi school of thought, he added. Italian police said Tuesday's arrests were the result of an investigation, started in 2003, into some Salafi cells which were organized by Tunisians and Algerians. The main suspect in the operation is a Tunisian who was arrested in 2002 during a separate antiterrorism operation, police said. The main terrorist cell was based in the northern Italian region of Lombardy and involved what investigators called a ""long-term"" jihadist program which provided military and ideological training. Another cell, based in Reggio Emilia, had the goal of creating a grand Islamic ""empire"" stretching from Morocco to China, police said. Parente said those arrested are also accused of producing false documents, facilitating illegal immigration, and covering up other individuals wanted for terrorism-related crimes.

"Summary: Nair directed ""Monsoon Wedding,"" ""Vanity Fair,"" ""Salaam Bombay!"" Her film, ""The Namesake,"" is based on Jhumpa Lahiri's novel. Nair cast character of ""Gogol"" after teenage son's recommendation. Nair: Indian and American audiences ""not that different"" Article: From ""Mississippi Masala"" to ""Vanity Fair,"" Mira Nair's movies have entranced audiences in India and the West. CNN spoke to the director of ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""Salaam Bombay!"" at the Bollywood Movie Awards in Long Island about filmmaking in India and America and her adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's novel about loss and family, ""The Namesake."" ............................... Film director Mira Nair. CNN: What inspired you to make ""The Namesake""? Mira Nair: I happened to read ""The Namesake"" on a plane in early 2004, when I traveled from New York to Jo'berg to finish the filming of ""Vanity Fair."" I read ""Namesake"" while in huge grief with the death of a beloved person to me [Mira's mother in law]. It was at that state of mourning that I picked up this novel, and in it Jhumpa writes really acutely of a loss of a parent in a foreign country, and I thought I had been understood by someone. It was also a story that linked the two cities in which I had grown up -- Calcutta and New York City -- and it was almost certainly the road that I had traveled. It just spoke to me and I felt compelled to do this film. A few months later we were shooting it. CNN: It's filmed in both India and New York, such different cultures. Tell us about the universal themes involved during the film. Nair: Well, the story of movement and crossings is as old as the hills. It's a tale of millions of us that have left one home for another, and tried to find out who we are through these places. Then when we have children, life gets more interesting. It is about growing up through our adult lives and our children's lives. It is also equally a love story between two people who come from a culture who don't send roses and diamonds for love; who sit at a kitchen table and look at each other. It's about that generation of parents who have that stillness about one another, versus the clang and hustle of young Gogol who is 15 and grows up in an American world because he wishes to be American. That flow -- that see-saw between parents and children, that's what ""The Namesake"" is about. CNN: Tell us about casting the role of Gogol. Nair: Well, Kal Penn plays Gogol and he's known as a comic star, but I had no idea that he existed until my 15-year-old son said, ""This has to be your Gogol."" I didn't take him seriously at all until every night the campaign mounted at home: ""Tell me in the morning it's Kal Penn!"" he would say. And then Kal wrote to me and told me he became an actor because he had seen ""Mississippi Masala"" when he was eight years old and realized people on the screen could look like him, and other such seductive things. He came to my office and auditioned and he was just so appealing, and so much the real thing, that I cast him as Gogol. CNN: How have Indian audiences reacted to your heavily western-influenced films? Nair: It's not that different a kind of audience, that's what pleases me. ""Salaam Bombay!"" we really made for the children on the streets and the kids who really love that Bollywood stuff, and also with ""Deeply Alternative,"" which ran for 27 weeks. ""Monsoon Wedding"" was also a big hit in India. But no, they don't come to my films for Bollywood fare; it's a completely alternative thing. In terms of audiences on both sides, I've been blessed: the films have been really well received and highly anticipated. CNN: ""The Namesake"" was filmed in America and India. What differences were there in the two locations? Nair: In India it is more about orchestrating chaos, and it's about sifting the chaos, but I get especially excited about the throb and chaos on the streets and so on, and in America it's about paying for the chaos, you know every head has to be placed there and paid for. CNN: ""The Namesake"" is about not losing the identity of Indian culture. Was that a challenge? Nair: I am at home in many cultures. I live actively in three continents and I've done that for most of my life, so I just make films as I see the world, and that happens to speak to people. I do things that I want to do. It so happens because I am fluent in both worlds that my films enter both worlds, perhaps. CNN: Do Indian and American audiences behave differently? Nair: No, not really. I think films have to reach people and really grab them. That's what I hope to do when I make a film -- to get under your skin and really make you think about something, and have a transporting time that takes you somewhere.",0
"Summary: The 17-year-old suspect allegedly fired the fatal shot. Eric Rivera Jr. will be moved to a Miami-Dade facility Wednesday, attorney says. Three adult suspects in Sean Taylor slaying on suicide watch. Taylor died after being shot in home invasion last week. Article: A grand jury Tuesday indicted four suspects on charges of first degree felony murder and armed burglary in the slaying of Washington Redskins star Sean Taylor. A grand jury identified Eric Rivera Jr. as the shooter in the death of NFL star Sean Taylor. Court documents say the youngest is alleged to have fired the fatal shot. The three adult suspects -- Venjah K. Hunte, 20, Jason Scott Mitchell, 19, and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow, 18 -- appeared in court Tuesday via videoconference wearing thick green vests, which defense attorneys said were suicide safety smocks. They were ordered held without bail at the Pre-Trial Detention Center in Miami, Florida, where Corrections Officer Janelle Hall said they are under suicide watch. The fourth suspect -- Eric Rivera Jr., 17 -- remained in custody in Fort Myers, Florida. His attorney, Wilbur Smith, told CNN he expected his client to be moved to a Miami-Dade juvenile detention facility Wednesday. Watch CNN's Rick Sanchez speak to attorneys for two of the suspects ». Rivera was armed during the alleged burglary, and ""during the course of the commission of the offense ... discharged a firearm and as a result of the discharge, death or great bodily harm was inflicted upon Sean Maurice Taylor, a human being,"" the indictment says. The four men were arrested Friday, officials said. Taylor, 24, died a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his home. Miami-Dade police investigators said they believe the burglars thought the house was empty. Thousands of mourners attended Taylor's funeral Monday at Florida International University's arena. See photos from the funeral ». Police said Taylor and his girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, were awakened by noise coming from the living room early November 26. Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door, but the door was kicked in and two shots were fired, police said. One struck Taylor in the leg. Garcia and the couple's 18-month-old daughter were not hurt. Authorities have said Garcia told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack, did not see what happened and could not provide a suspect description. A break-in had been reported at Taylor's residence eight days earlier. A police report from that incident said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed. Several drawers and a bedroom safe were searched during the break-in, according to the report. Taylor spent four years with the Redskins, earning his first Pro Bowl selection in 2006. He suffered a sprained right knee in a November 11 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles and had not played since. The 2004 first-round draft pick played at the University of Miami, where he was an All-American in 2003. He was regarded as one of the hardest-hitting players in the NFL.

"Summary: Deadly struggle ""transpired within six minutes. That's all it took,"" sheriff says. Suspect faces charges including first-degree murder and escape. Incident happened as the deputy was transporting Michael Mazza to court. Mazza was apprehended after a massive manhunt. Article: A man serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore has confessed to overpowering and fatally shooting a deputy who was taking him to court Wednesday, authorities said. Michael Mazza, 40, was arrested outside a pawn shop in Hollywood, Florida, hours after the death of Broward County Deputy Paul Rein sparked a massive manhunt. It was the third shooting of a Broward County sheriff's deputy in four months, and the second fatality. The incident happened as Mazza was being taken to the second day of his trial in connection with the armed robbery of a Coral Springs bank, Sheriff Al Lamberti said. Mazza was being transported in a medical van because of a medical condition, Lamberti said. The driver's compartment of the van was separated from the back by a cage or grill. Mazza and Rein left about 8:05 a.m., Lamberti said. Minutes later, a truck driver who saw all or part of the altercation near Pompano Beach called 911. ""All of this transpired within six minutes. That's all it took,"" Lamberti said. The struggle began when Rein apparently pulled the medical transport van over at an intersection. The deputy's body showed other injuries from the fight -- a broken finger, bruises and cuts, Lamberti said. Mazza allegedly took Rein's service weapon away from him and shot him, authorities said. Although two shots were fired, Rein was shot only once, the bullet entering his upper chest and exiting his lower back, Lamberti told reporters. After the shooting, Mazza is believed to have thrown Rein from the van and driven away. A city public works employee later spotted the blood-spattered van in Fort Lauderdale, Lamberti said. Mazza, meanwhile, is believed to have hitchhiked his way down to Hollywood, about 20 miles away. He approached a man at a pawn shop and asked for a ride. The man, who was headed to a second pawn shop, agreed. When the man arrived at the second pawn shop, he left Mazza in the car and went inside, Lamberti said. As he was talking to the clerk, a television in the shop began broadcasting news about the deputy's shooting, and showed a picture of Mazza, he said. The man ""tells the clerk, 'Hey, I have that guy in my car,' "" Lamberti said. He went back to the car, took his keys, came back and told the clerk to call police. Mazza was arrested shortly afterward. Rein's gun was found with Mazza in the man's car, the sheriff said. Mazza faces charges including first-degree murder and escape, Lamberti said. He was being interviewed by police Wednesday afternoon and was to appear before a judge at some point, he said, and afterward would be transported to Dade County Jail. Because the shooting was ""an emotionally charged event for all of us ... we feel it's probably better that he be housed at another facility outside of Broward County,"" Lamberti said, and Dade County agreed to house him. Mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities, but later agreed, and confessed to shooting Rein, the sheriff said. He offered no details. Lamberti said Mazza was serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore in Coconut Creek, correcting his earlier statement that Mazza was serving two life sentences. He was on trial for robbery of the Coral Springs bank. Broward County also has a pending case against Mazza -- a February drugstore robbery in Pompano Beach, he said. Mazza was dressed in civilian clothes -- a suit -- rather than jail scrubs Wednesday because he had a court date, authorities have said. When caught, however, Mazza was wearing a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers, Lamberti told reporters. Police are investigating whether he had planned the escape in advance and whether anyone helped him. Rein's co-workers told reporters he was ""in outstanding condition physically."" The sheriff's office has fitness-for-duty standards that deputies must meet. Broward County deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day -- one deputy transporting up to a handful of inmates, Lamberti said. Thin staffing and scant resources prevent more than one deputy being involved, he said. ""It's a routine thing,"" Lamberti said. ""But it shows, in this profession, nothing is routine, whether it be a domestic, a traffic stop or just transporting an inmate to court."" As news of the escape broke, all 273 schools in Broward County went on lockdown, according to Nadine Drew, a spokeswoman for the school system. Lamberti said Rein's wife spoke to her husband by cell phone just 10 minutes before he was shot. ""She said you never think it's going to happen to you,"" the sheriff said. The deputy was memorialized Wednesday on the Web site of the Broward County Sheriff's Office. Visitors to the site were greeted by a photo of Rein, with a caption saying, ""Husband. Father. Friend.""",0
"Summary: Coast Guard initial assessment: Human error probably involved. It was crew's first voyage on Cosco Busan, which hit Bay Bridge in dense fog. Crew not allowed to leave ship due to federal law, says Coast Guard. Feds launch criminal probe; 58,000 gallons leaked and killed nearly 400 birds. Article: ""Human error factors"" probably were involved in a ship crash and oil spill that killed nearly 400 birds in San Francisco Bay and prompted a federal criminal probe, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday. A worker checks oil cleanup gear near the Golden Gate Bridge Thursday in San Francisco, California. The U.S. attorney in San Francisco has opened a federal criminal investigation into Wednesday's crash of the MV Cosco Busan to determine whether the captain and crew violated federal maritime laws. Although not officially detained, the captain and crew were barred by law from leaving the vessel, which is docked for repairs in Oakland, the Coast Guard said. ""You had a competently manned ship with a pilot, all the navigation and sensors,"" said Adm. Thad Allen, Coast Guard commandant. There were ""probably some human error factors, but we need to determine the facts, because there's no reason a ship like that should have collided with the bridge."" Watch Allen on the criminal probe ». The Cosco Busan was departing Oakland for South Korea when it struck a tower supporting the western suspension span of the Bay Bridge, cutting a 212-foot, 12-foot wide gash in the ship's side. About 58,000 gallons of heavy-duty bunker oil poured out of the vessel as it was moored near Treasure Island. See where oil spilled ». The oil sickened birds and formed globules on more than 20 of the area's beaches. It oozed along the San Francisco city waterfront and out of the bay, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge toward Marin County. Allen defended the Coast Guard against criticism of its response to the spill. Some lawmakers, including one of the state's U.S. senators, Democrat Barbara Boxer, have criticized the Coast Guard's handling of the collision and resulting spill. Boxer said the Coast Guard initially reported that the ship's owner had said only 140 gallons had spilled from the Cosco Busan. Boxer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have called for congressional hearings into the accident and resulting spill. Although Allen conceded some confusion in the Coast Guard's communication, he said it did not reflect their response. ""Response was set into play within an hour of the event itself,"" Allen said Monday. Regarding the initial low estimate of 140 gallons of lost oil, Allen said heavy fog and damage to the ship's tanks hindered initial aerial and on-ground evaluations of how much oil had leaked from the ship. In addition to federal prosecutors, the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the accident, and NTSB spokeswoman Debbie Hersman said Sunday that agency was interviewing the pilot, the ship's crew, and other pilots who were on the water at the time of Wednesday's crash. See photos of oil coating the bay ». The crew had been on its inaugural voyage on the ship, which the current owner purchased last month, Hersman said. The NTSB also intends to review the ship's voyage data recorder, which should have recorded captain and crew conversations on the bridge and other information in the 12 hours leading up to the bridge collision, Hersman said. The oil spill has sparked concern among local officials and environmentalists. As of Sunday, 23 beaches in the area remained closed. Angel Island State Park, the Bay's largest island, reopened Monday, the Coast Guard said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency, freeing money to clean up the spill. Seven miles of containment boom stretched across the bay has collected more than 12,271 gallons of oil so far, and another 4,000 gallons have evaporated, officials said. Nearly 400 dead birds have been recovered from the bay, while another 500 birds have been rescued alive but soaked in oil, according to Lisa Curtis, administrator of the Department of Fish and Games Office of Spill Prevention and Response. In 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground and fouled Alaska's Prince William Sound with almost 11 million gallons of crude -- the nation's worst ever oil spill. Thousands of birds and animals died in the disaster, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Often birds and animals are threatened when they come in contact with the oil and swallow it as they try to clean themselves, said the NOAA Web site. In addition to birds, oil spills can be very harmful to fish and shellfish, NOAA said. Twenty wildlife teams were scheduled Monday to be the bay, working to find sick birds so they can be rehabilitated, Curtis said. On Sunday, the state's other U.S. senator and a leading Coast Guard official decried the accident. ""This an incident which, in my view, should not have happened,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said Sunday after being briefed by Coast Guard officials. Rear Adm. Craig E. Bone, the Coast Guard's director of inspection and compliance, echoed Feinstein's comments. ""This incident should have never ever occurred,"" he said. ""There's systems, there's capabilities, there's licensed operators, there's a pilot on board the vessel, there's the capacity and the capability to safely navigate through this port and waterways every day."" He added, ""But we have to move beyond the incident and the fact that it occurred and move forward into the response."" The California Department of Transportation said the collision did no structural damage to the bridge and there was no interruption of bridge traffic -- more than 250,000 vehicles daily.",0

Mary and Joseph ride a donkey to Bethlehem in a performance of the Nativity story near Guildford, England. A British hotel chain is promising free accommodation to couples who share their first names with the couple from the Christian Nativity story. Almost 30 Josephs and Marys had already signed up for the free night's stay at the Travelodge, said Shakila Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the hotel chain. ""The 'gift' of a free night's stay is to make up for the hotel industry not having any rooms left on Christmas Eve over 2000 years ago when the original 'Mary and Joseph' had to settle for the night in a stable,"" the company says on its Web site. The offer is good at any one of the chain's 322 hotels in the United Kingdom, the Web site says. The couples must bring proof of identity and must prove that they are in a long-term relationship. ""If you satisfy the criteria, you get a free night in a family room for two adults and two children,"" Ahmed said. ""There's also parking space for a donkey if needed,"" she joked. Ahmed said the offer, which will run from Christmas Eve to Twelfth Night -- December 24 to January 5 -- had been very well-received. ""We've had a lot of interest. I think people like the fact that it resonates with the Nativity story at a time when the actual meaning of Christmas often becomes forgotten in festive overkill,"" she said.

"Summary: Journalist spent a year looking for the world's happiest countries. Eric Weiner: Bhutan is probably the closest thing on Earth to Shangri-La. He marvels at the creativity and ""coziness"" of Iceland. Self-described ""grump:"" chocolate contributes to happiness in Switzerland. Article: It may take a lot of frequent-flier miles, a penchant for cold places, a tolerance of taxes and regular doses of chocolate, but happiness could be within reach. However, it's not where most people might expect. Journalist Eric Weiner says he wanted to explore the relationship between place and happiness. Just ask Eric Weiner, who made it his mission to find the most content places around the globe, uncovering lots of surprises along the way. Hungering for a tropical paradise? A warm climate doesn't necessarily make a happy nation, Weiner said. Thinking of moving to a wealthy state? Money can degrade happiness, he found. Weiner, who wrote the book, ""The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World,"" began his quest for very personal reasons. ""I'm an unhappy person, so it's kind of what prompts a hungry person to search for food,"" he said. Weiner spent 10 years as a foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, a job that took him to some of the least happy places in the world. It was enough to send him on a yearlong journey to look for just the opposite. Weiner mapped out his quest with a combination of scientific and personal methods, choosing some countries because they traditionally score high on happiness surveys and selecting others to see how factors like money play a role. A world map of happiness, based on 100 different studies and produced by Britain's University of Leicester in 2006, listed Denmark as the world's happiest nation. But for Weiner, the place where he felt the most bliss was a toss-up between Bhutan and Iceland, countries that ranked eighth and fourth, respectively, on the happiness map. Weiner's list of favorites also included Thailand, India and Switzerland. See photos of his favorites and listen to him explain why they're happy ». His top two picks, though very different countries, have unconventional paths to happiness, he said. ""Bhutan is probably the closest thing on Earth to Shangri-La, that fictional paradise,"" Weiner explained. He pointed out that while other countries focus on their gross domestic product, the Himalayan kingdom proudly touts its policy of ""gross national happiness."" ""The Bhutanese very much believe that happiness should be part and parcel of every government decision,"" Weiner said. Cold place, warm relationships. Thousands of miles away, Weiner found happiness in a very different environment, marveling at the creativity and ""coziness"" of Iceland. ""Everyone in Iceland is a poet,"" Weiner recalled. He visited the country during winter and said he found a certain beauty in the cold and the darkness. Such a chilly climate usually encourages warm relationships, Weiner found. ""The cold inspires people to cooperate, traditionally. If you go back a few hundred years, people in cold climates have to cooperate or they die together. It's that simple,"" he said. Weiner found a different flavor of happiness in Switzerland, where he discovered people are content partly because everything runs like clockwork. Simple pleasures like trains arriving on time contributed to national happiness, he said. But there may be a much sweeter reason why Switzerland is a happy place. ""The Swiss eat a lot of chocolate, and let's not forget that,"" Weiner said. He was also impressed with how the Swiss view money. ""Their attitude is that if you've got it, hide it. While our attitude is if you've got it, flaunt it,"" Weiner said, comparing the Swiss to Americans. Weiner called the United States, which came in at No. 23 on the University of Leicester's world map of happiness, a nation that ""is not as happy as it is wealthy."" The impact of wealth and taxes. The relationship between money and happiness took Weiner to the Middle East and Qatar, a country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, thanks to oil and natural gas revenues, according to the CIA World Factbook. ""I went there specifically to examine what happens when the entire country wins the lottery,"" Weiner said. He found the wealth made the residents comfortable, but also degraded their level of contentment. ""Most of our happiness is derived from our relationships with other people,"" Weiner said. ""The money in Qatar has allowed them to wall themselves off, literally and figuratively, from other people. ... That's not a recipe for happiness."" There are no income taxes in Qatar, but that's not a cause for contentment, Weiner found. Some taxation is necessary for happiness because it's a way of being invested in a place, he argued. ""You're giving money to someone else, a government, and you're trusting them to do something good with it,"" Weiner said. ""In a country where there's no taxation at all, people don't have vested interests in how well the government performs. You can't say, 'Hey, those are my tax dollars at work.'"" Quest creates buzz. Weiner's book has struck a chord, recently rising to the top 10 of The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. An expert who studies happiness said part of the book's appeal may lie in how Weiner mapped out his journey. ""He arranges an interesting itinerary because he uses science as his compass,"" said Daniel Gilbert, a psychology professor at Harvard University and the author of ""Stumbling on Happiness."" Gilbert said it's only recently that a combination of biology, sociology and psychology has been able to answer the ""where's and why's"" of happiness, a subject that has always fascinated people. ""The quest for happiness is the central preoccupation of human beings and has been for as long as there have been human beings,"" Gilbert said. He echoed Weiner's findings that bliss is other people. ""Everyone has been telling us for the longest time that happiness is about social relationships, well, bingo, they're right,"" Gilbert said. Meanwhile, after a year of exploring some of the world's happiest places, Weiner -- the self-described ""grump"" -- said his mind-set has improved somewhat.

Woman's lawyer loses law license for speaking to Saudi-controlled media. Human rights group: Lawyer faces three-year suspension and disbarment. Article: A Saudi Arabian human rights attorney is asking the government to allow him to represent a woman who was gang-raped -- and then sentenced to prison for speaking out about the case. Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim. The attorney, Abdulrahman al-Lahim, had his license revoked last week by a judge for speaking to the Saudi-controlled media about the case, al-Lahim told CNN. The judge more than doubled the sentence against al-Lahim's 19-year-old client because she spoke to the media about the case, a court source told Arab News, an English-language Middle Eastern daily newspaper. The woman -- who was initially sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes -- had her sentenced increased to 200 lashes and was ordered to serve six months in prison under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic law. ""We were shocked,"" al-Lahim said of the increased sentence. CNN has been unable to reach Saudi government officials for comment on this report, despite repeated requests. Watch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim ». Al-Lahim had petitioned the court to sentence the attackers to the death penalty, but instead the court agreed to increase their jail sentences, which had been two to three years, to two to nine years, al-Lahim said. The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups. ""Barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself,"" said Fawzeyah al-Oyouni, founding member of the newly formed Saudi Association for the Defense of Women's Rights. ""This is not just about the girl, it's about every woman in Saudi Arabia,"" she said. ""We're fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every Saudi woman out there. We're afraid of going out in the streets."" Human Rights Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah ""to immediely void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer."" The woman, who is married, and an unrelated man were abducted and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago, the lawyer said. The male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison, al-Lahim said. The man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him, according to al-Lahim. Citing phone records from the police investigation, al-Lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client. He noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position. Al-Lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day. It is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudi's Islamic law. Al-Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month, where he faces a possible three-year suspension and disbarment, according to Human Rights Watch. He told CNN he has appealed to the Ministry of Justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with Justice Minister Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al Al-Sheikh. ""Currently she doesn't have a lawyer, and I feel they're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights,"" he said. ""We will not accept this judgment and I'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place."" He said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month. ""The Ministry of Justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because I consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz started and against Saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions,"" he said. Saudi Arabia's Islamic law or sharia is not written and, therefore, subject to a wide array of interpretations. Human Rights Watch points out that a judge in Jeddah threw out a lawyer simply because he was a member of the Ismaili faith, a branch of Shia Islam. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man, and they are not allowed to vote. The Saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom, including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases, adoption of a new labor law that addresses working women's rights and creation of a human rights commission. Christoph Wilcke of Human Rights Watch praised the female rape victim and her attorney for speaking out about the case, which he said may be indicative of ""many injustices that we still don't know about."" ""It's not only one court, it is the Saudi government that is fully behind punishing a woman who's been raped [and] punishing the lawyer who's trying to help her and doing that both because they've spoken to the media,"" Wilcke told CNN. ""And if they hadn't spoken to the media, we wouldn't know about it."" Shying away from criticism of key ally, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the case and the punishment ""surprising"" and ""astonishing."" ""While this is a judicial procedure -- part of a judicial procedure -- overseas in courts outside of our country, still while it is very difficult to offer any detailed comment about this situation, I think most people would be quite astonished by the situation, "" McCormack said. ""I can't get involved in specific court cases in Saudi Arabia dealing with its own citizens. But most people here would be quite surprised to learn of the circumstances and then the punishment meted out,"" he said. CNN's Saad Abedine and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Police confiscate computers, examine information on Web sites. Gunman may have frequented the Westroads Mall, police say. Mall shooter was ward of state for almost four years, governor says. Army recruiters turned down Robert Hawkins when he tried to enlist. Article: Investigators probing the deadly mall shooting in Omaha have seized computers and are analyzing information on Web sites in the search for clues in the case, police said Thursday. The 19-year-old gunman sent at least one text message to his former girlfriend, with whom he broke up about two weeks ago, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said. Robert Hawkins also left a voice mail for his mother before killing eight people at a department store Wednesday. He chose his victims randomly, police believe, then took his own life. Hawkins visited a friend near the Westroads Mall before the shootings and apparently went directly to the shopping center after that meeting, Warren said. Police don't yet know why Hawkins chose the mall or the Von Maur department store in particular, Warren said, adding only that the teen ""may have frequented the Westroads Mall."" See who Hawkins killed in department store ». The incident itself appeared to be premeditated, as Hawkins left a suicide note and other correspondence, Warren said. Watch officials detail the rampage ». ""Typically there are hints that something like this may take place,"" Warren said. ""Certainly you can't anticipate someone engaging in this type of shooter rampage, but if there is any justification, any explanation,"" police will find it, he said. ""Apparently he had been experiencing some mental health problems, ideations of suicide."" Debora Maruca-Kovac -- a friend of Hawkins' family who was letting him live in her home -- found the suicide note just minutes before the shootings. Watch her describe their last conversation ». ""He basically said how sorry he was for everything,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. ""He didn't want to be a burden to people and that he was a piece of s--- all of his life and that now he'd be famous."" Warren said the rifle used was an AK-47. Police haven't finished tracing the gun, but believe Hawkins stole it from his stepfather's home. Security officers flagged Hawkins as suspicious when he entered the mall. He left soon after he entered, then returned less than six minutes later with something apparently hidden in a balled-up sweatshirt. He went up an elevator to the mall's third floor, then immediately began firing, ultimately turning the firearm on himself, Warren said. ""It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,"" Warren said. Hawkins fired more than 30 rounds, the police chief said. The shootings sent panicked holiday shoppers fleeing for cover. ""It was just so loud, and then it was silence,"" said witness Jennifer Kramer, who hid inside a circular clothing rack. ""I was scared to death he'd be walking around looking for someone else."" Watch how Kramer and her mother hid ». A friend of Hawkins' said he hadn't thought Hawkins was capable of such violence. ""He was the one guy, you know, if people would be getting in a fight he'd be trying to break it up,"" said Shawn Saunders, who had known Hawkins for about 2½ years. ""If there were arguments amongst our friends or groups, he was kind of like the calm, cool and collected one."" Watch how Saunders learned Hawkins was the shooter ». Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman said Hawkins had been a ward of the state for nearly four years, but he did not specify in what capacity. The state's custody ended in August of last year, Heineman said. U.S. Army recruiters turned Hawkins down last summer when he tried to enlist, a source familiar with the situation said Thursday. The source didn't want to be named because it is against the military's rules to discuss potential recruits. The reason for his rejection was unclear. Heineman ordered that flags throughout the state be lowered to half-staff through Sunday. The dead include six store employees and two customers, ranging in age from 24 to 66. One store employee was in critical but stable condition Thursday and another had been upgraded from critical to serious, according to hospital officials. Another person was still being treated Thursday afternoon, Warren said, but he did not specify whether the individual was a customer or employee. Two other customers had been treated and released, he said. Westroads Mall remained closed Thursday, but the facility, including the Von Maur store, could reopen Friday.

"Summary: Angelina Jolie visits Iraq to boost efforts to help internally displaced refugees. Actress tells CNN: ""There doesn't seem to be real coherent plan to help them"" Jolie is goodwill ambassador for U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. More than 4.2 million Iraqis have fled homes, 2 million to neighboring states. Article: Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie is visiting Iraq to boost what she sees as lagging efforts to deal with the problems of 2 million ""very very vulnerable"" internally displaced people in the wartorn country. Angelina Jolie has been working to focus attention on problem of refugees in Iraq. ""There doesn't seem to be a real coherent plan to help them,"" said Jolie, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNN's Arwa Damon Thursday. ""There's lots of goodwill. Lots of discussion, but there seems to be a lot of talk at the moment, and a lot of pieces that need to be put together. I'm trying to figure out what they are."" A goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jolie wants to find ways to help the agency be more active inside war-torn Iraq. Watch CNN's exclusive interview with Jolie ». Sunni-Shiite sectarian violence in the country has sparked a displacement crisis that is considered the most significant in the Middle East since the 1948 creation of Israel. More than 4.2 million Iraqis have fled their homes, around 2 million to neighboring states, mostly Syria and Jordan, and another 2.2 million displaced inside Iraq. The flight was aggravated by the February 2006 bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samarra, an attack that stoked pitched sectarian warfare. Many of the internally displaced live precarious lives amid conditions of squalor, crowded into camps and slums that often lack basic necessities, such as proper food, health care and shelter. ""How Iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire Middle East,"" said Jolie. ""It's in our best interest to address a humanitarian crisis on this scale because displacement can lead to a lot of instability and aggression."" Read transcript of interview. Jolie has been working to help draw attention to the problem and has called for governments to bolster their support of the U.N.H.C.R. In August, Jolie first visited Iraq and Syria to get a sense of the problem. She heard stories from refugees about their plight. Watch as Jolie lunches with troops ». This visit to Iraq is focusing on the problems of the internally displaced, 58 percent of whom are under age 12. A top issue for the agency is getting better security. Jolie is talking with U.S. officials, including top U.S. Gen. David Petraeus, about that issue, and are willing to provide such security which she said ""needs to be addressed and solved."" The Iraqi government needs to empower agencies that deal with migration to address the concerns of the displaced -- but that has not happened yet, she said. Jolie said it was crucial that the government prepare a plan to deal with refugees who return home from Syria and Jordan and find that their homes are ""occupied"" by others or ""bombed out."" She emphasizes the way in which these people are resettled will have ""broad implications"" in the region. Jolie also is talking to people about moving forward the U.S. effort to resettle Iraqi refugees in the United States, which has set a goal of taking in 12,000 of those people by September. Only 375 have been admitted so far. ""I have to believe there are people working toward that goal,"" she said. International agencies, such as the United Nations and the Arab League, and many countries in the region and in Europe are addressing the refugee and the internally displaced persons' crisis, and money is being allocated to Iraq and host countries to help clothe, feed and house people. Most of the refugees are in Syria and Jordan, and they reside in big cities like Damascus and Amman. The U.N.C.H.R. is trying to help governments in Syria and Jordan to cope with the influx, which has stretched the resources of institutions like schools and health systems. It is also attempting to help 41,000 non-Iraqi refugees in Iraq, such as Palestinians and Iranians. Last month, the UNHCR announced a plan to seek $261 million this year for its work to help these refugees. It has almost 350 staffers ""directly engaged in operations for Iraq and the surrounding region."" Officials in Iraq and the coalition have been heartened by the fact that some refugees are starting to trickle back home. But they are returning to a country where mixed Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods have turned into Sunni or Shiite enclaves and that they might not be able to return to their homes.",0
"Summary: Udinese stay fifth in Italy's Serie A after suffering a 3-1 defeat away to Napoli. Ezequiel Lavezzi scored twice in two second-half minutes to end goal drought. Both teams were reduced to 10 men, with one player sent off in each half. Fabrizio Miccoli scores only goal to give Palermo a 1-0 victory over Livorno. Article: Udinese remained in fifth place in Italy's Serie A after suffering a 3-1 defeat away to Napoli on Saturday, with both teams having a player sent off. Ezequiel Lavezzi inspired Napoli to victory against Udinese, netting twice and setting up the first goal. Ezequiel Lavezzi scored twice in two minutes to end a goal drought lasting two and a half months, netting on 74 and 75 as Napoli moved up to ninth in the table. The Argentine also provided the cross that Udinese defender Cristian Zapata put into his own net to leave the visitors playing catch-up from just the third minute. Pepe leveled the score on nine minutes, and then Napoli played with 10 men from the 36th minute after Paolo Cannavaro was expelled for a last-man foul. But the teams were even in numbers again after Pepe was ejected for a second yellow card on 60 minutes. Udinese are still four points behind fourth-placed Fiorentina and the last Champions League berth. Fiorentina hosts AC Milan, which has 30 points, on Sunday. In Saturday's other match, Fabrizio Miccoli scored the only goal to give Palermo a 1-0 victory over Livorno. Miccoli struck in the 76th minute with a shot from just outside the area with Livorno goalkeeper Marco Amelia partially unsighted by several players. Palermo keeper Alberto Fontana saved a penalty by Francesco Tavano at the end of the first half, and had to make several vital stops in the first opening period. Palermo had lost their last three Serie A matches and dropped down the table, but the win put them one point above Napoli in eighth. In Sunday's other matches, leaders Inter Milan host second-bottom Empoli and second-placed Roma travel to third-bottom Siena. Genoa are at home to Catania, third-placed Juventus host bottom club Cagliari, Sampdoria travel to Lazio, Parma play Atalanta and Reggina face fellow strugglers Torino.",0
"Summary: New trial at Heathrow airport will use RFID to accurately track and monitor luggage. Compared to exsiting bar codes, RFID tags offer 15 percent more reading accuracy. A proposed service will send SMS to passengers informing when bags arrive. Article: A six-month trial was launched this week that promises to transform the way luggage is tracked and monitored at London's Heathrow airport. As many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage. The trial -- run by BAA and airline Emirates -- is using RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology to tag baggage. This will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport. The crucial difference between RFID and the existing barcode system is its scanning accuracy. Barcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned. If not scanned, details must be entered manually into the system, adding time and error to the process. BAA estimates that Heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through. RFID is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy. The £150,000 trial -- the first of its kind in the UK -- will continue for six months tracking bags for passengers traveling with Emirates to and from Dubai, and transferring through Heathrow. A duplicate of the Heathrow system has been installed at Dubai Airport. During the check-in process at Heathrow Terminal 3, staff apply tags containing RFID chips to bags with information including the passenger's name and route. The chips are then read on entry into the baggage system; they are tracked as they move throughout; and finally on leaving the system. As a result, says Shaun Cowlam, Logistics Director at Heathrow Airport, staff can know where a bag is at ""every moment of every day"". BAA is also considering introducing a SMS text messaging service to keep passengers informed of where their bags are. When passengers arrive at Heathrow, says Cowlam, the idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at. Ultimately, the use of RFID could extend services to frequent flyers, and provide the means to added value services such as faster check-in, and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery. The main benefits, however, will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as Heathrow and Dubai, as this system offers better processing of baggage on transfer flights. Emirates and BAA are sharing the costs of the trial. But as Vic Sheppard, Emirates Vice President for UK and Ireland says, ""cost is not an issue"", especially considering the savings the airline is expected to achieve by reducing loss and repatriation of bags. And as Cowlam adds: ""if we can introduce this across the whole network the costs will reduce significantly."" Hong Kong International Airport was one of the first to deploy RFID technology in 2005. But as outlined in a recent survey by SITA, RFID is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed. ""For this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology,"" says Cowlam. That widespread adoption may not be far off. The SITA survey indicated that RFID tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009. It's still early days, but BAA and Emirates are optimistic for RFID's future in airports. ""There have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years. But in the last few decades there hasn't been any advancement in the methods adopted for baggage handling,"" says Sheppard. ""This is a major step forward.""",0
"Summary: Telegram: King Hussein wanted U.S. strike on invading Syrian troops in 1970. Nixon White House urged Saudis to distance from PLO's Fatah organization. Papers also discuss Israeli acquisition of nuclear weapon. Documents among 10,000 papers released Wednesday by Nixon Library. Article: Jordan's King Hussein sent a secret message to President Richard Nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack Syria, according to declassified documents released Wednesday by the former president's library. President Nixon works at his desk in the Oval Office in a June 1972 photograph. The papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the Nixon Presidential Library, some of which offer harbingers of present-day events, such as concerns about terrorism and Saudi Arabia. Library director Timothy Naftali said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the Saudis more involved in solving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, how to get them more engaged against terrorism, how to address the Arab view that the United States always sides with Israel and how to build up moderate Palestinians to counter extremists. A 1973 diplomatic cable cites this objective: ""isolate and undermine terrorisms [sic] and commandos [sic] by establishing another, more stable and respectable Palestinian political entity and political personality."" Documents detail U.S. efforts to persuade Saudi Arabia to move away from Fatah, the military wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization, because U.S. officials believed the PLO was supporting the terrorist-linked, anti-Israel group Black September, referred to as BSO. The document, a U.S. State Department telegram from the embassy in Jeddah to Washington reads, ""BSO and Fatah [are] now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and uncertainty. One might wonder whether central objective BSO conspiracy was not to erase any slight progress toward Middle East peace."" The document release was intended to coincide with Mideast peace summit among Palestinian, Israeli and other Mideast leaders in Maryland, Naftali said. The Nixon White House also was adjusting to Israel's acquisition of a nuclear weapon. ""We are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for Richard Nixon's decision in 1969 to accept the fact, a fact of life, that Israel had a bomb, a nuclear device,"" said Naftali. ""That, of course, is very important with what's going on in Annapolis."" ""Even though it is clear from the documents that the United States government did not encourage Israel to acquire a nuclear deterrent, it became a fact of life,"" Naftali said. ""There are materials here that show how our government, 30 years ago, dealt with this very, very difficult problem."" Rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power, Israel still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability. In 1970, as King Hussein dealt with threats by both Palestinian refugees in his country and Syrian military forces crossing Jordan's border, the king asked ""the United States and Great Britain to intervene in the war in Jordan, asking the United States, in fact, to attack Syria,"" Naftali said. ""Syria had invaded Jordan and the Jordanian king, facing what he felt was a military rout, said please help us in any way possible."" The telegram indicates that Hussein himself called a U.S. official at 3 a.m. to ask for American or British help. ""Situation deteriorating dangerously following Syrian massive invasion...,"" the document said. ""I request immediate physical intervention both land and air ... to safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Jordan. Immediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative."" The library has withheld the Nixon documents from public access until Wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified, Naftali said. Nixon served as president from January 20, 1969, to August 9, 1974, when he resigned under political pressure during the Watergate scandal -- the only U.S. president to do so. He died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81.",0
"Summary: Orange jailed in Alabama in 1965 for getting students to help voting rights drives. In march to support him, a man was killed, leading to 'Bloody Sunday,' famed march. After successful Selma-to-Montgomery march, Voting Rights Act signed into law. Article: The Rev. James Orange, a civil rights activist whose 1965 jailing sparked a fatal protest that ultimately led to the famed Selma-to-Montgomery march and the Voting Rights Act, died Saturday at Atlanta's Crawford Long Hospital, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference said in a statement. He was 65. Orange was a native of Birmingham, Alabama, ""who resided in southwest Atlanta for four decades while fighting the good fight for equality and social justice for all mankind,"" said the SCLC, a civil rights organization. Orange was arrested and jailed in Perry County, Alabama, in 1965 on charges of disorderly conduct and contributing to the delinquency of minors for enlisting students to aid in voting rights drives. As rumors spread that Orange would be lynched, civil rights activists organized a march to support him. However, the marchers clashed with Alabama state troopers during the February 18 demonstration, and a young black man, Jimmie Lee Jackson, was shot in the stomach. ""I could hear the singing and the commotion,"" Orange told CNN last year. ""Once the tear gas was flying and the shots started, I couldn't tell what was going on."" Jackson, 26, died eight days later. Witnesses said Jackson's grandfather, who was active in the voting rights movement, had been beaten by troopers, and Jackson was trying to get him to the hospital. The anger resulting from Jackson's death led civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., to organize the Selma-to-Montgomery, Alabama, voting rights march. The first attempt at that march was broken up by club-wielding state troopers and sheriff's deputies, a melee that became known as ""Bloody Sunday."" ""Jimmie's death is the reason that Bloody Sunday took place,"" Orange said. ""Had he not died, there would never have been a Bloody Sunday."" On the marchers' third attempt, in March, they made it to Montgomery. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law in August 1965. In May 2007, a former Alabama state trooper, James B. Fowler, now 74, was indicted in Jackson's shooting, one of several cases involving the deaths of civil rights activists that prosecutors have revived in recent years. Fowler has claimed he shot Jackson in self-defense, but Orange and Elijah Rollins, who was upstairs at a nearby cafe when the shooting took place, last year disputed claims that protesters were throwing rocks and bottles at police. ""Not one bottle or brick was thrown back at the troopers,"" said Orange, adding that film and a Justice Department report back that up. He said he was glad Jackson's case had ""never been forgotten."" Orange was a project coordinator at the SCLC from 1965 to 1970, then later became a regional coordinator with the AFL-CIO in Atlanta, the SCLC said. Since 1995, he had served as the founder and general coordinator for the M.L. King Jr. March Committee-Africa/African American Renaissance Committee, Inc., which coordinated commemorative events honoring King and also promoted industry and commerce among Atlanta, the United States and South Africa. Orange is survived by his wife, five children and two grandchildren, the SCLC said. Funeral arrangements were incomplete Saturday.",0
"Summary: Former Lebanese President Amin Gemayel loses by a few hundred votes. Candidates will replace legislator Pierre Gemayel and lawmaker Walid Eido. Both were allies of U.S.-backed Lebanese government and opponents of Syria. Article: Supporters and opponents of Lebanon's pro-Western government appeared to split seats on Sunday as Lebanese voters went to the polls to replace two ruling-party lawmakers assassinated in recent months. Lebanese women wait in line to cast their votes in Beirut. Voters in Beirut sent pro-government candidate Mohammed al-Amin Itani to parliament to replace Walid Eido, who was killed in a June bombing. Both Eido, a Sunni Muslim, and Itani are members of the bloc led by Saad Hariri -- the son of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, whose 2005 killing triggered Lebanon's current wave of political upheaval. But in Metn, a Maronite Christian suburb east of the capital, anti-government candidate Camille Khouri upset former President Amin Gemayel by a few hundred votes, Lebanese television network LBC reported. Khouri is a member of the Free Patriotic Movement, the anti-government party led by former Lebanese Army Gen. Michel Aoun. Aoun has said he will run for president of Lebanon -- and since the post is chosen by members of parliament, Sunday's results were closely watched. Gemayel was seeking the seat held by his son Pierre, who served as industry minister in the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora before being gunned down in his car in November 2006. He served as president from 1982 to 1988, during the civil war in Lebanon. His brother, Bashir Gemayel, was elected president in 1982 but was assassinated before he could take office. Eido and Gemayel were among several Lebanese political figures killed since the February 2005 killing of the elder Hariri. All were critical of Syria's influence in Lebanon, and their supporters blamed Damascus for their deaths -- allegations the Syrians and their allies in Lebanon denied. Hariri's killing triggered a wave of protests against Syria known as the ""Cedar Revolution,"" which brought Siniora's government to power and forced Syria to withdraw the garrison it kept in Lebanon for three decades.

"Summary: Justice Department must decide whether to pursue investigation. Former agent John Kiriakou talked about interrogation technique on TV. Kiriakou attorney says probe could cause CIA more problems. Administration summoned for court hearing on destroyed tapes. Article: The CIA asked the Justice Department to investigate whether former operative John Kiriakou illegally disclosed classified information when he talked about the waterboarding of a terrorism suspect, government officials say. Ex-CIA agent John Kiriakou says he underwent waterboarding in training and cracked in a few seconds. Kiriakou spoke last week with several news organizations, including CNN, after the CIA disclosed that videotapes of certain interrogations were destroyed in 2005. That revelation has prompted new calls for investigations on Capitol Hill. The Bush administration appeared in U.S. District Court on Friday to answer a judge's questions about the tapes' destruction. Speaking to CNN last week, Kiriakou said that U.S. interrogators drew valuable information from al Qaeda captive Abu Zubayda by ""waterboarding"" him. But Kiriakou said the procedure amounts to torture and should be stopped. Waterboarding involves pouring a stream of water onto the cellophane-covered face of a suspect to induce the sensation of drowning, Kiriakou said. Watch how a suspect is waterboarded ». Kiriakou told CNN he was unaware that CIA interrogations were being taped, but that the tapes should have been kept ""as a matter of historical record."" Kiriakou's attorney Mark Zaid told CNN that the referral of the case to the Justice Department is standard procedure. ""A criminal referral from the CIA would be both expected and normal under the circumstances,"" Zaid said in a written statement. ""It is a routine act that the CIA undertakes even when they know no violation has occurred."" Zaid added that the question is whether the Justice Department will proceed, and that such a decision ""must be measured carefully."" ""Doing so will unlock a Pandora's box that will place a spotlight on the information in question as to the lawfulness of the alleged conduct and the activities of those involved."" he said. ""There would also exist a challenge regarding whether Mr. Kiriakou was being targeted for exercising his First Amendment rights."" CIA officers who leave the agency are required to sign documents promising never to divulge classified information. Written comments are cleared by an agency review board before publication, and unscripted oral comments -- such as television interviews -- are referred to the Justice Department after the fact. About one case a week is referred to the Justice Department, and an investigation could take months to complete, a source in the intelligence community said. For private citizens found to be in violation of the secrecy standard, penalties can range from loss of security clearances to criminal prosecution leading to jail time. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said the department has no comment on the Kiriakou matter, and routinely refuses comment on whether another agency has referred a case. Kiriakou said he was not present when other agents used the waterboarding technique on Abu Zubayda, but that he was told the al Qaeda suspect lasted 30 or 35 seconds. Kiriakou said he himself was subjected to the treatment during his training, and lasted about five seconds before having to stop. CNN's Kelli Arena contributed to this report.",0

Thanks to super-sized expectations and over-the-top commercialization, February 14 has gone from a sentimental aside to a pressure-filled gauntlet lined with chocolate boxes, tennis bracelets and cheesy stuffed bears. See where the love dollars go ». ""The holiday's designed to make you feel (bad),"" says Judy McGuire, author of ""How Not to Date."" ""If you're in a relationship, it's never anything that it's supposed to be. And if you're single, you feel like a big loser because you don't have anybody. I think people should lower Valentine's Day expectations to pretty much nil. That way, anything that happens is good."" Brian Wise, a 32-year-old technical writer from Seattle has seen his Valentine's Day go sideways repeatedly -- most memorably the time he ended up in handcuffs (and not in a good way). ""Last year, I was in Singapore and I met this beautiful woman who took me to dinner at this hot, new restaurant,'"" he says. ""But then she gets food poisoning and ends up in an alley with major gastrointestinal problems. And while I'm standing guard, the cops pull up and think I'm paying her for sex."" Wise talked his way out of an arrest (luckily, one of the policemen had eaten at the same place) but he's found no release from his unlucky Valentine's. ""It doesn't matter who I'm out with,"" he says. ""The day is just cursed."" There are ways, though, to avoid a miserable holiday. Good plans. Most women will admit they like to celebrate, but a fancy night on the town isn't necessary. ""Sometimes, hanging out at home can be a lot more fun than going out to some restaurant filled with couples,"" says author McGuire. ""Stay home with champagne, caviar and maybe a new toy from a tasteful sex shop."" If you're not dating anyone, take some time to indulge yourself (a luxurious bar of chocolate, a pedicure), do something relaxing (take a yoga class or get a massage) or spend time with some of your closest friends. Make sure you're on the same page. And if you do make plans, stick to them. Galen, a 28-year-old secretary from Seattle, and her boyfriend had made special Valentine's Day plans a month in advance. But on the big night, his buddies showed up and talked him into going out with them instead. ""I was dressed to the nines,"" says Galen, who asked that her last name not be used. ""When his friends stopped by, he says, 'Do you mind if I go with them?' I said, 'Fine, go,' being totally sarcastic, and he picked up his coat and left."" Although they talked about it later, Galen said, her boyfriend seemed not to understand that she was unhappy with his wanting to ditch her for his buddies. The two later broke up. Breaking a date on Valentine's Day is definitely bad form, but automatically expecting one to happen (a much more common scenario) is also problematic. To avoid a disconnect with your significant other, McGuire suggests being honest. Simply expecting your partner to know what you want is unrealistic. Not-so-good gifts. If you decide to go the gift route, McGuire recommends not settling for a cliché like a stuffed animal or a hastily purchased bouquet of flowers. ""Listen to what the person talks about,"" she says. ""She may want the new 'Godzilla' game for her Wii. His underwear may be riddled with holes."" Another thing to avoid, advises Katie Briggs, 44, of Seattle, is the gag gift. A few years ago, Briggs and a new beau went out to a nice restaurant where they shared dinner, drinks and presents. Briggs gave her date homemade cookies and a Starbucks gift card. He gave her a beautifully-wrapped box -- of Spam. ""He thought it was the best joke ever,"" says Briggs. ""But it just wasn't thoughtful. If you're going to go with a joke, you need to back it up with something else."" LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

"Summary: Majid Khan's attorneys say he endured an ""aggressive"" interrogation program. Khan's allegations of torture redacted in court documents. Bush administration: Khan worked for 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. CIA: The United States does not conduct or condone torture. Article: Attorneys for a ""high-value"" terror suspect who says he was tortured while being held at secret CIA prisons have requested that a judge bar the agency from destroying evidence of the alleged torture. One of 14 ""high-value"" detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, alleges he was tortured. The motion, filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights attorneys on behalf of Majid Khan -- who is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- is dated November 29. That is a week before CIA Director Michael Hayden acknowledged the agency destroyed videotapes it made in 2002 of interrogations of al Qaeda suspects using newly approved ""alternative"" interrogation techniques. Khan -- a native of Pakistan who attended high school in Baltimore -- was held for more than three years at the secret CIA prisons and ""subjected to an aggressive CIA detention and interrogation program notable for its elaborate planning and ruthless application of torture,"" attorney Gitanjali S. Gutierrez claims in the court documents. Details of Khan's torture claims are redacted in the filing -- a whole page is blacked out -- but Khan's attorneys say he suffers ""severe physical and psychological trauma from which he is unlikely ever to recover fully"" as a result of his ordeal. Asked about Khan's claims, CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told CNN, ""CIA's terrorist interrogation effort has always been small, carefully run, lawful and highly productive. Fewer than 100 hardened terrorists have gone through the program since it began in 2002, and of those, less than a third required any special methods of questioning. The United States does not conduct or condone torture."" Khan's attorneys claim he was taken into custody in 2003 and ""forcibly disappeared"" before his transfer to Guantanamo, ""where he remains imprisoned without charge or trial."" He filed a legal challenge to his detention in September 2006 and appeared before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal in April, the court documents said. He was found to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant, but filed a challenge to that on August 14. He was not allowed to meet with an attorney, however, until October, the document said. The Bush administration contends Khan was an operative working for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Khan researched how to blow up gas stations and poison reservoirs in the United States, the administration has said. He is among 14 ""high-value"" detainees held at Guantanamo. Gutierrez and another CCR attorney, Wells Dixon, also released declassified notes of their meetings with Khan, saying he has been on hunger strikes while in Guantanamo, is ""painfully thin and pale"" and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. In detention, he has been able to communicate with Abu Zubayda, an alleged lieutenant for Osama bin Laden, they said in the notes. A government official with knowledge of the destroyed CIA tapes has said that Zubayda was one of the two al Qaeda suspects whose interrogations were videotaped. While undergoing interrogation and torture by the CIA, ""Khan admitted anything his interrogators demanded of him, regardless of the truth, in order to end his suffering,"" the documents said. Without a court order requiring the preservation of evidence, ""there is substantial risk that the torture evidence will disappear"" and that may affect the challenge to his detention, the attorneys claim. The motion was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Hayden has said the CIA stopped videotaping in 2002, while Khan was not taken into custody until the following year. ""The careful, professional and lawful questioning of hardened terrorists has produced thousands of intelligence reports, revealed exceptionally valuable insights on al Qaeda's operations and organization, foiled terrorist plots and saved innocent lives,"" Gimigliano said. ""The information developed by the detention and interrogation program has been irreplaceable, and the program has operated in strict accord with American law.""

"Summary: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wanted to visit ground zero. New York City officials said no because site is under construction. The United States considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism. Leaders call request ""audacious,"" ""unacceptable"" Article: City officials in New York have denied Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's request to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center next week, a police spokesman said Wednesday. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero, but New York city officials said no. The controversial, outspoken president wanted to ""pay his respects"" and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks during his visit to the U.N. General Assembly, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said, citing Iranian officials. But workers are rebuilding the foundations of the site, ""and it would not be possible for him to go where other people don't go,"" Kelly told CNN. Iranian officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at ground zero, police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN. But, he said, ""If there were a further request, we'd reject it"" because of security fears. Watch why New York said no to Iranian leader ». The Iranian mission to the U.N. said it had not been told of the decision, but in a statement issued Wednesday evening, it called the rejection ""unfortunate."" Iran is ruled by a Shiite Muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist Sunni al Qaeda. Ahmadinejad's predecessor at the time of the September 11 attacks, Mohammed Khatami, condemned them, and Tehran cooperated with the U.S.-led campaign to topple al Qaeda's Taliban allies in Afghanistan that followed. The United States and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days. The United States considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism and has accused the country of meddling in Iraq and in Afghanistan where U.S. troops are battling Taliban and al Qaeda remnants more than six years after the September 11, 2001, attacks. More than 2,700 people died in the attack on the World Trade Center, when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers. A third jet hit the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers. ""It is appalling that President Ahmadinejad, one of the world's leading sponsors of terror, would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground,"" State Department spokesman Tom Casey said. Several presidential candidates also condemned the requested visit. Hillary Clinton, the New York senator and Democratic front-runner, called the request ""unacceptable."" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a leading Republican, called it ""shockingly audacious."" And former Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- whose leadership after the attacks is the cornerstone of his GOP presidential bid -- said that ""under no circumstances"" should Ahmadinejad be allowed to visit the World Trade Center site. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the site should not be ""used as a photo op."" Numerous critics have attacked Ahmadinejad's hard-line anti-Israel stance and his insistence that Iran will defy U.N. demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium. Iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants, but Washington accuses Tehran of trying to produce a nuclear bomb.

"Summary: Judge: Lisa Nowak's statements and items in her car were unlawfully obtained. Nowak's attorneys have said her comments were made under duress. Former astronaut is accused of stalking and assaulting a romantic rival. Nowak has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted kidnapping. Article: A Florida judge Friday handed a legal victory to a former astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival, ruling evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial. Lisa Nowak, accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival, is set to go on trial in April. Ninth Judicial Circuit Judge Marc Lubet ruled that all were unlawfully obtained. He said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors, most concerning police tactics in their interview of Lisa Nowak and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car. ""In each and every case, this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored,"" Lubet wrote in his opinion. ""Unfortunately, in this case those protections were not as thoroughly followed as the law demands."" Nowak, 44, is accused of stalking Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman and using pepper spray against her in a parking lot at Orlando International Airport in Florida on February 5. She pleaded not guilty March 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon. Her trial is set for April. If convicted, she would face a sentence of up to life in prison. Her defense attorneys had claimed Nowak's comments to police and her consent to search her car were made under duress. During a hearing held in August, Lubet heard testimony from, among others, Nowak, Shipman and Orlando police detective William Becton, who interviewed Nowak after her arrest. Lubet said in his ruling that when Nowak asked Becton if she needed an attorney during the interview, he failed to answer her question in a ""simple and straightforward manner."" ""There was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the Miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights as 'formalities' "" during the interview, Lubet wrote. On the audiotape of the interview, there was no audible response from Nowak on whether she understood that her statements could be used against her in court, and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police, Lubet wrote. ""Thus, there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them."" Nowak testified at the August hearing she did not respond to Becton's questions because she was confused, Lubet wrote. In addition, he said, Becton used ""legally impermissible"" statements and techniques, including threats, to get Nowak's statements and consent. ""Well, what you say can change what you're charged with,"" Becton said at one point. ""Right now we're looking at [a] possible life felony of carjacking."" In a written statement, an Orlando Police Department spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court, and referred questions to prosecutors. Lubet noted that, although Nowak was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat, she was ""subjected to a barrage of questions"" beginning in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportunity to sleep or make a phone call. ""Defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours,"" the judge said. Nowak's consent to search her car, Lubet wrote, ""followed illegal police activity, such as a prolonged detention, threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent."" Prosecutors accuse Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from Houston to Orlando -- wearing NASA diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following Shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot. Her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers. Shipman told police that after she got into her car, Nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window. When Shipman cracked it to talk to her, Nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray, Shipman said. Police said Nowak was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin. Nowak has said she merely went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begun dating Nowak's former love interest, Navy Cmdr. Bill Oefelein, who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps. At the August hearing, Becton testified that when he searched Nowak's car, he found maps showing how to reach the airport, maps of the airport's layout, a buck knife and papers including a letter Nowak appeared to have written to Oefelein's mother. He also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car. Police previously said they also found a BB gun, a steel mallet, a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle. Nowak's attorneys in August filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense, saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders. On August 30, Lubet granted Nowak's attorneys' request that her electronic tracking ankle bracelet be removed. CNN's Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Sharon Long is forensic artist who creates faces from skulls. Fort Myers, Florida, police called her after they found eight sets of remains. Only two of the eight remains have been identified. Article: Sharon Long's work has earned her the nickname ""Skull Lady."" Sharon Long is a forensic artist whose job is to help identify the dead, often murder victims. She is a forensic artist whose job is to give faces -- and sometimes identities -- back to anonymous murder victims who have been robbed of both. Armed with sculptor's clay, glass eyes, wigs and research, Long creates a face from a human skull. When Fort Myers, Florida, police found eight sets of human remains in the woods in March, they turned to her -- anything to help identify the people who were so mercilessly left to rot amid the trees and mud. ""[Police] have no other way. They have no fingerprints; they have no flesh. Usually, the last resort is building a face,"" Long said. See the ""skull lady"" at work ». She hopes that when the faces of those killed get printed in newspapers or appear on TV or online, a friend or loved one recognizes them and says, ""Gee, we haven't seen so-and-so for a while, and that kind of looks like him."" ""Then, at least, you have a lead, and then you can get DNA from people. And then [police] have something to go on."" Long, 67, has made faces for the unknown victims of grisly homicides and solved historical mysteries. During her 20-year career, the forensics specialist from the University of Wyoming helped identify the crew of the H.L Hunley, a Confederate submarine sunk during the Civil War. She also created the first picture of the only explorer to have died on the Lewis and Clark expedition. When law enforcement asks for Long's assistance, it is almost always on a case that has gone very cold. And that was exactly the case in Fort Myers, where police were desperate for any information on the dead they found: eight men killed, their bodies discovered in a wooded area on March 23, 2007. Watch how bones can give clues to investigators ». There were no witnesses, no leads and little evidence of killings other than the victims' bones. If Long could identify the victims of the crime, it might help to catch a serial killer. But before Long could create any likeness of the victims, she would have to do a lot of work -- hundreds of hours of it. Long first creates a mold of the skull and uses it to make a plaster replica. She puts eraser tips on points to mark tissue depth. Sculptor's clay fills in for skin and muscle. The faded gumline on the skull's teeth helps Long determine how thick the person's lips were. The victim's hair and eye color requires guesswork and research, Long says. Often while working on cases, she talks to people who lived in the same area as the victim or victims to find out the most common eye color and what hairstyles are in fashion. See how to decode a face ». She spent two months on the Fort Myers skulls. ""I start working, and 15 hours can go by, and I don't get up and move, and you don't realize how much time has gone by, and, well, that's how intense I get,"" she said. ""It's like you get carried away in this life of somebody. I start trying to think of them as being an alive person and doing something and not getting killed."" Eventually, publicity about the Fort Myers case would lead people with missing relatives to submit their DNA. Testing revealed that two of the men were Erik Kohler and John Blevins. Both men lived hardscrabble lives and had run-ins with police. Both disappeared in 1995. At a news conference last month where Fort Myers police unveiled Long's sculptures, investigators said they still need to identify the other six victims if they are to solve the case. Kohler and Blevins didn't closely mirror Long's sculptures of their faces, but there were some similarities, some facial features that looked liked the two dead men. And that's what police say they want: They hope people with missing relatives will look at every detail of the other six sculptures to see whether they notice any resemblance, no matter how faint. ""Going into this, I knew there would be some level of subjectivity in the art part of it, but I think what it does is generate the interest,"" Fort Myers Police Detective Barry Lewis said. ""I am just looking for that one little similarity, that one little key that someone could recognize that they could make a call that that is their loved one."" Since the news conference, police say, they have received hundreds of leads. Long's work on the case might be done, but she still has nightmares about the eight men killed. ""I hear screaming, and I hear pleading, and I hear all these things which I couldn't imagine,"" she said. ""I can see somebody dragging a body out there, and here he kept taking them to the same area. I think, what in the hell is wrong with this guy?"" Six of those killed remain nameless. And police are still trying to find the killer. Authorities urge anyone with more information on the case to call 877-667-1296.",0
"Summary: Four-week-old polar bear separated from mother amid fears she would eat it. Nuremberg City Zoo's other polar bear ate its own two offspring earlier this week. Mother was showing signs of being upset and confused, zookeepers said. Article: German zookeepers in Nuremberg will bottle-feed a four-week-old polar bear and rear it away from its mother after concerns the mother would eat her cub, officials said Thursday. Zookeepers fear the unnamed polar bear cub could be at risk of being eaten. The cub, which doesn't yet have a name, was being cared for at Nuremberg City Zoo, where it was resting under heat lamps and is drinking formula. ""It's gaining weight, it's very hungry, it drinks a lot of milk,"" said Alexandra Foghammar, a spokeswoman for the city. The zoo announced Thursday that the cub is female. Wednesday, the zoo said keepers decided to take the cub away from its mother, Vera, because the mother was showing signs of being upset and confused, taking her baby in and out of the animals' enclosure. ""We were 100 percent sure that the baby was going to die if we didn't take it away from her,"" Nuremberg zoo director Dag Encke told Time magazine. ""This would have been a death verdict for the cub."" The zoo confirmed earlier this week that its other female polar bear, Vilma, had eaten her two offspring. The zoo said it feared Vera would do the same, so it took her cub away as a precaution. Since then, the cub is thriving in the care of humans, but Vera seems to miss her cub, Foghammar said. Watch how zoo has faced criticism over polar bears. ». ""The mother is a little bit nervous,"" she said. ""She walks around and is searching for the baby, but the responsible persons for the zoo say this is normal. It will continue for three or four days. It's a normal situation."" The zookeepers are pondering whether to bring another adult bear, possibly the cub's father, Felix, to the zoo to help Vera overcome her loss, and are seeking another small bear to serve as a companion for the rescued cub, Time reported. The zoo said a keeper entered Vilma's enclosure Monday and noticed that her two cubs were nowhere to be found. The zoo said it assumes Vilma ate her young because she believed the cubs were sick, though zookeepers say the cubs were last seen on Sunday and appeared in good health. But Foghammar told Time that the separation of the bears was bad for the ""principle of wildlife conservation"" at the zoo: ""Now the cub will not grow up to act in a natural way, just as the mother lacked the experience to bring up a cub."" The plight of the cub follows the case last year of Knut, a cub rejected by its mother at Berlin Zoo who became the focus of a media frenzy after animal rights campaigners called for it to be killed, claiming it had become too dependent on humans.",0
"Summary: Parents of church shooter meet with victims' family. They ""met and hugged and cried,"" pastor says. Matthew Murray, 24, killed four people in two shootings, before killing himself. His parents also thanked guard who shot their son. Article: Pastor Brady Boyd calls it the ""highlight of my ministry"" -- seeing the parents of the man who shot up his church be embraced by the parents of two teenage sisters who were killed in the attack. A former roommate took this photo of Matthew Murray performing in a 2002 Christmas program. ""The four of them met and hugged and cried,"" said Boyd, the senior pastor at New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. ""It made me evaluate my own life and think, 'Is there anyone I'm not forgiving?'"" Boyd was referring to a meeting on January 3 between Ron and Loretta Murray, whose 24-year-old son Matthew carried out the December 9 attack at New Life Church, and David and Marie Works, whose daughters, Stephanie, 18, and Rachael, 16, were killed in the rampage. David Works also was wounded in the shootings. Learn more about the victims ». The pastor said he invited the Murrays to visit the New Life campus after praying over the holidays. The family immediately accepted his invitation and was given a guided ""step-by-step"" tour of where the rampage took place and shown where their son died. ""It was extremely emotional. They wanted to hear the details. I kept telling them I would stop with details, but they wanted to hear them,"" he told CNN in a phone interview this week. At one point, the parents also met with security guard Jeanne Assam, who shot their son in the leg before he turned his gun on himself. The parents thanked Assam for her swift action and for helping save more lives, said Casey Nikoloric, a Murray family spokeswoman and long-time friend. ""They told Assam that they were so deeply sorry she had to do what she did,"" said Nikoloric. ""There were tears, lots of embraces, prayers."" The visit, she said, was ""very, very, very important"" in the healing process for the Murrays as they deal with the loss of their son and the terror he inflicted. Boyd agreed. ""I thought this would be best for the Murrays,"" he said, adding that it touched everyone involved. ""I've never seen repentance and forgiveness as profound as I did that day."" The Murrays toured the church with their other son, Christopher, 20, a student at Oral Roberts University. The Murrays met the Works in Boyd's office. He said he also asked the Murrays to share ""some of the good memories"" of Matthew as a boy. ""It put it in context: This kid was raised in an upper middle-class home and had every chance to do well,"" Boyd said. ""You wonder what went wrong for Matthew. They described Matthew as any parent would describe their son."" The pastor said he didn't tell many people about the meeting before it happened, fearing it ""could have gotten volatile and hostile."" ""It was risky, but I knew enough about the Murrays to know they were mature and good people,"" he said. On Sunday, he began his sermon by telling his congregation about what had transpired just a few days earlier. He was met with loud applause. Matthew Murray began his assault that day at the Youth With a Mission center in Arvada, Colorado, killing two people -- Tiffany Johnson, 26, and Philip Crouse, 24 -- and wounding two others before he went to the New Life Church, about 80 miles away. The Murrays visited the mission center December 12 and met with the families of the slain victims, according to Nikoloric. ""The depth of our sorrow and our grief is greater than we could possibly describe,"" the Murrays said in a written statement. ""But with thanks to God, these remarkable families and their pastors and churches, healing and reconciliation have begun.""",0
"Summary: 123 structures destroyed by wildfires in Lake Arrowhead. White House: Federal Agriculture Department will provide fire crews. Fires threaten San Diego Zoo's Wild Animal Park; animals evacuated. Malibu Canyon fire is 10 percent contained, officials say. Article: More than a dozen uncontained wildfires raged Monday across Southern California, threatening thousands of structures and forcing people to flee homes from San Diego to Malibu to Lake Arrowhead. This photo taken from space Monday afternoon shows smoke rising from the wildfires in Southern California. Fire officials said more than 265,000 people have been evacuated and nearly 4,900 firefighters are battling the fast-moving blazes, which began over the weekend. By Monday afternoon, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention had reported 13 active wildfires have consumed more than 98,000 acres and destroyed or damaged at least 50 homes and businesses across six counties. The winds driving the flames are expected to stay strong, coming out of the northeast, at least through Tuesday, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""It's a tragic time for California,"" California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said earlier Monday. He declared a state of emergency in seven counties and asked the National Guard to pull 800 soldiers from patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border to help battle the wildfires. Monday evening, Schwarzenegger asked U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates to order delivery of all available Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems (MAFFS) to help fight the fires. Watch fires devour homes and land ». Citing the proliferation in the number of fires, Schwarzenegger wrote, ""Your immediate assistance is necessary to deploy Department of Defense aircraft located in Wyoming, North Carolina and Colorado to assist California in our firefighting effort."" According to the White House, the federal Agriculture Department will provide fire crews, air tankers and helicopters to fight the fires, and the state will receive assistance grants to help pay firefighting costs. See where fires burn across Southern California ». Hardest hit was San Diego County, where 250,000 people have fled from five fires. One person was killed and 18 were reported injured in the county, including five firefighters. Local officials said the fire situation had worsened throughout the day, prompting new evacuations. ""We have a very dangerous, unpredictable situation,"" said Ron Roberts, chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. ""We have some of the highest temperatures, some of the driest landscape conditions and some of the most powerful winds -- all the ingredients for a perfect firestorm."" On one cul-de-sac in the San Diego suburb of Rancho Bernardo, five of six homes burned to the ground, leaving flames from gas lines flickering amid the ruins, according to a KGTV report. See photos of the fires ». Officials turned Qualcomm Stadium, home of the NFL's San Diego Chargers, into an evacuation center. Residents of four housing areas at the Camp Pendleton Marine base in northern San Diego County were put on notice for possible evacuations and told to pack personal belongings as a precautionary measure. Earlier Monday, fixed-wing firefighting aircraft were grounded by the strong winds, officials said, making the jobs of fire crews on the ground even harder. Fires threatened the San Diego Zoo's Wild Animal Park on Monday, causing the park to close. Some of the animals, such as endangered condors, are being moved to a safer location, according to zoo spokeswoman Yadira Galindo. Authorities are asking people to hold off on 911 calls unless there is a real emergency, saying clogged cell phone lines are hurting rescue efforts. The largest of the wildfires was the Buckweed blaze north of Los Angeles, which has consumed 27,500 acres and forced the evacuation of 15,000 residents from Santa Clarita and nearby communities, according to the state forestry department. About 4,000 structures were threatened, and the fire was moving toward the Magic Mountain amusement park. Two fires that erupted Monday morning in San Bernardino County near Lake Arrowhead have destroyed at least 123 structures and charred 1,800 acres, said Loretta Benavidez, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino National Forest. Several communities in the area, including Green Valley Lake, Arrowbear and Running Springs, were evacuated. And in Malibu Canyon, south of the Pacific Coast Highway, nearly 1,450 firefighters were battling a blaze that began Sunday afternoon and still threatened 900 structures in the area, which is home to many Hollywood luminaries, the state forestry department said. The Canyon fire is only 10 percent contained, an official said. The Pacific Coast Highway remains shut down in Malibu. Copyright 2007 CNN.

"Summary: Glasgow derby between Celtic and Rangers on Wednesday is postponed. Decision made as a mark of respect after death of ex-player Phil O'Donnell. Motherwell's home game against Celtic next Sunday was already called off. Article: Wednesday's Glasgow derby between Celtic and Rangers has been postponed as a mark of respect following the death of Motherwell captain Phil O'Donnell, the Scottish Premier League announced. O'Donnell, left, celebrates Motherwell's Scottish Cup final win against Dundee in May 1991. ""These are never easy decisions. But we recognise that as a former player, Phil was part of Celtic's extended football family,"" said SPL secretary Iain Blair. ""After consultation with Rangers we agreed to postpone the Old Firm fixture on the second of January."" Motherwell's game against Hibernian on the same day was called off on Saturday night in the hours after O'Donnell, 35, died following his on-field collapse. Gretna's match against St Mirren was also postponed as it was scheduled to take place at Fir Park which has become a shrine to the memory of O'Donnell, but the SPL confirmed that the other three fixtures scheduled for Wednesday will go ahead. Celtic skipper Stephen McManus spoke out in favor of the postponement after he and his team-mates met on Monday morning for the first time since O'Donnell's death. ""A number of our squad have very close connections to Phil's family and feel it would be inappropriate to proceed with this match at such a time, following such a tragic event,"" he said. Rangers manager Walter Smith agreed that the game should not be played. ""You cannot think of playing at a time like this,"" he said.

"Summary: Indian judges bus mobile courts to rural villages to ease backlog. Judges say the mobile courts make justice more convenient. India has an estimated 300 million unresolved court cases. Article: In a nation of more than a billion people and millions of unresolved court cases, how do you take care of the backlog? Long distances over questionable roads stop many Indians from making it into courtrooms. Solution: You take the courts to the people. A bell rings. A bailiff yells out the name of the accused. It's another day in the mobile courtroom of Judge Sandeep Singh. His courtroom is a desk plopped down in the middle of a dusty schoolyard in the northern Indian village of Haryana. ""It works like any other regular court,"" Singh said. ""The only difference is that instead of people going to the court, the court comes to the village."" The mobile court is bused into rural areas to hear both criminal and civil complaints as part of an effort to dig the nation's court system out from under an enormous backlog of cases. With an estimated 300 million unresolved cases languishing in Indian courts, one consultant believes, it could take more than 300 years to clear the docket at the current pace. There's one main reason for the backlog: inconvenience. People often have to travel long distances over questionable roads, using slow modes of transportation. ""The witnesses -- definitely, they don't show up -- and even the parties -- they don't show up -- and they send their advocate,"" Singh said. ""But here, people are closer by, so definitely it makes a difference."" With distance no longer a problem, more villagers and their attorneys are coming to hearings. Compared to the traditional legal system, the mobile court claims to be both fast and efficient. Singh said he has been able to clear 1,100 cases in just six months time compared to 500 under the traditional court system.",0
"Summary: Fran Townsend says she'll look for opportunities in the private sector. Townsend has worked in government and law enforcement for 25 years. Townsend will be on a panel searching for a replacement. Article: President Bush's top adviser on homeland security is stepping down after 4½ years on the job, the White House said Monday. Fran Townsend served more than four years as homeland security adviser. Homeland Security Adviser Fran Townsend turned in her letter of resignation to President Bush on November 6 and will be looking for new opportunities outside government. ""I'm going to just take another job doing 20-hour days, but this time in the private sector,"" said Townsend, who has spent 25 years working in law enforcement and government. Bush praised Townsend's work Monday. ""Fran has always provided wise counsel on how to best protect the American people from the threat of terrorism,"" Bush said in a statement. ""We are safer today because of her leadership."" Townsend's job, as the president's top adviser on fighting terrorism, involved identifying terrorist groups around the globe and assessing their threat, and finding ways to track and cut off their funding. She said that experience should will be useful in the private sector as well. Townsend -- the mother of two, ages 6 and 12 -- said she first will look into public speaking, writing and board work before pursuing opportunities in global risk management for a large multinational corporation or financial institution. Watch how Townsend is planning to use her skills ». She said she's been talking with the president about her planned departure for eight months. Townsend's name had come up during the president's recent search for a new attorney general, but she was not considered. She said not getting the job ""had absolutely nothing to do with her decision to leave."" She said Bush had wanted her to stay on in his administration. ""It was a hard decision as I have loved and will cherish my every minute of service,"" she said in an e-mail. ""My family actually advocated that I remain and has always been supportive of my service so this was entirely my decision."" Townsend is part of the search committee to find a replacement by the beginning of next year. The president appoints the senior staff position, and it needs no Senate confirmation.

"Summary: Attorney: Clients allege terrorism, war crimes, wrongful death, seek $7.86 billion. Plaintiffs want $20 million in damages for each of 393 victims named in suit. Chiquita admits paying a group that the U.S. labeled a terrorist organization. Company ""categorically denies"" attorneys' allegations, says it will fight them. Article: Chiquita Brands International faces a $7.86 billion lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of nearly 400 Colombian families who say the company should be held responsible for the ""torture and murder"" of their loved ones. With a map of alleged victims, Jonathan Reiter makes his case Wednesday at a New York news conference. Attorney Jonathan Reiter said his clients are seeking ""damages for terrorism, war crimes ... and wrongful death."" The plaintiffs are asking for $10 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages for each of the 393 victims named in the suit. Earlier this year, Chiquita, as part of a plea agreement, admitted that what it called protection payments had been given to Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, or AUC. AUC was named a terrorist organization by the United States in 2002, making it a crime to give them money. The lawsuit alleges Chiquita's interaction with the paramilitary group went further than the payments -- it accuses the company of facilitating shipments of arms to the group. ""They conspired with the AUC, aided and abetted them in a far-reaching conspiracy and plan to control every aspect of banana growing, distribution and sale,"" Reiter said. The attorney said one couple refused to sell their banana farm ""for pennies"" and were killed by AUC in 2001, and other murder victims had been directed to ""sell their bananas only to Chiquita."" The families filing the suit will remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals in their home country, he said. ""The principle upon which this lawsuit is brought is that when you put money into the hands of terrorists, when you put guns into the hands of terrorists, then you are legally responsible for the atrocities, the murders and the tortures that those terrorists commit,"" Reiter said. Responding to the allegations Wednesday afternoon, the company said, ""Chiquita Brands International categorically denies the allegations made by these attorneys. We reiterate that Chiquita and its employees were victims and that the actions taken by the company were always motivated to protect the lives of our employees and their families."" Chiquita's director of communications, Michael Mitchell, went on to say, ""Our company had been forced to make protection payments to safeguard our workforce. It is absolutely untrue for anyone to suggest that these payments were made for any other purpose."" Mitchell said the company will fight the allegations. ""Chiquita has already been the victim of extortion in Colombia. We will not allow ourselves to become extortion victims in the United States."" In the March plea agreement, Chiquita Brands International agreed to pay a $25 million fine for the payments made by the company's former banana-producing subsidiary in Colombia. During a government investigation, the company admitted to making payments to AUC even after outside counsel told the company those payments were illegal and should stop immediately.",0
"Summary: Police affidavit quotes mother's statement about beating that killed girl. Mother's husband threw Riley Ann Sawyers across room, affidavit says. Husband later attempted suicide, mother told police. Riley Ann's mother and her husband arrested after a tip led to search. Article: Before dying, 2-year-old Riley Ann Sawyers was beaten with belts, picked up by her hair, thrown across the room and held under water, according to an affidavit from the Galveston County Sheriff's Office. Police believe 2-year-old Riley Ann Sawyers is ""Baby Grace."" The affidavit says the girl's mother, Kimberly Dawn Trenor, described to police how her daughter died and was put in a plastic storage box that Trenor and her husband, Royce Zeigler, later dumped into a Galveston waterway. Trenor told police Zeigler tried to commit suicide the weekend before Thanksgiving, and wrote a note that said, ""My wife is innocent of the sins that I committed."" The body of the then-unidentified toddler was found on October 29. A fisherman found Riley's body stuffed inside a blue storage container that washed up on an uninhabited island in Galveston's West Bay. A medical examiner said the child's skull was fractured, and a forensic dentist estimated her age at 2 to 3 years. Police dubbed the child ""Baby Grace."" A police artist's sketch of her was widely circulated in the news media and prompted a call to Galveston police from Riley's grandmother in Ohio, who had not seen the girl in months. On Saturday, police arrested Trenor and Zeigler on charges of injuring a child and tampering with physical evidence, the sheriff's department said. Their bonds were set at $350,000 each. The affidavit, obtained by CNN, says when police interviewed Trenor on November 23, she ""gave a voluntary statement on video with her attorney present in which she describes her involvement, with Royce Zeigler, in the physical abuse, death and disposal of the remains of her daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers."" Trenor's statement said on July 24, she and Zeigler both beat the child with leather belts and held her head under water in the bathtub. She said Zeigler picked the girl up by her hair and also threw her across the room, slamming her head into the tile floor. After her daughter died, Trenor's statement said, she and Zeigler went to a Wal-Mart that night and bought the Sterilite container, a shovel, concrete mix, and other supplies. The statement said the box containing the child's body was hidden in a storage shed for ""one to two months."" Then, Trenor said, she and Zeigler carried it to the Galveston Causeway and tossed it in, and she saw it drifting away. Riley Ann's father, Robert Sawyers, on Monday tearfully remembered her as a ""fun-loving girl ... with a big imagination."" Watch Riley Ann's father describe the little girl ». Riley was ""very active, very hyper, but also very well-behaved,"" Sawyers told reporters in Mentor, Ohio. She would play ""with a water hose ... spraying the whole patio soaking wet until she was done with it,"" he said, as he sat behind two photographs of his daughter, a toddler with wispy blond curls. Robert Sawyers' mother, Sheryl Sawyers, said the family was ""devastated"" to learn that police believe Riley is dead. ""It's hard to think that I'll never see her again,"" she said, clutching a red Elmo doll she had planned to give Riley for Christmas. Maj. Ray Tuttoilmondo of the Galveston County Sheriff's Department said Monday that authorities are ""fairly confident"" that the toddler whose body was found on October 29 is Riley Ann Sawyers. DNA analysis is still in progress to confirm the identification. The results will be available in two to three weeks, Tuttoilmondo said. Tuttoilmondo said Riley is originally from Mentor, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, and that ""she and her mother came down to Texas earlier this year."" The toddler was last seen in Texas ""three or four months ago,"" Tuttoilmondo said, although he did not know by whom. Tuttoilmondo said police did investigate whether Child Protective Services had taken Riley away, something the mother had reportedly alleged. Of that report, Tuttoilmondo said, ""What we believe is that is not what happened."" The affidavit said Trenor admitted that after the body was found, Zeigler had her type up a fake letter from the Ohio Department of Children's Services saying that Riley was to be taken away. Trenor left Ohio in late May, after filing an allegation of domestic violence against Robert Sawyers and reaching a joint voluntary agreement that gave her custody of Riley and gave Robert Sawyers visitation rights, the Sawyers' family lawyer said Monday. ""She disappeared,"" Laura DePledge said Monday at the Ohio news conference with the Sawyers. Sheryl Sawyers said Monday that she saw widely distributed police sketches of ""Baby Grace"" and contacted Galveston police in November. The girl in the police sketches strongly resembles photos of Riley. ""No, I never did think it would end up like this,"" Sheryl Sawyers said Monday, eyes welling. ""I guess knowing is better than not knowing."" The girl's family in Ohio has been ""very helpful"" in this case, Tuttoilmondo said, adding that the FBI and a Galveston County police officer visited the family in Ohio on Sunday. DePledge said Riley was the product of a ""teenage pregnancy."" Trenor and Robert Sawyers were together for two years as a result of the pregnancy, DePledge said, during which time they lived with Sheryl Sawyers. DePledge said Monday that the family, whose grief she described as ""simply overwhelming,"" wants Riley's body returned to Ohio for a memorial service. ""What Riley needs is to be brought home,"" she said. ""I think this family needs some closure."" Tuttoilmondo asked anyone who knew the child or her family to help detectives reconstruct the events of Riley's short life. The toddler's case has touched even hardened police officers, he said. ""Any way you look at it, we carry a piece of her with us, and we'll always carry a little piece of her with us,"" he said Monday. He held up a small, pink-and-white shoe identical to those the child was wearing when she was found. ""That says it all. A little-bitty shoe."" CNN's Sean Callebs contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Topps Meat Co. hamburger patties may contain E. coli bacteria. New Jersey plant's grinding operation shut down. As many as 25 cases of illness recorded in eight states. Article: Topps Meat Co. on Saturday expanded a recall of ground beef from about 300,000 pounds to 21.7 million pounds, one of the largest meat recalls in U.S. history. The recalled products are all ground beef patties with various brand names. In a statement, the Elizabeth, New Jersey, company said the hamburger patties may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhea and cramps, as well as other complications. A statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said 25 illnesses are under investigation in Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The ground beef products being recalled have a ""sell by date"" or a ""best if used by date"" between September 25, 2007, and September 25, 2008, Topps' statement said. Watch the latest on the beef recall ». The packages also have the marking ""Est. 9748"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. Tuesday, the company announced a recall of about 331,000 pounds of hamburger meat, according to the USDA. ""Because the health and safety of our consumers is our top priority, we are taking these expansive measures,"" said Vice President of Operations Geoffrey Livermore in the statement. ""Topps is continuing to work with the USDA, state departments of health, retailers and distributors to ensure the safety of our consumers. Additionally, we have augmented our internal quality control procedures with microbiologists and food safety experts. We sincerely regret any inconvenience and concerns this may cause our consumers,"" Livermore said. This is the company's first recall in its 65 years of business, the statement said. Consumers who find the products at home are asked to cut off the UPC code and return it to Topps for a full refund, then dispose of the product immediately, Topps spokeswoman Michelle Williams said. The company said to avoid E. coli, consumers should wash hands thoroughly after handling the beef. Topps set up a toll-free recall help line at (888) 734-0451. Williams said because the products may have been produced up to a year ago, many of them have already been safely consumed. Production in the ground beef area of the company's plant in Elizabeth has been shut down until all the investigations are complete, Williams said in a phone interview. ""We're working with the USDA and the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and conducting our own investigation,"" she added. The products, all ground beef patties and hamburgers with various brand names, were distributed mainly in the northeastern United States, but went to retailers in many other areas of the country as well, Williams said. While the sheer size of the recall is large, two other companies have been involved in larger recalls. In 2002, Pilgrim's Pride recalled more than 27 million pounds of poultry, and Hudson Foods recalled 25 million pounds of ground beef in 1997.",0
"Summary: ""He admitted playing with matches and starting the fire,"" says police report. Boy, whose name and age were not given, is home with his parents. Buckweed Fire burned 38,000 acres, destroyed 63 structures, 21 of them homes. Article: A boy playing with matches started a Southern California wildfire that scorched more than 38,000 acres, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday. A firefighter talks on a radio while battling the Buckweed blaze on October 22. The Buckweed Fire, which destroyed 21 homes on its rampage, began October 21 in the Agua Dulce community. ""Our arson explosive detectives, in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Fire Department investigators, immediately began their investigation, and during the course of the investigation, it led to a juvenile suspect,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Tony Moore told CNN's ""American Morning"" Wednesday. ""After talking with that juvenile, he admitted to playing with matches, and accidentally starting the fire in that area,"" he said. Watch what's next for young suspect ». The boy, whose name and age were not given, is home with his parents, police said. The case will be presented to the Los Angeles County district attorney for possible charges. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the Buckweed Fire burned 38,526 acres. Sixty-three structures, 21 of them homes, were destroyed, and three civilians and two firefighters were injured. The sheriff's department said the fire forced the evacuation of about 15,000 people. As of Tuesday, 18 of 23 wildfires in Southern California were completely under control, and the remainder were at least 70 percent contained, according to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fires are blamed for 14 deaths and charred more than 508,000 acres, destroying about 1,600 homes. Five people were arrested in arson probes last week, and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday vowed to ""hunt down"" people responsible for setting wildfires. Authorities said Saturday they were following 1,700 tips about a white Ford F-150 pickup seen near the origin of the sprawling Santiago Fire in Orange County. Witnesses reported seeing the 1998-2004 model truck with chrome tubular running boards on Santiago Canyon Road on October 21 at about the time the Santiago Fire started. Authorities said last week they had found evidence at the scene, although they declined to describe it. ""If I were one of the people who started the fires, I would not sleep soundly right now, because we're right behind you,"" Schwarzenegger said, urging the culprits to turn themselves in.",0
"Summary: Texas voters go to the polls March 4. Sen. John McCain is the clear front-runner on the Republican side. Sen. Barack Obama is on an eight-state winning streak. Some strategists see Texas as a must-win state for Sen. Hillary Clinton. Article: It's all tied up in Texas. Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running a tight race in Texas. A new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois is a statistical dead heat in Texas, which holds primaries March 4. In the survey, out Monday, 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the party's nominee, with 48 percent backing Obama. But taking into account the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 4½ percentage points for Democratic respondents, the race is a virtual tie. Watch Democrats target Texas. ». Two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even. Map: National and state polling. ""One reason the race appears to be tight is that Texas Democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options,"" says CNN polling director Keating Holland. ""Likely Democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination, and they don't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues. ""Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly, those people are splitting roughly equally between Clinton and Obama."" Many political strategists and analysts consider Texas and Ohio -- which also holds a March 4 primary -- must-win states for Clinton. Obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates, 193 of which are at stake in Texas. The new survey indicates Arizona Sen. John McCain is the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination. Among Republicans, 55 percent of likely Texas GOP primary voters support McCain as their choice for nominee. Thirty-two percent back former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former Libertarian standard-bearer Ron Paul. The poll's sampling error for Republican respondents is 4 percentage points. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday. Pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in Texas, including 553 likely Republican primary voters and 529 likely Democratic primary voters. McCain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity. The poll was released on the same day the only living former Republican president -- George Herbert Walker Bush, the current president's father -- endorsed McCain at an event in Houston. Watch McCain get a big boost ». But McCain has had trouble winning conservative voters. Just last week, McCain lost the conservative vote to Huckabee in the Virginia primary, according to exit polls. The new survey, though, suggests McCain may have better luck in Texas. ""It looks like McCain has made some inroads with conservative Republicans,"" Holland said. ""McCain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the GOP primary. The McCain campaign probably wishes that number were higher, but it does mean that a McCain victory in Texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents, as has happened in several states in the past few weeks."" Texas Democrats and Republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues, but the poll suggests they do agree on what's the most important issue. Thirty-five percent of Democrats and an equal number of Republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president. The second most important issue for Democrats was health care, at 23 percent, followed by the war in Iraq at 22 percent, illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent. Nineteen percent of Republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue, putting it in second place, followed by the war in Iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent. Sixty percent of Republicans say they'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing. That number climbs to 76 percent for Democrats. Likely Democratic primary voters view Clinton and Obama on roughly equal terms. Seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if Clinton were the nominee; an equal number feel the same way about Obama. Seventy-nine percent say it's likely Clinton can win the nomination; 82 percent say the same about Obama. The two candidates are essentially tied on immigration, Iraq and the economy, but Clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion.",0

Evacuees taken to an armory converted into a shelter, Red Cross says. Man tells WCVB-TV his car caught fire, exploded as he fled; ""I got out just in time"" Article: At least 200 people were evacuated from their homes, including 84 residents of an apartment building for the elderly, after a tanker truck carrying 9,000 gallons of gasoline erupted early Wednesday in a northern Boston suburb. Firefighters battle a blaze Wednesday north of Boston after a tanker overturned carrying 9,000 gallons of gas.

"Summary: Kaka deservedly named World Player of the Year for the first time in his career. The Brazilian beats Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the journalists' vote. The 25-year-old averages one goal in three games for both AC Milan and Brazil. Article: Despite the obvious claims of younger rivals Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite as the 2007 World Footballer of the Year. Brazilian genius Kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 World Footballer of the Year award. The prestigious Ballon d'Or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and Kaka's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old Brazilian's current standing in world football. When AC Milan defeated Liverpool in the Champions League final in Athens, avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in Istanbul two years previously, it enabled Kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft Europe's premier trophy -- a winner's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance. Kaka's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the San Siro from Sao Paulo for a fee of just $8.5 million in the summer of 2003. Unlike many a Brazilian sporting genius, Kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town. He was born into a comfortable middle class Brasilia family, where football was not the only hope of a bright future. However, it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by Sao Paulo, after his family had moved there, at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old. Kaka's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and Felipe Scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 World Cup finals, earning him a winners' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Costa Rica. A year later, and Kaka was on his way to Milan. Within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the Rossoneri lift the Scudetto and the European Super Cup. Throughout his career, Kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games. Yet to describe Kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice. Tall, elegant and blessed with astonishing skill, Milan and Brazil utilize Kaka's ability superbly. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti soon recognized Kaka's genius, changing his team's system to a 4-4-1-1, playing the Brazilian behind a main target man. With Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso holding the central midfield area, Kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker, be it Filippo Inzaghi, Ronaldo or Alberto Gilardino. And Kaka does this with devastating effect, running at the opposition with pace and power, finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play. The fly in the ointment for Milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season. Although they have already reached the last 16 of the Champions League, the club are floundering in Serie A and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season's competition unless they win the trophy. Real Madrid have coveted Kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Milan don't secure a place among Europe's elite.",0
"Summary: Of 100,000 items, library systems are able to locate about 20,000. Inspector general: This does not mean the remaining items are missing. Inspector general: Items may ""be safely located within the library's storage"" Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation expresses ""serious concerns"" Article: Up to 80,000 items at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library are unaccounted for, probably because of haphazard record-keeping and inventory procedures, officials said Thursday. An audit found ""significant breakdown in internal controls"" at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. An audit completed last month by the National Archives and Records Administration's inspector general looked at the management of presidential artifacts at six presidential libraries. It ""cites particular issues at the Ronald Reagan Library. ... We acknowledge that problems exist in inventory control at the Reagan library,"" said a statement from Allen Weinstein, national archivist. Inspector General Paul Brachfield was more blunt. A ""significant breakdown in internal controls"" was found at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, California, he said in a statement Thursday. The audit results prompted the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation to urge the National Archives -- which is responsible for maintaining the artifacts -- to move quickly to fix the problems. The chairman of the board of trustees has contacted Weinstein ""to express the serious concerns and disappointment on behalf of the Reagan Foundation and Mrs. Reagan,"" the foundation said. Library officials told auditors that ""the collection contained approximately 100,000 items, yet the library systems only had information to locate and account for approximately 20,000 items,"" Brachfield said. ""This does not automatically mean the approximately 80,000 remaining items are missing. The vast majority may very well be safely located within the library's storage facilities. ... Some of these items may be missing or stolen, or none of these items may be missing or stolen."" Control deficiencies at the library created an environment that could potentially have been exploited, Brachfield said. Although Congress has a copy of the audit, it has not yet been made public because of the ongoing investigation into the whereabouts of the items. The count of 100,000 was an estimate taken from the original Reagan White House Gift Unit database, Weinstein said Thursday, but was never meant to be used as a concrete inventory control number. The Reagan library has already begun implementing recommendations from the audit, he said. It has upgraded its management inventory software, is hiring additional trained museum staff, has begun a comprehensive inventory and is addressing storage issues by reshelving artifacts and taking steps to protect artifacts in case of an earthquake. ""Like all of the presidential libraries, the Reagan library stores their gifts in a locked vault, which is protected by a security camera,"" Weinstein said. The audit examined management of artifacts at the Reagan library; the Franklin D. Roosevelt library; the John F. Kennedy library; the Gerald R. Ford library; the George Bush library; and the William J. Clinton library, Weinstein said. ""Early collections of artifacts came to presidential libraries with few controls and incomplete information relating to the collections,"" he said.",0
"Summary: Fires at Camp Pendleton cause evacuation of 3,000 marines. Military lending direct and indirect assistance to firefighting efforts. As firefighting efforts go on, base officials poised to evacuate. Navy and Marine Corps have more than 20 facilities in San Diego area. Article: Dozens of Defense Department personnel are actively engaged in fighting the wildfires raging in Southern California, Pentagon officials said Tuesday, and thousands more National Guard and active-duty military personnel are available to help. The Rice fire, east of Camp Pendleton, caused the evacuation of the Fallbrook community. Paul McHale, assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense, said that 12 Defense Department firefighting teams, with 12 engines, are already working the blazes and more than 17,000 National Guardsmen are potentially available if needed. In addition, he said, 550 Marines from Camp Pendleton are preparing to deploy to the fire area. ""All of the aid that we provide is the result of a request ... from the state,"" McHale said. ""However, we have been very proactive in independently preparing those capabilities for the possibility of such requests, and we have reached out early to state officials."" California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has already called up 1,500 National Guard troops, including more than 200 taken from border duty to help with supplies and security at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium and DelMar Fairgrounds and Racetrack, where thousands of evacuated residents are taking shelter. Schwarzenegger also requested and received from the federal government six ""modular airborne fire fighting systems"" units -- which are C-130s that drop water and fire suppressant on the blazes. Watch California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger talk about the crisis ». The Pentagon provided 11 helicopters equipped with water buckets to fight the fires, McHale said. Aerial attacks on the fires, however, have been minimal because of high Santa Ana winds with gusts approaching 70 mph. In an effort to make room for more civilians who have had to evacuate their homes, sailors stationed in Southern California are abandoning their barracks. ""Orders have been given to all sailors ashore in barracks to move to shipboard billeting to provide room for evacuees,"" said a Tuesday statement released by the U.S. military. Only essential personnel are requested to report to duty at Naval Base San Diego, Naval Amphibious Base in Coronado, and Naval Air Station in El Centro. Those bases have also set up cots and tents for evacuees. Also, the Navy has offered an Aegis cruiser, a guided missile destroyer, and two fast frigates to support evacuation efforts. Meanwhile, the Pentagon designated March Air Reserve Base as the primary staging area for medical and relief supplies coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, McHale said. And some 100 California National Guard medical personnel are helping alleviate ""critical staffing shortfalls"" at the San Diego Veterans Center, whose hospital staff are under voluntary and mandatory evacuation orders. The fires are also having a direct effect on military personnel -- McHale said 1,400 Navy personnel and their families have been forced to evacuate, and Camp Pendleton ordered 3,000 Marines to evacuate because of the fire, the Pentagon announced Tuesday evening. In all, the military has about Video 20 facilities around the San Diego area.",0
"Summary: Scientology membership a privilege that's earned, Cruise says. 2004 video part of ceremony honoring Cruise for humanitarian work. Scientology defined as ""study of the truth"" Article: Tom Cruise expounds on his beliefs in Scientology in a 2004 video that made its way onto the Internet this week. Tom Cruise appears with his wife, Katie Holmes, at a movie premiere earlier this month. ""I think it's a privilege to call yourself a Scientologist, and it's something you have to earn,"" Cruise says at the beginning of the video. Cruise says he's ""driven ... by the opportunity to really help, for the first time, change people's lives. I'm absolutely, uncompromisingly dedicated to that."" The video was shown at a 2004 Scientology ceremony honoring Cruise for his humanitarian work. Church of Scientology officials said it can be viewed at any of its churches, but it created a stir this week when what the church calls a pirated and edited version appeared on YouTube. The video has since been taken off YouTube, but an interview portion remained available on the celebrity Web site gawker.com on Thursday. Watch snippets of Cruise video ». ""The Cruise Indoctrination Video Scientology Tried To Suppress"" is the title of gawker.com's presentation. ""You have to watch this video,"" the site says. ""It shows Tom Cruise, with all the wide-eyed fervor that he brings to the promotion of a movie, making the argument for Scientology,"" which it calls ""the bizarre 20th-century religion. Watch ""Showbiz Tonight"" discussion of Cruise video ». Cruise talks over a repetitive guitar-riff soundtrack, and appears to be answering questions, though an interviewer is not seen or heard. A second part of the video, made available to CNN by the publisher of a new unauthorized biography of Cruise, shows Cruise accepting Scientology's Freedom Medal of Valor award and exchanging military-like salutes with Scientology chairman David Miscavige to audience applause. The publisher denies leaking other parts of the video to the Web. In the video by the publisher, Cruise also salutes a portrait of L. Ron Hubbard, cited on the church's Web site as the founder of ""the only major religion founded in the 20th century."" Hubbard's biography cites his accomplishments as everything from mariner and horticulturalist to author and humanitarian. In the video, Cruise puts emphasis on the latter role. A Scientologist ""has the ability to create new realities and improve conditions,"" Cruise says. On its Web site, the Church of Scientology highlights its humanitarian work, from anti-drug campaigns in places from Minnesota to Taiwan to teacher training in India. The Web site defines Scientology as ""the study of truth."" Cruise embraces that in the video. ""If you're a Scientologist, ... you see things the way they are,"" Cruise says. He also says he finds peace in the religion. ""The more you know as a Scientologist, you don't become overwhelmed by it,"" according to Cruise. The unauthorized biography of Cruise is by author Andrew Morton. A Cruise spokesperson and the Church of Scientology have disputed the book, saying Morton did not seek their comment. ""Accuracy and truth were not on Morton's agenda,"" according to a church statement. Morton denies that and says Cruise, who he calls ""a towering figure on the international scene,"" and his faith are worthy of scrutiny. ""Tom Cruise has done remarkable work for his faith over the past few years,"" Morton said. ""If it wasn't for him the Church of Scientology would be a shadow of what it is today.""

"Summary: French and Australian leaders arrive in Afghanistan. Both leaders expected to meet with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Both will visit with their respective country's troops. Article: Australia's new prime minister assured Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Saturday that his country's troops intend to be in Afghanistan ""for the long haul."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy, left, shakes hands with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Kabul. Kevin Rudd and French President Nicolas Sarkozy flew into the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Saturday to meet with Karzai and visit their respective country's troops participating in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. In a morning meeting, Sarkozy ""assured President Karzai of his government's long term political and military support with the people of Afghanistan,"" according to a statement from the Afghan president's office. Rudd, who was elected in a landslide victory Nov. 24, appeared with Karzai at a news conference, where he repeatedly said that the Australian commitment to Afghanistan is strong. ""We will be, as I said before, in this country, Afghanistan, for the long haul. It's important for us to be here in partnership with NATO countries,"" Rudd said. ""On the question of the broader security policy challenges faced within Afghanistan, of course they are significant, they are real. But we are confident that in partnership with our friends in the Afghan government and with our other allies, particularly in NATO, that we can continue to achieve real progress in the long-term security of this country,"" he added. Australia's new defense minister, however, warned U.S. and NATO allies recently that they risk losing the war in Afghanistan without a sharp shift in military and reconstruction efforts there. Joel Fitzgibbon, who took office with Rudd allies during a conference in Scotland earlier this month, said that more work needs to be done to win the ""hearts and minds"" of the people of Afghanistan in the 6-year-old war against the country's former Taliban rulers and their al Qaeda allies. Karzai wished those at the news conference a merry Christmas, then thanked Australia, France and other countries for their help and support. More than 1,900 French troops are in Afghanistan, serving both the ISAF and the U.S.-led Operation Enduring Freedom. Australia is the largest non-NATO contributor to the war in Afghanistan, with nearly 1,000 troops stationed mostly in the southern province of Oruzgan. Sarkozy, elected to lead France last May, told the U.S. Congress during a visit last month that France would stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with the United States on the war in Afghanistan. ""Let me tell you solemnly today: France will remain engaged in Afghanistan as long as it takes, because what's at stake in that country is the future of our values and that of the Atlantic Alliance,"" he said. Rudd made a surprise visit Friday to Iraq, where he promised continued Australian aid, despite a decision to withdraw all 550 Australian troops in Iraq by mid-2008 -- an effort his predecessor, John Howard, staunchly opposed. Rudd had said he would start a phased withdrawal of Australian forces from Iraq if his Labor Party won the vote. Journalist Farhad Peikar in Kabul contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Vick's attorney says early surrender shows Vick accepts responsibility. Sentencing set for December 10 on dogfighting charges against Michael Vick. Atlanta Falcons quarterback pleaded guilty in August. Monday, he surrendered to begin whatever sentence he gets on December 10. Article: Michael Vick turned himself in to authorities on Monday to get a head start on serving his sentence for running a dogfighting ring, the U.S. Marshals Service said. Michael Vick leaves court in Richmond, Virginia, in August after pleading guilty to dogfighting charges. The Atlanta Falcons quarterback is scheduled to be sentenced on December 10 on a federal conspiracy charge of bankrolling the dogfighting operation. Vick, 27, voluntarily turned himself in around noon, said Kevin Trevillan of the Marshals Service, and is being held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Virginia, until the sentencing hearing. The quarterback, who has been suspended indefinitely by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, faces 12 to 18 months in prison on the charge. Vick pleaded guilty in August after three associates admitted their own roles in the operation and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. ""From the beginning, Mr. Vick has accepted responsibility for his actions and his self-surrender further demonstrates that acceptance,"" Vick's attorney, Billy Martin, said in a statement. ""Michael wants to again apologize to everyone who has been hurt in this matter and he thanks all of the people who have offered him and his family prayers and support during this time,"" Martin's statement said. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin speculated that Vick started his sentence early ""to get it out of the way."" Watch Toobin explain why Vick would surrender early ». On September 25, a Virginia grand jury indicted Vick and the three co-defendants -- Purnell Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Quanis Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Tony Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia -- on state charges of running a dogfighting ring at Vick's home outside Newport News. The Surry County grand jury brought two charges against the four men: one count of unlawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights. Each is a felony charge that could result in a five-year prison term. In addition, Taylor faces three additional counts of unlawful torture and killing of dogs. A hearing in that case is set for November 27, but Vick does not have to be in court at that time. In September, Vick was put under tight restrictions by the federal court after he tested positive for marijuana use. Vick tested positive for the drug on September 13, a court document from the Eastern District of Virginia shows. As a result, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson ordered Vick to ""submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance."" Those methods could include random drug testing, a remote alcohol testing system ""and/or any form of prohibited substance screening or testing,"" the order said. Vick was also ordered to stay home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., ""or as directed by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer,"" the order said. He was to be electronically monitored during that time. Vick must participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling ""if deemed advisable by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer"" at his own expense, the order said.",0
"Summary: Pope says football can teach values of ""honesty, solidarity and fraternity"" Sport should be used as a vehicle of education for young people, he says. Vatican has endorsed lower league club Ancona's adoption of ethical code. German-born pope is reputed to be a Bayern Munich fan. Article: Football should be used to teach young people moral lessons, Pope Benedict XVI said during an audience with representatives from the Italian football league and lower division clubs. Pope Benedict XVI is presented with a football by Ancona club officials. Italian football has been tarnished in recent seasons by corruption, match-fixing scandals and crowd trouble, but the pope insisted the sport celebrated positive virtues as well. ""The sport of football can be a vehicle of education for the values of honesty, solidarity and fraternity, especially for the younger generation,"" the pope said, according to Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper. The comments are not the first foray by the Bavarian-born pope -- reputedly a Bayern Munich supporter -- into Italian football. In October, he was presented with a No. 16 shirt by officials of the lower league club Ancona after the Vatican endorsed its campaign to turn itself into a ""beacon of morality"" by adopting an ""innovative, ethical model of practising football,"" Reuters reported. The code committed Ancona to promoting fair play in a family atmosphere. The club is currently second in Serie C1/B, Italian football's third tier league. ""Football should increasingly become a tool for the teaching of life's ethical and spiritual values,"" the pope said. Pope Benedict XVI's predecessor, Pope John Paul II, was also a keen football fan, reportedly playing in goal during his youth in Poland. All Italian football matches were cancelled on the weekend following his death in 2005.",0

"Summary: Riots in French suburb for second night after two teens killed in police crash. Violence spreads from Villiers-le-Bel, north of Paris, to two nearby towns. More than 60 police injured, bombarded with Molotov cocktails and bottles of acid. Parallels drawn with unrest in 2005, when President Sarkozy was interior minister. Article: The Paris suburbs were again rocked by riots after a second night of lawlessness Monday caused widespread destruction and left scores of police injured, according to French authorities and media reports. Firefighters in a Paris suburb battle to control a blaze started after youths rioted Sunday night. An angry mob repeatedly clashed with riot police and torched cars and buildings in the town of Villiers-le-Bel, north of Paris, after two teens on a motorcycle were killed following a collision with a police car Sunday night. Rioters bombarded police with baseball bats, Molotov cocktail bombs and bottles filled with acid as the violence spread to the nearby towns of Longjumeau and Grigby Monday night. The 15- and 16-year-old boys, both sons of African immigrants, according to police, died when their motorbike hit a patrol car in Villiers-le-Bel. Some residents, populated largely by immigrants and their French-born children, accused police of fleeing the crash scene. However, three eyewitnesses, interviewed on TV, said the police stayed and tried to revive the two boys with mouth to mouth resuscitation. Watch why a repeat of past rioting is feared ». More than 60 police officers were injured in Monday night's confrontation, with five kept in hospital in a serious condition, according to reports in a number of French newspapers. A spokesman for the police authorities in the Val d'Oise prefecture refused to confirm the numbers of police injuries, telling CNN that police feared the information could further enflame the already tense situation. The police spokesman said 60 cars, a library and car dealer's showroom had been set on fire in Villiers-le-Bel. He said a police station had also been damaged and 15 garbage cans torched. Security was tightened Tuesday, with helicopters deployed to patrol over the town, the spokesman said. Villiers-le-Bel was not among the districts hit by the weeks of nationwide rioting in November 2005, when disaffected youths nationwide set thousands of cars ablaze to protest against unemployment and discrimination. Those riots were also sparked by fatalities, namely the deaths of two men of North African descent who were electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical substation. French president Nicolas Sarkozy, then serving as the interior minister, provoked controversy at the time by referring to the rioters as ""scum."" Sarkozy, currently on a state visit to China, had urged residents Monday to ""cool down and let the justice system determine who is responsible for what."" A spokesman for the president's office told CNN Tuesday they were continuing to monitor the situation. The prosecutor's office in the nearby town of Pontoise has already begun an inquiry into the deaths. Police said the teens drove through a red light without wearing helmets and on an unregistered bike. But Omar Sehhouli, the brother of one of the victims, told French media the police involved should be arrested. ""Everyone knew the two boys here,"" he told French radio. ""What happened, that's not violence, it's rage."" According to the initial findings from the French police watchdog, reported Tuesday in the daily newspaper, Le Figaro, the boy's motorbike was driving ""at very high speed"" and had failed to give priority to the police patrol vehicle. The police car was driving normally at around 40 kilometers an hour, the newspaper reported the watchdog had found. CNN's Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Kenya's once-stable economy faltering due to violence following disputed election. Equity market on Nairobi Stock Exchange lost $591 million on first day of 2008. Business leaders say the government losing $29.5 million a day in revenues. Thriving tourist industry also hit, with British tour operators calling off flights. Article: The orgy of violence that has greeted Kenya's disputed election result has led to hundreds of deaths and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes. But away from the tragic human cost, the unrest has also provoked concerns about the stability of the east African country's economy, until now seen as a model for the region. Businesses have been destroyed and looted and supply routes disrupted after the opposition accused incumbent president Mwai Kibaki of election fraud after he was declared winner Sunday. Investors are watching events closely in the country, fearful of how it could affect one of Africa's few economic success stories. And the early signs have been worrying. The equity market on the Nairobi Stock Exchange lost 40 billion Kenyan Shillings ($591 million) in value on its first day of New Year trading Wednesday, the Kenyan financial newspaper Business Daily Africa reported. And business leaders said that the government was losing around 2 billion Shillings ($29.5 million) a day in lost revenue as a result of the political violence, the paper reported. ""We do seem to be in a new place, there's a lot of uncertainty about where we go from here. And a lot depends crucially on how long-lasting this is,"" said Razia Kahn, an analyst specializing in Africa at Standard Chartered bank. Kenya has attracted a large number of multi-nationals and is home to one of the world's fastest growing stock exchanges. Its relative economic success has been helped in part by its thriving tourist sector, with visitors attracted by its abundant wildlife and pristine beaches. Provisional figures for 2006 from the Kenya's tourist board said the country had received 1.5 million visitors for the year, a growth of 5.2 per cent. However, fears that the tourist industry could take a heavy hit from the unrest grew with the British Federation of Tour Operators announcing Thursday it was suspending all holidays to the country departing up to and including this Saturday. Watch an aid worker describe fears that crisis may resemble Rwanda's ». British tourists already in the country have been advised by the British Foreign Office to stay indoors and to stay away from the major cities. There are also worries about the knock-on effect for the region, since around 40 percent of Kenya's exports go to other African nations, Kahn said. Of even greater concern is the effect on Kenya's lucrative agriculture industry. Exports of tea, coffee, vegetables and flowers are big earners for the country, with agriculture making up about a fifth of the total economy. There have been media reports of tea and coffee auctions being halted by the violence as well as widespread disruption to transport routes as rioters blockade major roads across the country. Arun Shah, who runs a coffee import business based in London, told CNN his livelihood depended on a stable Kenya. ""We have had absolutely reliable supply,"" he said. ""We have had reliable quality and the quantities that we need for our trade."" CNN's Jim Boulden in London contributed to this report.",0

"Summary: Independents, Democrats can vote in Michigan's open Republican primary. No Democratic delegates at stake, and most top-tier candidates aren't on ballot. Economic woes top concern for Michigan primary voters. Article: The most compelling action during Michigan's primary Tuesday will be on the Republican side. The Democratic Party has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early, and top-tier Democratic candidates have taken their names off the ballot, except for Sen. Hillary Clinton. The struggling auto industry has been a drag on Michigan's economy. In many ways, the Republican battle for Michigan will be similar to last week's New Hampshire contest. The primary is open, and any registered voter -- including independents and Democrats -- can participate. Sen. John McCain won New Hampshire with the help of independent voters, and he is campaigning hard to re-create that success in Michigan. In 2000, McCain defeated then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the Michigan primary. In that vote, more than half -- 52 percent -- were either independents or Democrats. Among Republican voters, McCain lost to Bush 29 percent to 66 percent. In that contest, almost three out of every 10 voters identified themselves as members of the religious right. Overall, Michigan is a swing state, producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders. However, voting trends favor the Democrats. Michigan's governor, Jennifer Granholm, is a Democrat, as are the state's two U.S. senators -- Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow. The Democratic presidential nominee has carried Michigan in the last four elections. Sen. John Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 standard bearer, won Michigan 51 percent to 48 percent over President Bush. The state's economy is powered by the automotive industry, which has experienced its fair share of struggles. Michigan's unemployment rate, 7.4 percent, is higher than the national average of 5 percent. Region by region. Wayne County, in the southeastern corner of the state, contains the economically depressed Detroit, Michigan's largest city. Detroit is predominantly black and solidly Democratic. North of Wayne County are the more-affluent suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb, which have grown in population in the last two decades. These two counties have been the state's central political battleground in recent elections. West of Wayne is the ""university belt,"" home to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Michigan State University in East Lansing. The area also includes the industrial cities of Saginaw and Flint, where unions remain strong, as well as Jackson and Bay City. The state's capital, Lansing, and the sparsely populated upper peninsula are also part of this region. The southwest part of the state is dominated by Grand Rapids, Michigan's second-largest city. Grand Rapids is traditionally Dutch-American and has many Christian conservatives and generally votes Republican. The area also contains smaller industrial cities and farming communities. The economy of the sparsely populated north and northwest is based on agriculture, tourism and timber. It traditionally votes Republican. Endorsements. The Detroit Free Press has endorsed McCain. ""While the Free Press differs with McCain on a number of issues, the Arizona senator is a smarter, more tested and pragmatic leader who has shown since 2000 that he knows how to build bipartisan alliances around issues,"" the newspaper said in an editorial. The Detroit News also endorsed McCain, citing his fiscal conservatism and command of military and foreign affairs, over Michigan native Mitt Romney. ""Other GOP contenders, most notably former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, are capable figures with impressive resumes and a solid grasp of the issues. But McCain's longtime presidential ambitions are at last aligned with the needs of the nation,"" the newspaper said.",0

Article: A search is under way for a pregnant 20-year-old Marine who has been missing from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, since December 14. Lance Cpl.

The sheriff's department said Lauterbach's mother said that her daughter, of Montgomery, Ohio, had witnessed an incident at Camp Lejeune and was to testify about it. Sheriff's department officials said evidence causes them to be concerned about Lauterbach's disappearance, WITN reported. The Marine's car was found Monday at Jacksonville's bus station, Brown told the Daily News, and her cell phone had been found at Camp Lejeune's front gate on December 20. Her mother reported her missing on December 19, and told the sheriff's department ""that she was very suspicious that something bad may have happened to her daughter,"" the department said in a news release. Watch Lauterbach's mom say what raised her concerns ».

December 14 was also the last time Lauterbach's cell phone was used, authorities told the Marine Corps Times. The Raleigh News and Observer, citing Brown, reported that the woman's mother said her daughter phoned home or her relatives up to 12 times a week and the mother became concerned when she did not hear from her daughter for five days. A Facebook page established to help find Lauterbach says she was last seen December 14 in Jacksonville. ""Call mom!!! You know the number,"" the page says. ""All of us love you and we miss you.

"Summary: Head of Iraqi Red Crescent says parents abandoning their kids at alarming rates. Sometimes he wonders: ""Oh my God, how are we going to solve it?"" The greatest concern is the long-term effect on an entire generation. ""Trauma of what's happening to those children is enormous"" Article: The head of Iraq's main humanitarian group said an 18-year-old approached him with a baby suffering from leukemia. The desperate mother said she'd do ""anything"" for treatment for her child -- and then offered herself up for sex. Baha, 12, waits for treatment in an Iraqi Red Crescent center after shrapnel pierced his left eye. Said Ismail Hakki breaks down in tears as he recalls that story. Leukemia can be treatable to a degree in much of the world, but not in Iraq. The baby died two months later. ""It shook me like hell,"" said Hakki, the president of the Iraqi Red Crescent. ""All my life I've been a surgeon. I've seen blood; I've seen death. That never shook me -- none whatsoever. But when I see the suffering of those people, that really shook me."" The plight of Iraq's children is nearing epidemic proportions, he said, with mothers and fathers abandoning their children ""because they're becoming a liability."" The parents don't do it out of convenience, they do it out of desperation. Watch the plight of Iraq's children ». ""When you become so desperate, you tend to just throw everything up and go,"" Hakki said. ""Every time I look at those children, I ask myself first, 'What crime have those children committed?'"" Hakki says Red Crescent has the monumental task of treating and feeding more than 1.6 million children under the age of 12 who have become homeless in their own country. That's roughly 70 percent of the estimated 2.3 million Iraqis who are homeless inside Iraq. How to help the Iraqi Red Crescent. With 95,000 volunteers and 5,000 employees, the Iraqi Red Crescent is the last line of defense for the country's poor, sick and displaced. They try to blend in as best they can, with Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds working in the neighborhoods distinct to their ethnicities. Six employees of the Iraqi Red Crescent have been killed over the last four years. Eight have been wounded, including six left disabled by the severity of their wounds. Hakki says the spike in numbers of abandoned children is especially alarming, the result of sectarian violence and drastic socio-economic problems. The majority of parents in Iraq, he says, leave their children with a single relative who often has about 20 to 30 children to look after. Some parents just leave their kids altogether. Many of the families are living in areas without basic needs, like water and electricity, and there are no jobs available. ""It's a desperate situation,"" he said. ""Children are becoming a liability for both the father and the mother."" The greatest concern is the ripple effect it will have in the long term -- an entire generation lacking basic life skills, surviving with no education, no income and no families. See wounded Iraqi children get help in neighboring Jordan ». ""The trauma of what's happening to those children is enormous,"" he said. ""If somebody is injured by a bullet or shrapnel, it takes a week or two and he's fine. ... The psycho-social injury is pretty deep and can take months, if not years, to heal. ""That's the task -- the mammoth task -- the Iraq Red Crescent is facing."" The group gets some financial support from the central government. It's also negotiating with the U.S. Embassy, he said, to see if it can offer financial aid. But funds are low. Just recently, the group closed 18 camps for the winter and is trying to house those thousands of people in abandoned government buildings. At a waiting room at an Iraqi Red Crescent treatment center in Baghdad's Mansour district, CNN came across several young children in desperate need of care. But they were among the lucky ones -- if that term can even be applied -- because their parents remain with them. Baha, a 12-year-old boy, was waiting to see a doctor, recalling the exact date -- January 16, 2004 -- he lost his left eye. ""I want my eye to get well,"" he said. Baha was with his father in a market when someone opened fire on U.S. soldiers. When the soldiers fired back, shrapnel hit his eye. Despite what happened, this brave boy still goes to that same market. ""I'm not afraid,"" he said. Across the room, 3-year-old Saja lightened the mood in the room. ""Iraqis, we are still brothers!"" she sang. She giggled, laughed and darted around, bringing smiles to all who saw her. Yet, she couldn't see most of what was around her. She's blind in one eye and losing sight in the other -- the result of shoddy medical care. Her father, Dia'a, said he heard about the Iraqi Red Crescent from television and others who had been treated here. He said he can't afford to travel outside the country for medical treatment for his girl. This clinic, he said, has given him ""a ray of hope that I had lost."" He, too, expressed despair over the plight of Iraq's youngest generation. ""Our children are suffering. All they talk about is weapons and bombs,"" he said. ""They are children. We are older; our hair turns gray. What happens to them hearing all the explosions and bombs? ""We can't make them feel better because we are down."" That's a sentiment that haunts the head of the Iraqi Red Crescent. ""There are times I get up in the middle of the night and I say, 'Oh my God, how are we going to solve it? God help me to help those kids!'"" CNN.com's Wayne Drash contributed to this report in Atlanta.",0
"Summary: Military says some of the 26 bodies may belong to Iraqi police. Complex believed to be an al Qaeda in Iraq haven. Coalition forces say they made the discovery during operations in northern Iraq. Military: Evidence of torture and murder against local villagers found. Article: Coalition forces found 26 bodies buried in mass graves and a bloodstained ""torture complex,"" with chains hanging from walls and ceilings and a bed connected to an electrical system, the military said Wednesday. Twenty-six bodies were found in mass graves near a ""torture complex"" discovered by coalition forces. The troops made the discovery while conducting an operation north of Muqdadiya, Iraq. From December 8 to 11, the troops who found the complex also killed 24 people they said were terrorists and detained 37 suspects, according to a statement issued by Multinational Division North at Camp Speicher in Tikrit. The moves were part of an operation called Iron Reaper that has been in progress across northern Iraq for the past few weeks. The complex was in an area thought to be an al Qaeda in Iraq haven and operating base, the military said. Iraqis had told the military about the site during an earlier operation. ""Evidence of murder, torture and intimidation against local villagers was found throughout the area,"" the military statement said. Ground forces first found what appeared to be a detention facility, which was one of three connected to the torture complex, Multinational Division North said. One of the facilities appeared to have been a headquarters building and a torture facility, it added. As the area was cleared, the bodies were found. Eventually, 26 bodies were uncovered in mass graves next to what were thought to be execution sites, the military said. The bodies are believed to have been dead between six and eight months, according to a gruesome military video shot at the scene. Some had their hands tied behind their backs. Identification is proving to be a challenge because of advanced decomposition. Photos given to the news media show a filthy bed wired to an electrical system, with an outlet hanging from wires on the wall. In the video, troops point out rubber hoses and boxing gloves, a ski mask and a blood-covered sword and knives. Other still photos show an entrance to the underground bunker and barbed wire stretched outside it. A short distance away from the complex, troops found a bullet-riddled Iraqi police vehicle. Some of the bodies may belong to Iraqi police, according to the military video. The operation netted nine weapons caches, which have been destroyed, the military said. They included anti-aircraft weapons, sniper rifles, more than 65 machine guns and pistols, 50 grenades and a surface-to-air missile launcher and platform, the statement said. Also found were mines, pipe bombs, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar tubes and rounds and 130 pounds of homemade explosives.",0
"Summary: Pakistan rejects fears its nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of extremists. Mohamed ElBaradei, U.N. nuclear watchdog chief, voiced his worries Tuesday. ElBaradei: I fear chaos in this state, which has 30 or 40 nuclear weapons. Pakistan: Our nuclear weapons as secure as those held by other nuclear states. Article: Pakistan's foreign ministry Wednesday rejected concerns raised by the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief that the country's nuclear weapons ""could fall into the hands of an extremist group in Pakistan or in Afghanistan."" Mohamed ElBaradei, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief. fears for Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Mohamed ElBaradei's comments to Al-Hayat newspaper were ""irresponsible"" and ""unwarranted,"" foreign ministry spokesman Mohammed Sadiq said at a news briefing on Wednesday. ""Pakistan rejects the statement by Dr. ElBaradei, Director General IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), hinting at the possibility of its nuclear weapons falling into the hands of extremists,"" according to a ministry statement. ""As head of the IAEA, which is a U.N. body, he has to be careful about his statements which ought to remain within the parameters of his mandate. ""His remarks also ignore the fact that the strategic assets of Pakistan are fully secure and under multilayered safeguards and controls exercised by the National Command Authority."" In an interview published in Al-Hayat Tuesday, ElBaradei said that Pakistan's recent political instability makes it more sensitive to susceptible to problems in other Muslim countries. ""The effects of any new war in the Middle East and the Islamic world could have repercussions, not only in Iran, but what I fear most is the effect in Pakistan, a nation with many internal problems,"" ElBaradei said. ""I fear a system of chaos or extremist regime in this state, which has 30 or 40 nuclear weapons."" Pakistan has been in a state of political upheaval since the country's opposition challenged President Pervez Musharraf's tight grip on power, pushing him to step down as military chief and lift the emergency rule he had imposed in early November. The country further spiraled into chaos after the December 27 assassination of leading opposition figure and former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto. In response to the IAEA director-general's comments, Pakistan's foreign ministry stressed in its statement that ElBaradei, ""on several occasions, has been briefed about the structure and control mechanisms put in place to ensure complete safety of our nuclear assets."" ""Pakistan is a responsible nuclear weapon state. Our nuclear weapons are as secure as that of any other nuclear weapon state. We, therefore, believe statements expressing concern about their safety and security are unwarranted and irresponsible. ""Pakistan attaches great importance to IAEA and has extended cooperation and assistance to the Agency on many important issues towards the fulfillment of its mandate. Our civilian nuclear program is under IAEA safeguards and we have always fully complied with IAEA obligations,"" the ministry said.",0
"Summary: Discussion on campaign trail turns to foreign policy, national security, terrorism. Candidates trying to portray themselves as the one with the most experience. Richardson says he would call on Musharraf to step down, Thompson disagrees. McCain challenges Giuliani's foreign policy experience. Article: After expressing condolences and outrage over events in Pakistan, presidential candidates turned their discussion toward whose foreign policy credentials were better. Hillary Clinton, then U.S. first lady, meets with Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan in 1995. In a campaign that had been drifting toward economic issues, the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the turmoil in Pakistan could refocus voters on who is best qualified to deal with crises in other parts of the world. ""My theme has been throughout this campaign that I am the one with experience, the knowledge and the judgment. So, perhaps it may serve to enhance those credentials,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. Locked inside a tough three-way battle for the Democratic nomination in Iowa, Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent a year calling herself the most experienced, most qualified candidate in the field. She stressed her ties with Bhutto and the tragedy of her death. ""This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime, and it certainly raises the stakes high for what we have to expect from our next president,"" the New York senator said. Watch how the assassination is resonating on the campaign trail ». Sen. Barack Obama's camp, which has spent a year pushing back on criticisms that he lacks experience, insisted they welcome the renewed talks on foreign policy and called attention to Clinton's ""yes"" vote on the Iraq war. ""She was a strong supporter of the war in Iraq which we would submit is one of the reasons why we were diverted from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Al Qaeda, who may have been players in this event today. So that's a judgment she'll have to defend,"" said Obama adviser David Axelrod. The Clinton campaign said the suggestion that her vote caused unrest in Pakistan is baseless, adding that this is a time to focus on the people of Pakistan and not politics. When asked about Axelrod's remarks late Thursday, Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that, ""This is one of those situations where Washington is putting a spin on it. ... He in no way was suggesting Hillary Clinton was somehow directly to blame for this situation."" The Illinois senator added that ""it's important for us to not look at this in terms of short-term political points scoring."" Watch the showdown on foreign policy ». But the candidates all reacted, in part because of the gravity of the event, in part because they are just days away from the January 3 Iowa caucuses. Conversation quickly moved from condolences to campaign issues. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani talked terrorism, connecting the attack in Pakistan to the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""America feels a connection because of the attacks that took place here,"" he said. McCain, who along with Giuliani scores best on national security, bluntly challenged Giuliani's foreign policy experience. Watch how the GOP candidates are reacting ». ""He did a great job post-9/11 in handling a post-crisis situation, but I don't know how that provides one the credentials to address national security issues,"" he said. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said he would call on Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf to step down. ""What is in U.S. interest is for there to be a stable, democratic Pakistan that is fighting terrorists. Right now, we have the worst of all worlds,"" he said Friday on CNN's ""American Morning."" But Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson said calling for Musharraf to step down wouldn't be a good idea. ""I hope that we as candidates out here don't start lobbying these ideas that get plenty of attention but are not very sound,"" Thompson told CNN. Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards said he called Musharraf and ""urged him to continue this democratization process."" Democratic hopeful Joe Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Bhutto's death was a ""genuine tragedy."" Watch how the Democrats are responding ». ""Ladies and gentleman, the stakes are incredibly high. They are incredibly high. If Pakistan falls into complete turmoil, martial law is declared again, you end up with a state that is being run by a dictator; ladies and gentleman that does not bode well for Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, India,"" he said. The shift in focus might not play out well for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, whose foreign policy credentials have been under a microscope since he admitted to journalists that he was unaware of a major report on Iran's nuclear weapons program. He appeared to make another minor gaffe Thursday when he seemed to suggest incorrectly that Pakistan was currently under martial law. Later Thursday, Huckabee told CNN that ""it was not that I was unaware it was suspended, two weeks ago, lifted. ...The point was, would it be reinstated, would it be placed back in? All of the aspects of martial law have not been completely lifted even now. There's still a heavy hand Musharraf has used."" If voters see a high-stakes drama in Pakistan, that could resonate at the polls. Most of the candidates said they didn't want to turn the assassination into a talking point, but it is just a week before the Iowa caucuses, and world events not only change the conversation -- they can change a campaign.

"Summary: Seven Manchester United supporters taken to hospital before game in Rome. British Embassy officials in Rome said five of the fans received stab wounds. Embassy spokeswoman said that the injuries were not thought to be serious. Article: Seven Manchester United supporters were taken to hospital after violence flared before the 1-1 Champions' League draw against Roma in Italy. Manchester United supporters were segregated inside the Olympic Stadium for the Champions tie. British Embassy officials in Rome said five fans received stab wounds while two others, including a 16-year-old boy, needed treatment for being drunk, the Press Association reported. None of the stab victims is understood to have serious injuries following the clash between the rival fans outside the Stadio Olympico. An embassy spokeswoman said: ""Seven Manchester United supporters were taken to hospital after fighting broke out on the Pont Duca d'Aosta bridge which fans cross over the river to get to the stadium. ""Five are receiving treatment for stab wounds while two others, one who was a 16-year-old boy, were understood to be drunk. ""Their injuries are not thought to be serious and most of them will be discharged in the next couple of hours. One person may be kept in overnight for observation. ""The situation in the stadium is now fine and everything is running smoothly."" The embassy had warned travelling fans beforehand not to use the Pont Duca d'Aosta bridge because it was habitually used by Roma's notorious Ultras - a following of hardcore fans. Roma coach Luciano Spalletti condemned the latest violence. ""It's difficult to give a comment on what has happened,"" said Spalletti. After watching a video replay of the ugly scenes, Spalletti added: ""These people are sick."" The trouble marked the second consecutive game between Roma and Manchester United in the Italian capital which has been marred by violence. Eighteen United fans needed hospital treatment in April after clashes on the terraces in Rome and outside the ground. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had hoped tonight's game would pass off peacefully but the British Embassy in Rome had warned supporters faced a ""real danger of attack"" by the Ultras. The 1,200 British supporters who made the journey were largely shepherded into the stadium two hours before kick-off, with clear segregation in place in the less than capacity crowd.",0
"Summary: Chester Stiles' ex-girlfriend says she's ""disgusted"" she helped him meet child. Stiles sought by police as suspect in 3-year-old girl's videotaped rape. Ex-girlfriend Tina Allen says he seemed good with kids when she dated him. Allen says the girl lived in same apartment with her children. Article: An intense manhunt was under way Monday for Chester Stiles, a 37-year old man whom police say is a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3-year-old girl four years ago. Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3-year-old girl. Also Monday, Stiles' former girlfriend told CNN she believes she put him in contact with the girl. Tina Allen said she is ""disgusted"" and ""mortified"" at her role in bringing them together. Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said Friday the girl has been found and is safe. He said the child's mother was cooperating with authorities. De Meo addressed Stiles directly: ""Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency. Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency."" Stiles' former girlfriend said she is stunned by the allegations. Watch Allen describe her first impression of Stiles ». Allen said she and Stiles had been in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years and that he was good with her children. ""He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,"" Allen said. Allen took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her 3-year-old daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. ""I'm disgusted. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, mortified,"" Allen said. ""I regret every, every step I ever took; I feel bad for the baby."" Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, told CNN he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. He said his mother and Stiles spent time together there. Todd Allen said nobody realized the child may have been abused. ""She's what you'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like,"" he said. He said he never witnessed Stiles physically assault anyone. ""But I have seen him verbally and mentally assault many people,"" Todd Allen told CNN. Looking back, Tina Allen said there were some warning signs. She said Stiles hit her once but she didn't file a police report. She said she blames herself. ""How could I not know? Why couldn't I have recognized something? Why are all these people going through this torture now because of me?"" Allen asked. Allen ended her relationship with Stiles a few months ago. She said she believes it will be difficult for police to find him. ""He will hide out in mountains if that's what it takes, he will hide out in a crowd, he'll find somebody who hasn't heard anything and stay there,"" she said. ""He has skills. He knows how to hunt, I mean hunt with a gun, a knife, a bow."" Allen said Stiles stopped by her house last week for a friendly visit before his name was linked to the videotape. She said his appearance had changed. She said his hair was longer and he had put on weight. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, is a former animal trainer, authorities said. De Meo said the FBI also is seeking him in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under 14. The man who claimed to have found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in Sunday to Nye County officials. Darren Tuck, a Nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible sentence of 10 years to life for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, according to De Meo. Tuck's attorney, Harry Kuehn, said last week on CNN's ""Nancy Grace"" that his client had been ""wracked by indecision"" as to what to do with the tape once he realized what it was.",0

Originally from California, Gadahn talks about Bush's upcoming trip to Middle East. Gadahn is on the FBI's Most Wanted List with $1 million reward for information. Article: On a videotape released Sunday, American al Qaeda member Adam Yahiye Gadahn renounces his U.S. citizenship, destroys his passport and cites U.S. President Bush's upcoming trip to the Middle East. ""American jihadist"" Adam Gadahn, originally from California, in a video released in September 2006. The 50-minute tape -- titled ""An Invitation to Reflection and Repentance"" -- was released by As Sahab, al Qaeda's video production wing and was provided to CNN by www.LauraMansfield.com, a Web site that analyzes terrorism. In it, Gadahn renounces his citizenship to protest the imprisonment of Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, a blind Egyptian Muslim leader serving a life sentence for his role in the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center; and John Walker Lindh, the American Taliban who was arrested in Afghanistan in 2001, and others. Gadahn displays his passport to the camera, rips it in half and says, ""Don't get too excited -- I don't need it to travel anyway."" Though Gadahn speaks mostly in English, he references Bush -- who is to travel this week to the Middle East -- only in Arabic. ""We raise an urgent appeal to our mujahedin brothers in the Muslim Palestine, the Arabian Peninsula in particular, and the region in general, to be prepared to receive the crusader butcher Bush on his visit to Muslim Palestine and the occupied peninsula at the beginning of January,"" he said.

The self-proclaimed American jihadist, also known as Azzam the American, is on the FBI's Most Wanted List, with a reward of up to $1 million for information leading to his capture. Gadahn was indicted in 2006 on charges of treason and offering material support for terrorism, the first American charged with treason since World War II. Gadahn, who grew up in rural California, embraced Islam in the mid-1990s and moved to Pakistan. Since October 2004 he has appeared in at least eight al Qaeda videos in which he speaks in English and praises the terrorist network.",0
"Summary: Ted Sorensen helped draft Kennedy's 1960 speech on Roman Catholicism. GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney delivers speech on faith in politics. Kennedy, Romney views on religion differ greatly, Sorensen says. Sorensen says Kennedy viewed religion as more of a private matter. Article: During the 1960 presidential election, Theodore Sorensen helped then-Sen. John F. Kennedy draft a speech addressing Kennedy's Catholicism and the separation between church and state. At the time, many questioned whether Kennedy, who would go on to become the nation's first Roman Catholic president, would be influenced by the Catholic church. Theodore Sorensen helped write John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech on Catholicism. Speaking to CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider, Sorensen discussed Kennedy's famous 1960 speech and compared it to the speech on faith in politics delivered Thursday by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who would be the first Mormon in the White House if he is elected. Question: Did Kennedy's 1960 speech win him the presidency? Sorensen: Well, he obviously didn't lose it, nor did he free the country from the curse of anti-Catholicism. The hate mail still poured into his office. The vicious picket signs were still seen out on the campaign trail, and, indeed, on Election Day. According to a University of Michigan survey, more people voted against Kennedy because of his religion than any other reason. Nevertheless, that speech, which was nationally broadcast and frequently rebroadcast, certainly took a lot of the poison out of the anti-Catholic issue and reassured all reasonable people. Watch Sorensen discuss why Kennedy gave his speech ». Q. Could President Kennedy have delivered the speech Romney gave on Thursday? Sorensen: No. Mr. Romney's position on many of the issues are very different than JFK's. JFK wanted to particularly stress that he believed in the separation between church and state. He believed that no one needed to worry about a Catholic bishop or a cardinal dictating to him as a president, and that freedom of religion included freedom for those to go to any church or not to go to any church at all. So, Romney emphasized the role of religion in public life more strongly than JFK did or would have. Q. Romney seemed to differ quite strongly with Kennedy on the privacy of religion, didn't he? Sorensen: Yes, he did. In fact, Romney felt compelled for some reason to define his personal views of Jesus Christ. Kennedy said, as you noted, his personal views of religion were totally his business and not the business of the American people. Q. Romney made the statement ""freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom."" Do you think Kennedy would have agreed with that? Sorensen: I don't think anyone would disagree strongly with that. There were some lines in the Romney speech that echoed the Kennedy speech. As an old speechwriter, I would congratulate Mr. Romney. It was a pretty good speech. I think he touched all the bases he wanted to touch. Q. Romney discussed his views of Jesus Christ, something that Kennedy avoided. Why did Kennedy avoid discussing his religious views? Sorensen: Because [Kennedy] began the speech by saying his private religious beliefs -- his relationship with God or Jesus Christ or anything else -- was not a matter of public discussion. He did not think the election should be based on -- as he said, it's not what kind of church I believe in, the question is what kind of country do I believe in. Q. Kennedy's speech in 1960 is widely viewed as being successful. Do you think Romney's speech is likely to be viewed as a success? Sorensen: I assume so. I don't think Mr. Romney should be denied the presidency because of his religion. Just as I don't think Senator [Barack] Obama should be denied because of his race. Or that Mrs. [Hillary] Clinton should be denied the presidency because of her gender. This country is in deep, serious trouble, and thoughtful citizens surely are going to make up their minds based on the major issues confronting the country and the major qualities of the candidates and not on such superficial tests as religion, race, or gender.",0

Engineers designed, electronically pre-assembled the 777 using computers. In 2005, a Boeing 777 set a new world record for distance traveled non-stop. Article: The Boeing 777 is the mainstay of many airlines' long-haul fleets and has never been involved in a fatal accident during its service history. British Airways aircrew fly the Royal Standard from the flight deck of the Boeing 777 aircraft. The aircraft first entered service on June 7, 1995, with more than 900 suppliers from 17 countries coming together to provide the more than three million parts needed in its construction, according to the Boeing Web site. Since its inaugural flight, Boeing has extended the 777 family to five commercial passenger models and a freighter version, collectively making more than two million flights. The aircraft seats between 301 and 368 passengers in a three-class configuration and can fly distances up to 17,500 kilometers. The 777 has also won a number of design awards, as well as setting a number of records and firsts. On November 9 and 10, 2005, a Boeing 777-200LR Worldliner set a new world record for distance traveled non-stop by a commercial jetliner. The 777-200LR set a record distance of 21,601 km on a route traveling eastbound from Hong Kong to London Heathrow. The flight lasted 22 hours and 42 minutes. The achievements was recognized by the U.S. National Aeronautics Association, The Federation Aeronautique Internationale and the Guinness Book of Records. The Federation eéronautique Internationale recognized the Boeing 777 in April 1997 for achieving a speed and distance record for airplanes in its size and class. The Boeing Web site claims the 777 set the ""Great Circle Distance Without Landing"" record, traveling 20,044 km, and it set the record for ""Speed Around the World, Eastbound,"" traveling at an average speed of 889 km per hour. According to Boeing the aircraft reached 500 deliveries by 2005 -- faster than any other twin-aisle commercial airplane in history. Boeing prides itself on the 777's landing gear, which it claims is the largest ever incorporated into a commercial aircraft. Each main landing gear is fitted with six wheels, while the nose gear has two.",0
"Summary: Donors pledge $7.4 billion to help build a Palestinian state. IMF offers to monitor Palestinians' promised reforms. Palestinian aid conference organizers hail event as a new beginning. Tony Blair says donors need to be repaid with steps to create a lasting settlement. Article: A major donors conference to raise funds for the Palestinians has gone beyond expectations, with donors pledging $7.4 billion to help build a Palestinian state, organizers said Monday. France's Nicolas Sarkoxy, left, welcomes Tony Blair and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Monday. Other delegations at the Paris meeting are offering aid in kind, such as the International Monetary Fund, which said it would provide monitoring of the Palestinians' promised reforms to reassure donors that their money would be used efficiently. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad called the pledge of money a ""vote of confidence"" in the Palestinians. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the support of donors needed to be repaid in the coming months with steps to create a lasting settlement. ""Over the next few months, we have to show people our capability of making the difference on the ground,"" said Blair, who co-hosted the conference in his new role as envoy for the so-called Middle East Quartet of the United Nations, United States, European Union and Russia. The Paris conference focuses on short-term priorities for the Palestinians, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said those include providing immediate support for the Palestinian people -- particularly those living in Gaza -- and stabilizing the Palestinian economy. Watch CNN's Jim Bittermann explain the conference's aims ». It follows on the heels of last month's peace talks in the U.S. in which Israeli and Palestinian leaders vowed to negotiate a final-status agreement by the end of 2008. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said France would donate $300 million, and the United States was expected to pledge more than $500 million. Central to the Palestinians' request for aid is a three-year reform plan that the Palestinians prepared for the conference. The plan, which covers 2008 to 2010, centers on economic development and government reform. The World Bank praised the plan, calling it a ""promising effort"" to link policy-making, planning and budgeting. But in a report released Monday, the World Bank pointed out the reforms would succeed in helping Palestinians only if they were accompanied by both donor aid and Israeli actions. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni spoke of taking such actions, saying Israel is committed to meeting its responsibilities under the Middle East road map, especially regarding the contentious issue of settlements. Livni said an agreement had been reached with the European Union to provide training for Palestinian police. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinians didn't lack will or determination but resources. He promised donors that Palestinians would work hard to create a modern country in control of its security. ""We are at a historic stage today, and the destiny of our region and peace depends on this,"" said Abbas, who requested the conference be held. Abbas earlier had requested $5.6 billion in aid over the next three years. Sarkozy repeatedly told the conference he is a ""friend of Israel,"" but he urged the Israeli government to withdraw troops from the West Bank, freeze settlements, reopen institutions in East Jerusalem and help the isolated population of Gaza. The World Bank's report detailed the challenges facing attempts to revive the Palestinian economy, which has become almost totally dependent on foreign aid. The Palestinian Authority is the largest employer for its people, as private-sector jobs dry up. The World Bank said wages for public sector employees account for almost half of the government's expenditures. With public investment having nearly ceased, the World Bank said, almost all government funds in the past two years have been used to pay salaries and cover operating costs. Staffing also has gone up in the health and education sectors, the World Bank said, leaving little money for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, teaching and learning materials, and overall maintenance. The World Bank said the reforms would only succeed if they include Gaza, where 40 percent of the Palestinian population lives. Gaza has been subject to a wide-ranging crackdown since Hamas took power in June; its borders are closed, fuel imports are restricted, and there are strict limits on all imported goods. ""The continued entry of humanitarian goods has mitigated the impact of the closures on Gaza's population, but has not been sufficient to offset the collapse of the private sector there,"" the World Bank report said. Unemployment across the Palestinian territories stands at nearly 23 percent, the World Bank said, but in Gaza, 33 percent of the population is out of a job. It predicted the figures would rise if the restrictions continue. A report Monday from the U.N. Development Program spotlighted the pressures on private Palestinian businesses, especially in Gaza, where it said the private sector ""is on the verge of collapse with no scope for recovery"" unless Israeli restrictions are lifted. CNN's Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.",0

Tom Lantos represented his Northern California district for 14 terms. He died at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, surrounded by his wife, Annette, daughters Annette and Katrina and many of his 18 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, according to his office. Lantos' life was ""defined by courage, optimism, and unwavering dedication to his principles and to his family,"" said his wife, Annette, his childhood sweetheart, in a statement the House of Representatives released. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday that she was ""quite devastated"" by the death of her ""dear, dear friend."" She called him ""a true American hero"" and ""the genuine article."" ""He's going to be really, really missed,"" she said. Rice described Lantos as ""the embodiment of what it meant to have one's freedom denied and then to find it and to insist that Americans stand for spreading the benefits of freedom and prosperity to others."" Lantos, who was serving his 14th term in the House, was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in December. He announced last month that he would not seek a new term. ""It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and a fighter in the anti-Nazi underground could have received an education, raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of Congress,"" Lantos said in a statement at the time. ""I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country."" Watch Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid remember Lantos ». The lawmaker is the only Holocaust survivor to have served in Congress. The Hungarian-born Lantos came to the United States in 1947 after surviving a forced-labor camp in his Nazi-allied homeland. He escaped and was sheltered in a Budapest safe house set up by Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who was credited with saving tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II. He arrived in the United States after being awarded an academic scholarship to study, according to his congressional Web site. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from the University of Washington in Seattle and later earned a doctorate in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, the site said. As a lawmaker, Lantos was an outspoken human rights advocate. He supported the 2002 congressional resolution that authorized President Bush to launch the invasion of Iraq but later became an outspoken critic of the conflict. He was the latest of more than a dozen members to announce plans to leave the House at the end of the year, most of them Republicans. His San Francisco-area district is solidly Democratic, and he won re-election with more than three-quarters of the vote in 2006. ""Chairman Lantos will be remembered as a man of uncommon integrity and sincere moral conviction -- and a public servant who never wavered in his pursuit of a better, freer and more religiously tolerant world,"" House Republican Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri said in a statement.",0
"Summary: All vehicles banned in city of Amara through Thursday, provincial governor says. Death toll continues to rise as Interior Ministry reports 151 wounded. State television reports that many of the casualties are women, children. Amara has been scene of fighting between rival Shiite factions vying for power. Article: All vehicles were banned from the largely Shiite city of Amara Wednesday after three car bombs ripped through a market district, killing at least 27 people and wounded 151, officials said. Iraqis gather at the site of a car bomb in the city of Amara on Wednesday. The blasts detonated in close succession in a commercial area in the central section of Amara, the provincial capital of Maysan province and a city that has been the scene of fighting between rival Shiite factions. Baghdad was also hit by violence on Wednesday. A car bomb there killed five Iraqi civilians and wounded 15 others, an Interior Ministry official told CNN. The incident occurred in a Christian section of the largely Shiite New Baghdad district. Maj. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf, head of the Interior Ministry's National Command Center, confirmed the casualty figures in the Amara bombing. He and a committee were headed to Amara to investigate the incident. He said the ministry fired the city's police chief in the aftermath of the attack. Maysan Gov. Adil Muhawdar Radhi announced the vehicle ban, which he said will be in place through Thursday. He said additional security measures have been put in place in the city. The first bomb, in a car parked in a commercial area, detonated about 9:30 a.m. As onlookers gathered, the second one exploded in a nearby garage a few minutes later. It was followed by a third bomb in the garage a few minutes after that. Ambulances and police raced to the scene. News footage showed burning vehicles and black smoke, and the clothing of victims scattered beside pools of blood. Iraqi state television showed hospitals packed with people. Al-Forat, an Iraqi TV station affiliated with the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq political movement, reported that most of the casualties were women and children. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, in a statement, denounced the attack. ""The targeting of unarmed civilians today in the markets of Amara town by car bombs -- that is another ring in the chain of conspiracy against the Iraqi people that is aiming to destabilize the security and stability in this province,"" which he said endured cruelty under the Saddam Hussein regime. Maysan, which borders Iran, has been under Iraqi security control much of this year after control was transferred from the British military. It was not immediately known who was responsible for the blasts, but the violence is a reminder of the intense fighting between the Mehdi Army -- the militia of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr -- and the Badr Brigade, the militia of the SICI, which condemned the bombings and blamed ""Saddamists and Takfiris."" The two movements are bitter rivals and have been in the middle of local power struggles in Iraq's southern provinces and other Shiite areas. Watch how Shiite groups have been vying for power ». Britain, which has been in command of the south since the Iraqi war began, has been working to withdraw its troops from the region, which, despite this latest violence, has always been more stable than Baghdad and other outlying regions. Britain's Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that the British military will transfer security control of the southern province of Basra to Iraqi forces on Sunday. Ali al-Dabbagh, Iraq's government spokesman, confirmed the date and said the Maysan attacks will not affect the handover. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Kenya's 36 million population made up of around 40 tribal groups. President Mwai Kibaki belongs to the influential and powerful Kikuyu tribe. Challenger Raila Odinga's Luo tribe forms sizeable group in west, Nairobi slums. Kenya dogged by poverty, violent crime, corruption, simmering ethnic tensions. Article: Kenya has enjoyed a reputation as one of East Africa's most stable nations since achieving independence from the UK in 1963. Residents of the Mathare slum in Nairobi shout at demonstrators during violent clashes. But a booming tourism industry, impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to The Economist -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty, violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions. Tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in Kenya, with the country's 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes. Last week's election pitched incumbent President Mwai Kibaki, a member of Kenya's largest Kikuyu tribe, against opposition leader Raila Odinga of the Luo tribe. The Kikuyu make up about 22 percent of Kenya's population. Mostly originating from Kenya's central highlands, the Kikuyu have long wielded strong economic and political power within the country. Kenya's first post-independence leader, Jomo Kenyatta, president from 1964 until 1978, was a Kikuyu. Kibaki, a government minister from 1965 until winning power as head of the Party of National Unity in elections five years ago, also enjoys the support of Kenyatta's successor, Daniel Arap Moi, a member of the Kalenjin tribe who ruled Kenya for 24 years from 1978 to 2002. The Luo make up around 13 percent of the population, mostly in the west of the country. But they also form a sizeable community in some of Nairobi's most notorious slums, such as the vast Kibera shantytown where Odinga enjoys strong support and where some of this week's fiercest violence has occurred. Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement is also backed by many members of the Luhya tribe, Kenya's second largest ethnic group, after Odinga promised to make a leading Luhya his deputy if elected. This week's violence came as election officials declared victory for Kibaki with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for Odinga in the closest presidential vote in Kenyan electoral history. But the result has been questioned by international election observers, throwing the country's political future into doubt. Kibaki's first election success in 2002 -- declared free and fair by international observers -- was hailed at the time as a step forward for Kenyan democracy. However, his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft.",0
"Summary: Manji says Bhutto disappointed some because she adhered to feudal politics. During Bhutto's time in office, writer says, she did not defy anti-rape laws. Pakistan must ""transcend both trauma and tribalism,"" Manji says. Article: In the days after Benazir Bhutto's assassination, it will be tempting to reach two hasty conclusions: that she was Pakistan's last great hope and that her geo-politically crucial country has revealed itself to be inherently hopeless. Irshad Manji is a controversial Muslim feminist and activist from Toronto, Canada. On each front, I take a different view. While far more liberal and democratic than Gen. Musharraf, Bhutto disappointed moderate, modern Pakistanis with her adherence to feudal politics. Writing to me through my Web site, American feminists say they are ""aching"" over the loss of ""our dear, sweet, brave Benazir."" I understand the sentiment. But ""brave"" is not the word used by Pakistani women from whom I've also heard. They're hurting more over Bhutto's ""self-imposed"" conformity. ""She never realized her potential,"" a woman from Karachi tells me. ""And not because she was killed but because when she had the chance, she did not effectively challenge the backward mindset that has now led to her demise."" For example, during Bhutto's time in office, Pakistan didn't defy the anti-female rape and adultery laws. Those notorious ordinances, known as Hudood, took their inspiration from tribal politics masquerading as Islam. Watch Manji argue on CNN why Bhutto's legacy is mixed ». Imagine the opportunity: Bhutto could have championed a purer faith by tackling corrupt cultural practices. In so doing, she might have created allies among conservatives, who can be persuaded that although Islam is God-given, culture is man-made. Last year, a media campaign to strike down the Hudood Ordinances achieved this fine balance. But not because of her. And that, say many progressive Pakistanis, amputates Bhutto's legacy. The fact that cruel laws against women can be publicly debated at all should suggest that Pakistan has hope anyway. An exceptional leader can tap into it. History tells us so. There was a time when Pakistan's democratic politicians stuck it to the feudal fanatics. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was once heckled by a religious fundamentalist. ""You drink alcohol!"" shouted the critic. ""Yes,"" retorted the elder Bhutto, ""but I don't drink the blood of the people!"" His response captured the spirit of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founder. In 1947, Jinnah exuded high hopes for his people: ""You are free. You are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques, or to any other place of worship in the State of Pakistan. ""You may belong to any religion or caste or creed. That has nothing to do with the business of the state. We are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens of one state... You will find that in due course of time, Hindus will cease to be Hindus and Muslims will cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense ... but in the political sense as citizens of the state."" Jinnah meant every word of his unconventional vision because he, himself, lived as a maverick. He adored his non-Muslim wife, and his sister often appeared with him on the campaign trail. Her visibility attested to Islam's embrace of women as partners of men. In the months ahead, the people of Pakistan will need to recall Jinnah's vision. It may be of comfort know that they're not alone. Countless Americans are now asking about their founders' intentions, desperate to re-discover the better angels of their country after eight years of George W. Bush. Still, Pakistan must avoid America's enduring mistake. The United States lapsed into profound divisiveness following the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Many would argue that today's politics of polarization can be traced to the unresolved trauma of the King-Kennedy murders. For Pakistan, it's high time to transcend both trauma and tribalism. I pray that in death, Benazir Bhutto will be the catalyst for a deeper democracy than she ever advocated in life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.",0
"Summary: Sources say pardon unrelated to Hajj nor subsequent Eid al-Adha. Justice minister says king felt pardon in best interests of Saudi people. Report: King Abdullah pardons rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes. A Saudi court had ruled the 19-year-old had an ""illegitimate relationship"" Article: Saudi King Abdullah has pardoned a rape victim who had been sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison in a case that sparked international attention, a Saudi newspaper has reported. The case cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic law. Al-Jazirah newspaper quoted a Saudi Justice Ministry official saying King Abdullah issued a royal pardon Monday -- the same day that the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, begins in Saudi Arabia. The victim's husband told CNN he has not received an official letter regarding her pardon, but considers it to be legitimate since it was announced in an official Saudi newspaper. He thanked King Abdullah for the pardon, saying: ""This fatherly care and noble gesture will help (in) lifting the emotional and psychological stress and suffering that our family has been enduring."" ""This is not something new because we know that the King was always generous in dealing with his people and the entire world,"" the husband said. ""This week, we have two holidays to celebrate; the Eid and this great news of the pardon."" Saudi sources told CNN that the king's pardon was not related to the beginning of the Hajj nor the Eid al-Adha festival that follows, which is normally when the Saudi monarch issues amnesty for prisoners. Watch how Arab media is reporting the story. ». Saudi Arabia's Justice Minister Abdullah Bin Mohammad al-Sheikh told al-Jazirah newspaper that the king felt the pardon would be in the best interests of the Saudi people, and the decision did not reflect any lack of confidence in the Saudi justice system. The White House welcomed King Abdullah's decision, but National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe stressed that ""this is obviously a matter for the Saudi Arabians and King Abdullah."" A Saudi court ruled the 19-year-old had an ""illegitimate relationship"" with a man who was not her husband, and that she was raped after she and the man were discovered in a ""compromising situation, her clothes on the ground."" The rape took place in Qatif in March 2006 when the woman was engaged to be married. The case has drawn international attention, provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under strict Islamic law in Saudi Arabia. The woman was meeting with a man -- described by the woman's attorney as a former friend from whom she was retrieving a photograph -- when they both were abducted last March. Seven men, convicted of abducting the pair and raping her, were sentenced from two to nine years in prison. Abdul Rahman al-Lahim, the lawyer who represented the woman, faced a disciplinary hearing for ""insulting the Supreme Judicial Council and disobeying the rules and regulations"" of the judiciary. The hearing has been postponed. The woman's husband has been outspoken in his support for his wife. He called a Lebanese TV show to defend her, when a former Saudi judge claimed on the program that she ""spoil(ed) their marital bed"" by meeting an unrelated male ""in secret"" and admitted her guilt. Al-Lahim has said he hopes the case changes the Saudi justice system. ""We want to highlight the rape crimes in Saudi Arabia and the way they are handled and sentenced in court,"" he added. ""This is a new era for all of us."" He said that the rape case had elicited a fierce response, including calls for his beheading. U.S. President George W. Bush said last week that King Abdullah ""knows our position loud and clear"" on the case. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery.

"Summary: Claims by Diana's butler that he knew ""secret"" about her trashed by coroner. Paul Burrell asked to testify about the last letter the late princess gave him. Coroner revealed Burrell's ""secret"" was Diana planned to buy property abroad. But coroner said the revelation is ""fairly and squarely in the public domain"" Article: Claims by Diana's former butler that he knew a mysterious ""secret"" about the late princess have been trashed by the coroner in her inquest. Diana's former butler has given conflicting information at the enquiry into her death. The coroner said the information was already in the public domain and some of it was even mentioned in one of Paul Burrell's own books. Considered the first star witness of the inquest, Burrell's appearance Tuesday was delayed after the coroner asked him to retrieve the last letter the princess gave him. Monday, the ex-butler -- once described by the princess as ""her rock"" -- told the inquest the letter contained a ""secret,"" which he claimed he could not remember. After returning to London from his home in northern England Tuesday, Burrell said the letter was not there, but at his home in Florida. He then handed the coroner a note that he said contained the supposed secret. The coroner revealed that what Burrell referred to was that Diana was planning to buy property to live in part of the time and that the location may have been in the United States or South Africa. The coroner said the revelation is ""fairly and squarely in the public domain"" and that some of the information appeared in Burrell's book ""The Way We Were."" Explaining the apparent discrepancies in his testimony, Burrell said he was confused by the cross-examination, which he described as ""horrid"" and ""disgraceful."" The questioning of the former butler is expected to continue Wednesday. Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, died in a Paris tunnel in the early hours of August 31, 1997, along with their driver, Henri Paul. They had driven away from the Ritz Hotel in a black Mercedes with paparazzi chasing behind. There has been speculation that the couple had planned a big announcement the night they died. Photographers have testified they had heard rumors Diana would say she was getting engaged to Fayed or having a baby. Watch report on claims about Diana's marriage plans ». Burrell did not take the stand until Tuesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, the inquest heard from Diana's former lawyer, who said the princess had claimed Queen Elizabeth was planning to abdicate in April 1996 and allow Prince Charles to be king. Maggie Rae said at the inquest that Diana also believed there was a plot to seriously injure her in an accident. Rae said the claims came at a meeting with her legal team at Kensington Palace in which the princess also made clear her belief that the succession of the English crown should skip a generation to her son, William. The morning's evidence also heard that Britain's top police officer had advised the queen against allowing Diana to go on holiday with Mohamed al Fayed, the father of Dodi. In a note from Chief Superintendent Dai Davies, head of the Royal Protection Squad, that was read out to the court, it was stated that he and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon believed that the planned holiday was ""unwise."" Al Fayed -- a successful businessman and owner of the London luxury store Harrods -- was considered a controversial figure at the time. Diana defied the advice and went on the trip. It was during this holiday on the tycoon's luxury yacht in the French resort of St. Tropez that she met Dodi Fayed. During her testimony, Rae also gave an insight into the princess's lifestyle, which she described as ""odd"" and ""lonely."" She said she did not believe Diana's claims of a conspiracy against her. ""I remember one occasion when she told me about her weekend and she had been alone in those rather silent set of apartments. She had heated her own food in the microwave,"" Rae told the court. ""I thought she lived in a very odd environment. I thought she was quite lonely."" CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Paul Burrell, Princess Diana's former butler, gives evidence at inquest. Describes phone call in which Diana's mother called her daughter""a whore"" Burrell says Queen Elizabeth's husband was not involved in Diana's death. Also claims that Diana told him: ""I need marriage like a bad rash"" Article: Princess Diana's relationships with two Muslim men provoked an outburst from her mother, who called her daughter ""a whore"", Paul Burrell, the princess's former butler, told an inquest Monday. Diana once referred to her former butler Paul Burrell as ""my rock."" Burrell, who returned to Britain from his home in Florida to give evidence, was the first star witness of the London inquest, now in its fourth month. His role as confidant to Diana, who died in a Paris car crash on August 31, 1997, along with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and hotel security chief Henri Paul, meant his testimony was eagerly anticipated. Burrell, whom the late princess once called ""my rock,"" cast doubt on whether Diana was ready to marry Fayed. According to Burrell, the princess was still ""holding a candle"" for former boyfriend and heart surgeon Hasnat Khan -- who she called ""her soulmate"" -- when she started dating Fayed ""on the rebound."" Burrell told the inquest that Diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in June 1997 with her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with Muslim men. ""She called the princess a 'whore' and she said that she was messing around with 'effing Muslim men' and she was 'disgraceful' and said some very nasty things,"" Burrell said. He agreed that, as a result of such calls Diana, decided not to talk to her mother again. The inquest, which began in October and is expected to last another two or three months, aims to uncover the facts surrounding the deaths of the Princess and Dodi and determine their cause of death -- whether by accident or otherwise. Asked earlier in the day if he believed that Fayed was ""the one,"" Burrell said ""no, I did not have that impression."" He also cast doubt on claims that Fayed and Diana were engaged or on the cusp of engagement, saying: ""I find that difficult to believe."" Asked to explain himself, Burrell said: ""Because this was only a 30-day relationship and the princess had just finished a long-term relationship with someone (Khan) she cared deeply about. I knew that because I was there and I saw it."" Diana's 18-month relationship with Khan ended around the same time she started seeing Fayed in July 1997. Burrell said Diana had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with Khan might take place, given that Khan is Muslim. Watch report on claims about Diana's marriage plans. ». Khan had not proposed to the princess, Burrell said, adding that Khan was ""the man she loved more than any other."" He said he spoke to Diana about the possibility that Fayed would give her a ring shortly before her death. Burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand, rather than the left, as is customary with engagement rings. ""I need marriage like a bad rash,"" Burrell claimed Diana told him. Last month at the inquest Lady Annabel Goldsmith, a friend of Diana, said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage ""like a rash on my face."" Burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring, as the Fayed family has maintained. Fayed family spokesman Michael Cole testified last week that Dodi's father, Mohamed Al Fayed, was certain the couple had planned to marry. Lawyers at the inquest asked Burrell whether he knew whether a special announcement had been planned for the Monday following the fatal car crash. There has been speculation the couple planned to announce special news, such as an engagement. But Burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan. He said he had actually looked at Diana's schedule for that day and found only mundane items, and nothing to indicate she planned a special announcement. Burrell also told the inquest he did not believe Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's, husband was involved in Diana's death. Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi and the owner of Harrods department store, has long claimed that senior members of the royal family -- specifically the queen's husband, Prince Philip -- ordered the pair be murdered. He also claims that Diana was pregnant at the time of her death. But Burrell said that he knew Prince Philip very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths. ""I can tell you that is not Prince Philip's nature, "" he said. ""Plus the princess was the mother of his grandchildren. Why would he want to harm her? It's not possible."" The inquest has seen and heard about correspondence which Prince Philip sent to Diana, with some witnesses claiming that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters. But other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed, ""Pa."" Burrell explained that Philip could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks. ""Prince Philip doesn't mix his words,"" Burrell said. ""He says it as it is, but he is not a nasty man. Prince Philip isn't known for his diplomacy. He was fond of the princess."" Burrell worked for the British royals for 21 years and became close to Diana after her separation from Prince Charles. He has written two books about his time with the princess. In his second book, Burrell told of a letter from Diana which indicated she feared for her life. The princess wrote that Prince Charles planned ""'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury."" One of Diana's close friends, however, testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged. Lucia Flecha de Lima said on December 18 that Burrell was capable of imitating the princess's handwriting. Lawyers questioned Burrell about the date of the letter. Burrell said it was written in October 1996, two months, after Diana and Charles divorced -- yet the letter refers to Charles as ""my husband."" Burrell responded that Diana always referred to Charles that way, even after the divorce. The inquest has revealed that Diana was a prolific letter-writer who also received a lot of correspondence. Witnesses, including Burrell, recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk, with the more important ones stored in a special box. Burrell testified that after Diana's death, her mother, Frances Shand-Kidd, worked every day for a week shredding the papers from Diana's desk. He said he expressed concern about the shredding during a meeting he had with the queen on December 19, 1997. It was at this meeting that Queen Elizabeth told Burrell: ""There are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge."" That comment, which has been widely reported, was meant to warn him to be careful, Burrell said, and was not a warning about any one person or group of people. At the same meeting Burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of Diana's belongings to keep safe. The details of the conversation emerged when Burrell stood trial for their alleged theft in 2002, causing the case against him to collapse.

"Summary: Bush: U.S., Turkey and Iraq must unite against PKK Kurdish separatists. Iraqi Kurds are critical of both PKK and air attacks against them. Turkey bombed alleged PKK sites in northern Iraq over the weekend. PKK has spent 20 years fighting for autonomy in Turkey; uses Iraq as a base. Article: U.S., Turkish and Iraqi leaders all held talks Monday about Kurdish rebels using northern Iraq as a launchpad for cross-border attacks into Turkey. Turkish troops patrol near the border with Iraq on Monday. President Bush chatted by phone with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while separately two senior Iraq national government figures met with the head of the country's Kurdish region. The diplomatic moves came after Turkish warplanes pounded Kurdish separatist targets in northern Iraq on Saturday and Sunday as well as last week. Bush and Erdogan talked about the dangers of the Kurdish separatist rebels along the Turkish-Iraqi border, the White House confirmed. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said they discussed their common efforts to fight terrorism, and the importance of the United States, Turkey and Iraq working together to confront the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Bush has vowed to help Turkey fight PKK rebels. The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey, with some of its attacks launched from inside northern Iraq. The United States and European Union consider the group a terrorist organization. Last week, Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Nabi Sensoy, said his country's maneuvers against Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq were based on intelligence provided by the United States. In the Kurdish Iraq city of Sulaimaniya, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, who is Kurdish, and Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is Sunni Arab, met with Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani. Iraqi Kurdish officials, while critical of the PKK, have denounced the Turkish bombing campaign. Last week, Barzani snubbed visiting U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in protest of the attacks. ""We have vehemently condemned the bombardment. The bombing targeted safe and secure areas and innocent people. Several people were either killed or wounded,"" Barzani said on Monday at a press conference with the others. ""We held consultations with President Jalal Talabani and we will continue our consultations with other concerned parties to put an end to these aggressions and put to an end the shelling of villages."" The three Iraqi officials also dealt with national unity. They signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" to deepen relations further with their three parties: Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party and al-Hashimi's Iraqi Islamic Party, a Sunni Arab entity.

"Summary: Top seed Andy Roddick reaches last eight of ATP tournament in San Jose. The American defeats Delray Beach winner Kei Nishikori of Japan 6-2 6-4. Second seed James Blake also advances but third seed Tommy Haas is out. Article: Top-seed Andy Roddick easily defeated Delray Beach winner Kei Nishikori of Japan 6-2 6-4 in the headline match at the ATP tournament in San Jose on Thursday night. A pumped up Roddick needed little over an hour to dispatch teenager Nishikori. Roddick needed just 63 minutes to defeat the 18-year-old Japanese who won his first ATP title on Sunday and was on an eight-match winning run. But American number one Roddick imposed his quality from the start by taking a commanding 3-0 lead and breaking Nishikori's serve before the youngster won a game. Roddick, who has won twice in San Jose, repeated the break later in a feisty opening set which came to a head in the seventh game. Roddick barked at the young player as they exchanged shots at the net. Nishikori held his cool, did not respond, and just walked away. ""I didn't understand a word he said,"" Nishikori said. But when pressed he acknowledged that he did in fact understand what Roddick had shouted at him but just did not want to repeat it before the press. But Roddick had no trouble repeating what he had said. ""I told him to stick me with it the next time. I just let him know that he needs to finish it. I had no problem with it. But it was a monologue."" Roddick duly rounded off the set in the next game and broke Nishikori's service in the fourth game of the second only for his youthful opponent to break straight back. But as Nishikori served at 4-5 to stay in the tournament he made two crucial errors. He missed an easy slam shot that would have given him the advantage at deuce and then saw his saw his volley go wide that gave Roddick the match. ""I made too many easy mistakes,"" Nishikori said. ""I didn't take advantage of the many chances I had. But overall I was happy with the way I played."" In the early evening match, James Blake, beaten by Nishikori in the Delray Beach final, overcame first-serve problems to beat Jesse Levine 6-4 6-4 to move onto the quarterfinals. The second-seeded New Yorker, ranked ninth in the world, will face Robby Ginepri in the quarterfinals. ""I thought I played well,"" Blake said. ""I felt comfortable and although I had a slow start I was able to put pressure on Jesse."" In afternoon matches, John Isner beat third-seeded German Tommy Haas 4-6 7-6 6-3 to advance to the quarterfinals. Isner, the ATP Tour's second-tallest player at six-foot-nine, will next face Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. Haas, ranked 26th in the world, was three match points from winning the second set in a tiebreaker before the 106th-ranked Isner rallied to win. Fifth-seeded Mardy Fish also advanced, beating Germany's Denis Gremelmayr 6-7 6-3 6-3 to make the quarterfinals for the second week in a row. Fish will face Roddick in the quarterfinals.

"Summary: Several Marines are the focus of 2004 Falluja civilian death investigation. Allegations from former Marine called ""credible"" Sources: Naval Criminal Investigative Services conducting the probe. Article: Several Marines who were involved in the November 2004 offensive in Falluja, Iraq, are now the focus of an investigation into allegations that civilians were intentionally killed during the operation, several Pentagon officials have confirmed. Members of the 1st U.S. Marines Expeditionary Force operate in Falluja, Iraq, in November of 2006. No one has been charged in the probe, which is based on what one official told CNN were ""credible allegations"" from a former Marine. That Marine volunteered the information during an employment polygraph test administered by the U.S. Secret Service. Several sources familiar with the probe say the Naval Criminal Investigative Service is conducting the investigation. The allegations first surfaced on a Web site, defendourmarines.com, posted by Nathaniel Helms, a military journalist who wrote a book about the Marines in Falluja. The Web posting includes an account from a Marine who alleges eight captured Iraqis were gunned down following a firefight. The weeklong anti-insurgent offensive in Falluja began on November 7, 2004. It was called Operation New Dawn, and it sparked intense fighting involving airstrikes and house-to-house searches. There were reports of civilians being killed in the crossfire at that time. The allegations are the latest involving Marines and civilian deaths in Iraq. Seven Marines and a Navy medic were charged with killing an Iraqi civilian in Hamdaniya in April 2006. One Marine will serve eight years in a plea deal; another Marine withdrew his guilty plea, saying he acted under orders. Four Marines were charged with murder in the 2005 killings of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha. Four officers are accused of failing to investigate and report the deaths properly. Haditha was a target of Marine operations to root out insurgents. Both U.S. military law and international law of armed conflict prohibit the killing of unarmed captured prisoners, whether or not they are combatants.",0

Civil defense officials say more than 10,000 families have been affected. Ecuador's president declares state of emergency, orders army, police to help. Article: At least 10 people have died and thousands have been left homeless after torrential rains inundated large parts of Ecuador, officials said Thursday. A man grabs on to a piece of wood as a boat passes him on a flooded street this week in Puerto Inca, Ecuador. Authorities said the rains, which began a week ago, were the worst in a quarter century. Civil defense officials said more than 10,000 families have been affected. Los Ríos -- north of Guayaquil -- was the hardest hit of nine provinces affected, civil defense officials said. In Los Ríos province, five people died when an ambulance drove into a hole at the side of a street at dawn Thursday. A newborn boy, his parents, a doctor and a driver were killed. Streets also were flooded in the capital of Quito. Watch the scenes of devastation in Ecuador ». On Wednesday, President Rafael Correa declared a state of emergency and ordered 2,000 members of the army and the police to help rescue workers. Correa increased by $25 million the $10 million he already had allocated for the emergency efforts. He also directed another $88 million to municipalities. Once the crisis has eased, an emergency fund will give seed and fertilizer to help farmers whose fields were washed away, Ecuador's government said. There also have been reports of livestock drowning. Cristina Medina, a spokeswoman for the Ecuadorean Red Cross, said provinces most heavily affected were along the Pacific coast, where drinking water was often in short supply. In some towns, high waters forced entire neighborhoods to evacuate, Medina said.",0
"Summary: Italian tennis players Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali banned by the ATP. The pair have been suspended for betting on matches, although not their own. Starace suspended for six weeks while Bracciali is banned for three months. Article: Italian tennis players Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali have been banned by the ATP for betting on matches. Top Italian player Potito Starace has been suspended for six weeks for betting on matches. The country's top player Starace -- 31st in the ATP rankings -- has been suspended for six weeks from January 1 and fined $30,000 (20,890 euros) for making five bets totalling around 90 euros two years ago. Bracciali, world ranked 258, has been banned for three months and fined $20,000 (13,930 euros) for making around 50 five-euro bets between 2004 and 2005. The Italian Tennis Federation (FIT) confirmed the news on its website, www.federtennis.it. However, they denounced the penalties as disproportionate, saying the players never bet on their own matches. ""Injustice is done,"" the statement said. ""These penalties are absolutely, excessively severe compared to the magnitude of the violations carried out by the two players."" The federation said the two were not aware of the ATP's betting regulations, and that they stopped placing the bets as soon as they learned it was against the rules. Another Italian player, Alessio Di Mauro, became the first player sanctioned under the ATP's new anti-corruption rules when he received a nine-month ban in November, also for betting on matches. Starace and Bracciali said they were scapegoats for a larger match-fixing scandal.""It's disgusting,"" said the 26-year-old Starace. ""The ATP doesn't know where to turn. It's all a joke."" Bracciali said the two had been ""sacrificed."" ""That's why they came after us,"" the 29-year-old said. ""We are not champions and we don't count in the upper echelons."" ATP officials could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Concerns about match-fixing have risen since August, when an online betting company reported unusual betting patterns during a match between fourth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina. The company, Betfair, voided all bets and the ATP has been investigating. Davydenko, who retired while trailing in the third set, denies wrongdoing. Since then, several players have said that they had been approached with offers to fix matches in exchange for money.",0
"Summary: Dodi Fayed's bodyguard says can't remember crash that killed Princess Diana. Trevor Rees received anonymous threatening phone calls, letters after crash. Princess Diana, boyfriend Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul all died in accident. Rees was a bodyguard employed by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed Al Fayed. Article: The sole survivor of the crash that killed Princess Diana has told a court he still cannot remember the incident but does not support the conspiracy theories surrounding it. Bodyguard Trevor Rees and the back of Princess Diana's head are seen shortly before the car crash. Bodyguard Trevor Rees, formerly known as Trevor Rees-Jones, was the front-seat passenger in the Mercedes that carried Diana, her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul. He sustained serious injuries in the August 31, 1997 crash and testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident, threatening him to keep quiet. He said the caller told him to keep quiet, saying, ""We know who you are, we know where you are, and we know where you live."" Rees said he didn't take the calls or letters seriously. A lawyer also asked Rees about a supposed encounter with a woman in which he told her, ""If I remember, they're going to kill me."" Rees said he didn't recall the conversation and found it unlikely he ever made the remark. Rees, who still has a visible scar from the accident over his left eye, told the court he remembers nothing new about the crash, which, he has said, was an accident. He has said the last thing he remembers that night was leaving the Ritz Hotel in Paris, and that his next memory is more than a week later, in his hospital bed, when his parents told him everyone else in the car was dead. Rees suffered major injuries to his lower jaw, the base of his brain, and his pulmonary system and has had several surgeries and hospitalizations, some of which al Fayed paid for. Rees also testified that he did not support the allegations by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed al Fayed, that British security services were behind the crash. He denied the security services paid him to change his story. At the time of the crash, Rees was working for al Fayed's security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Fayed. He was also protecting the princess because she was Fayed's companion on the trip. He no longer works on al Fayed's security team. Rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down, largely because he does into support al Fayed's conspiracy theories about the crash. ""I am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all,"" Rees testified. ""All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it."" In 2000, Rees published a book, ""The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor,"" offering his account of the events surrounding the crash. He said al Fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book's publication in England. Rees told CNN he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew, but also to counter al Fayed's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident. Rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills. During the morning session, Rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash, but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories. In the first, Rees said, he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently Diana -- calling out, ""Dodi"" from the back seat of the car. In the second flashback, Rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car. Lawyer Ian Burnett then read from a letter written by Al Fayed to Lord Stevens, who investigated the crash for the British police. In the letter, Al Fayed says Rees is lying about losing his memory. ""He knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress,"" Al Fayed wrote, alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot. Rees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss: ""I have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel, that's my last true memory."" Rees also said claims the couple visited a jeweler's in Monte Carlo to buy an engagement ring in late August 1997 were untrue. British authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances. A judge, who is also called a coroner, holds hearings to determine how the person died, but he will not determine blame or apportion guilt. Although Diana and Dodi Fayed died in Paris, a British coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to Britain. The inquest does not involve driver Henri Paul because his body remained in France. British authorities had to wait to begin the inquest until after French authorities concluded their investigation, which lasted from August 1997 to late 2003. The inquest then began but immediately adjourned so that British police could do their own report, which was needed for the British inquest. The British police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in December 2006. The inquest then resumed in October 2007 and is expected to last four to six months.

"Summary: Joshua, 12, ""happy to be home. ... I didn't think we were going to make it"" Family sought shelter from snow in culvert, warmed each other's frostbitten feet. Frederick Dominguez and his 3 children set out Sunday to cut Christmas tree. More than 80 people searched for them Tuesday in heavy snow. Article: Stranded in the snowy California woods for three days after losing their way while searching for a Christmas tree, a father and his three children fashioned a ""Help"" sign out of twigs on a nearby unpaved road, according to the helicopter pilots who found them. Lexi and Joshua Dominguez exit a helicopter Wednesday, shortly after being found. The four sought shelter from the heavy snow in a culvert and removed their sodden socks in an effort to stay warm and dry while they waited for rescue, the pilots said. Frederick Dominguez said that during the three-day ordeal, he and his children slept inside a log for warmth and ripped apart their shirts to wrap their wet, freezing feet. ""You just go to survival mode,"" he said. ""Every parent would do that. You would do anything, sacrifice yourself, because these are your kids."" Dominguez and his children -- Christopher, 18; Lexi, 14; and Joshua, 12 -- were reported missing Monday night by Dominguez's former wife and the children's mother, Lisa Sams, according to police in Paradise, California, a town of 27,000 people about 90 miles north of Sacramento. Watch the family talk about their ""scary"" ordeal ». ""I'm glad I'm home. Praise God,"" Dominguez told reporters after exiting a chopper at the search command post. ""It was awful."" Asked how he survived, he replied, ""Jesus Christ."" Dominguez said he used branches and sticks to spell out the word ""Help"" near the culvert, where the three slept the last two nights -- at times sleeping with their feet inside each other's shirts to help stave off frostbite. He said his daughter was the first to hear a California Highway Patrol helicopter overhead. He said he ran though several feet of snow barefooted to wave it down. ""When they turned around, man, I was just praising God and saying, 'Thank you Lord, thank you Lord,' because I knew we had made it,"" he said. Police vehicles equipped with snow chains rumbled up mountain roads to help conduct the search, which also involved a snowmobile and dogs. More than 80 searchers scoured the woods Wednesday until the four were found about 1 p.m. (4 p.m. ET). Officer Steve Ward said he was piloting the helicopter out ahead of bad weather when he spotted Dominguez coming out of the culvert and waving. ""We were very lucky that we just saw this guy at the last second."" Paramedic Flight Officer Dave White, who was with Ward, said that after the two shut down the helicopter and waved the family over, all four came running. ""The little girl was in tears,"" he said. White said the family was found north of where ground crews were searching. The pilots could see the ""Help"" sign they had made with twigs on a nearby four-wheel-drive road, he said. Christopher Dominguez told CNN's Anderson Cooper the family got lost Sunday searching for a tree, which they had chopped down but later abandoned. He said they didn't have food, heavy coats or other provisions to help prepare for the cold nights. ""We weren't prepared at all,"" he said. ""We just thought we were going to go up to the mountains, get our tree and go back home. It didn't turn out that way."" After the family failed to locate their vehicle, he said, snow and darkness began to fall. At that point, Lexi Dominguez said, ""I started freaking out."" ""It was really, really scary,"" she said. ""I just remember walking and walking and being like, we're not going to make it,"" Lexi said. And as they huddled for warmth, Christopher Dominguez said, his sister sang songs to help pass the time until help arrived. ""We were all just happy, happy to be rescued,"" Christopher Dominguez said late Wednesday, huddled with his siblings under blankets in their home. ""I feel good, just happy to be home,"" said Joshua Dominguez. ""Because I didn't think we were going to make it."" All four appeared to be in good condition as they were brought by chopper to the command post and taken to ambulances. Wendy Wilson, the children's aunt, told CNN the two younger children had some frostbite on their toes and a touch of hypothermia, but were expected to make a full recovery. Butte County Search and Rescue dispatcher Madde Watts said, ""They had angels with them, for sure."" The search riveted those in Paradise and beyond. Mayor Alan White, whose son played soccer on the same team as Joshua last year, said he and many others in and around Paradise have cut Christmas trees in the same place where the family vanished. When winter weather sours there, he said, people in the woods can get lost quickly. ""If you're 50 feet from your car, you might not be able to find it,"" he said. Although police found the family's car, it offered no clues as to where they might have gone. The inaccessible area is beyond the reach of cell phones, authorities have said. Paradise High principal Mike Lerch said students had volunteered to help in the search. ""This is a good family,"" he said. Christopher Dominguez had graduated from the school a few months ago, Lerch said, and Lexi is a sophomore there. Joshua attends Paradise Intermediate School.",0
"Summary: ""No Country for Old Men"" wins four awards, including best picture and director. Four acting awards go to Europeans: Cotillard, Day-Lewis, Bardem and Swinton. Best original screenplay is awarded to former stripper Diablo Cody for ""Juno"" Host Jon Stewart jokes about the recently ended writers strike. Article: Oscar said yes to ""No Country for Old Men"" and to European actors on Sunday night. Actors Daniel Day-Lewis, Tilda Swinton, Marion Cotillard and Javier Bardem toast their success. ""No Country,"" the Coen brothers' brutal tale of a man pursued by death and the law across the bleak moonscapes of West Texas, won best picture at the 80th Academy Awards. The four acting awards, meanwhile, went to Europeans: Marion Cotillard, Daniel Day-Lewis, Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton. The Coens also won best director and best adapted screenplay, and Bardem, who played cattle-gun-armed killer Anton Chigurh, won best supporting actor. Producer Scott Rudin shared the best picture award with the brothers. ""We're very thankful to all of you out there for letting us continue to play in our corner of the sandbox, so thank you very much,"" Joel Coen said in accepting the directing award. He observed that the pair didn't think they were doing much different work now from when, as a child, Ethan Coen ""got a suit and a briefcase and we went to the Minneapolis International Airport with a Super 8 camera and made a movie about shuttle diplomacy called 'Henry Kissinger, Man on the Go.' "" Watch the best of the winners' backstage remarks ». The Coens, who have been known for their arch style and oddball humor in films such as ""Fargo,"" ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" and ""The Big Lebowski,"" received some laughs for Ethan Coen's laconic acceptance speeches. After the pair won for adapted screenplay, Ethan Coen gave a brief thanks. Upon winning the directing award, he expanded on his speech slightly, sort of: ""I don't have a lot to add to what I said earlier. Thank you,"" he said. Day-Lewis was more effusive in his thanks after winning best actor for his performance as a misanthropic oilman in ""There Will Be Blood."" ""My deepest thanks to the members of the Academy for whacking me with the handsomest bludgeon in town,"" the British actor said as he accepted the award. ""I've been thinking a lot about fathers and sons in the course of this, and I'd like to accept this in the memory of my grandfather, Michael Balcon, my father, Cecil Day-Lewis, and my three fine boys, Gabriel, Ronan and Cashel,"" he added. See the complete list of winners. As he accepted his first Oscar, Bardem, one of Spain's top actors, thanked his directors and reflected on his role as a creepy killer with a bad haircut. ""Thank you to the Coens for being crazy enough to think that I could do that, and to put one of the most horrible haircuts in history over my head,"" he said. Watch ""No Country"" win best picture ». It was his second career nomination. His other came for ""Before Night Falls"" (2000), in which he played Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. In a mild surprise, French actress Cotillard won her first Academy Award for her portrayal of singer Edith Piaf in ""La Vie en Rose."" Early handicappers had bet heavily on veteran Julie Christie, a previous Oscar winner who played a woman falling victim to Alzheimer's in ""Away from Her."" But Cotillard, who's received raves for her performance as the French singer, had been considered a strong contender for best actress. ""I'm speechless now ... I ... I ... thank you life, thank you love,"" Cotillard exclaimed. ""And it is true, there are some angels in this city. Thank you so, so much!"" The actress has appeared in dozens of films in her native France, but she may be most recognizable to American audiences for her performances in ""A Very Long Engagement"" (2004) and ""Big Fish"" (2003). In a highly competitive race, Swinton nabbed the best supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal as lawyer Karen Crowder in the legal drama ""Michael Clayton."" ""I have an American agent who is the spitting image of this. Really, truly, the same shape head and, it has to be said, the buttocks,"" the British actress said, examining her new Oscar. ""And I'm giving this to him because there's no way I'd be in America at all, ever, on a plane if it wasn't for him."" See Swinton on the red carpet ». Swinton beat out 83-year-old Ruby Dee, who had been considered a sentimental favorite for her first Oscar nomination in the supporting actress category, playing Mama Lucas to Denzel Washington's drug kingpin Frank Lucas in ""American Gangster."" Swinton also beat Cate Blanchett (as a mid-'60s take on Bob Dylan in ""I'm Not There"") and Amy Ryan (a difficult working-class mother in ""Gone Baby Gone""). The Academy Awards opened with host Jon Stewart joking about the recently ended writers strike -- which forced a cutback in the Golden Globes and threatened the Oscars as well -- and commenting on the bleakness of the best picture nominees. ""Tonight we look beyond the dark days to focus on happier fare: This year's slate of Oscar-nominated psychopathic killer movies,"" Stewart joked. ""Does this town need a hug? What happened? 'No Country For Old Men,' 'Sweeney Todd,' 'There Will Be Blood'? All I can say is, thank God for [the comedy ""Juno's""] teen pregnancy. I think the country agrees."" Check out Oscar prep photos ». ""Juno"" has been the little movie that could all season. The film, which cost a relatively paltry $7.5 million, was the only best picture nominee to top $100 million at the box office, ensuring it a rooting interest from moviegoers. Star Ellen Page received plaudits for her performance as the title character, and screenwriter Diablo Cody -- famously a former stripper -- has become one of Hollywood's ""it"" scribes. Cody won best original screenplay. ""This is for the writers. I want to thank all the writers. I especially want to thank my fellow nominees because I worship you guys and I'm learning from you every day,"" Cody said. The first award of the evening, for costume design, went to ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age."" The best animated feature went to ""Ratatouille,"" a computer-animated Pixar film directed and written by Oscar winner Brad Bird (""The Incredibles""). The rat-turns-chef movie beat out ""Persepolis,"" based on the graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi, and ""Surf's Up,"" a computer-animated film about penguins. ""The Counterfeiters"" from Austria took the best foreign-language film. The movie is based on a true story about a counterfeiter who, after being sent to a concentration camp, was employed by the Nazis to fake other countries' currency. Best original song was awarded to ""Falling Slowly"" from ""Once."" It beat out three songs from ""Enchanted,"" the Disney film about an animated princess come to life. The Oscars were spread around. ""No Country"" picked up four, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" earned three (one for its rapid-fire editing) and ""There Will Be Blood"" received two: Day-Lewis' acting award and Robert Elswit's cinematography honor. But nobody had any doubt what film was considered the evening's big winner. ""There's nothing like it, and especially with these two guys,"" producer Rudin said backstage with the Coens of their unusual Western. ""I'm incredibly proud, and I think it's the best movie we have been involved with. I loved it from the first minute I saw it.""",0
"Summary: Flight attendants call hospital with 24/7 staff, multi-lingual staff who give advice. Pilots, not doctors, decide whether to divert a flight due to passenger illness. U.S.-based commercial airlines carry defibrillators, oxygen and medical kits. A passenger died last week aboard an American Airlines flight. Article: The death of a passenger last week aboard an American Airlines flight underscores the importance of taking precautions before flying, a travel health industry representative said Monday. An American Airlines passenger complaining that she was having trouble breathing died on a flight last week. Jill Drake, a marketing representative for MedAire, Inc., said its physicians last year advised 74 airlines on how to handle more than 17,000 in-flight medical events. Flight attendants with sick passengers call Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, a level-one trauma center where emergency room physicians and a service able to translate 140 languages are on call to answer questions from any of 2 million airline passengers flying at any given time, she said. ""Very rarely"" does the call result in a diversion, a decision made not by the doctor but by the pilot who must consider a number of variables beyond the passenger's health, she said. The pilot must weigh weather conditions, remaining fuel and proximity to an airport. As of 1 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) Monday, MedAire had fielded 110 calls, ""which is a very busy day for us,"" she said. On average, the company gets about 50 in-flight calls from commercial airliners for an entire day, and an additional 25 or 30 calls related to events that occur at airport gates or aboard yachts and commercial ships, she said. Airlines contracting with MedAire include Continental, Southwest and British Airways. American has its own in-house medical team. Drake said MedAire's doctors documented 97 onboard deaths in 2007, down from 110 in 2006. The top categories of in-flight illness are fainting, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory issues such as shortness of breath, heart problems ranging from arrhythmias to arrest and orthopedic problems, such as broken bones, Drake said. By law, U.S.-based commercial airlines must carry automatic external defibrillators, oxygen and medical kits. Some airlines choose to carry extra, non-mandated medications. If a passenger already has breathing problems, airplane travel will only worsen the condition because cabins are typically pressurized at 8,000 feet, said Drake. Her advice to anyone not feeling 100 percent: ""Do not travel."" And anyone with a medical condition who travels should pack any critical medications in a carry-on bag, she said. Though flight attendants are trained to handle on-board emergencies, ""they are not medically trained,"" she said. ""To think that they are going to be able to assist your every need, that's quite a high expectation."" Hydration and moderation are key, and passengers should carry water and a snack, she said. Vacationers often return home from tropical locales sunburned and, in some cases, drunk. ""Altitude amplifies the buzz,"" Drake said. ""You have a couple of cocktails in Denver, you feel it a little bit more than in Omaha."" Denver's altitude is 5,280 feet; Omaha's is 1,040 feet. Flying in a fresh cast can also prove dangerous. ""Your arm could expand and it could cut off your circulation,"" she said, noting that the risk is reduced with older casts, which have typically already expanded to accommodate any swelling. Though the FAA began demanding that airlines carry certain medications more than 30 years ago, the list was tiny. During the 1990s, overseas airlines began carrying more sophisticated equipment, and pressure increased for U.S.-based airlines to follow, said Dr. Russell Rayman, executive director of the Aerospace Medical Association, which has roughly 3,000 members including physicians, research scientists and flight nurses. Congress held hearings and then required airlines carry more robust kits and defibrillators by 2004. American Airlines was among the first to do so, said Dr. David McKenas, who served for 10 years as the airline's corporate medical director until 2002. He lauded the defibrillator as ""so good it's like 100 cardiologists in a box."" The machine will only work if the patient's heart is fibrillating, a condition where the contractions become so irregular it loses its ability to pump blood efficiently. American Airlines buys its kits from Banyan International Corp., which describes itself as ""the nation's leading provider of emergency medical kits."" Each of the nine-pound, $250 kits includes aspirin, alcohol swabs, nitroglycerine tablets, antihistamines, IV tubing, a stethoscope, a blood-pressure gauge, a bronchodilator, syringes, gloves, saline solution, epinephrine, dextrose, a manual resuscitation bag, alcohol pads and shears. Oxygen comes in several forms aboard planes. The oxygen that flows into masks stored above individual seats is not medical oxygen and would not suffice for a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency, said Rayman. Flight attendants have portable bottles of oxygen that they are to use for themselves in the event of a cabin decompression. ""It could be used if there is a medical emergency on board, but that's not its purpose,"" he said. More oxygen is stored in the cockpit for the pilots. Though MedAire keeps track of its clients' medical air incidents, Rayman criticized the FAA's failure to do so. ""There is no central repository where these things can be archived and then retrieved,"" he said. ""They don't want to report it because it just doesn't look good. It's not good P.R., you could say."" He said even an anonymous registry would serve a useful purpose. ""We're concerned for safety on the flight,"" FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette said. ""Once someone leaves the aviation system, there is no way for us to track the outcome.""",0
"Summary: New law raises auto fuel efficiency standards. Increase to fleet average of 35 miles per gallon is first in 32 years. Senate majority leader calls bill a ""great, wonderful first step"" Article: President Bush on Wednesday signed a sweeping energy bill that he said would help the country become ""stronger, cleaner and more secure."" President Bush on Wednesday signs a bill raising auto fuel economy standards for the first time in decades. The bill -- approved overwhelmingly Tuesday by the House of Representatives -- raises automotive fuel economy standards for the first time in more than three decades, requiring a corporate average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. It also boosts federal support for alternative fuel research and energy conservation efforts. A Republican filibuster in the Senate removed provisions that Bush objected to that would have eliminated tax breaks for oil companies and a requirement that electric utilities produce a portion of their power from alternative sources. The current fuel-economy standards of 27.5 miles per gallon for passenger cars and 22.2 for light trucks were established in 1975. The new bill sets a single average standard for manufacturers. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Tuesday's bill was ""a great, wonderful first step for an energy revolution that starts in America and ripples throughout the world."" But Reid said Democrats would continue pushing to shift federal tax breaks away from fossil-fuel producers and into renewable energy research -- one of the party's top priorities when it took control of Congress in January. House opponents such as Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, complained that the bill will undo many of the efforts made to foster increased production of fossil fuels in an energy bill passed in 2005. ""I understand the consequences of elections. I understand there's a new majority,"" said Barton, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. ""I do not understand how what made sense two years ago doesn't make sense today."" Barton called the legislation a ""no-energy"" bill and ""a recipe for recession,"" arguing its mandated conservation measures would raise prices for fuel, homes and appliances for consumers.

"Summary: Bush: Faith-based groups are ""helping to defeat this epidemic one soul at a time"" World AIDS Day is Saturday. More than 2 million people have died of AIDS this year. Bush wants to expand the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Article: U.S. President George W. Bush on Friday stressed the role of faith-based groups in the fight against AIDS, calling the struggle one of conscience and morals on the eve of World AIDS Day. Activists call for more AIDS funding in front of the White House, draped with a giant red AIDS ribbon. Bush was speaking at Calvary United Methodist Church in Maryland after meeting with representatives of religious and community groups. ""Faith-based groups like these are the foot soldiers in the armies of compassion,"" he said. ""They are helping to defeat this epidemic one soul at a time."" More than 33 million people worldwide have HIV -- the virus that can lead to AIDS -- according to the United Nations. That includes 2.5 million children younger than 15. Watch a report on living with HIV ». More than 2 million people have died of AIDS this year -- including 330,000 children. Bush is asking Congress for an additional $15 billion to continue and expand the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a program approved by Congress after he announced it in his 2003 State of the Union address. On Friday, he announced plans to visit sub-Saharan Africa early next year to see the program at work. He renewed his call for lawmakers to continue funding it. ""Now the time has come for the United States Congress to act again,"" he said. ""I'm confident they will."" The White House says the program -- which targets countries hardest-hit by the disease -- has treated more than 1.3 million people with AIDS. Increased funding would boost that number to 2.5 million, while expanding AIDS prevention programs and offering care to millions more with AIDS. Despite some successes, the program has been criticized for requiring that participating groups emphasize abstinence education. At the White House, about 40 people carried signs in support of more AIDS funding. Before speaking, the president, along with First lady Laura Bush, participated in an hourlong faith-based roundtable discussion at the church. Among others, the president met with Martha Chilufya, founder of the Mututa Memorial Center in Zambia. The center works with faith-based and other caregivers to serve more than 150 patients. Laura Bush and daughter Jenna visited the center in June. Bush said the first lady will join him on his trip next year.

"Summary: Case part of parental custody dispute. Father converted to Judaism after splitting with wife. Father wanted son to convert after getting custody. Russian Orthodox mother says son doesn't want procedure. Article: A 12-year-old boy should get a say in whether he gets circumcised, the Oregon Supreme Court has ruled. The court sent the parental custody dispute back to the trial court ""to resolve the factual issue whether M agrees or objects to the circumcision."" ""M"" is the child at the center of a long-running custody dispute between James and Lia Boldt, who divorced in 1999. Soon after, the father began studying Judaism and later converted. He also started teaching his son about the faith. By then, James had parental custody and told his ex-wife the boy would convert as well, and that to do so, he would have to have the circumcision procedure. The mother objected, saying the child had been raised in the Russian Orthodox faith while the couple was married. Because the two sides disagreed, and were living in neighboring states, the conflict dissolved into ongoing personal and constitutional dispute. James Boldt said that as a Jew and the primary caregiver, he has a First Amendment right to practice his faith as he sees fit for his child. Lia Boldt countered her son does not want to go through with the circumcision, and that it is an invasive, irreversible, and potentially dangerous medical procedure. The state high court seemed especially reluctant to address the issue, saying normally such disputes ""are considered private family matters."" But the justices noted ""these parties cannot or will not resolve this matter without resort to the courts."" So rather than offer a definitive ruling, the justices ordered both sides to go to the actual source of the conflict. ""In our view, at age 12, M's attitude regarding circumcision, though not conclusive of the custody issue presented here, is a fact necessary to the determination"" of whether the mother can press her objections to the procedure, wrote Chief Justice Paul De Muniz for the six-member panel. ""Forcing M at age 12 to undergo circumcision against his will could seriously affect the relationship between M and his father, and could have a pronounced effect on father's capability to properly care for M."" There was no initial reaction to the decision from the parents or their attorneys. The case is James Boldt v. Lia Boldt (S054714).",0
"Summary: Arrests made after ATF agents set up a sting operation. Affidavit: ATF ""became aware"" some soldiers wanted to rob dealers of their cocaine. The investigation began in November. The Army Rangers are an elite light infantry fighting force. Article: Four active-duty U.S. soldiers -- three of them elite Army Rangers -- have been arrested and charged with planning to rob drug traffickers. A courtroom sketch shows David White, left, Stefan Champagne, center, and Carlos Lopez. Wearing street clothes, Rangers Carlos Lopez, 30, and David Ray White, 28, and Army medic Stefan Andre Champagne, 28, appeared in federal court Friday. They're charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and with carrying firearms in connection with that conspiracy. U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman ordered them held in custody until a preliminary hearing Wednesday. Another Ranger, Randy Spivey, 32, is scheduled to appear in court Monday. ""It is a sad day when members of one of America's most elite corps of soldiers, the Army Rangers, are alleged to have become involved in criminal activity,"" U.S. Attorney David E. Nahmias said of the case. ""These men were trained to defend the people and principles of this country, not to use their skills to steal cocaine from drug dealers at gunpoint."" Lopez, White and Champagne were arrested Thursday at a storage facility in Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb just north of Atlanta, by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who had set up a sting operation. Spivey was apprehended at Camp Frank D. Merrill, an Army Ranger training center in Dahlonega, Georgia, on Friday, the ATF said. Dahlonega is about 60 miles north of Atlanta. Lopez, White and Champagne were to commit the robbery while Spivey covered for them back at the camp, where the men are stationed, according to an affidavit filed with U.S. District Court. All four were to get a cut of the spoils of the robbery, the affidavit from ATF Agent Brett Turner says. The investigation began in November, when the ATF ""became aware"" that some soldiers were interested in robbing drug dealers of their cocaine, Turner says. He posed as a disaffected security guard for the drug traffickers who wanted to ""rip them off."" The first try to set up the ""robbery"" failed, but a second attempt earlier this month succeeded, leading to the arrests at the storage facility and, a day later, the Ranger camp. A subsequent search found that Lopez, White and Champagne were carrying semiautomatic pistols and had an AR-15 assault rifle and a field pouch with 15 magazines of ammunition for it in their vehicle. Agents also found a ski mask, binoculars and a Taser among the items the men brought with them. The four soldiers face minimum mandatory sentences of 10 years in prison each for the drug conspiracy and an additional five years, consecutive, for the weapons allegation. The Army Rangers are an elite light infantry fighting force capable of deploying anywhere in the world within 18 hours. They became a permanent presence in the U.S. military in the 1970s. From the Colonial Era until that time, Rangers were activated for specific missions or conflicts and then deactivated when their work was completed.",0
"Summary: Protest moves after crackdown at Freedom Square. Order sought after protests over last month's election turn violent. Demonstrators say the election was fraudulent. State of emergency could last until March 20, official says. Article: Armenian President Robert Kocharian declared a state of emergency Saturday night after a day of clashes between police and protesters, a spokeswoman for the Armenian Foreign Ministry said. Opposition supporters wave an Armenian flag during a protest rally in Yerevan, Armenia, on Saturday. The protesters claim last month's presidential election was rigged. The state of emergency will ""hopefully bring some order"" to the capital, Yerevan, said Salpi Ghazarian, assistant to the Armenian foreign minister, who spoke to CNN early Sunday. The state of emergency could last until March 20, she said, but the government hopes ""that it will be lifted sooner."" The clashes began when authorities used force to clear Freedom Square of thousands of demonstrators who had camped there for the past 10 days, according to a U.S. Embassy official. Ghazarian said the authorities ""moved in"" because ""they thought that there were arms there, and it turned out that they were right."" Watch a report on clashes between police and the opposition ». The embassy official estimated that the demonstrations in Freedom Square grew to as many as 60,000 Armenians at times over the last 10 days. As of early Sunday morning, Freedom Square was empty, Ghazarian said, but the protesters were demonstrating in a main square elsewhere in the city. Watch Ghazarian discuss the situation in Armenia ». ""What is happening on the streets of Yerevan is people protesting what they consider to be unfair elections,"" Ghazarian said. ""After the president was forced to declare a state of emergency, things have quieted down. There are a couple of burning cars, and there are a few hurt people,"" she said. ""We're convinced that this will come to an end soon."" She did not elaborate on the number of people injured or the extent of their injuries. Witnesses told CNN that Saturday morning's action by Armenian riot police was bloody, but the U.S. official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries. An Armenian woman interviewed by CNN said there was ""huge chaos"" when police moved in. ""These are innocent people,"" she said. ""They just want their freedom. They just want to be heard. They are being beaten up, some people have horrible wounds."" She asked that CNN not use her name because she feared for her safety. As night fell Saturday, the sounds of gunfire could be heard from the direction of the protesters' gathering, and tracer fire could be seen in the sky, according to another Yerevan resident, who also asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety. The man said his wife saw two demonstrators hit by a police car earlier in the day. The car initially did not stop, he said, but the protesters surrounded the car, dragged the officers out and burned the vehicle, he said. The officers were able to escape, he said, but he did not know the condition of the protesters who were struck. The protests began soon after the February 19 presidential election. Opposition presidential candidate Levon Ter-Petrosian lost to Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, a political ally of outgoing President Kocharian. The opposition party immediately accused the government of vote fraud and demanded that the results be voided. Ghazarian said Sunday that the government had reached out to the opposition. ""We are hoping with the help of the international community, the opposition, the leader of the opposition, will come and enter a political dialogue rather than continuing this debate on the streets,"" she said. Haroutiun Khachatrian, editor of the Noyan Tappan News Agency, told CNN that riot police arrested several hundred people in the square Saturday morning, including many opposition party officials. Ter-Petrosian was there but was not arrested, he said. The opposition vowed to pursue its claims through legal means. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitored last month's Armenian election and concluded that it was mostly in line with international standards, although it did include some criticism in its report. The U.S. Embassy has warned the several hundred Americans living in Yerevan to stay at home and avoid the downtown area where the demonstrations have been taking place, the U.S. official said. Armenia, population 3 million, is a former Soviet republic east of Turkey, south of Georgia and north of Iran.",0
"Summary: Sewage was partially treated, Office of Emergency Services says. The 2.7 million-gallon spill occurred Thursday night, Sheriff's Department says. Pump and alarm failed at Marin County waste treatment facility. Area being tested; boaters advised to avoid Richardson Bay area. Article: Nearly 3 million gallons of sewage spilled into San Francisco Bay when a pump failed at a waste treatment facility, the Marin County Sheriff's Department told CNN on Friday. Attempts are being made to contain Thursday night's 2.7 million-gallon sewage spill. The 2.7 million-gallon spill occurred Thursday night. A pump failed at the South Marin Sanitation District's waste treatment facility in the town of Mill Valley, said Lt. Doug Pittman. The waste was released into Richardson Bay, an inlet of the large bay on the east shore of Marin County, he said. See the spill from the air ». The sewage and storm water was partially treated, according to Greg Renick of the California Office of Emergency Services. In addition to the pump failure, he said, an alarm that would have alerted workers at the facility to the spill also failed. The accidental release occurred between 5:30 and 8:30 p.m. Thursday, according to a statement from Marin County's emergency operations center. But the Sewerage Agency of Southern Marin didn't report it to the state until 11:16 p.m., Renick said. The state Office of Emergency Services notified local offices in the bay area within an hour of receiving the report, he said. The Marin County Department of Environmental Health was conducting tests Friday to determine how far the contamination had spread, Pittman said. Boaters were being warned to avoid the Richardson Bay area, and residents were told to avoid contact with the water. The California Department of Fish and Game has had a boat and personnel on the water since early Friday, and has found no sign of sick or distressed wildlife resulting from the spill, agency spokesman Steve Martarano said. Marin County is just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. CNN's Chuck Afflerbach contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Dozens of people face charges, ranging from money laundering to murder. Gambino family accused of profiting from extortion. Several companies allegedly paid a ""mob tax,"" Department of Labor official says. Police in Italy also make 77 arrests in connection with organized crime. Article: A massive anti-Mafia sweep that stretched from New York to Sicily has not only cut off the head of the Gambino crime family but lopped off ""the shoulders and chest"" too, prosecutors said Thursday. John ""Jackie the Nose"" D'Amico, shown in 1992, is one of 62 people indicted. Sixty-two members of the Gambino, Genovese and Bonanno families face 80 charges, ranging from money laundering to illegal gambling and murder. ""These charges strike at the very core of the Gambino family,"" said Benton Campbell, United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. The Gambino family profited from extortion within the New York construction industry and its labor unions, according to the charges. Watch the perp walk ». Several companies allegedly paid a ""mob tax"" in return for ""protection"" and ""permission to operate,"" said Gordon Heddell, inspector general of the U.S. Department of Labor. Other charges involve an alleged illegal gambling ring, said Richard Brown, Queens County district attorney. Nicholas Corozzo -- a reputed captain in the Gambino family -- was involved in a sports gambling enterprise that relied in part on toll-free telephones, Brown alleged. Meanwhile, four members of the Gambino family are charged with eight crimes involving murder, according to the indictment. Those charges include the felony murder of Jose Delgado Rivera, who was shot and killed in an armored truck during a robbery in 1990. ""Today we are able to bring closure to crimes from the past that have never been forgotten,"" Campbell said. He said the crimes span back over three decades. Watch feds say they've 'cut off the head' of crime family ». Key to the Gambino arrests Thursday was a member of the Attorney General's Organized Crime Task Force who infiltrated the Gambino family and recorded hundred of hours of conversations, said John Milgrim, a spokesman for the attorney general. Forty-five of those charged are already in custody, police said. Arrests were made in New York City; Long Island, New York; and New Jersey. ""It is as unrelenting as weeds that continue to sprout in the cracks of society,"" New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said of organized crime. ""We will not rest until organized crime is a distant memory."" In addition to the arrests in the New York area, police in Italy detained 77 people in connection with organized crime. Those arrests netted important members of a powerful clan in Sicily linked to Mafia boss Salvatore Lo Piccolo, who was believed to be the successor of the boss of bosses, Bernardo Provenzano. Watch the prosecutor explain why authorities acted now ». Police say that in his attempt to rise to power, Le Piccolo tried to mend fences with New York-based Mafia families after those ties were broken during the bloody Mafia wars of the 1980s. Those families included the Gambinos of New York and the Inzerillos of Italy. Provenzano was arrested two years ago in Corleone. ""It is evident that the intent of the Mafia in Palermo was to re-establish a dialogue through the Inzerillo family in the U.S,"" Francesco Messineo of the Italian Police said. ""A dialogue that was never interrupted because the relationship between the American and the Italian Mafia is historic, based on long tradition. But there was certainly an attempt to re-establish that connection."" Investigators believe mob clans wanted to collaborate on illegal commercial ventures such as money laundering and drug trafficking. Italian officials said the arrests were aimed at preventing these illegal activities, but they warned that other Mafia clans in Sicily oppose the return of the Inzerillo family to the island, and therefore were concerned about a new Mafia war.

"Summary: CBS: Hussein claimed he didn't think the U.S. would invade Iraq over WMD. FBI agent says Hussein lied about having WMD to intimidate Iran. But the Iraqi dictator said he wanted to start the WMD program again, agent said. Hussein was captured in 2003 and hanged in 2006. Article: Saddam Hussein let the world think he had weapons of mass destruction to intimidate Iran and prevent the country from attacking Iraq, according to an FBI agent who interviewed the dictator after his 2003 capture. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in an unknown location in Iraq after his capture in 2003. According to a CBS report, Hussein claimed he didn't anticipate that the United States would invade Iraq over WMD, agent George Piro said on ""60 Minutes,"" scheduled for Sunday broadcast. ""For him, it was critical that he was seen as still the strong, defiant Saddam. He thought that (faking having the weapons) would prevent the Iranians from reinvading Iraq,"" said Piro. During the nearly seven months Piro talked to Hussein, the agent hinted to the Iraqi that he answered directly to President Bush, CBS said in a posting on its Web site. ""He told me he initially miscalculated ... President Bush's intentions. He thought the United States would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four-day aerial attack,"" Piro said. ""He survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack."" ""He didn't believe the U.S. would invade?"" Correspondent Scott Pelley asked. ""No, not initially,"" Piro answered. Once it was clear that an invasion was imminent, Hussein asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks, Piro said.

But Piro said he was not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of Hussein's plan. ""Well, he would like to take credit for the insurgency,"" he said. Hussein had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that, Piro said. ""He wanted to pursue all of WMD ... to reconstitute his entire WMD program."" Hussein said he was proud he eluded U.S. authorities who searched for him for nine months after the U.S.-led invasion, Piro said. ""What he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us,"" Piro said. ""He told me he changed ... the way he traveled. He got rid of his normal vehicles. He got rid of the protective detail that he traveled with, really just to change his signature."" Hussein was hanged in 2006.",0
"Summary: There are more than 44 million people of Hispanic origin in the U.S. The community includes diverse national origins, generations, languages. Some observers say enough similarities exist to project a communal identity. Article: Hispanics are described as the largest minority group in the United States, as a burgeoning force in the electorate and as an untapped frontier of the business market. Yet these descriptions belie the complexity of the 44 million people to whom they refer. Susana Clar, with daughters Vanessa (left) and Virna (center), says the labels ""Hispanic"" and ""Latino"" are limiting. Even the terms used to name them -- Hispanics, Hispanic-Americans, Latinos, Latino-Americans, the Spanish-surnamed -- too tightly package the people categorized by those definitions, some observers say. ""We are mixed and we are many things,"" said Phillip Rodriguez, a documentary filmmaker. Many of his films, such as ""Los Angeles Now"" and ""Brown is the New Green: George Lopez and the American Dream,"" explore the experience and identity of Latinos in the United States. Latinos ""very often don't share language, don't share class circumstances, don't share education; it's very difficult to speak about them as one thing,"" he said. From a census standpoint, being of Hispanic or Latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or ""other Spanish, Hispanic or Latino"" origin. In the latter more open-ended category, respondents can write in specific origins, such as Salvadoran, Argentinean or Dominican. According to a Pew Hispanic Center/Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2002, that is how most Latinos choose to identify themselves. When asked which terms they would use first to describe themselves, 54 percent said they primarily identify themselves in terms of their or their parents' country of origin. About one quarter choose ""Latino"" or ""Hispanic,"" and 21 percent chose ""American."" But the broader terms -- Latino, Hispanic -- are the ones tossed about when the media want to discuss a ""trend among Latinos,"" or when a politician appeals to the ""Hispanic vote."" The U.S. government came up with the term ""Hispanic"" in the 1970s to generally refer to people who could trace their origin to Spanish-speaking countries. The term ""Latino"" refers to origins from Latin America, which includes non-Spanish speaking countries like Brazil. The terms are often used interchangeably, which is a point of some contention in the wider community. But do the terms carry meaning among the people to whom they refer, or are they merely governmental designations? ""That's the way you call our people,"" Susana Clar, 52, said of the terms. She and her family emigrated from Uruguay nearly two decades ago, and she works as a vice president in her daughter, Vanessa Di Palma's, Salt Lake City, Utah-based communications firm. ""Either you are Latino [or] Hispanic. I'm fine with that, but I think that we are so much more than that,"" Clar said. Manuel Baez, 49, a native of the Dominican Republic who owns an insurance agency in Tampa, Florida, laughingly answered the question of how he identifies himself. ""Manuel or Manny,"" he said, adding, ""We're being put together in this package and that's too hard,"" he said, stressing that he didn't like labels. He continued, ""Dominican-American really represents who I am, instead of Dominican or Latino."" He never uses Hispanic to identify himself because ""I am mixed,"" Baez said. ""Hispanic doesn't go with me because I don't believe that Spain was the best thing for Latin America."" ""For me...there is no such thing as a Latino identity,"" said Suzanne Oboler, professor of Puerto Rican and Latino studies at John Jay College at the City University of New York. ""There's certainly a cultural understanding... [And] a political identity,"" she said, noting that the many different groups will join on particular issues such as immigration and wages. But she stressed that it was not a homogenous group. ""Not all Latinos speak Spanish, for example. Not all Latinos are going to vote Democratic... All Latinos are not immigrants."" Others, such as Carl J. Kravetz, a longtime veteran of Hispanic marketing, said similarities among the different subsets of Latinos do show a Latino identity, one partly fused through the group's experience in the United States. Kravetz heads a Los Angeles-based Hispanic advertising agency called cruz/kravetz: IDEAS. The Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies embarked on a Latino cultural identity project last year -- when Kravetz was the organization's chairman -- to better understand a group of consumers they felt could not be adequately reached through the traditional Spanish-language market. There is ""very definitely a Latino identity,"" Kravetz said. It is drawn along parallels in values and ways of thinking and regardless of country of origin, the group tends to ""cluster"" in a few areas, he said. Those areas include interpersonal relationships (Latinos tend to emphasize family; individuality is not as important), perceptions of time and space (they have longer time horizons and have a relaxed sense of privacy), and spirituality (religion and spirituality have a strong influence on Latino life and perception of the world). David Chitel, the founder of New Generation Latino Consortium, a group of advertising and media companies, also said there are definite cultural ties among Latinos, particularly between those born in the United States. So much so, he said, that he and others coined the term ""new generation Latinos"" to refer to them. ""We're talking about people that have grown up here in the U.S. in Latino households, most likely with their parents speaking Spanish at home, eating certain foods at home, certain values and traditions that are instilled in them, from music to religious beliefs to the importance of family, these sorts of things,"" Chitel said. ""And it creates very much an identity that is Latino."" Chitel said this group of U.S.-born Latinos should be reached with culturally nuanced media, in the same way the African-American market functions. Still, some chafe at the labels. ""Every time it comes up it just kind of annoys me and makes me mad,"" Anna Rivas, of Boulder, Colorado, said of her background. Her parents emigrated from Mexico before she was born, but she said she's never identified with the Mexican culture. ""On a regular basis I get asked where I'm from,"" she said. ""And I'll usually reply, 'My parents are from Mexico.' And I don't say, 'I'm Hispanic or Latino, or I'm from Mexico,' because I'm not.""",0
"Summary: U.S. Navy makes move amid a political standoff over Lebanon's presidency. The presence is important,"" says chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff. Lebanon's pro-Western majority in parliament struggles with pro-Syrian opposition. Article: The U.S. Navy has moved the guided-missile destroyer USS Cole and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon, Pentagon officials said Thursday. A file image of the USS Cole, which the U.S. Navy moved to the Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon. The deployment comes amid a political standoff over Lebanon's presidency, but the Navy would not say whether the events are linked. ""It's a group of ships that will operate in the vicinity for a while and as the ships in our Navy do, the presence is important,"" Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday. ""It isn't meant to send any stronger signal than that,"" he said. ""But it does signal that we're engaged and we are going to be in the vicinity, and that's a very important part of the world."" The Cole was badly damaged by an al Qaeda bombing during a port call in Yemen in 2000, killing 17 sailors. It returned to service in 2002. The destroyer and two support ships are close to Lebanon but out of visual range of the coast, Pentagon officials said. Another six vessels, led by the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau, are close to Italy and steaming toward the other three, the officials said. Mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming Lebanese parliamentary vote on a new president, which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week. But he said the vote was ""important,"" and Washington was waiting for it to take place. And a Bush administration official told CNN the decision to move ships to the region was a message to neighboringSyria that ""the U.S. is concerned about the situation in Lebanon, and we want to see the situation resolved."" ""We are sending a clear message for the need for stability,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak for publication. The ships ""should be there a while,"" the official added. Lebanon's pro-Western majority in parliament and the pro-Syrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years. The country has been without a president since November, when pro-Syrian leader Emile Lahoud's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement. Despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief Gen. Michel Suleiman, disagreements over how to share power in a future Cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote. Parliament speaker Nabih Berri's office announced Tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to March 11. Berri's office said the Arab League needed more time to break the deadlock. Lebanon has been wracked by a sometimes-violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, whose supporters blamed Damascus for his killing. The resulting outcry eventually drove Syrian forces out of Lebanon, where they had been stationed since the 1970s. CNN Correspondent Zain Verjee contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Clinton wins in Ohio, Texas, CNN projects. McCain clinches GOP nomination; Huckabee drops out. Clinton wins Rhode Island; Obama wins Vermont. Article: Sen. Hillary Clinton got her campaign back on track with projected wins in the Texas, Ohio and Rhode Island primaries. Sen. Hillary Clinton claimed victory in Texas, Ohio and Rhode Island. Delegate-rich Texas and Ohio were considered must-wins for her campaign. Obama, who claimed victory in Vermont, had won 12 straight contests since Super Tuesday on February 5. Texas also held Democratic caucuses Tuesday, but it was too close to declare a winner. ""For everyone here in Ohio and across America who's been ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out, for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up, and for everyone who works hard and never gives up -- this one is for you,"" Clinton said before supporters in Columbus.

Obama congratulated Clinton on her victories but downplayed his losses. CNN's political team weighs in on the results ». ""We know this: No matter what happens tonight, we have nearly the same delegate lead as we had this morning, and we are on our way to winning this nomination,"" Obama told supporters in Texas. Sen. John McCain swept all four Republican contests on Tuesday to become his party's presumptive nominee. Read about McCain's victory. McCain won primaries in Texas, Ohio, Vermont and Rhode Island, giving him more than the 1,191 delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination. ""I am very, very grateful and pleased to note that tonight, my friends, we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence, humility and a great sense of responsibility, that I will be the Republican nominee for president of the United States,"" McCain told supporters Tuesday night. Watch McCain claim victory ». Mike Huckabee dropped out of the Republican race after the results came in. ""It's now important that we turn our attention not to what could have been or what we wanted to have been, but now what must be -- and that is a united party,"" Huckabee told a crowd in Dallas. Watch Huckabee bow out ». McCain is slated to go to the White House on Wednesday to receive the endorsement of President Bush, according to two Republican sources. The Arizona senator's campaign -- his second run for the White House -- was largely written off for dead last summer amid outspoken opposition from the party's conservative base, a major staff shakeup and disappointing fundraising. But McCain said earlier Tuesday that he was confident he would emerge as the presumptive nominee by the end of the night. McCain overwhelmingly won moderates and conservatives in Ohio, but he lost the evangelical vote to Huckabee, according to exit polls. Obama's campaign pressed to extend voting by one hour in two Ohio counties. See county-by-county results in Ohio. ""Due to reports of ballot shortages in Cuyahoga and Franklin counties, we requested a voting extension in those counties,"" said Obama spokesman Bill Burton. A judge ruled to keep parts of Cuyahoga county open an extra hour. In Texas, Clinton held a two-to-one advantage over Obama with Hispanic voters, while Obama had the overwhelming advantage with black voters in the state's Democratic primary, according to CNN's exit poll. See county-by-county results in Texas. Eighty-three percent of blacks voted for Obama, while 16 percent supported Clinton, according to the exit poll. Meanwhile, 64 percent of Hispanics backed Clinton, while 32 percent went for Obama. Early exit polls indicate a distinct ""age gap"" in both states. Obama appealed most strongly to younger voters while older voters favored Clinton. Among Ohio Democratic primary voters aged 17 to 29, 65 percent went for Obama, and 34 percent went for Clinton. Among those age 60 and older, Clinton led Obama 67-31 percent. The same pattern held true in early exit polling from the Texas Democratic primary. Among voters aged 18 to 29, Obama led Clinton 61-39 percent, and among voters 60 and older, Clinton led Obama 63- 36 percent. Poll workers in Collin County, near Dallas, estimated that nearly three-quarters of the Democratic voters would participate in the Democratic caucuses to be held after the polls close. In an unusual system, the 193 delegates that Texas will send to the Democratic National Convention will be split between Obama and Clinton according to the results of both the primary and the caucuses. State party officials say the dual primary/caucus system promotes participation in the party. Both Clinton and Obama have encouraged supporters to do the ""Texas two-step"" and vote in both events. Obama came into the day with momentum on his side. He had 1,378 pledged delegates and superdelegates to Clinton's 1,269. Neither candidate is close to the 2,025 needed to win the Democratic nomination. Allocate delegates yourself and see how the numbers add up ».

Barack Obama visits former church of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Atlanta. Sen. Hillary Clinton picks up pastor's endorsement at Harlem church. Article: The top three Democratic presidential candidates face off in a Monday night debate in South Carolina, with the hearts and minds of African-American voters on the line. Sen. Barack Obama addresses Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina share the stage at Myrtle Beach's Palace Theatre as the nation honors the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. with a federal holiday. The debate, put together by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, comes five days before the Democratic primary in South Carolina, where almost half of the Democratic primary voters are African-Americans. These voters will be crucial to the outcome of Saturday's primary in South Carolina.

Having a debate on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in South Carolina ""is very fitting,"" said David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, who is executive producer of the debate. ""Perhaps a debate on Martin Luther King Day in South Carolina should be made a must-stop on the road to the White House every four years."" A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Friday suggested that nearly 60 percent of black registered Democrats were backing Obama as the presidential nominee, with 31 percent supporting Clinton. That's a major shift from October, when African-Americans backed Clinton over Obama, 57 percent to 33 percent. What appears to have changed is Obama's electability. ""There's been a huge shift among African-American Democrats from Clinton to Obama. African-American Democrats used to be reluctant to support Obama because they didn't think a black man could be elected. Then Obama won Iowa and nearly won New Hampshire. Now they believe,"" Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst, said. ""Obama's lead over Clinton among black men is more than 50 points, and among black women, once a Clinton stronghold, Obama has an 11-point advantage,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. Entrance polls from Saturday's Nevada Democratic caucuses match what appears in the CNN poll. Eighty-three percent of black voters questioned before they entered the caucuses said they were backing Obama, with 14 percent supporting Clinton, who if elected, would become the country's first woman to win the presidency. These kinds of numbers could spell trouble in South Carolina for Clinton, who's coming off victories in the New Hampshire primary and the Nevada caucuses. But Clinton holds a special relationship with many in the black community, thanks to her efforts in support of civil rights and to the popularity of former President Clinton with African-Americans. Both Democratic front-runners were reaching out to African-American voters Sunday. Obama, who often refers to King in his speeches, spoke at Atlanta, Georgia's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the late civil rights leader once preached. Watch Clinton, Obama reach out to black voters ». Obama recalled the legacy of discrimination against African-Americans but challenged the audience at the historic black church to take a look at a few lingering prejudices among some within the community. ""And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean. If we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to King's vision of a beloved community,"" Obama said, citing homophobia, anti-Semitism and anti-immigrant sentiment. Obama told the congregation Sunday morning that if King could forgive his jailers, ""surely we can look past what divides us in our time."" Obama's visit to the city coincided with his endorsement Sunday by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which cited his ""appeal across many of the lines that have divided America,"" adding that ""both Clinton and Obama would make very good presidents, [but] Obama is the person; this is his time."" Georgia voters head to the polls February 5. In New York, Hillary Clinton spent Sunday morning at another historic black church, Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, where she picked up the endorsement of its pastor, the Rev. Calvin Butts. Butts said outside the church: ""A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to elect someone who has proven through time to me and to this community and this country that she has the experience to make things happen, and the vision to return us to a place of prosperity."" Clinton also sounded a conciliatory note Sunday. ""I have the highest regard and admiration for my friend and colleague Sen. Barack Obama. I am honored to be running with him,"" she said. ""I hope that this election remains focused on the big challenges that confront us."" After a distant third-place finish in the Nevada caucuses, Edwards on Sunday made light of his performance. On CNN's ""Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer,"" Edwards said he hopes ""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,"" admitting, ""I got my butt kicked."" Edwards would like to rebound in South Carolina, his native state. He won the primary there in 2004 when he was making his first bid for the White House. But he's running a distant third in most recent surveys in South Carolina, behind Obama and Clinton. On Sunday, Edwards sounded a cautious note, saying South Carolina was important but just one ""part of the long process. ... We will see how it goes."" Also on ""Late Edition,"" the House majority whip, Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, cited the timing of the debate to help put the spotlight on issues important to blacks. Clyburn, the highest ranking African-American in Congress, was instrumental in having Monday's debate held in South Carolina. ""When we were dealing with the dates of the primary, we tried to work in the symbolism that it would have to all of the world, for that matter, to have this debate on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday celebration,"" Clyburn told Blitzer, who is the moderator of the event. CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Rebecca Sinderbrand, Chris Welch and Josh Levs contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: British counter-terrorism experts re-inspect Bhutto's vehicle. Bhutto's assassination was her own fault, says Musharraf in interview. He blamed her for standing up outside the safety of an armored car. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, wants a U.N. inquiry into his late wife's death. Article: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination was her own fault, the country's president, Pervez Musharraf, said in an interview on U.S. television. Bhutto sits on stage at a campaign rally minutes before her assassination. ""For standing up outside the car, I think it was she to blame alone -- nobody else. Responsibility is hers,"" the former general told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday. Bhutto was killed December 27 in Rawalpindi, south of the Pakistani capital Islamabad, while she was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for now-postponed parliamentary elections. Her head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack. The cause of her death is not clear: a bomber blew himself up near Bhutto's limousine and videotape showed a gunman present, though no autopsy has been carried out. Asked if Bhutto could have been shot, Musharraf said, ""Yes, absolutely, yes. Possibility."" He has said he welcomes an international investigation. Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to Bhutto, who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister. He noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and ""was given more security than any other person."" Asked about the hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, widely rumored to be in the remote border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, Musharraf said, ""There is no proof whatsoever that he's here. We are not particularly looking for him, but we are operating against this -- and al Qaeda and militant Taliban. And in the process, obviously, it is combined. Maybe we are looking for him also."" And Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Mahmud Ali Durrani, told CNN's ""Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer"" that, ""If we knew where he was, we would have taken him out."" Durrani added that Musharraf's comment about ""not specifically looking for Osama"" means that the Pakistani military is ""totally focused on destroying al Qaeda and the Taliban network and not just one person."" About Bhutto's death, he noted only that the investigation is not completed ""and we should not jump to conclusions."" Still, he added, ""if she had not come out of the vehicle, the protected and armored vehicle, maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today."" Though Musharraf's popularity at home has plummeted, he retains support from GOP presidential contender Sen. John McCain. ""I think he's a good man,"" the Arizonan told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""But I think he's made mistakes, don't get me wrong. And we've got to move forward with these elections and have them free and fair. ""But I can work with him. He understands the threat to his country that the Taliban and al Qaeda present. And radical Islamic extremists. He's a very smart man. He'd be one of the first to go. They've tried to kill him nine times, OK? Nine times they've tried to kill Musharraf. He's not their favorite guy."" The New York Times reported Sunday that the Bush administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of Pakistan to shore up support for Musharraf's government and to find bin Laden and his second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Democratic presidential candidate Bill Richardson of New Mexico told CNN's ""Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer"" that, though he had not heard details of the plan, ""it sounds like a strategy that makes sense."" He added, ""We have got to take whatever action is needed."" Richardson has called for Musharraf to step down and has called for free and fair elections. ""What we need to do is ask Musharraf, push him, push him to step aside for the good of the country, because he is widely unpopular,"" he told CNN. Sen. Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate from New York, said Saturday that she would try to persuade Musharraf to share the responsibility for safeguarding his country's nuclear weapons with a delegation from the United States and perhaps Great Britain. Meanwhile, detectives from Britain's Scotland Yard on Sunday once again examined the white Land Cruiser that Bhutto was riding in when she was assassinated, Pakistan's state-run news agency said. The Associated Press of Pakistan said the detectives also watched videos of Bhutto's last moments three times, and looked at bird's eye view photographs of Liaqat Bagh park taken from a building that overlooks the Rawalpindi public site. The team of five detectives arrived in Pakistan Friday after Musharraf agreed they should work alongside Pakistani agencies to determine how Bhutto was killed and who was responsible for her death. On Saturday, the team spent more than two hours at the park. Musharraf said he expected the Scotland Yard investigators to help ""solve all the confusion"" surrounding the case. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, wants a United Nations inquiry into his late wife's assassination. The Pakistan interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her car's sunroof after ducking for cover after a suicide bomb attack on her convoy. However, supporters of Bhutto insist she was shot prior to the explosion -- a view that some say is supported by video footage of the moments before the blast.",0
"Summary: Grand jury upgrades charges against girl's mother and mother's husband. Presented new evidence, jury took just 3 minutes to vote for tougher charges. Riley Ann Sawyers, initially known as Baby Grace, was beaten to death. Prosecutors haven't decided whether to seek death penalty for couple. Article: A Texas couple charged with killing the little girl known as ""Baby Grace"" now face capital murder charges, after a Texas grand jury upgraded the charges on Wednesday. Riley Ann Sawyers was moved from Ohio to Texas by her mother. Prosecutors said they have not decided whether to seek the death penalty against the girl's mother, Kimberly Dawn Trenor, and Trenor's husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II. Two-year-old Riley Ann Sawyers was beaten to death and her body was disposed of in Galveston Bay. Riley's body was found October 29 by a fisherman on an uninhabited island in the bay. It was wrapped in black plastic bags and stuffed in a blue, plastic bin. Her identity was not known at first, and police dubbed her ""Baby Grace."" Police sketches of the child were widely distributed, and Sheryl Sawyers, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter. DNA testing confirmed the child's identity. Trenor, 19, and Zeigler, 24, were initially charged with injury to a child and tampering with evidence. But since the initial charges were filed last month the investigation has continued and police have gathered additional evidence, in addition to confirming Riley's identity, said a statement released Wednesday by Galveston County Criminal District Attorney Kurt Sistrunk. Based on that, the grand jury was asked to upgrade the charges, he said. A three-hour hearing was held Wednesday in which grand jurors heard testimony from five witnesses, including police and FBI investigators and the medical examiner. The grand jury deliberated for only three minutes Wednesday before upgrading the charges, Sistrunk said. Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died July 24. She said the couple hid the girl's body in a storage shed for one to two months before putting it in the plastic container and dumping it into the bay. A medical examiner said Riley's skull was fractured in three places that would have been fatal injuries. Trenor and the girl moved to Texas from Ohio in May to be with Zeigler, who Trenor had met online. Sistrunk said the investigation is continuing, and a decision on whether to seek the death penalty will not be made until its conclusion.",0
