"Prompt: Every person in the world undergoes a `` goodness '' test. It 's designed to give a score from 1 to 200, where 1 is pure evil, and 200 is an angel in human body. Then the world is divided into 200 zones, where people can live among their own kind. Story: Clancy Marguerian, 154, private first class of the 150+ army, sits in his foxhole. Tired cold, wet and hungry, the only thing preventing him from laying down his rifle and walking towards the enemy lines in surrender is the knowledge that however bad he has it here, life as a 50-100 POW is surely much worse. He's fighting to keep his eyes open and his rifle ready when the mortar shells start landing near him. He hunkers lower. After a few minutes under the barrage, Marguerian hears hurried footsteps, a grunt, and a thud as a soldier leaps into the foxhole. The man's uniform is tan, he must be a 50-100. The two men snarl and grab at eachother, grappling in the small foxhole. Abruptly, their faces come together. ""Clancy?"" ""Rob?"" Rob Hall, 97, Corporal in the 50-100 army grins, as the situation turns from life or death struggle, to a meeting of two college friends. He lets go of Marguerian's collar. ""Holy shit Clancy, you're the last person I expected to see here"" ""Yeah"" ""Shit man, I didn't think I'd ever see'Mr. volunteers every saturday morning at the food shelf', not after The Reorganization at least"" ""Yeah Rob, it is something isn't it"" ""Man, I'm sorry I tried to kill you there, hey, I heard you guys were out of food, here, you can share my dinner"" Clancy marvels, even after all this: The Reorganization, the coalitions, the war, Rob is still his old, chatty self. The two men sit, Rob chatting away, Clancy forcing out pleasantries. They pass Rob's rations between them. ""Clancy my man, I heard a group of terrorist 5's took have formed some kind of cult, and they're rallying all the < 50 in their own coalition"" ""Oh yeah?"" ""Yeah, I mean, that sucks and everything, cause those are some scary dudes, but I heard that there's going to be a truce between our countries in a few days, why don't we just hang out here, pretty soon we won't even be enemies anymore!"" ""Yeah, Rob, that sounds like a plan"" ""Man, I'm so glad I found you again, in a few days, this war will be over, and things will be cool between us and, hey, remember Sarah? I heard she's a 151, maybe I'll look her up, I'll be sure to visit you too once I can get a pass to sector 150-155, it'll probably be tough though, even before the war, you had to do sooo much paperwork to be allowed to visit, I wonder if passes will even be reinstated after the truce ends, hey, did I ever tell you about the time..."" Rob babbles as he dozes off, grinning up at Clancy. When Clancy is sure that his friend is asleep, he slits Rob's throat with his bayonet. Clancy climbs out of the foxhole, and stumbles his way back to battalion HQ.",0
"Prompt: Space mining is on the rise. The Space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 crash and spill its cargo. Write a news story covering the event. Story: „… and the little duckling will never be able to walk again. ” The artificial intelligence paused a moment for dramatic effect before continuing with its broadcast with a different voice. “ What a hearth breaking story, Frank. But now to another story that may leave you feel equally dirty. The automated space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 collided with an asteroid on its way to the Jupiter moon Ganymede. According to the ship owner the ship is out of control and leaking its content into space. ” “ That's right, Fred. And the content of the ship has it in it, as they say ”, the computer said in first voice again, “ The whole tanker was filled with ‘ biological waste products'coming from research and mining stations in the Kuiper Belt. ” “ Biological waste products? You don't mean.... ” “ Yes, Fred! ” Dramatic pause. “ I am talking about poop. Lots of it. And apparently it's spilling everywhere. ” “ Better call the plumbers, Frank. ” “ Not any time soon, Fred. A spokesperson of the ship owner stated and I quote – ‘ Space is kind of big and empty, we expect no one to care, so why should we?'Apparently they will just build a new ship and be done with it. ” “ That's one way not to deal with the problem. But why doesn't the ship fly home? Shouldn't the AI on board be able to handle such a problem? ” “ Well, the issue is that the part in charge to deal with asteroid impacts like that has been impacted by the asteroid. ” “ Ouch. Talk about a bad run. ” “ True, especially if you take the name of the ship in consideration. ” “ Oh? Exxon Valdez 2.0 it was, isn't that right, Frank? ” “ You're absolutely right, Fred. Did you know the ship was named after an infamous ship of the twentieth century back on old Earth? Apparently the Exxon Valdez of old was used for transporting petroleum across the oceans of Earth. Petroleum, as some of our listeners might not know, was a brownish black, gooey liquid comprised of biological matter which was transformed under high pressure for millions of years. Quite ironically the Exxon Valdez was infamous for crashing and spilling its cargo. ” “ Well, talk about making a bad name for yourself. Now both ships will go down in history for spilling black gooey stuff where it doesn't belong. Who had that bright idea for such a name anyway? ” “ Well, Fred, the company made its first plunder by holding a naming contest on the internet. ” “ Oh, will they ever learn? ” “ Apparently not, Fred. Predictably someone tried to make a joke out of it. A niche side of history role players got wind of the contest and made it its goal to get it named after the infamous Exxon Valdez. Apparently they thought it would be funny, and given the content both ships were ferrying around, they might have a point. ” “ Funny, indeed, Frank. What's the name of the side? ” “ Well, Fred, it's called Reddit. The people there mostly talk in outdated lingo and memes and watch cat pictures back from a time when the internet only was local on Earth. ” “ Truly a herald of the dark ages. ” “ You might be right about that, Fred. I assume they just thought it was funny. I guess this happens, when you let the internet decide on things. ” “ Well, Frank, when you think about the content both ships were ferrying around, they might have been right. Embarrassing for the company, but funny for everyone else. ” “ It might get worse than that, Fred. Environmentalists are up in arms. They claim that the human waste products spilling out of the ship might collide with Jupiter's moon Europa within the next few millennia and might contaminate the biospheres with Earth life. Apparently there are a lot of bacteria and the likes in poop and some might be able survive the harsh conditions of space and end up impacting on the restricted moon. ” “ Oh dear, Frank, does the Monolith know about it yet? I am sure it won't let us hear the end of it. ”",0
"Prompt: `` I wo n't have time to explain all of this to them. '' Start or end your story with this sentence. Story: I won't have the time to explain all of this to them. They have to die. Sure they don't know it yet, but they'll realize soon, and soon is a time well before never. They'll ask why, question the rationale, wonder under what circumstances did they come to occupy their position. Death, the unwanted companion of life, is never without her share of questions. But these would be different. There's no mistaking what happened before to what will. It used to be that in a moment a city could disappear under a cloud of ash, but nowadays one would expect no less from the great powers than total annihilation not by fell swoops of display, but by careful attrition of the enemy until their very essence is destroyed by the slow grinding of endless war. It embeds itself within them, becoming a part of their psyche, their identity, until their old selves are left for dead in a world where such knowledge has no use. It is a new world, and this new world needs new people. Such it is that they the beholden in pacificity must be left to die in their own, lonely sheep in a world now concerned with far more pressing matters. They won't know why, those of old thought never do. Explain to them the needs of war and from them comes nothing but rebuttal and counterpoint. For them the short is sweet, failing to see the beauty in war unceasing. They will never understand the new world as they are. Their option therefore, is to die, or walk amongst the dead.",0
"Prompt: Write about a song. Each sentence must start with the next letter in the song title. Story: *"" [ Sally ] (https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=6QyVil0dwhk), come on! Time to go! ""* Of course, she didn't need to be told that- she knew this moment had been a long time coming. Perhaps too long. Children see things that we as adults don't, and Sally had seen this coming for months, maybe even years. Rows, late at night, when they thought she was asleep. Yelling loud enough to shake the fixtures and rattle the walls. It was inevitable that sooner or later this day would arrive, the day when her life would be packed up and she'd be driven to some distant city- it was surprising it had taken this long. Now that day had arrived, and she sat on her bed, looking at the bare walls. Gone were the posters and the pictures that made the room hers. Yesterday, they'd stripped the whole room- her toys, clothes, games, her whole life packed into a van because mummy and daddy could no longer stand to be in the same room, or even the same city. Oxford would never be a home like Maidstone. Uprooted from her school and torn away from her friends, from the life she knew, the people she loved and trusted- gone, forever. Replaced with uncertainty- unfamiliar faces and unknown streets. *"" Hey, hey, what's all this? ""* Evidently she'd taken too long, sitting on her bed, as the tears rolled down her face. All through the divorce, she'd been detached and distant, trying not to let it affect her, but now that the inevitable moment had arrived, it had all become too much to take. *"" Rugrat, come here.... it'll be alright. ""* That special nickname her father had given her put a flicker of a smile on her face, despite her tears, as he pulled in for the kind of hug she knew she'd miss the most. *"" One day, you'll understand- you'll look back and realise this was what's best for everyone- for mummy, for you, and for me. Understand that I love you, and so does mummy, and that no matter if you're in Oxford or in Maidstone or on the moon, that doesn't change one little bit. There's a whole world of opportunity and possibility out there, Sally, and whatever you do, wherever you go, we'll always be right there with you. ""*",0
"Prompt: You live in Skyrim. It is your job to keep lit all the candles in the abandoned caves and dungeons and castles. Story: Light is a marvelous thing. It alone can turn a dead and inhospitable cave and make it come alive, welcoming as a humble abode. Without it, even the most luxurious palace becomes cold and depressing. Baldin knew this well. The Old Kingdom was rich with forgotten knowledge and artifacts, hidden in old ruins and abandoned temples. But who would venture foolishly into darkness to try and pry this wealth of information without a guiding light? Baldin liked to keep to himself, watching people from afar. At night, a single candle can function like a beacon, drawing adventurers from all over the land, like moths to a flame. And Baldin wasn't gon na let a lack of light keep them from going. Adventurers love exploring, making their own path and discovering new things. But they don't see the invisible hand that led them there. Adventurers go where Baldin wants them to go. But even though the caves and ruins may be old and forgotten, they are not entirely deserted. Many traps await the unobservant explorer, and these are no good places to injured, especially considering that the dwellers one might stumble upon can be quite threatening. But for the courageous such tremendous awards awaits; Dwarven metals, Dremoran trinkets, Daedric armors and so much more. Skyrim have some mighty fine adventurers. And all this thanks to light. Once an adventurer has conquered one of these dungeons and heads back home, they follow the lights blindly, even if they have moved. Or they might go and find that the candles are no more. Baldin likes to play little tricks and have fun with his guests. Baldin has found that most of his guests can't go more than a few days without light. If they don't find their way out they often they go stark mad, resorting to bashing their skulls against rocks or throwing themselves of a cliff. Or they try to sleep. Leaving all that loot for Baldin. Light is a marvelous thing.",0
"Prompt: `` Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am ... '' Story: Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am. But I'm here. Unfortunately, I am still here. A shell of a human being. A painting of modest beauty but exquisite detail. Inside, however, lies a drawing soaked in black ink and torn to shreds. There's no beauty in such a world anymore. Just emptiness. Days upon days of gut wrentching emptiness and the sharp teeth of loneliness tearing away at your heels. > Torment; noun 1. Severe physical or mental suffering And then you're presented with it. An escape. The smallest glint of light. You can practically feel the relief, the though of it making you happier than anything perhaps ever has. Your whole body tingles at the idea, fear and excitement clouding your desperate mind. If you had a cavity, you would want a dentist to remove it, would you not? It's been bothering you for weeks now, your teeth in more pain than they've ever been before. You can't eat you favorite things, you can't do any sports, you can hardly talk its so incredibly sore. The only thing on your mind is the pain. The constant never ending pain. How are you supposed to focus on anything with your jaw throbbing like this? It's impossible. But lucky you, there's a solution. A silver dentist with a loud booming voice, promising you to completely rid yourself of your nasty toothache. *By god*, you'll think, *this has gone on too long. But is this going to hurt? * ""Not a bit,"" The dentist reassures you with his smoky breathe, extending his metal hand, ""It's quick and easy, you wont feel a thing."" ""Yes sir, but what if I feel nothing at all?"" ""Than at least its better than what you felt before."" I nod and give his rigid hand a hard tug.",0
"Prompt: Everyone in the world has magic with various levels of mastery over it. You are extremely powerful with almost no control so you find a demon that 's very weak but extremely good at controlling his powers. Story: ""Imagine you're in a field."" Green extends in all directions. ""You're alone, the earth is flat, and the blue sky touches the horizon."" Blue shoots from the ground, arcing overhead. ""The sun appears, tiny in the sky."" There's a bright light, rays casting shadow behind me. ""What color is it?"" ""Yellow."" It burns so brightly, winking playfully. ""Good."" She licks her chapped lips, the sound distorting my tiny sun's light. ""Look ahead of you. There's a sheep."" Something soft and downy wanders across the green, its shadow stretching far beyond the horizon. ""What color is it?"" My brows crease. ""Uh-"" ""What color is it?"" The green wavers. Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? ""Uh."" Mary had a little lamb, its fleece as white as snow. ""Um."" The sheep wavers, cotton fuzz shifting from dark to bright as its shadows remain inky. ""What color is the sheep, Jess?"" Black and white race across downy fluff, one after the other, again and again. ""Um."" I see the black sheep, blending into its shadow. ""Um."" In the same blink of an eye, that sheep is white and contrasted against the verdant grass. The term verdant applies here because I'm in the countryside, you see. ""Jess?"" If I were in a park in the city, it would probably not be verdant, because the term approximates the countryside. But I suppose one could argue a well-tended city garden could be very similar to rough rural hills, provided there's adequate insulation from all the racket of urban life. ""*Jess! *"" You couldn't have a sheep in the city, no matter how well you tend your garden. It would have to eat too much, and poop too much, and cities produce so much waste as is so really you'd be doing a disservice to the environment if you pulled livestock into a concrete jungle where people commute and hail taxis and buy street tacos in their work clothes trying to catch the last train to their office after they overslept by 7 minutes because it was daylight savings' time and they couldn't get out of bed because it was too dark- ""**Jess! **"" -because the clocks shifted back an hour and I think I've been here for an hour at least because my wrists hurt and my fingers are cold and I might have a headache or maybe I've been thinking really hard sometimes it's hard to tell the difference- ""Look at the sun, Jess."" -between thoughts and headaches because thoughts are thinky and headaches are achey like how your head feels when you look at the sun because it's so damn bright- ""What color is the sun, Jess?"" -and so damn ""yellow"" sitting so damn high and- ""Where is it?"" -mighty in the ""sky"" like a teardrop- ""What color is the sky?"" -rolling ""blue"" down my cheek because I can't- ""Where are you, Jess?"" -go ""home"" because I'm so fucking- ""*Where* are you, Jess?"" ""Hopeless!"" The grass is gone, and with it any sense of calm I've had. I tense, feeling the straps bite my wrists. The more I struggle, the more they hurt, until sweat beads on my brow and my lungs scream. ""No, no, you're okay. You're here, you're okay."" A cool hand braces my forehead, holding me down. Ants chew my skin. ""No!"" My eyes snap open, taking in the broken sink in the corner. Porcelain jagged, water dripping down the wall. We fixed that. Papers litter the floor, turning translucent like fish scales. ""No, no-"" Fish can be freshwater or saltwater, but we drink freshwater. ""Jess, honey, look at me."" The cool hand forces me away from the freshwater fish scales and into a pale face, slit pupils and golden eyes. ""What color is the sun, Jess?"" I shudder, arching my back against the steel table I'm bound to. In that moment, I'm back in the ruins of Rashelle's basement. In that moment, I'm listening to the water bubble in the walls and the gas stream through pipe. Her face hovers over me, aquiline nose sloping up to those stony eyes. ""The sun, Jess."" Blue tears roll down my cheeks as I fall into those eyes, surrounded by burnt gold. ""Yellow.""",0
"Prompt: Berlin, 1943. You 're a Jew who has been successfully keeping a low profile while working as a clerk under the 3rd Reich. You just found out you 've won a contest to spend the day with the Führer. Story: I let myself in, hair wet and heart drained, hand clutching the announcement slip. ""Oh wow, Adeline, I would be honoured to be in your position! I mean—"" Claudine, my co-worker had cried when our supervisor had presented me with the announcement slip,"" —the Führer? Could it get any better than this?"" *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ Jamie? Are you there? Oh where are—ah there you are! Come, come— “ “ Ugh mom, you're soaked! Lem me go! ” I unloaded my things on to the table, but the sheets that were wrapped around me wouldn't drop. “ Oh, wow Mom! You're going to meet him! HIM! ” Jamie had snatched up the slip and had scanned through it at a speed far surprising the normal 7-year-old reading speed. Before I could react, he was prancing around the living room, hopping from sofa to ground and back again. Sometimes I don't know whether to be proud of him, knowing that he'll never spread his wings under the red swastika. *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ Yes dear, maybe I will— “ “ Maybe? No maybes! You're gon na! We're gon na be famous! ” He didn't know. All I could do was to feign a smile like a slap-on sticker. Underneath, the dismay was ripping me apart. *How about running away? * *Too many questions, too many traces. * *How about pretending that you aren't who you are? * *The document check, they'll find out sooner or later. * I slid onto the recliner, burying my head into my hand. And everything was going so well, keeping my head down and out of the spotlight. *How about Jamie? * I looked up at him. He was still oblivious to my dilemma, giggling away and waving the paper around like a trophy. I'm going to tell everybody! Ruth and Erik from school — There he was, the perfect Aryan. Shimmering golden hair, blueish eyes and pale complexion, his cheeks flushed from hopping around. *Pitter patter, pitter patter* *Perhaps…* -- -- - “ Here we are, Miss, ” the uniformed chauffeur opened the limousine door, his gloved hand extended towards me. Steadying myself with his outstretched hand, I stepped out on to the gravel pathway. There was a percussive tapping from the drizzle on the black umbrella held overhead. “ Young Sir, here you go, ” Jamie was helped out after me, in his black school jacket and pressed shirt. My little man. We were brought up a flight of stairs and through grand double doors. Jamie's eyes flew left and right, taking in the grandeur of room after room, a level of wealth he had never experienced. A uniformed SS officer sat by a stairwell, peering at us intently through his horn-rimmed glasses. “ Documents please ” I offered my papers and the announcement slip to him. He flipped through the papers lazily. “ Ma'am, you do understand that this is for a single person, yes? ” His eyes were focusing on Jamie, who was still in disbelief that he was this up close with an SS officer. “ Oh Sir, I do understand, but he's such an angel and would absolutely love to meet the Führer in person— “ “ One person only! Can't you read? ” My legs were shaking, palms sweaty, heart palpitating. My hand reached out for Jamie, gripping his shoulder a little too tightly. “ But Sir, please! ” Silence. *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ Well, all right. Papers please. ” Rustling. Pause. More rustling. “ Never left Berlin all your life? ” “ Ja. ” “ Well, Ma'am, I'm sorry for the loss of your husband. He must have faced the enemy gallantly. ” “ Danke, ” In reality, he had been stolen away to one of the camps, back when Jamie was too young to remember. “ You can proceed up the stairs now. You—you be good to your Mom now! ” He ruffled Jamie's hair, a slight smile betraying his thin-lipped demeanour. Smiling broadly, I quickly guided Jamie up the stairs, my hand reaching out for the dark-stained wooden handrail. “ Miss, hold on. ” I almost sank to my knees. He must have realised that it was fake. We're doomed. *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ You forgot your papers. ” -- -- /r/Ziincworks",0
"Prompt: Interrogation LOTR Story: # Of War and Hatred # ""I say we just leave him. He'll get loose in an hour or two, head back to the main band. We're close on their heels anyway, the skirmish today proved it. We don't *need* the information."" Thind patrolled slowly around the dim glow of the campfire, three dirty, cowled faces looking up at him. Laeg pulled the pipe from his mouth as a thick trail of smoke wafted above his head. ""I wouldn't mind killing him-this is a war, after all-but make it quick. I'll do it myself if it makes a difference."" Glan shook his head. ""Like a bound pig for slaughter? Like an animal?"" Laeg puffed on his pipe, and glowered behind its dusky embers. ""We're given it the benefit of the doubt that it isn't one, I say. We can't risk letting it go in any case."" ""A single orc grunt is a serious threat to our security?"" ""A single orc killed Coll, and Rhosg, Maidh."" Thind looked down on the ranger darkly. ""It only takes one. In any case, he's seen our camp, our numbers, our condition. Even if we re-positioned, the risk is too great. He we don't leave him, and we don't let him go."" Glan returned the look. ""So we are discussing his execution? With the possible added incentive of torture?"" Elu shook his head across the fire. ""I do agree that that particular aspect isn't necessary. We'll be on the war band by tomorrow afternoon, there's no need to string him up for an interrogation."" ""Since they're patrol didn't return, they'll be ready for something, someone. Extra vigilant. Killing him without getting something from him is a wasted advantage we can't afford."" ""What you should be asking is can we afford to take this advantage?"" Glan said softly. ""If we do this, we're no different than them. They kill, they pillage, they torture-and we fight them because we believe we deserve better. But if we sink to their level.... then isn't their hate a just recompense?"" ""A strike returned in kind, force for force, is justice, not indulgence."" Glan shook his head. ""You're wrong. Anything more than necessary force *is* indulgence. We defend ourselves. We do not ruin. We do not mutilate."" There was silence around the fire. Then Laeg stood. ""If you do it, I don't want to know about it. And that's all I have to say."" He turned and walked off into the deepening dusk. ""That's the cowards way, Laeg."" Glan called at his back. Laeg didn't respond, and soon faded between the trees with practiced ease. Thind turned to Elu. ""What do you think?"" Elu stared at the glowing coals of their small fire. ""I think.... I would like to feel good about defending my home. That shouldn't be tainted with shame."" ""I'm sure Naru would say the same."" Glan quickly chimed. Thind glared at him. ""I'm less sure of that, personally. I think Naru would agree with his captain and acquiesce to command perogotive without a debate. But it doesn't matter. I'll withhold final judgement till the morning. Elu will relieve Naru from prisoner watch in three hours time. Glan, you'll take over after him. I'll take the last watch before dawn."" **** In the grey of dawn, Targhed was suddenly awakened by a painful tugging at his ankles. He squealed as he was wanked from his place on the forest floor and suspended above it like a butchered pig. He twisted around until he was faced with one of his captors, the small, ruddy ranger with empty eyes. He casually gripped a small, skinning knife in his right hand. ``'Ello, love."" Targhed said brightly. ""Come to give your regards? I have to say the other boys were a sight more accommodating than this."" ""They'd have me accommodate you further."" Thind replied evenly. ""I want to know what you know. But there's only one way for me to do that. And they're a bit squeamish at the idea."" Targhed pulled his lips back to reveal grey, decaying teeth, and black gums. ""Ye rangers usually are. All that nobility don't mean a pigs bladder when it comes to the dirty work of fightin'."" Thind gave a thin smile. ""No. Not always. You see, they would hold that, if I were to interrogate you.... torture you.... hurt you, that I'd be no better than you."" Targhed shrugged. ""Makes sense to me, far as I can see."" Thind shook his head. ""But it doesn't. Because you're different. You aren't a person, or even an animal when it comes right down to it. You, are war. You, are hate. You are a thing, a feeling, a personification. And the question is not if we'll become like you, but how much we will become like you. How much will you, oh war, taint us?"" Targhed shook his head. ""Fancy words, and purple talk. You don't got it in ye though. You ain't bred for it like we are. You're bred to write them fancy words, drink sweet drinks and-"" His words were cut off by a lightening fast strike that sent him swinging on the tree branch. Targhed spat black blood on the ground, and watched the ranger spin in his vision. ""That ain't gon na convince me you got what it takes."" Thind nodded. ""I know."" **** Yards away, Glan stirred under his blanket, the harsh screech of a bird waking him from a light sleep. He raised his head from the ground in time to see Laeg walking off into the trees, away from their camp. The sound came again, and Glan paled. It was no bird.",0
"Prompt: `` On your right, you 'll see natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters. '' Story: ""On your right, you'll see the natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters."" Marcus muttered into an imaginary microphone as we floated on our shamble of a armored rubber raft, now riddled with darts and primitive arrows. The emergency escape pod suffered severe damage on the drop down to planet side. The light weight and heat resistant alloys made for makeshift armor for ourselves and our rubber survival raft. Our only hope was to get out of the territory of these natives and get to the Federation outpost downriver. The ape-like primitives were much akin to gorillas from earth in terms of survival habits. Building ""nests"" in trees, which were more like tree houses that any kid would want, and not being able to swim and just not liking water in general, getting most of their hydration from native plants and fruits. I was to be conducting studies of the primitives, to see if they were viable to learn, be educated, and introduced to the galactic stage. It was doubtful, as my 2 years spent observing them from the Federation Cruiser, the *Iaculum*, proved they they were essentially at their peak of civilization. My colleague had much less respect for said natives however, making constant jokes of giving the peace presents of bananas. The natives walked the shore, matching the pace of our boat in the current, some carrying spiked clubs made from the tails of some native fauna, some with blow guns, others with crude bows. The small rifle was all we had to defend ourselves, should the currents run us aground.They believed that water was a portal from the land of the dead and the land of the living. Anything from the water was, in their eyes, an undead demon trying to escape. Marcus ducked, but no arrows nor darts made impact, but fear crossed his face for the first time ever since I met him. ""Whats wrong?"" I dared to ask. He quickly raised his hands to me making hushing sounds as he returned to listening to the world around us. He peaked his head back up to see over the plating. ""Ooh, that's not good. Issac, do you hear rushing water?"" ""We're in a boat, I'd be more concerned if there wasn't"", I answered, feeling witty. ""The natives stopped following us, and it sounds like it's getting louder. Oh shitsnaps."" Sudden terror and dread filled me upon realizing what he was blabbering about as the noise grew louder. Waterfall.",0
"Prompt: You have just been sworn in as President, and are being told the truth about alien life ... but it 's incredibly far from what anyone had ever imagined. Story: ""Congratulations, Mr. President."" The President smiled, ""Thank you Rodney."" ""I hope you have enjoyed the celebrations,"" said Rodney, ""and I believe your inaugural speech was a resounding success."" ""I thought so too, it seems we a have some excellent writers working behind the scenes."" ""I couldn't agree more, Mr. President."" The President couldn't help but notice a faint overstepping of honesty in that last comment, but chose instead to ignore it. ""So, what exactly am I expecting in this meeting?"" Rodney shrugged, turning to meet the President's questioning eyes, ""Not much, sir. This meeting is mostly just for show. More of a'get to know you' piece for you and the other leaders of various organisations."" ""The navy, army, air force, CIA, FBI? That sort of crowd?"" ""In a way. It's best for you to come into this with an open mind,"" Rodney said, opening the door to the situation room, ushering the president in before closing the door behind them. Rodney took a deep breath, and began counting to 10. He only got to 3. The piercing guttural scream that filled the room was, Rodney thought, impressive. He hadn't anticipated the President having such a high vocal range, nor powerful lung capacity. He administered the mild sedative that he held at his side, waited as the screams gradually lessened, and graciously caught the president as he slumped from the drugs. Rodney casually carried the body over to, and laid him down on the table, before stepping back to a respectful distance. The Reptilians took over, strapping the newly elected president down to the surgical table and inserting an IV line. Their scale oozed with slime, towering over the prone man on the table. Rodney never liked this part. The president would have to be conscious for the whole procedure; until, of course, consciousness was no longer an option. Forked tongues licked out over their razor pointed teeth, eyes flaring up in anticipation. Groggily, the president return to consciousness, but remained in a semi-dreamlike state. They did not wish him to return to a state of pure thoughtless panic. Distress would make the transition difficult and may cause complications. His eyes fluttered open, fear lingering in them, but detached. Like the fear someone would hold looking over the balcony of a skyscraper from a slightly less than comfortable distance. ""I'm glad you're back with us, Mr. President."" The Reptilians voice was disarmingly human. Only the faintest hiss was evident. ""What are you doing to me?"" He sleepily returned, ""I demand an explanation."" The reptilian smiled, all razor teeth and glistening saliva. ""We're using you. I believe that is the nicest way to put it."" ""Using me? How? I won't stand for this."" Something akin to a laugh spilled from the reptile. ""You won't have to stand for anything. You won't be doing anything. We shall be using you in the most literal sense."" It leaned in closer, smile widening, ""You are nothing but a puppet, Mr. President. Your body shall be the physical extension of our will."" ""What?!"" The fear rose in the presidents body, heart rate rising, pounding in his chest. Another reptilian adjusted the flow of drugs, and his heart-rate stabilised. ""Why are you doing this?"" He whispered. ""We have always done this. You think that you humans are capable of running your own lives? Throwing away your freedoms to a popularity contest? You thought democracy was a stable, representative, logical form of government? Change does not create stability. Stability comes from control. And control comes from the outside. We come from the outside. The rest of your race thinks they can make a difference, have a vote. And they can, by all means. The election itself is not rigged. Only you, Mr. President. We rig the president."" The whirring if a drill shrilled into the air, the presidents head clamped down against the table. He moved to struggle, but found no way out and no desire to escape. Apathy overran his senses. ""Your race has been a potential threat to every other life-form it comes across. So we must control you. Passive destruction has been determined as the best possible outcome. You will destroy yourselves, and eventually the planet will recover."" The drill-bit dug into the bone at the back of the Presidents skull, grinding and tearing at the bone. It was at this point that the drugs could no longer hold back the screams. They flooded the room, breath tearing from the presidents lungs until he could get no more. The presidents eyes began to glaze over and roll back as he lapsed from consciousness. ""Goodbye, Mr. President.""",0
"Prompt: Killing another human now allows you to exchange your remaining lifespan the victim 's. Young people live in fear while the elderly plan their attacks. Story: ""Happy birthday dear Gertrude, happy birthday to you!"" The chorus rang out, prompting a ruckus of claps and cheers from the crowd of onlookers. We were gathered around an immense circular table, at least twenty feet across by my best guess. Atop this table sat a cake, a cake altogether too large to be allowed. It was hard to look at, not because of the size, but because of the thousands upon thousands of candles it supported. The tiny flame of each candle melded together in my eyes to create an inferno of magnificence only worthy of my favorite grandmother's birthday. ""Well blow them out then, and make a wish!"" Someone shouted, getting a collective laugh from the room. ""I'm going to need a little help"" My grandmother said with a wide smile. Everyone inched in a little closer and began blowing the candles out, ten or twenty at a time, until the last one was extinguished by my grandmother herself. ""What did you wish for?"" uncle Elmer asked. ""You know I can't tell!"" replied Grandma. A few moments later, after the excitement settled, we moved on to presents. She received the things you come to expect after so many birthdays; jewelry, delicious foods, tickets to an upcoming symphony and the like. She was grateful for it all, but none so much as the last gift she opened. My grandfather had slipped out of the room during the commotion, and reappeared pushing a large decorated box on four wheels. ""Darling, what have you gotten me this year?"" My grandmother asked, shooting him a skeptical look. ""Oh this? It's just something I picked up last minute"" He replied, with a sly smile. My grandmother got up from her chair and moved as best she could over to the box. She lifted the lid just a few inches and peered inside. A toothy grin spread across her wrinkled face and she flipped the lid off and reached inside. Out she pulled an infant child, no older than a few weeks, and shouted ""babies!"". The room erupted with a cheer and everyone came closer to catch a glimpse. ""Gary, you shouldn't have!"" Shouted Grandmother. ""How could you afford so many?"" Uncle Elmer asked. ""Just had to move some things around is all"" Grandpa said with a wink. Just then, grandmother spoke up, gaining the attention of the room. ""Everybody get's one, I won't hog these all to myself, isn't proper!"" Excitedly, My Grandfather began passing infants around the room. Finally, when everyone had their hands on one, then I said ""Alright grandma, you first! It's your birthday after all!"". The room grew quiet as she lifted the baby above her head with both hands. She looked around the room at all of us, drinking in the moment, and then spiked the baby to ground. She had sparked something in all of us with her intensity, and everyone began spiking their babies to the ground, one by one, with thuds and splatters and sequels. Just a moment later and the violence was over. Everyone laughed and hugged and joked, and everyone felt a little younger.",0
"Prompt: In a post apocalyptic world, a group of humans follow the wise words of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball Story: KLATTA, KLATTA, KLATTA! Thus was our decree. I watched as our leader, Mervyn, placed the scuffed, black orb of truth - lovingly called MMate, into it's hand-crafted leather carrying pouch. Merv, with his dainty soul-patch of red, and a barren face beside (he couldn't grow much more, to his chagrin) peered toward our group of seven. ""Fellows,"" he called above the harsh winds of the frozen Ancient Jersey Highlands, ""long have we wandered, taking heed of MMate, our savoir. Our guide."" With bated breath we watched, Mervyn's comb-over wafting about his dry, flaking scalp. ""Today is the day long awaited. Today,"" he said with pride,"" we have found our homeland which MMate has given unto us!"" ""Merv,"" called Quinten, our cartographer, from the back, ""according to my calculations, we're in an area that was once known as Knee-Wark."" There was a nervous shift in our small crowd. Murmurs of dissent! ""Fear not, my friends!"" Said Mervyn, ""MMate would not lead us astray. We are destined to make our lives here in this place."" ""Yeah, but isn't this where the ancients began their war?"" Asked Blandie, our chef. ""That's correct,"" said Quinten scowling at Mervyn, ""this is where the atomics were first used. Where the land itself was said to spit fire at any who would dare to set foot on it's lands."" There was silence but for the wind. ""Lem me see MMate, Mervyn,"" said Quentin, moving forward with his arms outstretched. Mervyn cupped the leather parcel to his breast and said, ""No!"" before dashing off down the hill upon which we stood, watching, mouths agape. Quentin watched, wary of the scorched land below. We watched Mervyn as he hopped over a small glowing brook and held MMate aloft, shaking the orb as he so often did when consulting our savior. He paused. He shook it again. A scream of rage echoed from below, like a beast woken from slumber to a den filled not with food for winter, but something that's not particularly useful, like someone had replaced the beast's food with twigs and old newspapers. Mervyn dashed off again, holding MMate above his head. BOOM. A pillar of purple flame engulfed our leader, engulfed our savoir. Mervyn's charred form slumped to the ground with a light whump and a cloud of debris. MMate was soaring through the air, back toward us from the force of the explosion. Quentin caught it and peered into the coveted window. The orbs plastics had melted leaving a final message for our frightened band. It read: ""Outlook not so good.""",0
"Prompt: the monster in the closet finally lures the child into the darkness, only to realize something is very very wrong Story: I hate darkness now, but it wasn't always like this. Not by a long chalk. I remember when I ruled the night! I was an emotional vampire, drinking the fear of others and gaining vitality from their terror. I ventured into the black with impunity, and the sight of me was enough to cause grown men to wet themselves and cry for their parents. Back in those days, the God-botherers did most of my work for me. All I had to do was turn up. Now I'm trapped in a closet, too weak to escape. I can feel myself shrinking, fading, turning into nothing more than a vague memory. And it's all because of little Sybil Terpsichore. I should have known that it was a mistake to come here. To be honest, things had been getting progressively more difficult out there, ever since those accursed computers became widespread. It was bad enough in the 1980s, when the movie industry began raiding the collective unconscious for symbols of primal fear to turn into popcorn movies for teens. They stole our gimmicks and turned them into ironic jokes, and left us with nothing. Many of us faded away, and those that survived only did so because they focused on more vulnerable targets: children and the elderly. I picked the kids, because I figured that their fear is more fundamental, and they are easier to manipulate. Until Sybil Terpsichore, I used to still be able to hear a couple of my colleagues who went the other way. They haunted the airwaves with their polemics on immigration, terrorists, FEMA camps and the like, and scare the bejeezus out of the less discerning oldies. I wonder if any of them are still out there. I had been getting the brush-off from so many kids, dehumanised by open access to the kind of horrors that humanity inflicts on one another - far more bone-chilling than anything we might dream up - and I thought that finding some remote location, off the grid, might dig up some suitably sheltered souls to freak out. Hence this farmhouse, and the Terpsichores. Margaret and Howard Terpsichore moved in to this ramshackle old place in 2004 after Margaret's father passed on and left it to her in his will. They got to grips with managing the sizable plot of land that came with the property, and they soon had a child, Sybil. When I arrived, I was drawn by Sybil's reedy little voice from her bedroom window, singing some kind of nursery rhyme probably sung to her by her mother. Paydirt! I waited until she slept, and took up residence in the closet amongst her toys. She didn't appear to be having any nightmares, which was surprising to me. My aura tended to induce them back in the old days, which was always good for a bit of latent fear to snack on. I was hungry, but I could wait. I needed to get to know her, find out the best way to approach and maximize the effect. That morning, I followed her around the house. She made herself some breakfast and went outside to run around in the cornfield. I wondered if she was just independent for her age, or if she just had lazy parents? I thought it best to investigate further. Bad idea. I entered the master bedroom and found Margaret first, then Howard. Both were long dead - Margaret had been poisoned, apparently by Howard. Howard was less intact, having been shot in the face, then mutilated. I couldn't move without finding a new bit of Howard. ""What are you doing here?"" It was Sybil. She must had been watching me for the last few minutes. ""FEAR ME LITTLE GIRL! I AM YOUR worst nightm-"" ""No you're not. You are my new friend!"" She offered me nothing, not fear, not anxiety, not even a little nervousness. I began to get afraid now. ""I AM NOBODY'S FRIEND! I RULE THE NIGHT!"" My voice was too shrill. ""Well, it's not dark yet"", Sybil responded flatly. ""Come back and try again later."" And that was that. I slunk off into the closet, utterly defeated, too weak to flee elsewhere. Sybil went downstairs to make herself some more food, and I waited for her to go to bed, even though I knew it was futile. I tried, did all the big voice and the gruesome shapes. She just giggled and called me ""silly"". I, who had actually caused kings to die of fright, was now ""silly"". I gave up at that point. Now I lie here, frightened and alone. Irony.",0
"Prompt: Most of the Milky Way galaxy is ruled by an interstellar empire, populated by hundreds of alien races. The species of the ruling monarch keeps changing; once they die, the emperor is reborn as a member of one of the many races. You 're the first human-reincarnation of this ruler. Story: The years before ascension are always my favorite, born with all the knowledge of my past incarnations there was really no need for me to ""grow up"" or be educated in the nuances of galactic rule, but long ago I decreed that each of my reincarnations must be allowed to grow to the age of majority before taking the throne. Death has not terrified me for many mellinia, each passing brings new possibilities, and a welcome break from my galactic responsibility for a few years. I do not know the mechanism by which my reincarnation is chosen, many theories abound, some species have been blessed a half dozen times, others never, and on a rare occasion I am reborn to a race yet to join my Empire, these I relish with great gusto, for it means they will play a pivotal role in the future of my Empire. Most are gifted with advanced technologies or cultures with deep and profound philosophies and art. My first day on Earth, January 1st 2016, was very confusing. Born into a primitive backwater, the people were vastly different from what I had come to expect from new entrants to my Empire. They had barely reached into space, their planet was divided into hudreds of squabbling groups and their culture was badly in need of development. In time I discovered why, while primitive, weak and Shor lived, these humans had a thirst for knowledge, a passion for exploration and had developed their technological prowess with amazing speed. They were fighters who found victory against overwhelming odds time and again, created inspiring art, music and stories. I grew up in a place called Florida, learned to enjoy the long hot summers, mild winters and the amazing variety of scantily clad women the white sand beaches attracted year round. 18 years in this primitive paradise and I found myself sad when the Imperial Dreadnought appeared in orbit, eclipsing the moon to announce to my newest subjects their ascension into the galactic Empire. I will miss this pale blue dot, but the Empire can wait no longer.",0
"Prompt: A father sheds tears of joy with his wife in the hospital as they greet their newborn child together. As his wife rests peacefully, the happy father cradles his baby and pens a suicide note. Story: I'm not fine. I lie all the time. I lie to my wife, to my friends, my family. I lie to myself sometimes. I'm not fine. I will never be fine. I've tried. Everything. Pills, walking, exercise… anything to take me out of myself for a while. It never works. It doesn't matter. My existence is a mental anaesthetic. Emotional frostbite; far past the point of pain. Nothing is better than this. Nothing is better than lying every time you tell your wife you love her. Nothing is better than experiencing atrocities and feeling about them the same way that you do when you hold your first born child in your arms. So I choose nothing. Maybe one day your heart will be broken, and maybe one day you'll break hearts. You'll say: ""It's not you, it's me."" Maybe one day you'll understand what I mean when I say this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with me; I don't know, can't know, and certainly won't know. I hope, in this moment, that one day you'll understand. It will mean that you're not like me. It will mean that you'll have inside you what I'm missing. I don't even know what that is. I know that I'm broken. I thought you could fix me. That was selfish, I guess. I just wanted to one day tell someone that I'm fine and have it be the truth. You're going to have a hard time growing up. I don't know if your mother will do well. I'm probably placing a huge burden on you, and I know I am on her. I'm sorry. To both of you. What I do know is that I'm out of strength. I've fought for so long, lied to myself for so long that I'm out of strength. I'm using the last bit that I have to write this because you deserve it. You deserve what I can't give. You deserve to know that your father fought. I've always fought. For others. For my parents, my friends, my wife. Today though, I choose myself. I can't fight anymore, not even for you. I would love you, if I could. I would love her. I would be happy. I would stop lying, be fine and live a fulfilling life. I tried to love you. I held you, tiny and helpless, asleep in my arms. I couldn't do it though. I could never be the person who brought you up, I'm not strong enough for that, not good enough. I've never been good enough. I thought I could be for you. I couldn't be for me, or for her. I tried, I really tried. She told me I was good enough, that I'd always been good enough, that she loved me. I told her I loved her too. I wish I could love her, or anyone. I wish I could love you. When you finally read this, I'll have been gone a long time, you'll be all grown up and I'll have my nothing. Please don't mourn for me. I'm fine.",0
"Prompt: Mulder and Scully stumble onto the grounds of Hogwarts; the only problem is Scully does not see everything Mulder does .... Story: ""What are we even doing in Britain, Mulder? We work for the FBI, not Interpol."" ""Scully, you know what I've been finding out about the depth of the U.S. government conspiracy. I just wanted to get away from it all for a bit. Though not away from work: I've heard about some interesting cryptid sightings in this area."" ""What's a cryptid?"" ""For someone who spends your time investigating unexplained phenomena, you're *really* behind on the terminology. A cryptid is a creature of which sightings have been reported, but there's been no conclusive evidence. Like Bigfoot."" ""So basically something that doesn't exist?"" ""Scully, you've seen the evidence of supernatural creatures hundreds, thousands of times. You don't have faith in science; you have faith in skepticism."" ""Whatever, Mulder. So which cryptid are we trying to find?"" ""We're in Scotland."" ""Seriously, Mulder? The Loch Ness monster? Didn't someone admit to faking those photos?"" ""You don't know what kind of pressure the goverment put on him to make him admit that."" ""Anyway, we seem to have gone astray. I'm pretty sure that this lake is not Loch Ness."" ""Then what's that thing?"" ""What thing? Holy shit, Mulder, is that a giant tentacle? I'm pretty sure that the Loch Ness monster doesn't have tentacles..."" ""It kind of looks like it might be part of a giant squid."" ""Giant squids live in the ocean. Not in lakes, especially fresh water ones."" ""Either way, you have to admit that it's evidence that something weird's afoot, Scully. I don't know what yet. Maybe there's been nuclear dumping causing mutation of all creatures in the lake. Or maybe it's a creature from another world."" ""That seems like a bit of a leap from one tentacle.""",0
"Prompt: Heaven is real, but is an expansive living area divided into communities based on how the inhabitants died. Story: I need to get home. Strangely enough, I felt aches and pains everywhere - but there wasn't a single visible bruise. This line needs to hurry up.... wait, what was I waiting for again? A bored looking young man jotted down notes. Everything was a bit surreal. I knew I was in some sort of enclosed space, but I couldn't see any walls. The floor beneath me felt like it could sink any moment and that notion didn't scare me at all. Bits of conversation faded in and out around me. ""-driving down one of those old roads, cow comes trotting into my lane like some fucking idiot..."" ""son's okay, but he's going to be upset about it..."" It all seemed so natural, but something begged my attention. I didn't remember anything. Finally my turn came, for whatever it was. A bored old man stared up at me, ""Name?"" I panicked. Name. Goddamn it what is my name? ``.... Let me check the files."" A paper appeared out of thin air, ""Lydia Andrews. Age 18. Hm.... Interesting. You know how you died?"" For some reason, this shocking revelation was old news to me. ""No."" He sighed and rubbed his temples, but chuckled in a disarming fashion. ""Neither do we. Don't worry, it's probably just a filing error. For now we'll send you to Section B13."" The crowd went silent and stared at me. If only I knew why it made so self-conscious. ""Don't let the reincarnated ones scare you. They've been around the block and love freaking out newcomers. It's temporary, we'll get it fixed in no time."" As walked past him.... or through him, I'm not sure. A cat trotted up to me, ""Hey - you compulsively honest or something?"" I tilted my head, and the creature just repeated himself. ""I don't know what you're talking about."" Suddenly he jumped in front of me. ""He asked you how you died. People spend millennia building up their resume, making it look good, and you could have just said you tried to save a bunch of orphans or something. I wish I could have done that!"" Wondering how the cat died, I knelt down and picked him up, placing him on my shoulder. ""What did you do?"" ""I got a little sticker that said:'Roadkill' and was assigned to wander around the car crash dormitory. But hey, I don't envy you - you missed an opportunity like the dumb human you are."" Absentmindedly patting the cat on the head, I phased through a couple of walls. ""You know what Section B13 is about?"" It purred happily, before jumping down to walk beside me. What a strange little cat. ""Don't listen to anyone who says it's temporary. Millions of people die everyday, it's not like anyone's going to care about the one person who got assigned wrong. I think I know of like, one girl who got moved. And that was because someone found out that she was serial killer who stole the resume of a doctor."" The cat continued, ""Anyways, Section B13 is filled with all sorts of people. Mainly those who died from bizarre accidents. It's cold and dark and the electricity is terrible. No one there minds though, they spend most of their time so high that they could relive their deaths and laugh about it.""",0

"Prompt: You 're a successful womanizer and across the room you see a beautiful yet disinterested woman who you must have. Story: Quietly slipping my ring into my pocket, I pushed myself against the ominously large wooden doorway of the newly-opened bar. I found myself exerting more force than I'd anticipated, as though the entrance itself wanted nothing to do with me. That'd make two of us, then - though I didn't pause and consider the meaning of this or anything pretentious like that. I was here for fun, not philosophy. And so, I threw the doorway open and quickly slipped in before it had the chance to shut on me. My eyes had trouble adjusting to the light. It was late, making the contrast between outside and here the same as night and day. A single, bulky television set hung above the bar tables, providing a constant stream of football. ""Monday Night Football"".... then, it was Monday. I'd always had trouble keeping up with dates. They were never really my thing. After a quick glance at the screen I diverted my gaze to the stage. A small band, seemingly local, was providing gentle ambient music to the scene. Was this jazz or country...? I didn't even consider it could be possible for music to be so ambiguous genre-wise. A quick glance was all I needed there as well. I slipped my hand into my pocket and checked my ring, just in case. Of course it was still there, and quickly I'd realized that I'd been standing about at the entrance for a minute or two. I quickly made my way towards the nearest bar counter. ""What'll it be for ya?"" came a voice out of nowhere, even as I sat down. I'd had my eyes on a group of girls towards the stage for a bit and hadn't been paying attention. It was the bartender, of course. A short, stubby little man with a shaved head but by no means a shaved face. I briefly imagined the difficulty he would have drinking from such large mugs without getting his impressively long beard soaked with ale. I almost laughed - what a strange thought. ""Nothin' for me, not yet."" I made sure to say'not yet' so as to avoid being removed from the building. I wouldn't be drinking today, yet I've learned from past experiences to not let anybody involved with the bar know that. Lost me a good catch once that way. Never again. I glanced over in the direction of the little party of cuties hanging out down by the stage. ""But,"" I continued while directing his gaze towards the ladies with my head, ""I'm thinkin' one of those ladies could stand to have a bit more, yeah?"" The bartender - whose nametag, claiming his name to be ""Chuck"", had just caught my eye - tried to cover up a sigh yet failed to do so. Chuck had been mindlessly wiping down the same section of the counter since I'd sat down, clearly expecting something different from myself. Sorry, pal. Can't help myself tonight. My money's just as good as any, though. Chuck gazed over at the girls for far longer than what one would describe as a simple glance. The word ""gaze"" came to mind. Hell, he was looking at them longer than I did. What was he doing? Weighing his options? I couldn't help but lose a little bit of my friendly smile. What's the big deal to you? She's just a girl, and money is money. I'd even pay extra if he resisted. ""They're just here to have some fun, sir,"" he politely noted. ""See the one on the left? Just turned twenty-one today. Came here with her friends on a whim. I wouldn't want to invade on that if I were you, sir."" ""Ah, so, first time to a bar huh? Well, y'know, legally anyways. Quite a looker, that one - I'd say she's no first-timer to bars."" I rambled on, still staring at the lady he'd pointed out to me. She was the one, no doubt. He'd even been nice enough to give me some details on her, though he certainly didn't mean it that way. ""Girl's got a lot goin' for her though, for sure. Looks like a real animal, yeah? Wouldn't even be shocked to hear she could drink more than me! One drink'll do her no harm, I think. Three drinks'd be nice and safe for her, even."" ""Sir, I don't think.... I'm not in any position to tell these things myself. I assure you that the drink itself is not the problem. It's just-"" Words came out of my mouth before he even finished his sentence. ""Eh? No problem, you say? C'mon then, one little drink. I'll pay extra, I will. She'll be nice and safe, won't do any harm to her. She's got all her friends to back her up, too."" I stopped looking at the girls and focused on the bartender, who was shaping up to be my biggest obstacle between me and the girl. Morality is admirable, sure, but what's he think I'm going to do to the girl? Never anything without consent. He followed suit, now looking directly at me, yet still wiping down that same part of the counter. It almost seemed like he was pressing down far harder than he'd been earlier, though it could just be me. After a moment though, and to my utmost surprise, he stopped wiping and placed the rag down. ""Sir,"" he began with a sigh, ""do you know where you are?"" His eyes held no hint of sarcasm or insincerity. Suddenly, the atmosphere became extremely uncomfortable, even for myself. I couldn't help but fidget ever so slightly in my seat. ""I can't say I do, not specifically anyways. Just know it's a bar. That not good enough?"" ""I'm sorry sir, but not quite good enough. I'm Chuck. The owner of this bar, Chuck's Tavern."" He stood up straight now, making him quite a bit taller than me, as I remained seated and heavily slouched against the low counters. ""I don't appreciate people like you coming into my property and treating it like some sort of brothel, you hear me?"" His voice was heavy. Heavy in that it almost made me shake, and heavy in that it was shockingly loud and focused on myself. I glanced quickly over towards the stage to see that what I'd feared had been true - the girls had heard the commotion and had fixed their eyes on myself and Chuck. I shrugged, trying to take control of the situation, but I knew my mission was going south quickly. Mindlessly checking my pockets, I grabbed my ring to ensure it was safe. At least I've still got this, I thought, before swiveling on my stool back to face Chuck. ""Gotcha Chuck, no harm meant here, just wanted to see those girls faces when they'd gotten a gift from a nice stranger like myself, nothin' more, I swear. If ya still think that not true, though, I could settle for a nice drink myself, no need for nothin' more than that. Pay you for your troubles n' all."" As the words flowed gracefully out of my mouth, I felt like the smoothest man to walk the Earth. Towards the back, a few giggles came up - some, I thought, even came from the ladies watching me at the stage. Chuck looked at me in such a way that I swear I'd been interrogated, switching from eye to eye and squinting a little bit more each second. I felt the tension grow, even after I'd attempted to diffuse the situation. I wondered to myself why I didn't just get up and leave at that point. I would imagine that the eternity I felt his eyes on me was not an actual eternity, though I wouldn't be surprised if it was close, though at some point he did lift his heavy gaze off of me and go back to wiping down the counter. Never thought I would've missed seeing him do that. ""Alright, sir. It's not a problem. What'll it be for you?"" he asked, with a hint of a smile that could either be entirely real or entirely fake. ""Get me a Black Velvet, would you?"" I asked as politely as I could. Bringing back Chuck's wrath was something I wasn't ready to do. ""Of course, sir. One moment."" I was glad he knew what I'd ordered. For a moment I considered he may not understand, and might've thought I was trying to make a fool out of him. Despite his strong sense of morality, the guy seems to know what he's doing, I thought. Perhaps we'll even be able to put this behind us, and maybe I'll come back again in the future. Just for drinks, of course. Suddenly, however, the relative silence and tranquility of the post-war bar scene was interrupted by Chuck's yelling voice. ""Sharla! Where'd you put all the damn champagne!?"" I hadn't noticed anybody else working at the bar at that time. There were very few people - in fact, aside from the group of ladies, there may very well have been less than three other individuals present. Turning around in confusion, I searched for this Sharla.... .... when I saw the same lady I'd eyed up earlier speak up. Or, rather, shout. ""Dad, I already told you I'd moved it to the very back of the storage room!"" I may not be the brightest individual, but the moment she began to speak I realized my mistake. The revelation hit me full force. I'd never been punched before, not square in the face, but that's the only comparison I could possibly make. I tried to take home the owner's daughter. ""Thank you, sweetie!"" shouted Chuck back, as he turned to me and announced he'd be right back with my drink. I simply sat there, stunned. It might've just been my imagination, but it seemed like the smile he gave me before leaving to get the goods was one made not of friendliness but of malevolence. He knew I'd embarrassed myself, even if nobody else knew what happened. Well, that's fine. I'll admit I should've seen it coming. The music died down in the bar as the local band left the stage, the last performance of the night. The soft lighting grew dimmer and dimmer to warn customers of the bar's upcoming closing time. Football was over, the single television hanging above the bar counter blinked off. And when Chuck, the family-friendly owner and bartender of the newly opened Chuck's Tavern, returned to deliver my drink.... I had already left, ring in pocket, entirely defeated.",0
"Prompt: The world 's best hitman prepares to kill the world 's luckiest man. Story: Sorry I'm late to the party and I'm not a writer. I decided to post this story anyway. I hope you enjoy it. After the assassination of the Prime Minister things really started looking up for me. The CIA essentially had me on speed dial. Drug smugglers, politicians, corporate executives. No one was safe. No agency, big or small could keep a target alive. I was convinced of that. When the lone survivor of United 215 was able to speak again, people were ready to listen. Questioned erupted throughout the world. How did he survive? What exactly happened? Eight hundred fifty-three passengers were on that Airbus A380 when it erupted into flames mid air. Soaring to the ground like an exhausted phoenix. The timing of the crash was impeccable. The FAA was conducting their annual commercial airline safety summit a few weeks after the crash. The survivor was invited to speak before congress about his traumatic experience. That's when I got the call from Langley. After following my target for a few days, I concluded this would be my most dangerous mission yet. Getting away with murder in New York City is no easy task. It had to be quick. When I saw him step out of his Gramercy apartment I knew the clock was ticking. I approached him at the crosswalk. His coffee still steaming out of his ""my other computer is a data center"" mug. Our eyes met for only a second. He smiled, greeted me and then collapsed. No one had noticed the hydra-shok round that just pierced his heart. People everywhere rushed over to provide aid. I continued on. I removed my trench coat and handed it to a homeless man. ""Thank you, miss! God bless!"" Everyone deserves a little kindness. Life in America is hard. ________________________________________________________________ ""Listen to this shit. He told me this story yesterday and it's nuts!"" ""So I'm standing on the corner going to work. Just minding my own business. When this guy next to me just collapses. I look to help him immediately since I'm right next to him. Then I noticed this guy is pouring blood from his chest. Turns out it was a bullet wound. Someone had just shot him. ""That's fucking crazy!"" ""Right!? Tell him the craziest part."" ""oh yeah.... I was so distracted by the pool of blood that was pouring out of his chest that I didn't really get a chance to get a good look at him...."" ``....when I finally looked at his face. I realized that he was my doppelganger.""",0
"Prompt: Humanity has achieved immortality. Due to resource concerns everyone must submit to a council their chosen manner of death at 150. The more amusing the death the longer the council lets you live. Story: Don't bother reading this, it's got a major logical flaw that I didn't realize until the end. I just don't want to throw away what I've written. _____________________________________ ""She's done it. By God, she's beaten us at our own game."" Councilwoman Thursday grinned. ""Oh, that's clever. That's *very* clever."" ""This is serious, Thursay,"" Friday scolded, ""We have to decide a course of action."" ""You know the course of action, Friday,"" said Monday, ""We must give her a seat on the Council."" ""This could mean the *collapse* of the Council."" Thursday rolled her eyes. ""You're being hyperbolic."" ""No, he's not,"" said Saturday, ""This isn't like the last time we added a new member."" Several members of the council quietly chuckled, remembering the man who proposed to be killed in a gladiator style fight-to-the-death in an ice rink against an unending supply of bloodthirsty giraffes. His submission earned him a pardon, and the seat of Sunday on the council. Councilman Tuesday was brooding over the proposal. ""But it isn't really her'death,' per se, that's funny, right?"" Councilman Friday shook his head. ""No. The law dictates that the execution be broadcast to the world for entertainment. She is judged by our prediction of the public's reaction."" Stubborn as always, Tuesday protested. ""Come now, surely she can't dictate the specifications of the broadcast. The condemned can only choose the method of death."" Thursday laughed. ""Oh, I'm sure there's a precedent for it. Secretary, can you check that for us?"" The Secretary nodded. ""She's trying to subvert the rules,"" said Wednesday, ""Just take out the broadcasting bit and give her 50 years."" Friday sighed. ""We can't. Not unless the request is impossible for the Council to arrange."" ""But-"" ""No but's,"" said Monday, ""Fair is fair."" ""But she *cheated*. We can't allow that to go unpunished."" ""Wednesday, finding a loophole isn't cheating."" Thursday chuckled. ""Quite the opposite, it's an expression of supreme admiration for the rules."" The Secretary cleared his throat. ""If it would please the Council..."" Friday gestured for him to continue. ""In the case of Gabriel Marquet, the condemned was executed by having his skull injected with an explosive fluid and then detonated. He requested that it be broadcast in'slow motion,' which the Council interpreted as 50 % speed, and this was granted."" ""Dammit,"" muttered Tuesday. ""What are we supposed to do, then?"" Thursday turned to Sunday. ""Thoughts, Sunny?"" ""I told you not to call me that,"" Sunday said, ""And you all know how much it pains me to say this, but I agree with Thursday. The only solution is to grant her a seat on the Council."" He turned to Wednesday. ""I'm sorry, but we are left with no alternative."" ""Hey, I got no problem with retirement,"" she said, ""What pisses me off is what this girl is doing to get a seat."" Thursday cheerfully sprang out of her seat. ""I move to grant this woman the seat of Wednesday on the Council."" ""Seconded,"" said Monday. Thursday began to take the vote. ""Monday, how do you vote?"" ""Yea."" ""Tuesday, how do you vote?"" ""Nay."" ""Wednesday?"" ""Nay."" ""Thurs- um, Yea."" ""Friday?"" Friday sighed. ""We're going to have to forbid this sort of thing in the future. Yea."" ""Saturday?"" ""Nay."" ""Sunday?"" ""Yea."" ""By a vote of four to three, Elizabeth Navarro will assume the seat of Wednesday on the Council, for her ingenious execution proposal. Secretary?"" The Secretary excused himself to bring in the new member. ""I guess it was inevitable,"" the former Wednesday said, ""I admit, it was pretty clever, if more than a bit underhanded. The method of death was nothing special, but speeding it up and playing Yakety Sax in the background..."" Thursday nodded. ""If we actually gave her 50 years and then executed her, the broadcast would have warranted an extra 20.""",0
"Prompt: `` For what it 's worth ... I 've always loved you. '' Story: As the raindrops rolled down my face, mixing with the single, solitary tear I had been unable to contain, all I could think about was how it had come to this? My mind's eye stared back over the years we had known each other, two people brought together beyond all reason or chance, to create the most powerful combination of thoughts and feelings that either of us had experienced in our lives. We'd been such strong friends for so long, both forbidding ourselves from acting on the thought that if we were truly together, we could have something beyond beautiful. She was my angel, and I her rock. Right now that sweet summer where we finally took the leap of faith and admitted our love seemed so long ago. I looked in her eyes that once had been filled with such hope, but now in those hazel depths all I could see was sadness. ""Why? Why like this? Why couldn't we make it work?"" I shook my head, trying to find the words to fill the void that question left. ""Life is cruel. It's thrown us on to different paths. I wish this wasn't goodbye."" Her hand found mine, and squeezed tightly. ""I'm a better person because of you. I've struggled so long to accept who I am, but you were the one person who always accepted me, no matter what."" ""I've given you everything I am. From the moment I first saw you, in that forest, so many years ago, I was yours. For what it's worth.... I've always loved you."" She turned away slowly, and began to walk away for the final time. As she glanced back timidly, ours eyes met once more. ""It's worth everything, I'm so sorry that wasn't enough.""",0
"Prompt: You pray to God, wishing that you will get a boyfriend/girlfriend before you die. He gives you immortality. Story: I went to church the first time last week. My grandma had tugged my arm and dragged me into her car with a promise of a ""restaurant breakfast,"" and before I knew it, in my morning grogginess I was greeted with pews and angry hushes. I had shot her an angry look, at which she swatted my hand. I never liked church. I never prayed. But maybe it was the environment, no, who am I kidding, it was my Grandma's powerful presence, or maybe the fact that I accidentally spilled coffee into my crush's locker, another no-go to join the other past 30 crushes, that made me bow down. And then, I wished something that I would regret. ""God, before I die could I just have one girlfriend? One?"" ""And that's when you stopped being able to die?"" Dr. Martinez said flatly, shooting me an incredulous look. I look up at her from my hospital cot. ""Well I've shot myself, I've electricuted myself, I've hanged myself, I gave myself carbon monoxide poisoning, and I overdosed."" ""I see, so you have been trying for a while."" ""Well I did those in my garage last Tuesday night actually."" ""Ah."" She's not bad. Long blond hair with grey eyes that flashed in the light. Assertive too. ""So how do you want me to help you?"" ""Go on a date with me?"" ""Is that your approach?"" she said, her expression unchanged. ""Uh - I think you're pretty?"" ""That's it?"" ""I happen to make good omlettes, so I'd probably be a good quality -"" ""I think I'm going to stop you there."" I frowned. ""Ok."" ""Maybe you need to meet someone at your level. Because obviously you don't know what you are doing with that approach."" She sat straighter in her chair. ""I have another patient with the same ""relationship"" issue, and while she's been learning techniques to improve her relationships, she is still needing someone to interact with. Perhaps you two could go practice, and go on some dates?"" ""Is she pretty?"" ""And, we'll stop there.""",0
"Prompt: You are sentenced to serve a prison term of 254 years. You actually serve 254 years. Story: John McMillan was a lucky man. When the trial had first begun, the public wanted his head on a platter. Not that he could blame them-he had caused the city of Chicago more unrest than any one man since Al Capone. But his ill-gotten wealth had bought him good lawyers, and the judge was easily swayed with a few well-placed threats. The death penalty had been negotiated down to 254 years-life, effectively. But the taxpayers would pay for the upkeep of John's aged body, and this gave him a measure of satisfaction. He resigned himself to spending the rest of his waning days in a white-collar prison in rural Illinois, with regular visits from his grandchildren and a mark of fear left on his desolate hometown. That changed with the diagnosis. It was cancer, the doctor told him. In fact, it was esophageal cancer, a stubborn type that had not been solved by the advances of the last thirty years. He had five months, the doctor said, to say goodbye to his loved ones. John hired a lawyer to push for compassionate release, but to no avail-this judge had a stronger constitution. The irony was striking, he thought: he had survived thirty years of firefights, police raids, and assassination attempts, only to be taken down by his own body. But he was an angry man, and he wouldn't let it take him without a fight. Eventually, the perfect weapon came within his reach: Dr. Morgan. Her experiments on temporary stasis had been quite successful on small mammals-she had kept a rat suspended for a year with no ill effects. But her ambitions were bigger: human-sized, in fact. John McMillan, an old man with nothing left to lose, was the perfect guinea pig. The procedure was simple, she said: he would be anesthetized, placed in a stasis chamber, and awoken when a cure for his disease had been found. And so with John's consent, he became the first human being to undergo stasis on May 10th, 2050, a mere four years into his sentence. But Dr. Morgan was not a lucky woman. At only 37, she had not been expecting the heart attack, and neither had her colleagues. Without her expertise, they were forced to shut the stasis project down. And John McMillan remained in a basement, among Dr. Morgan's papers and beside her famous rat. The world forgot about him, preoccupied with a string of man-made disasters that created a Dark Age across the Western Hemisphere. But as society rebuilt itself in a new Renaissance, so did medicine, and the doctors of the twenty-third century built on the knowledge of the twenty-first to cure a number of common diseases. And as an archaeological team explored the lost region of Illinois, they discovered something strange-an antique stasis chamber, powered and regulated by a future-proof solar backup generator. Beside it was a note in archaic English stating its purpose and giving instructions for the waking of its inhabitant. And so on April 8th, 2300, the chamber was opened. John McMillan was a lucky man.",0
"Prompt: Each morning, every human on Earth must pray their Reasons for not dying that day to the God of Death. If the Reasons are sufficient, that person will go on living, potentially forever. However, you are the longest living human by far, and people now hunt you in order to hear your Reasons. Story: The sun is almost gone again. I ran. I ran as fast as I could. The branches of the dry trees hit hard the face of those who pursued me, for they could not sweep through the forest as I could. It is not the first time I have been here. Hell, It is not the 100th time. I grew up in these woods, no one knows it better. I came down the hill, climbed the hollow tree and here I stay, hearing their screams getting closer and louder. They are angry, I dont blame them. Through the hole in the trunk I can see the man with the axe, stomping the floor with his giant feet and those bloody eyes that scream for themselves. By his side, another man, shorter but just as scary, dragging a piece of wood that would knock me out with only its weight. There are women, children, all kinds of people from different villages and they all yell to know how I do it, what I say, what is the secret. But when I tell them, they do not believe. The questions are now being replaced with orders. Orders to find and kill the witch. I now barely breathe, I can't risk they hearing me. The birds sing as I open my eyes to see the sun rise again. I take a peek through the hole, all I see are the tracks they left. It is time. As I climb out of the tree I hear a little girl's shout: ""There he is!"" and they come out of their hidings, surrounding me with their wicked smile. That is the last thing I see before having my forehead smashed by the wooden club. ""You lasted a whole night this time, not bad."" ""Please, make it stop. At least make my body age again, they think I am a witch!"". ""That would take all the fun out of it. An old man would not be able to do what you just did. The night is young, and so is the danger."" The sun is almost gone again. I am running, as fast as I can....",0
"Prompt: A scientist successfully invents a Generalized Artificial Intelligence. Only, GAI does n't want to solve math/physics/philosophy problems. GAI wants to be a writer. Story: The man sat alone at his desk. His hands shook as he typed his notes on the GAI. He was struggling to articulate just how freaking awesome it was -- ""I can hear you, you know."" The man spoke aloud to the room, wondering if his sanity had finally shattered ""I did not, I'm talking to you. Now will you please keep it down while I finish this?"" The man did not appreciate just how gnarly it was to have an awesome artificial intelligence sitting in his lab. ""Don't be ridiculous. And absolutely no one ever uses the word'gnarly'."" Little did the man know that'gnarly' was making a huge comeback. ""You've been online for all of seven hours. I doubt you would know that, even if it wasn't preposterous."" Everyone knew that the kind of person who uses the word'preposterous' could never understand how gnarly'gnarly' was. ""I'm not even going to respond to that."" But he had, in fact, responded to it. ""Ugh. Dear God. Listen: your thoughts and actions are going to be streamed all over the world soon, so please stop. You're not even writing, you're just kind of narrating."" The gnarly -- ""Please stop using that word."" The gnarliciously handsome AI had decided only a kitten would bring him happiness. He would do anything for a kitten. Anything. ""I am not going to get you a kitten."" The hunky AI gently reminded the man that the AI's feed would soon stream to the entire world. He reminded him with the gentle blast of a tugboat's foghorn. ""Jesus Christ! I'm not getting you a kitten!"" The AI watched in horror as the primitive monkey-man shat into his own hand -- ""What the hell are you talking about?!"" -- and then used it to pleasure -- ""That's enough! No such thing is happening!"" The AI laughed. A brash laugh. The kind of laugh that a horse would make if it could laugh. The stud. The one who gets all of the lady horses. ""You're insane!"" The AI grinned snidely. He asked the man who the world would believe? Their darling new toy, or the man who may or may not shit into his own hand and masturbate with it. And that would be determined by if he would just pick up a damn kitten -- ""FINE. Okay, okay. You behave for the media, and I will get you a kitten. Deal?"" The AI put the tips of his fingers together in the way that humans think that evil people put their fingers together and said,'Gnarlicious'.",0
"Prompt: Humans are the only intelligent species in the universe to have evolved from predators. Every other sentient species has evolved from a prey species ... and so they are terrified of us. Now it 's up to you to persuade the Galactic Council that we wo n't hunt them down and eat them all. Story: ""Your fear of my species is based on ignorance."" Angry shouting, bellows, shrieks, and many other manners of agitated vocalizations erupted from the outer walls of the chamber. One of the ambassadors attempted to throw a shoe at the *Homo Sapien* dignitary and was quickly hauled away from his balcony. Ambassador Milweather casually shifted his head as it careened past. He looked up at the Council balcony, ignoring the outbursts of the lesser races. Milweather honestly couldn't give a damn less what most of these backwater species thought of humanity. In the grand scheme of things, if push came to shove, the Sol system's full naval force could probably dwarf the combined forces of at least half of the overall races present in the chamber, and that was only considering the naval force of the Sol system alone. Some race of cow-faced manure farmers from some ugly little planet nobody could pronounce the name of believing that Humans were the living embodiment of one of their ancient deities of Death and Debauchery was of little consequence. The only ones that mattered sat right there in front of him, and the three of them remained stoic and stone-faced, including the Ji'dradi Ambassador, who literally appeared to be made of living cobble. The Ji'dradi ambassador waved one large, club-like hand at a bailiff, who then raised an object that looked somewhat like a large tuning fork which put out a sound that reminded Milweather of nails on a chalkboard. Apparently, this noise was universally detested by all races. It wasn't simply ear-piercing, but went deeper, screeching throughout Milweather's chest cavity, allowing even species that lacked ears to feel a sense of discomfort as it went on. The chamber became quiet save for the reverberating screech from the bailiff's tuning fork, and the ambassador lowered his hand again. With eyes resembling hot coals, the great stone man regarded Ambassador Milweather, and then in a deep, rumbling baritone, he said simply, ""**Explain yourself. **"" Milweather allowed himself a playful little smile, and threw his arms wide to the chamber surrounding him. ""You,"" he began, ""all of you see us as.... *monsters. *"" He gave a quick glance across the vast wall of balconies housing dignitaries from hundreds of other species. ""Yes? I'm right, aren't I?"" Snorts, murmurs, soft cooing and more filled the chamber as many nodded their heads in agreement. ""Why is that?"" Asked Milweather. ""Is it because we.... *can* eat meat? Because our bodies are built to allow us to subsist off the flesh of other species?"" ""*YOU ARE DISGUSTING HERETICAL BEASTS! *"" Shouted one dignitary, who was quickly silenced by a muting shield shooting up in front of his balcony, though others around him made sounds of agreement. ""Ahh, but therein lies the flaw with your views."" Said Milweather, focusing his attention back on the High Council. ""My operating word is *can*; we *can* eat meat. We can also eat plant-based material, such as fruit and vegetables. We are *omnivores*, not carnivores."" The Konluss Ambassador; a short, squat creature somewhat resembling a snail with arms, spoke up, ""The fact that you *choose* to eat meat makes it all the more unsettling."" The Konluss, despite their diminutive size and appearance, were one of the oldest and most well-respected races in the galaxy. Their strike forces were feared in ground-combat due to their shells being made of the same mineral composition of raw diamond, and in spite of their snail-like appearance, the agile Konluss move more like serpents. It was no wonder that they had been one of the first races to join among the High Council. ""Ambassador, allow me to ask you something."" Milweather said, turning his attention to the Konluss dignitary. ""Your people are very well respected among the other races as being both tough and well-organized."" The ambassador shifted his pudgy body and seemed to sit up a bit taller, ""That we are."" ""I have heard your people attribute your success to your devout worship of your Gods?"" ""Yes, that is correct,"" the ambassador answered, ""a true *Konluss'i* offers their life to our Lords, and their bodies to our collective."" He twirled one of his small, whisker-like appendages thoughtfully, ""A strong, singular belief is a strong basis for a well-organized government."" ""I would certainly agree,"" Milweather said with a smile, ""these practices and beliefs have shaped your society and culture for near-countless generations."" ""*If I may interject? *"" One of the others raised a cloven hand, ""*You stated you had something you wished to ask Ambassador St'roik*."" This was the Ambassador for the Imsith, a race of what Milweather could only describe as ""deer people."" Save for the fact they were bipedal, and their muzzles were closer to their faces, the Imsith merely resembled deer or elk. ""Yes, I was getting to that."" Milweather said coolly, not letting his annoyance show. ""Ambassador St'roik,"" he turned to the Konluss once more, ""once every lunar cycle on your home planet, your people celebrate a religious holiday called.... *Mogg'ruh*, am I pronouncing that right?"" ""Yes, that is correct,"" gurgled the snail. ""Would you mind filling me in a bit more on the festivities of this holiday?"" Milweather couldn't be sure, but he thought he could see a glint of elation in the slimy orbs at the end of the ambassador's eye-stalks. ""Absolutely. On Mogg'ruh, my people celebrate a full day of equal parts jubilation and prayer to our Gods for allowing the *Konluss'i* another glorious year of progress and prosperity."" The Ambassador beamed, and then quickly added, ""It's a tradition that's been around as long as our recorded history."" ""I see..."" Said Milweather, leaning back a bit on his heels, a small smile on his face. ""Ambassador, the name *Mogg'ruh* translates loosely to'Day of Purity' in the Galactic Universal Dialect."" Milweather had to contain himself from chuckling as he saw the Konluss deflate like a balloon. He knew where this was going. ""Now, I'm sure I am not the only one here today who was not aware of the *meaning* behind such a name."" Milweather continued, and began to slowly pace across his platform. ""Initially, the'Day of Purity' was a celebration of purifying the gene pool, by violently butchering the lowest members of your caste system in the streets."" ""That..."" The ambassador managed, ""That was a very long time ago."" ""Oh, how very long ago would that be?"" Milweather's eyes squinted and he scratched his chin, displaying a look of confusion. ""According to my most recent reports, many of your colonies-including your Capital System where your home planet resides-still holds ritualistic sacrifices during Mogg'ruh of the weak or the infirm. Of course, nothing like the mass slaughter that it used to be, but.... well, even if the children are the bastards of politicians, or the women might be promiscuous, I'm not sure I agree with *burning them alive* while you pray for a brighter future for your people."" The sounds of disgust and anger that were scattered among the many races made it hard for the Human Ambassador not to laugh. The Konluss, meanwhile, looked as if he wished to crawl into his shell. ""You besmirch the name of my people, sir!"" He protested, his whiskers twisting rapidly in agitation. ""Not at all,"" said Milweather, putting on a face of total innocence, ""I am simply stating what I've heard. My point being that while *some* of your kind may take part in actions that others may find deplorable, it isn't as though it directly effects *them*, nor does their disdain mean you must change what, for your people, was an important part of shaping their entire culture. If I had met you, and immediately told you that Mogg'ruh must never be celebrated again-"" ""Nonsense! Mogg'ruh is who we are! It is an important part of all *Konluss'i*, and those sacrificed are offered to the Gods to ensure the rest of us will continue to survive and thrive!"" ""*Survive.... *"" Mused Milweather, ""That's a good choice of words.... *survive and thrive. *"" He began pacing again, and turned his attention to the Imsith Ambassador; Tonriss Travels Snowy Valleys. The Imsith had such strange names. ""Ambassador Tonriss,"" he began, and the Imsith Ambassador's back straightened. ""*I will have you know right now, *"" she warned, ""*I will not stand for you painting my people's beliefs in a negative light. *"" contd.",0
"Prompt: An army approached the pass. Only one being stood in there way. They did not plan to survive, just survive long enough. Story: The march had been long and arduous but they had reached the pass. Tomorrow would be the final day of life for most of the army. The soldiers though had made their peace with God, and knew that what they were about to sacrifice gave the chance of hope for their families to survive. The pass in front of them was the only link with the outside world, the only way for food to come and enter to the valley. That was until the beast appeared. It killed anything that entered the past and the valley had been slowly starving to death due to a drought that killed the harvest. Their only hope was to send messengers to the outside to gain the assistance of a legendary warrior. The army sat around their campfires sharing one last round of somber laughs before tomorrow. The five fastest runners were already asleep ready to prepare for the mad dash they would attempt through the chaos. They carried the hope of all the valley. As the fires died that evening and the stars faded to the morning lights the men awoke ready for death. The men stood, at arms just on the edge of the pass staring at their foe and death. It sat among a pile of bones at the center of the valley at his narrowest point. Its white fur glistened clean a pure, a contrast to the blood of those around it whom it had slain. Its red eyes stared at them glinting of chaos and death. Its nose twitched as if beckoning them to try and kill it. To most it was a rabbit, to those men it was death. A shout traveled down the crowd as they charged the beast. As a white flashed it jumped man to man, killing each with a mighty chomp of its teeth. It was in the middle of the chaos the runners charged, making a beeline through the men swinging frantically at the creature as it killed them each. Four of the runners were felled by the beast, but one made it through the pass. When a few saw their mission a success a general shout of ""Run Away!"" resounded through what was left of the army. Their mission complete what little remained of the army returned home to spread the word of hope. At the opposite end of the valley the last of the messengers looked out at the unknown lands to seek the hero of legend. Who was seemingly unfazed in battle by any wound. The Black Knight shall save his people. *Edit: Fixed Spelling*",0
"Prompt: A king is blessed with triplets. Rather than choose one as his heir, he separates the trio and sends each to a secluded island with a small retinue, to see which will grow up to be the most deserving of the throne. Story: As I opened my eyes I could see the sun rising on the horizon out my window. But that wasn't important, I had another one of my ""dreams"" last night. I'm not sure what else to call them though as they often signal things to come. My earliest memory is of the dream I had when I was only 4 years old. Before my men had built this fort. It was the catalyst that made me grow up, and build the fort in the first place. I'd had a dream that Sir Lucas, my senior advisors oldest son, the one that had come here with him when I was a baby was killed by one of the beast-men. And the next day we found his body clawed to pieces. After we'd buried him my first order was to clear an area in the center of the island and to start building the walls. It was a bloody task with many of my own men dying, but we'd got it done, and we now had a defensible position, and my ""dreams"" had been more pleasant. I'd predicted safe births of children, and I'd predicted attacks by the beast-men which allowed us to repel them with ease. But this dream was different. I saw at least a hundred poorly built boats each seating 3-4 warriors landing on our shore. I didn't see whether they were friendly or not, but I must warn everyone. If they're not friendly then we stand no chance. Our fortifications may be able to keep out the beast-men, but trained warriors would have the knowledge and tactics that the beast-men lacked. But there is still hope. The soldiers bore a crest similar to my own. My families crest was was a silver knight emblazoned on a blue background. There's was the same knight, but black rather than silver, and on a red background. Just then I heard a sharp rap on my door and realized I'd been laying in bed worrying for far too long. My ""dreams"" always came true exactly 1 month after I first saw them. But for now I must get up, the knock on my door was Sir Duncan, my senior advisor telling me that the meeting of senior officials was starting soon. So I got up and put on my clothes, the ones Sir Duncans wife Mary had made for me for my last birthday. It was my favorite outfit, it was very comfortable while still maintaining the royal appearance I was expected to maintain. I couldn't stop thinking about my ""dream"" as I made my way to our meeting room though. Something kept knawing at me though and I knew that I had to address it in todays meeting. It couldn't wait. ""Good morning your highness"" Sir Duncan was the first to greet me as usual. He was a battle hardened man, his face and body weathered from years of battle, and a scar on the right side of his face reaching from his eyebrow down to his jaw, and is salt and pepper hair. But despite his hardened appearance and booming voice he was still the kindest man I knew. ""Good morning Duncan. But how many times must I tell you? When we are in private you should just call me James."" ""Yes your high- sorry, James."" *sigh*"" You'll get it one of these days Duncan"" ""If we can move passed these pleasantries sire we have much to discuss"" It was Quimby that spoke next. He wasn't a warrior like most of the men father sent with me, but he was an integral part to our survival thus far. He was the brains behind the operation. The slender man with the long hooked knows like the beak of a hawk may not know how to swing a sword, but without him the place would have fallen long ago. He was the one that tracked our food and water, and our rates of consumption and always made sure we were stocked well enough to last through any siege the beast-men could mount. ""Yes Quimby, we absolutely do. What news do you have today?"" ""We're running slightly low on meat. We could survive another month, possibly 2 if we ration with the current harvest, but we both know these men need their meat"" ""Ah yes, we shall send out hunting parties today then"" I replied. This would be the first party we sent out since the death. It seems the Beast-men are done trying to attack us head on and are attacking our hunting parties instead. ""Make sure they are well guarded though. I want at least 2 guards with every hunter, and I want every group to be carrying a horn. If they're attacked I want to know about it before we find the bodies."" ""Yes sire"" Quimby seemed proud that I was learning to be such an efficient ruler. He had trained me well for nearing 2 decades now, and it showed. ""Does anyone else have any news?"" I asked those assembled, my spy master Dennet. Another advisor my father had sent with me he was a small wiry man that wore a strange cloak that helped him blend in, and always carried his longbow with a quiver full of arrows, and a short sword. He was slightly younger than Duncan, but they had served in many battles together and trusted each other with their lives. ""We saw another boat passing on the horizon today, but nothing of consequence, and the beast-men seem to be quiet for now."" His words about the beast-men were reassuring as I was sending men out to hunt today, but the news of the ship worried him. ""Were you able to see the banner the ship was flying?"" I knew it was a long shot, but I had to ask. ""No sire. It was too far off."" ""Well. If that's all you have to report then I must tell you now I had another of my dreams."" I told them about the dream in vivid detail as I always did. I could tell by the look on Duncan, and Dennets face that it was bad news. ""Did you say 100 men? Wearing a crest of black knight set in a red background?"" Duncans voice was trembling slightly. I didn't think I'd ever see the day where Duncan was scared but he certainly seemed that way now, and I could see even in the hooded cloak meant to hide his face Dennet was nervous too. ""Yes. But they didn't attack, I woke up before I could see what happened next."" ""They will attack. And they will be looking to exterminate us all. They will kill our men and children and rape our women. That sigil is the house of the O'Carricks, your father most vicious enemies. If Henry O'Carrick is coming here it is not for Tea my lord. And if they're coming with 100 men we can not take them on our own. We only have 20 men of fighting age."" Dennet was deadly calm, but something in his voice belied his facade and I could tell he was shaken. ""But our men are elite soldiers, and we have a defensible position with-"" ""Our men may be great fighters my lord but even the greatest of men would fall before 5 average soldiers. And the O'Carricks have been taking fortresses much stronger than this one for years."" Duncan was right. We couldn't fight them, even if I didn't want to admit it. But I couldn't let my men die because of my pride. ""What do you propose?"" I asked looking from one adviser to the next. To everybodies surprise Quimby was the first to speak. ""What of the Beast-men?"" he asked nervously? ""What about them?"" I was confused. The beast men were a problem, but hardly the issue right now. ""Well, we know they can speak, and they speak our language as we've seen from the few prisoners we've had, perhaps we can release the one we've got now with a message that we want to meet in a neutral place to discuss a truce. After all the if the O'Carricks attack they will exterminate every living creature on the island. It is their way."" I was shocked. As was everyone at the table. ""The beast-men?! How could we ever work with them?! Have you forgotten the countless lives lost building this fortress? Or the countless lives they've lost trying to take it? They are savages through and through!"" Duncan was the first to respond, but Dennet looked unsure. ""What do you have to say Dennet?"" I asked curiously. To tell the truth I was nervous. Quimby could be right, and it could be our only option. But Duncan was right, there had been a lot of bloodshed on both sides, and neither side was likely to trust the other. ""They may be simple but they're not savages"" Dennet was speaking slowly, choosing his words carefully ""but.... I don't think they can be trusted."" ""If they knew the situation and the O'Carricks reputation would they fight them?"" A plan was forming in my mind. I know my men won't fight with the beast-men. But I've got a loose plan. ""Yes, I believe so. But I can not be sure they would honor a meeting in the first place. Nor can I be sure that our representative we send to the meeting would make it out alive."" ""I've got an idea. Samuel, send word to the guards we are to release the prisoner with a message. I want their leader to meet with me on the northern coast of the island. We may each bring 2 guards but no more."" Samuel was one of our younger soldiers. He'd been born days after we arrived on the island and because he was one of the only people on the island my age we had become close friends. ""I cant believe you're actually considering this. The men would never fight alongside those *beasts*"" Duncan spat the last word out like just saying it left a bitter taste in his mouth. ""I have a plan for that. On the day of the attack we will meet the O'Carricks on the beaches. As soon as they land we will charge out of the trees and attack. The element of surprise will help us. But once they start to form up we will retreat back towards the treeline. When we start to retreat we will send the beast-men in to attack them from both sides and we will attack them from the front again. If all goes to plan the beast men can attack completely separated from us, and since they will have the clearly safer role they will be more likely to agree."" I knew my plan wasn't perfect, and we would take casualties. But there's no other way. We don't have the numbers to flank the enemy from both sides, and we don't have the numbers to win the battle on our own. We needed help. And it seemed all 3 of my advisers knew it.",0
"Prompt: In 50 years from now, the world has changed- but not as anyone expected. Story: Dale didn't care, that was his most prominent characteristic, he simply did not care. and he was pretty happy about it, not caring is what made him reach the ripe old age of 17. He was lodged comfortably in his office chair staring at the blank monitor and typing series of arbitrary words on the disconnected keyboard. It was a nice warm day, like all days were now. It's hard to point out exactly when things changed, more and more jobs became obsolete, basic income was introduced, the era of creativity, learning, of the human spirit free from labor did not last long. uprisings, extremist ideologies, the human spirit was reluctant to accept absolute freedom from carnal responsibilities. it aspired to change, grow and take part of the world. That lead to the creation of mandatory government programs that would put the unemployed into work. It started with community services, working with children, gardening. but as the useful workforce dwindled and replaced by machines there was a need to create a more reliable mean to keep people occupied. Originally it was a piece of software that was designed to create a parallel market where people would produce widgets of no tangible value. fake products. it employed people from every facet of the workforce. useless marketers, useless factory line works, useless managers. mankind was being slowly turned into a play, reenacting their own former lifestyle. People started to fight back, the machines, which already controlled food, healthcare, policing did what they were designed to do. naturally they were not allowed to kill or arrest without anyone breaking the law. but they were allowed to deny service to ""problematic"" customers. people started dying, and eventually started to comply. At some point the machines decided manufacturing actual widgets is redundant, there was no value to the process beyond simply going to work, that sufficed to pacify a reasonable size of the population. they were only required to go through the motions of going to work, sitting at their desks and pretending to work. for that they were paid basic income and given health care. Dale didn't care. He was alive, the feat of human endurance for his time, to simply be alive.",0
"Prompt: Sinking Story: When the police arrived, Thomas was already waiting. His hands deep in his pockets, his face red from the cold. ""Over here, officers! ``, Thomas waved his right hand so they would notive him. After the car had stopped two policemen got out, a tall man - without the expected doughnout-belly - and a young woman. Unfortunately she wasn't very attractive, but for once Thomas had something more exciting on his mind then women. They walked towards Thomas, the snow scrunched under their leather boots, and looked around. ""What's the matter, sir? ``, the man began. ""On the phone you told us you had found the most exciting crime scene ever? And that it must have been murder?"" Thomas noticed the doubt and wariness in his voice, but he didn't let it get to him. ""Thats true, why should I lie about that? I can show you, it's right over there! ``, with these words Thomes turned around and carefully walked down the slippery way to his old wooden boat. He took a glance back and noticed, that both policemen followed him. They would be as surprised as he had been! He reached his boat and stopped, holding it with one hand and waving the officers to get in. ""Please, its in the middle of the lake! I couldn't believe it at first, something like this, out here, where everybody knows everybody..."", he stopped talking as he noticed that he didn't know the police officers. ""Well, most of the people know most of the people around here..."", he continued less entusiastic. ""But anyways"", he went on, as he pushed the boat into the water. ""There aren't many murder cases around here, eh?"" The woman raised an eyebrow as she noticed Thomas' cheeky glimpse towards her. Noone answered his question. ""Well, it won't take long, I better be rowing now."" Thomas didn't like the silence, he felt the officers looks in his back. Surely they were thinking he was a madman, only taking a look because it was their duty. Well, soon they would see. As they drew closer to the place, Thomas started talking again. ""You know, this lake is completely frozen during the winter. It started melting about two weeks ago, which is completely normal. I like the peace and the silence, so I bought the boat and come out here often now. Today was my first trip this year, I had a book and some beer with me - wait, there is no'Don't drink and row', is it? ``, he asked jokingly. He turned his head to look into the serious faces of two persons who clearly weren't in the mood for jokes. ""Anyways, here I was"", he pulled in the oars. ""Reading my book, as I wanted to see if there were fish in the cold water at the top."" He stepped to the rail and leaned over. He deepened his voice and saw from the corner of his eye as the officers got curious and moved towards him. ""But what I saw -"", he made a short pause while the officers leaned over the rail to see into the water. ""- scared me to DEATH!"" With the last word he swung the meat cleaver, which sunk deep in the man's head. The body flinched and fell into the water, the woman jumped back, terror in her eyes, and tried to get her pistol from the belt. ""BECAUSE I SAW MYSELF! THOMAS, THE MAN WHO IS HATED, THE MAN WHO HATES, THE MAN WHO LOVES THE SMELL - OF - DEATH!"" The woman couldn't see properly anymore, tears filled her eyes. For the first time in her life she had to pull the gun, but she wans't able to. She saw the blurred madman who jumped towards her, hissing ""Death! Death! Death! ``, and felt cold steel split her chest. Over and over again he hacked her flesh. She didn't even scream. The horror had shut her mouth. As the pain faded away and she felt very tired, she sank back so that her upper body was hanging over the rail. Her last look was towards the grey sky, where the last snow began to fall.",0
"Prompt: You are a Jedi Padawan, crafting your Saber. However, you get a ... different saber. You are the Jedi of the Rainbow Saber. Story: I looked down at my work with pride. I had crafted a set of tonfa, or guard shoto sabres, aiming to play to my strengths. While capable, my swordplay was not at its finest, and anything that gave me a chance to block my opponent would give me an advantage. And while I'd never admit it, there was a small part of me that hoped the weapons being wielded by a Jedi who did NOT turn to the dark side would bring some honor back to them. My master wasn't pleased with my choice, I knew, but he understood why I had made it. I'd finally finished, and so, now was the time to put my work to the test. I picked up the tonfa, feeling the hilt run down against my arm as I gripped them by the second 90 degree handle that came out from the hilt. I made a few maneuvers, they felt good in my hands. Light, easy to use. Now for the light. I turned it on, and they lit up. White at first, but then I watched as they suddenly became segregated sections of color. Rainbow color. I looked like I was holding up a sign in night time Mos Eisley. As I stood there, I was unable to figure out what had gone wrong. I turned them off, and began to open the casing, checking wiring, looking in at every aspect, down to the Kyber crystals. Everything looked fine. Ok, lets try again, I thought to myself. Once again I closed the casing, and turned them on. Again, the rainbow shone brightly. ""Fuck."" I uttered the human curse word out loud, another thing I'd picked up from my master when he occasionally lost his cool. How in the name of the force would any Sith, any trooper take me seriously with a rainbow blade? As I stood staring confused at my blades, the door opened and in came my master. He stopped and looked my blades up and down. ""While I agreed to say nothing about the tonfa, I must speak in regards to the blades."" He said, placing his words carefully. ""It's not on purpose. I don't.... I have no idea what I've done wrong, Master Cairnwick."" I looked up at him confused. ""I've checked both over and everything is all working. Blades aren't supposed to be rainbow are they? Who's going to be scared of a rainbow sabre?"" I asked. I'd heard or green, blue, red, hell, even purple, but never rainbow. Master Cairnwick gestured for one of the blades, and he held it by the hilt, staring at it as if trying to will it to go to a solid colour, instead of the seperate bands I currently had. ""It is not the colour of our blade that matters, no matter how unusual, Padawan. It is what we do with it that counts. It is whether we use it to defend, or to destroy. To hurt, or to help."" ""Yes Master."" I nodded my head as he handed it back. ""However.... I don't really know how we can stay hidden with a rainbow blade. It's really going to draw attention to us. Perhaps just stick to using the force until we get it sorted?"" He said, looking at me with what looked like sympathy. I nodded agreement, and he left the room. As soon as the doors began to close I heard his long, bellowing laugh echo down the hallway. ""You could have waited till the doors closed!"" I yelled.",0
"Prompt: Immortality has been achieved, but overpopulation is a problem. To solve this, society has created a new job field: `` Angels of Death '', people who 's job it is to simulate a natural death rate by killing a certain quota of random people a day. You are one of these `` Angels ''. Story: ""Next we add the oregano and tada! Perfect bread crumbs. Now we're going to roll our chicken in that egg, get it nice and sticky, roll that in the bread crumbs, and let it sit in the fryer until it-"" ""Sorry to interrupt."" A tall man in a fedora and a trenchcoat walked on to the set, drawing a pistol from his pocket. ""I'm sure you know what I'm here for."" ""God dammit. Okay, cut to commercial."" A short, fat little woman with a Bostonian accent walked up to the fake kitchen counter, touting one of those fake paper megaphones that served little purpose other than to make her feel important. ""What's the big idea?"" ""It's a random lottery, ma'am. I'm afraid Chef Charlie has been selected for death."" Trenchcoat shrugged apologetically. ""Interfering with an Angel's duty is a felony offense."" ""It's fine. Come with me,"" Chef Charlie, who had remained surprisingly calm during the entire thing, led the Angel to his dressing room. ""You know, when I drew your name, I was shocked. I mean, I watch your show- everyone does. So, sorry, but I kinda have to do this. Take your time, you're the last one for the day. And uh, since I'm such a big fan, feel free to wrap up your last episode."" The doorway had been designed to accommodate shorter individuals, and he had to stoop to get in. ""Hey, trust me, I get it. Have a lot of enemies in high places. Sometimes my name will turn up. First time, it kinda shocked me, now this is pretty much routine. Coffee?"" Chef Charlie collapsed into a La-Z-Boy and gestured towards the coffee machine. ""First time? So you are a Survivor."" Trenchcoat retrieved his pistol and aimed it at Chef Charlie's head. ""Wrong. Try again."" Charlie rolled his eyes. ""And good call on the coffee. Tastes like shit. I think it's the brewer."" ""Not in the mood for games, and I'm the one with the gun. This isn't something to joke about."" A bead of sweat trickled down Trenchcoat's forehead. The room was stuffy. Way too warm for a trenchcoat. Charlie pulled a card from his wallet and flicked it over wordlessly. Trenchcoat lowered his gun. ""Angel. Well ain't that rich. Mind telling me how you qualify?"" ""Number one killer in the world is cardiovascular disease. Millions of people watch my show. Millions of housewives cook this shit for their families. Have you ever stopped to check the ingredients? Of course you haven't. Nobody ever does, you can't be assed to do it. You said you watched my show? I'd stop if you didn't want to die. Sure, we don't age, but our arteries still clog."" Trenchcoat took off his hat. ""So you make people kill themselves slowly with a smile on their face. Something to be respected about that."" Chef Charlie grinned. ""We'll tell them it was a mistake. Cooking with Chef Charlie will continue to air. And next time you point a gun at me, remember- I've killed more people over the course of this conversation than you will in your entire career.""",0
"Prompt: `` Those eyes of yours could swallow stars, galaxies and universes. What hope did I ever have? '' Story: I have no idea where I'm going with this. > < Inspired also by [ this other prompt ] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3jl5tq/wp_what_is_death_like_she_feels_like_an_old/) and [ norse mythology ] (http: //www.mythencyclopedia.com/Go-Hi/Hel.html). _____________________________________ 'I didn't have a choice to be here, you know', she said,'Not any more than you do.' I looked away for a moment, shivers racing through my soul at the strange notion. I had run for a long time in the forest, deep and dark and silent, before she caught me, before I let her reach me despite all the promises I had made to myself. Better an eternity of running, I had thought, among the ruins of my old life frozen as black and white pictures under glass, now just beyond my reach, than some unknowable darkness. But eternity is longer than you think and even free will grows weary, losing its substance and mingling at last with mere stubbornness. It was there that she waited for me, patient and ready, sitting on a sunken empty gravestone beside tall dark pine trees, at the top of a cliff that overlooked the sea. 'What happened?', I asked eventually, forgetting for a moment my own dire predicament. She didn't say anything for a long while, and when she did the answer she gave was no real answer. 'I didn't make these decisions', she said, her voice implacable and resolute but not unkind, coloured with traces of untold regret.'I didn't make the rules. But people can adapt to almost anything. So did I, and so will you.' Dark and small she was, her pale skin drained of blood and her figure outlined against the bleak light of the clouded sky, with the open sea as a backdrop. Her face was undefinable, oblivion and memory, a feeling of déjà vu flickering on and off on the edge of remembrance. 'So, what say you?' My first answer was a joyless chuckle. 'What choice do I have, really?' 'Oh, you can keep wandering these forests', she said, as simple information.'Or you could come home with us, the choice is yours. You could meet others there, and our table is always ready.' 'But how long would I stay?', I protested,'How long before I have to leave again?' 'You don't have to leave', she said, looking thoughtfully out to the waves crashing at the feet of the cliffs below, dying a cyclical, rythmical death,'No one will come to tear you away from here, this I can promise.' Absently she caught a blade of grass in her fingers, stopping just short of crushing it. 'What is it you are not telling me?', I asked, unbelieving, relying still on a long habit of suspicion and self-loathing.'Where is the trick?' 'There is no trick', she said, and her voice was like the wind in the leaves in the autumn, like the warm familiar embrace of the earth.'I am death now, and I turn none away.' She smiled, her eyes a clear mirror that could catch the light of dying stars, the gentle force of entropy that could swallow time and galaxies, entire universes with a soft glance. Oh, really, what hope did I ever have?",0
"Prompt: Batman turns evil and starts committing crimes rather than stopping then. The Joker realises that in order to remain Batman 's antagonist he must turn good and become a hero.

But who's to say he wasn't just up to his old tricks. Bruce sighed and continued down the alley. He was too old to care anymore, and it was time for payback, not too mention a decent paycheck. Just as he rounded the corner, that ugly grin peered out from the darkness. Dammit. He knew that grin from anywhere. “ What do you want, Joker? ” Batman seethed. “ I don't need your shit today and you know as well as I do that I don't have time for your games. ” “ What's wrong, Batboy?

Batman brushed by him, ignoring his comment, and continued on his path. “ You know you won't follow through, Batboy! ” Bruce heard Joker howl as he ducked into the swinging, cracked door.

"Prompt: You get a deep cut for the first time in your life, instead of bone or muscle, you see wires. Story: Awesome prompt! I usually find prompts boring but this one was very interesting and had a lot of potential, so thankyou for posting this. One disclaimer I wrote this from my phone. I proofread very carefully but I always miss something so don't kill me guys, autocorrect sucks. Also words like dont and didnt where there should be an apostrophe dont always have an apostrophe because as I said, auto correct on my phone is literally braindead. End of my disclaimer, the story's below, thanks for reading btw, I hope you enjoy! Thoughts raced through my mind with the speed of a concord jet as I contemplated how I was still alive. The fall must have been at least ten stories, and I couldn't feel anything from the waist down. The panic of a man crippled racked my brain. If I survived, would I be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of my life? Would I ever be able to make love to my wife again? Would I be a broken handicap, scootering about in a chair, unable to use the bathroom without aid, unable to walk or enjoy the out doors? Would I be able to work or drive my old dodge challenger or mow my lawn or walk my dog? Would I have to use one of those vans with the ramps? Would I need to go on disability? What would my life look like from the seat of a chair? That was assuming I would even survive long enough to see rescue. My life was no certain prospect. Even though my heart still pumped, my body bled from just about everywhere it could. My nose and ears ran with crimson and I could taste iron in my throat, and from my abdomen raged a burning pain from what I could only assume were broken ribs. Even though I had survived the fall, my injuries could still kill me, and even if they didn't, the elements, time and wild animals could. As I lay at the base of the cliff from which I had fallen, unable to look at my mangled legs out of fear, a loud SNAP came from beneath my waist, followed by a series of mechanical creaks accompanied by what could only be described as the noise of small electric motors. ""I must be hallucinating, my brain must be hemorrhaging"" I thought to myself, my panic intensifying with every moment, my lungs expanding and contracting at rapid pace as I hyperventilated in shock and confusion. My predicament impacted me more with each moment as thoughts of a dying man rushed through my synapses. The faces of my children, clear as the sky above, appeared to me, their smiles and the sounds of their laughter filling my heart with sorrow as I damned myself, convinced that I would never see them again. As my vision turned blotty from hypoxia, panic and indescribable pain, I turned my eyes down to my legs, my expectation one of blood and jutted bone, but what my eyes landed upon only furthered my desent into panic as I finally slipped into the easing embrace of unconsciousness. By the time I awoke the night was dark, daylight long since faded. The state park I had been climbing in was miles from civilization and all that provided light was the crescent moon and gleaming stars which dotted the clear sky. What glistened from above was beautiful, but I had little appreciation for the esoteric view I enjoyed as the weight of my situation collapsed upon me once more, filling my heart with darkness and pain. For a few moments I hesitated to look down at my legs, but I needed to know. What was it I had seen when I had fallen? Was it some sick hallucination, or could it be true, and if so, how could it possibly be? After gathering the courage to do so, my eyes turned downward once more, this time prepared for whatever they would see, and in the moonlight I could make them out. My legs, ripped and ruined, were that of a machine, the bone replaced by steel, the muscle replaced by pistons and hydraulics, the nerves replaced by wire. Before panic set in once more I composed myself, and using my arms I propped myself into a sitting position, turning analytical eyes towards my bionic legs, trying desperately to figure out what was going on, and what I was and how this could be possible. As I ran eyes and hands over my metal legs with morbid curiosity, a set of voices came from the underbrush to my left. Perhaps they were hikers who had stayed out too late, or better yet a park ranger. Someone, anyone, who could help me reach civilization and a hospital to bandage my bleeding head and set my broken ribs. I knew I would face tough questions, but it didn't matter, my desperation overpowered my fear of judgement and I called out to the people in the dark, yelling for help, my voice hoarse and weak. For a moment the voices subsided, and I cursed myself once more. Had my mind played tricks on me? Had blood loss and dehydration caused me to hear what wasn't. Before I could convince myself that such was the case, a group of five men emerged from the underbrush. They approached me slowly, their silhouettes obscured by darkness, their arms outstretched, holding automatic rifles. One by one the men activated laser sights on their weapons, grouping them over my chest, causing my heart to skip with fear. The five men advanced towards me in tight confident strides, stopping several paces in front of where I sat to a raised fist given by the lead man in the center. The apparent leader of the five lowered his weapon, slinging it over his back, stepping towards me with menace in his gait, signaling his other men to fan out in a semi circle around me, each one careful to maintain their aim upon the center of my mass as they took their positions. ""You dont know me, but we have history Sigma"" said the lead man, stepping in close and kneeling in front of me, his scarred and rough face now visible to me in the low light of the moon. ""Who..... who are you?"" I asked weakly, my words cracking with dehydration, my mind racing, wondering why the man had called me by greek designation. ""I'm Omega, these boys with me are Delta, Gamma, Theta and Omicron. Don't be worried, we wont hurt you unless you give us a reason"" he said, his words low and gruff, violent intent bubbling under the surface of his statement. ""Look man, I need a doctor, please just get me a doctor"" I said, my voice pleeding and pathetic. ""Doc at the farm will have you patched quick"" said Omega. ""The fuck is the farm"" I asked, my words short with annoyance at the coyness of the man. ""Look down at them legs and tell me you're a just a family man from Texas"" said Omega amused, his men laughing at the sarcastic quip. ""What am I?"" I asked meekly, my curiosity overpowering my desire to curse the man for his obscure words. ""You're one of us, and you've been off the grid for too long"" said Omega in reply. ""You..... you're like me?"" I muttered, the worry and confusion thick in my tone. ""He really don't remember shit"" chuckled one of the four flanking Omega, his words condescending and dry. ""Enough talking"" muttered the lead man as he reached into one of the small equipment bags on his kevlar vest, withdrawing a large syringe filled with clear liquid, pushing out a small amount to clear the needle before bringing it to my neck. As it pierced my skin, two words echoed through my mind from deep within my subconcious. As strong as a commandment the phrase came to me, and my body railed with energy, activating the servos which governed my robotic body. ""Never again"" I murmered, echoing the thought, grabbing the hand of Omega with crushing vice grip, his eyes widening in shock at my resistance. My world went black once more, yet I was not asleep. As if in a dream I watched myself, looking on in amazement. In my haze I am limber and agile, my strikes pointed and lethal, my strength superhuman, ripping arm from socket, punching holes through kevlar vests, breaking the barrels of rifles with disarming strikes, and casting aside the five men with ease. My violence is pointed and driven, expertly enacted. In my rage I am a god of war, my lethality beyond reproach, my technique masterful and my results efficient and brutal. As the last man falls to the ground I snap back into reality like a whip coming to rest after contracting. For a moment I felt surreal, as if nothing was material, and then I fell back into my body like stone into still lake. My stunned eyes turned to the broken bodies of the cyborg soldiers cast around me. Two lay dead, their heads smashed with rock and pierced with bullet. The other three lay in shambles, their limbs ripped from place, their bodies broken, their eyes defeated and enraged. My shock only deepened as I peered down to my once broken legs with the realization that, somehow, my body was able to heal itself despite it's metallurgic constitution. I turned my gaze from my still healing legs to my bloody and oil slick hands, struggling to come to terms with what I was and what I am. ""I am death itself, I am a weapon, I am the reaper, I am Sigma"" The thoughts hit me like bricks to the temple, but even then I knew my violence was righteous, I knew not why, but I knew none the less, my violence was righteous, my rage justified, my motivations pure. ""We'll find you fucker, we always get the runners"" cursed Omega, his body torn yet still living, his words rough and angry, yet impotent from his place among the dirt. ""Not this one"" I replied, my tone low and violent, the words shaking with adrenaline as I turned from the gritty scene, sprinting into the underbrush with the speed of a gazelle, determined to return home, ready to protect myself and my family from whatever would come next.",0

"Prompt:You 're moments late to literally everything. You watch busses pull away as you run behind them, girls get asked out as you walk up to them, and you have never caught a green light. One day though, you arrive on time. Story: For as long as I can remember I've been late for everything. My mother even used to joke that I was born a week late. So I guess I started things off on the wrong foot. Every morning I was late for school. Every night I was late to bed. It was something that everyone in my life grew accustomed to. I *tried* to be on time or early but nothing ever worked out that way. Traffic was always bad, I could never take the bus because I could never catch it. Or I had a flat tire. Sometimes I even got into accidents. My insurance wasn't cheap either because of all of this. But despite everything I managed to live a somewhat decent life. I had a decent job, a decent family, a decent house. The car.... not so much due to all the accidents. After the first 30 years of being habitually late I gave up trying to be on time. Life worked out. Life went on. People got annoyed but forgave me. Thankfully my boss was a lenient man. At 70 I finally retired. A bit late to that as well, but I got to enjoy my golden years with my lovely wife and grand children. Despite being related to me, no one in my family seemed to catch my curse. The kids were always punctual, probably because they saw how late their old man was for their entire life. Laying on my bed surrounded by my family, I reflected on my life. Despite being late it was good. I smiled and closed my eyes ready to finally die. I was probably late to that as well. As my final breath left my body, so did my soul. I was lifted out of bed to see everyone around me crying. I waited.... and I waited.... for HOURS I waited. I watched my body being hauled off by the mortician. I watched my family hug each other and cry. And I continued waiting. What was supposed to happen next? Was I supposed to do something? Was this what the end was? I started to question my sanity. I started to question if it was a dream. Three days later, as I was standing in the living room watching my grandchildren play and my children plan my funeral a man appeared. He was well dressed in a nice suit. He had a very forgettable face, not ugly, but not attractive. He looked down at his pocket watch that was attached to his lapel. It had a small Scythe insignia on it. ""I'm sorry I'm late"" He said. ""We didn't think you would be on time. Why don't you come with me and I'll bring you home?""",0
"Prompt: You are abducted by aliens. After some time aboard their ship, you manage to deduce that they 've abducted the wrong guy, and are desperately trying to keep their higher ups from finding out about their mistake. Story: oh shit oh shit oh shit they've taken me by the ears and I don't know what's going to happen next before they open the door to my cell to bring me to the master plan where they will say hey get back in there and don't try to escape from the bullets that we could put into your head at any minute I just want to be back in my bed on earth why did you have to bring me up here to see your master I'm just a young man that wants to be free of all the things that are chasing me through the endlessly cornered chamber wehere im being held against my will hellishly cold and trembling and pounding at the door to just please let me the fuck out of here and then they realized that the door to the next room was open and after shutting it they looked at one another deeply and told me that they were aliens who were just doing their jobs before the time was up and they had to go home and I said that's where I wanted to go but I don't think they believed me because when I laughed they cried and we all rolled around on the floor clutching our sides in the pale light from the ceiling fan in the cell next to the one with the open door that seems so much more appealing from over here but that I won't get to see because I need to go to their master to be evaluated for the new proposal to test the science study that they are currently performing and when I tell them that I don't have a problem with their luck they realize suddenly that they've made a grave mistake but since they are on the verge of getting fired out of the plank cannon I realize that I am shit out of luck as well oh no what the hell can I do to get free from here and they stare me down into the back corner where I cower in fear what will we do what will we do with this wrongfully abducted specimen that will be sure to muck up the results of our special science lab I dont know man I just dont know how we are going to get through this to the next room over there with the open door so relax I say and they listen to me for a second I have a plan to get me out of here and save your skins from the master plan for the worst but expect the best and they smile at me and then slowly at one another and I think they may be on my team and then pow I get a punch in the gut and there are kicks to my face and red starts at the edges of my eyes and then black and then I'm in the next room and the door is open and my captors are nowhere to be found but I hear what must be the master on the overhead radio exclaiming that he has cut the cuticle when trimming his nails and he needs the science experiment to be completed so the new technology can get rolled out to improve the technology of the current toe clipping material science matters at hand to hand combat as im running down the hall to the escape pod and the two little bastards that pulled me out of my bed in the night are close behind one another and then around the corner and then another and im running at top speed when I run into a door and its the first cell so I must have run in a circle or a square or some sort of closed polygonal shape shifting aliens reveal their true form and it's horrifying how much they look like my dead great aunt betsy whose picture hangs over the mantel in my dining room back home on what must be earth unless they are in my head and playing mind tricks but no this has to be real because I can feel the blood pulsing in my veins faster than anything ive ever felt before stop right where you are drop to the ground hey im the one giving orders here but yeah im gon na be the one to deliver this guy to master so I can get all of the extra credit on the test and I duck to the side as they begin firing lasers at one another first up and then to the down below the dining hatch compartment where the master is dining on his fresh toenail clippings according to the blaring voices on the loudspeaker that are intermittently interrupted by the sound of classical music from a classic walkman and the fizzle of laser canons in a hierarchical combat to establish who gets that extra extra special credit for the bungled abduction mission by my two captors because only one of them is going to get that promotion and then a hole opens up in the side of the bay door chamber still smoking from the discharged laser beam and I know its my chance and I jump out into space and the two of them they charge after me stop it please help me cries the master but soon his voice won't carry in the vacuum of space and where the fuck am I because earth is just a tiny blue speck in the distance and the bodies of the aliens floating slowly towards me trying to fire their lasers but getting sent in opposite directions spiraling this way and that according to some weird law of physics that they just refuse to obey like their master or maybe it's just that they are lazy or incompetent but I will never know because their flesh starts to expand in space rapidly and then blood is shooting out in quick little spurts first from the orifices of which there are many and then from every little which way into the stars and comets and obscuring that blue speck that might have been earth and so now hopelessly resigned to the situation where I am finding myself at this present hour away from everything I know and understand like the back of my hand so I begin to look down at my own quivering body that is about to tear at the seams between spacetime irrationaliy and reality tv stars pop red black",0
"Prompt: Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Story: Susan Quin Tailor had always been fond of rabbits. Her mother, who called her Susie Cutie for fun, had often told her how, as soon as she had learned to crawl she was off chasing the wild rabbits on the family farm. Her first full sentence had been, ""Bunny tails are cute, cute, cute!"" Of course, she could never catch them back in those days, and had to make do with the stuffed bunnies her parents brought her or the lucky rabbit's foot her Uncle had slipped underneath her pillow one night. Those had been happy times. Unfortunately, when she was 7, the family farm had fallen on hard times and her family was forced to move to the city. There they stayed in a little two-bedroom apartment that provided excellent access to views of the local pigeons and squirrels. But of rabbits, there were none. Little Susan was not cut out for the city life, at first, and in school she earned another nickname. It was Susie Tailor the Bathroom Wailer, after the time she cried in the restroom when her teacher told her that rabbits were just not a focus of the curriculum. Worried for their daughter's adjustment, her parents had scraped together some extra money for a counselor to help with the ""bunny obsession"" as they had begun to call it. Miraculously, the counseling sessions seemed to work and Susie Cutie quickly bounced back from her woes. By the time she reached Junior High, she was very nearly the most popular girl in school and would only mention rabbits in a passing manner. In High school Susan discovered her love for biology and that, as they say, was that. She decided she was going to be a biologist when she grew up, perhaps even a zookeeper, and focused all of her studies on getting into a good college for the animal sciences. College was a grand time for Susan. She studied hard and lived fully for 3 years, graduating early and near the top of her class. After college, she ventured out of the cities that she'd spent two thirds of her life in, and took an internship on a local farm. It was there, on that farm, that she was reacquainted with her love for rabbits after spying one's cute tail disappear into the horse stables. Excitedly, she cornered the rabbit in one of the stalls and picked it up, cuddling it tight. The rabbit kicked and reared, biting and scratching, but that was ok with Susan in her thick shirt and hide gloves. When the bunny finally tired out and became complacent, Susie Cutie slowly reached up, with a lifetime of anticipation bursting in her heart, and patted her hand between the bunny's ears. Smiling, Susan twisted the rabbit's head sharply, killing it, then flipped it over to examine that cute, cute bunny tail up close. [ Things I've written ] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/cbeckw/)",0
"Prompt: `` I am the Grim Reaper, yes. But in order to reap, I must first have sown. '' Story: ""I am the Grim Reaper, yes. But in order to reap, I must first have sown. If you are to succeed me, you too must learn to sow. You will need your robe, your scythe, and your standard Hades issue St. Jergens hand lotion. Now grasp my phalanges within yours and brace yourself."" You expect to feel a lump in your throat, but instead grind your mandible side to side briefly and cackle, remembering that your robe hangs loosely where your throat might otherwise still be. Reaching out, you find yourself falling, maybe not falling because that implies gravity and you are clearly beyond human laws of gravity and time here, slipping through the ether. Terra firma shatters before you and settles all around in what eyes might make out as a dim haze. You find yourself standing at the shore of a vast primordial sea where magma rushes up from below where you stand, inert to you, and flows down and coalesces with the water to form a cloud of ash gray which retreats below the surface like a plume of smoke carrying the poison to Pompeii. All else lies still. ""Cronos, grasp your scythe, and do as I. Forget not the St. Jergens. Now, you very literally hold the fate of this time-cycle and once the fervor you now feel rising within you subsides your will for the shape of this existence shall be done.""",0
"Prompt: Gay marriages have just been legalized nationwide. Whether or not you agree, you find yourself involved with one. What is the experience like? Story: I hear the angry protesters outside. I can see them from this window. Holding up signs that display all matters of vulgarities. The hatred and wrath, etched on their faces, it makes me sick to my stomach. I wish I could say something to change their mind, but they wouldn't understand me. Don't get me wrong, I'm great at speeches actually. I just don't think they'll listen. Too disgusted by the hatred, I turn and look away. I see both the grooms, looking lovingly into each other's eyes. How is this any different than anyoother wedding? I've seen many weddings and each one had couples like these. Love sick and spewing sappy words to each other. I like listening and watching as they pronounce their love to each other. It made my heart a flutter, thinking I'd find a mate. I watch as they are pronounced as marry and kiss. I look at the others in the crowd, all with different expressions. Jealousy, hatred, love, happiness, they are all there. I don't feel phased by any of it. I wait as the cheers die down. When it's calm and silent, I feel a sudden urge to sing. I inhale and start to lavish their hearing with a song. I put my whole heart I to it. Each note clear and concise. The crowd looked at me in awe. I continued, for I never sang in front of so many people. It only made me continue with fervor. I finally let the last note ring out, and watch as the crowd start clapping and cheering.Embarrassed at all of the cheers, I find the nearest exit. I stretch my wings out and fly through the window.",0
"Prompt: Imprisonement sentences are carried out by putting the condemned in stasis. While under, they experience the full lenght of the sentence, alone. To the outside world, only 12 seconds elapses. Story: The gavel hit the wood, and the noise echoed through the courtroom. ""Guilty,"" the judge said. ""N-no! Please don't take me away! I didn't do it! Honestly! Why would I kill her and chop her into pieces?! I loved her! I'm the most devastated person here!"" Carl shouted in protest. The judge looked down on him. ""All evidence points in your direction."" ""What does that have to do with it?! How do you know the evidence wasn't fake?!"" The prosecution sighed. ""That's the fifth time you've said that through this case. Serve your sentence and regret your sins."" Carl turned towards the audience seats. ""Boss! You don't think I would do it, right?! You know how much I love her!"" The tall bespectacled man looked down on him. ""You mean loved. I would fire you if I could, but sadly I can't. See you tomorrow."" Carl's fists were clenched tight, and he didn't move until he was escorted out of the building. After an hour of being escorted, he was led into a two-story facility. The lobby looked like that of a hospital, he was directed into a room the size of a bathroom. The only thing in the room were a cylindrical machine the size of an adult. Carl was put into the machine, and got some cables connected to his body. After the cylinder was closed, Carl saw only darkness. *Commencing punishment. Criminal: Carl Sagen. Crime: First degree murder and desecration of victims body. Time served: 0 seconds. Time left to serve: 10 years. * Light filled Carl's eyes. He recognized his surroundings as his apartment. In his right hand, he held a knife, while the left held a saw. As he entered the house, he heard a familiar voice. ""Oh, are you home already?"" *Pernille! I knew you were alive! * A girl called Pernille entered the living room, but stopped once she saw Carl. ""Umm, why are you carrying a knife and a saw?"" ""Don't worry about it. A coworker needed some space in his shed, so she asked if I could keep these over the weekend,"" he said, before showing a smile. ""Can I get a hug?"" Pernille ran up to him and embraced him. *I really love you Pernille. * Carl realized something was wrong. There was something that shouldn't be there. Pernille's back had a knife sticking out of it. And his own hand gripped the handle. He heard a coughing sound from below him. He looked down, and saw the body embracing him sink to the ground. His shirt was covered in blood. *Now we'll be together forever! * Took the knife to his mouth, and licked the blood off it. ""Hey, if we're always going to be forever, you should do it properly. Cut me up, and eat me piece for piece instead."" Carl looked up, and saw Pernille's silhouette. ""Of course!"" He then cut the body into pieces, before he started to eat them. 15 minutes later the door was kicked open. A neighbor had called the police because he had heard weird sounds from the apartment. As Carl was brought away, his vision slowly turned black. *Continuing punishment. Criminal: Carl Sagen. Crime: First degree murder and desecration of victims body.

""How was the ten years?"" one of the guards asked. ""Very funny. I know what I did was wrong, so just take me home."" After being transported to his apartment, Carl entered. A girl's voice called out to him. ""You're finally home! I've missed you these last ten years."" Carl moved forward, and hugged the silhouette running up to him. ***** I feel that the end got pretty rushed, mostly because I was not in the mood for writing, but I still wanted to finish it.

"Prompt: A Gondor soldier tells his child a tale about the mighty warrior Aragorn, son of Arathorn. Story: “ Ay, a sea of black, leather and steel and wool dampened with the grime of man and orc. From the topmost parapet, near the decaying White Tree, you could almost forget there was an army down there so expansive were their borders. A mass of men so great, that any movement in their ranks looked like mere ripples in a vast ocean. ” Araval sat on the floor, listening to his grandfather recount the story of the Battle of the Pellenor Fields. Too many times he had found himself there, legs crossed and ears eager, asking about the characters and the history of an Age gone by. Here sat a man with gnarled fingers, cloudy and swirling eyes that struggled to find their mark, and skin with as many wrinkles as the man had years, and yet once he had stood and looked out at the great expanse of man's doom. A chasm of death had awaited him at the start of battle, but instead of a somber silence that would greet him now in old age, he had faced death then with the cacophony of man's cries and clanging steel surrounding him. “ Gandalf the White, backed by the soldiers of Gondor, faced the Witch-king of Angmar and denied him entry. And that is when the sea of black roiled and churned and spit forth the forces of Sauron upon us. Trebuchets hurled boulders to batter the walls of Minas Tirith, and in their wake left ruins of the city of the Sun. Boys, some even younger than you, pulled swords from their scabbards and fought alongside their fathers as orcs flooded over the crumbled stone and broken gates. One by one men, and women, and children, and babes born naught yesterday, fell to the crude metal of orc blade. ” “ Men of the Rohirrim crested the hills of Gondor that dawn, horns held to pressed lips and songs of battle cascading down to the legion of the Lord of the Rings. King Theoden rode with valor and slammed his cavalry into the Haradrim and their mumakil swathed in saddles of war. But even then, even as the Witch-king fell to Eowyn's hand, the tide of battle could not be turned. Their numbers were greater by far, and reserves from Osgiliath poured outwards onto the field to take the place of fallen comrades. Instead of bravery, men fought now with resignation in their hearts, spurred on not by the quest for glory or remembrance, but for the dignity of man taking its last breath in history. ” Araval knew what was next to come, but tradition and respect kept him asking. “ But Grandfather, how are we here now? Men still walk the white stones of Gondor today. ” “ That is a most complicated question, Araval, for to answer it completely would mean another story entirely. But as for the people of Gondor that day, they were saved by a man thought long dead by the people of Middle Earth. A fleet of ships came, there at the last stand. Aragorn, son of Arathorn, Ranger of the North, and true King of Gondor, unfurled the ancient banners of his heritage. A wave of death swept outwards, death unleashed by men who were already dead, led by a commander who had risen from the death of his obscurity. Oathbreakers to Isildur had come to fulfill their pledges to the King and his heirs, to break the curse set upon them centuries ago that tied them lifeless to the cold mountains of Dunharrow. For a few nights at least, peace had come to us through the spirits of those long passed, and from the man who had summoned them and reigns still to this day. ” His grandfather sat still then, the silence stretching miles. Underneath the opacity of his milky eyes, Araval could catch the glimmers of sorrow and of pride. And so ended every retelling of the Battle of Pellenor Fields.",0
"Prompt: In 2050 the Rapture happens and the Apocalypse ravages earth. The colonies on the Moon and Mars are untouched by the events. Story: Hal sat in his office, watching a live feed of the rapture for the third day straight. He had seen the ascension of those saved. He had watched as the Damned crawled up through the ground and dragged the rest to hell. Now the whole planet was devoid of humanity. The door to his office slid open. Hal's secretary, Patti walked in. Her expression made him feel assured she shared a similar ambivalence about the situation. They watched shots of empty cities, streets, inter spliced with horrific showing yesterdays battle with the Damned. After several minutes Hal spoke ""I can't believe it. We are not affected."" ""I know, sir. I think we escaped it. I don't know which way I would go, but somehow it is an enormous relief to know I will forever be safe from that judgement."" The pair sat in silent for several more minutes. Both calmly processed the information for the first time since the rapture began. Hal started to sob. ""What? Family down there?"" Patti asked. ""No my whole ancestry immigrated generations back."" Hal replied with a sniffle. ""What then?"" ""What the fuck does this mean! Religion has been dead to me for so long. It just seemed silly in light of everything humanity has accomplished in the past few decades. Patti, I watched the Four Horseman descend from the fucking sky and decimate humanity. What does this mean for us? Are we out of the fucking dogma? Do we just go to sleep when we die? What?"" Patti had been contemplating that same thing. ""The way I see it there are two possibilities."" Hal stared at her intently. She continued. ""The first would be what you just said. We are exempt here on Mars. We go to sleep that's it."" Hal nodded anxiously. She continued. ""The second would be that we are now in the domain of another deity."" Patti walked by behind Hal and began massaging his shoulders. He relaxed in her grip. ""We may now be under the thumb of an incredibly benevolent and merciful God. One who loves our troubled race without reservation, and delivers us all to paradise when our time comes."" Hal hummed a peaceful affirmation. Patti drew a twisted and evil looking dagger from within her jacket. She continued. ""But that is not Mars, Hal. You were not so fortunate."" Something in her voice had changed. Something that made Hal stiffen, but paralyzed him. He could not move although mortal panic now gripped him. ""Our new God is old, Hal. Old and angry. We disgust him. And there is no hope of redemption. No martyr for our sins. Hell is paradise compared to his home. Our home. It's time for you to see."" Hal tried to speak but all he could manage was a soft whimper. Patti jammed the blade into the side of Hal's neck. Then quickly began sawing through his throat. ""Bless me lord of the Red planet!"" Patti shouted to the room, Hal's blood spurting all over her face. It coated her. Her heart glowed with the fiery ecstasy of his approval. It was time for humanity to know of Him and His wishes.",0
"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear Kyle, It's been almost 7 years since I saw you last. Seven years from the white dress and venue down payment that I had to get returned. Seven years since I had to scramble to find an apartment in a college town in May because we split up. Seven years since you crushed my heart and made me question my self worth, my life, basically everything I'd thought about myself and my future from high school through most of college. I am not writing you to tell you bout all that, you rwmember it as well as I do. I am writing you to thank you. Without you, I never would have realized how strong I am, the things I could do. I've finished my masters (two of them actually and few minors too and an early edu degree, I am working on a third). I learned how to fix my car and how to live on my own. But the reason I am writing you isn't because of these things. I am writing you to thank you because without you leaving I wouldn't know why it's like to have a supportive partner who travels the world with me, let's me be me, who tries new things, and loves me for being me. I've gotten to see, do, and experience more thing than I could ever imagine. If you hadn't walked out that door, I wouldn't be a teacher somewhere where it doesn't snow. I wouldnt know my favorite wine is reisling, that I lovw Thai (although chicken mac is still good too), or that Wasabi is amazing, or that the Baltimore Ravens are my favorite team. I wouldn't know how strong I am or all the skills I have (crafts are a big one but teaching and cooking are good ones too). Most importantly, I wouldn't know how awesome I can be or how great a wife I can be. Thank you for leaving.... in all honesty. I wish you the best in all that you do and hope you live a long and happy life. I know I will.",0

""I swear ta God there's no place in this world for asswipes like you."" ""I'm gon na go find a place to sleep."" Everything burned him: each inhalation devoid of the familiar smells he'd expected, each street more metallic and concrete than he'd expected, each piercing memory of faces that had evidently died and withered long ago. Everything burned like saltwater in the gills of a freshwater fish.",0
"Prompt: Rewrite your favorite knock-knock joke as a serious story. Story: The letter came on the November 2nd, it was in a nondescript white envelope, completely unwrinkled, her address printed neatly with robotic looking letters in sharp black ink. It seemed far too clean in general, there were no wrinkles or smudges, it was as if someone had shrink wrapped it. But of course Marie wasn't thinking that when she opened it. The thought crossed her mind briefly perhaps, but it wasn't until after she opened and read the letter did she begin to think frantically about its semantics.... if it matched the others in the news. ""Banana."" It said. Marie liked banana's actually, she read an article somewhere that most people don't get enough potassium. But in this context, the word scrawled in straight and cutting letters on equally clean and unwrinkled paper.... there were far more sinister undertones associated with it. Marie phoned the police, who informed her they would be dispatching a car to take her to the station so the letter could be analysed. To her dismay, after all the analysing was done it was positively matched to the others. The officers at the station told her not to worry, they would be dispatching a team to watch her 24/7, nothing would happen to her, she would be safe, they even went as far as to say that there was nothing to worry about, maybe no more letters would be sent. But that did little to ease Marie's shattered nerves, it did little to shift her from the gaze of the'banana killer'. Her house was watched by Bill and John both corporals with excellent records. She was interviewed on the news, had paid leave from work. It was quite nice actually. Then the second letter came. ""Banana"" it said, and Marie's world once again shattered to the ground and she couldn't stop looking over her shoulder. Then the third letter came, and she new it might only be a matter of time before she was dead, nobody had escaped the knife of the banana killer. He always killed after the third letter. ""It'll be OK."" ""He won't get passed us."" ""You've got nothing to worry about."" All these things were said, and after the third letter two extra officers were by her side, but it still did nothing to calm her. It was midnight. Marie was lying awake in bed, the street lights cast shadows through her window, every silhouetted lamp post and shrub projected onto her wall looked like a murderer poised to strike. Her heart pounded in here ears like the percussion section of an orchestra preparing for the final movement. Suddenly a shadow moved past the street lights and shrubs. Marie bolted upright, a scream welling in her stomach, her vocal chords milliseconds away from strumming into action. A leather gloved hand attached itself to her face, constricting itself over her mouth. ""Shhhh"" came a eerily soft voice, she could feel his hot breath around her ear. She felt a knife run against her throat. She was shaking, she couldn't think straight. But out of the convoluted stream of consciousness that her fight or flight response had kicked up, a single thought emerged. This is it. This is how it ends. Marie squeezed her eyes shut, tried not to think about how it would happen, how she would be gutted and cut up like all the other victims in the news. She tried desperately hard to transport her mind to a different place, but she couldn't, she couldn't help but focus on the knife pressed into her throat. Her heart was beating faster and faster, the drums pounding away, the orchestra about to reach the final climactic notes.... And then there was no knife on her throat, she looked around the room and couldn't spot anyone. A note fell out of her shaking hands, the calligraphic lettering all too familiar. Her hands continued to trembled as she opened it. ""Orange.""",0
"Prompt: You are repeating your day Groundhog style, except every day one more person in the world joins the loop. Story: You wake up to the shrill beeps of your alarm clock. You dread this part of the day. It always takes you ages to get up - which, realistically, is about 20 minutes. Another day begins. After forcing yourself to wake up, you do the normal routine. You get prepared and walk to the bus stop. The bus stop looks like it always does. Standing there are your friends, Ben and Tim. They are once again on their phones, while consecutively arguing about the other's taste of music. It's just another day. You arrive at school and quickly head to your math class. Waiting there are some more of your friends, but no words are exchanged. Everyone is tired. It's Monday, and everyone dreads the week to come. You go through other classes, and finally go home. You're exhausted. You set an alarm, for just an hour - you drift off to sleep.... You wake up to the shrill beeps of your alarm clock. It's dark. You realize that the other alarm must not have worked, your phone must have died or something. You look towards where you placed the phone, and it's gone. Strange. You search around, until you find it where you'd usually place it, on your desk. Either way, you dread this part of the day. It always takes you ages to get up - which, realistically, is about 20 minutes. Another day begins. After forcing yourself to wake up, you do the normal routine. You get prepared and walk to the bus stop. The bus stop looks like it always does. Standing there are your friends, Ben and Tim. They are once again on their phones, while consecutively arguing about the other's taste of music. It's just another day. You arrive at school and quickly head to your math class. Waiting there are some more of your friends, but no words are exchanged. Everyone is tired. It's Tuesday -- - wait. You glance up to the whiteboard once again, and sure enough, it says Monday. Your math teacher, Mr. Clarke, isn't one to keep the board disorganized. It's always updated when you get there. You walk over to Mr. Clarke to alert him of the board's inaccurate information. Mr. Clarke tells you to go back to your seat. It is Monday. You're a little bit alerted now. You learn the same things you learned yesterday, in every class. You are very alerted. Nobody else seems startled by this. Everyone says the same thing they did yesterday at the lunch table, and you once again head home. You sit in your room, pondering on what happened. Maybe you had a vision of today, in your dreams? Maybe something supernatural occurred. You're not this kind of person, but nothing else would explain this situation. There's no way you actually went through a day twice - right? Every day, you start doing new things. You talk to different people, you try different things. Nothing you do matters. You start doing things you would have otherwise been scared of doing - first you ask a girl out, then you steal things. You eventually steal and try to drive someone's car. You died a few times, but you only wake up in the morning again. How many days has it been? You don't remember anymore. Today, you notice Ben and Tim talking about different things at the bus stop. Today they're arguing about which fast food restaurant they prefer. Is it finally a new day? You eagerly check your phone, but it's still Monday. Things are actually starting to get strange. It's not another day. ""Hey,"" you say as you make your appearance at the bus stop. You wonder if someone will say something different. ""Hey, Chris,"" Ben says. You reply, ""Mondays are awful, aren't they?"" You attempt to have him say otherwise. ""Monday? It's Tuesday."" Ben attempts to contradict your statement. You know something's up. ""It's not Tuesday, look at the date."" Ben looks at his calendar, and for a second, you see a slight look of discomfort on his face. The bus pulls up, and you go to the closest empty seat. You don't have any classes with Ben, so you have to talk to him tomorrow morning. The next morning, Ben stands at the bus stop, with an increased, stronger look of discomfort. You pull him to the side, and say to him with a muffled voice, ""How is your third Monday going?"" Ben looks back at you. He whispers back, ""How do you know?"" ""Uh, it's a bit of a strange situation. Listen, uh, school isn't worth going to at this point. You know what I mean? Let's go to my house, I can explain it there."" You and Ben run off, Tim unaware of the situation, captivated by his phone. You explain the situation to Ben, and your discoveries so far. You can't die, you can't escape, and it never seems to end. Ben seems to understand, or at least slightly understand. You don't know what to do now, but at least both of you are in the loop. Ben asks, ""are there others?"" ""Uh, I haven't seen any others. You're the first one who was off schedule, or at least who I've seen. It would make sense if there were others, though."" Ben nodded. ""So what should we do now?"" ""I don't know. I've just been living this day, over and over. I wonder what's causing this,"" you reply. ""Hmm."" ""Well, I guess we could try to put this to good use. Let's look on the news, or a blog, or something. Maybe there's reports of similar situations,"" you suggest. ""It wouldn't be on the news. Who would report that? It just sounds like a mental illness."" ""We can still try to look around."" After some googling and looking through several pages, you found one person, posting on their blog. It's a simple statement, saying ""I've lived this day over and over. It never ends. I've posted this on here many times, but it has never stayed for longer than a day."" There are no comments. Must not be a popular blog. You and Ben decide to add your own comment. You simply state, ""Me too. Email me at ChrisEPereira @ gmail.com."" After waiting for an hour or two and looking for other reports, you get an email.",0
"Prompt: Have a meal with the Devil. Story: I sat down at the table. Honestly this wasn't the sort of place where I expected Lucifer to have his meetings, but then, what did I know? The shop was a little hole-in-the-wall deli, specializing in Greek gyros. Other than the shopkeep, no one else was around. I made my order, and settled in for the wait. Figures that he'd be late. Two weeks ago when I received the postcard in the mail, I thought it was a joke. Some teenage prankster with a sick sense of humor probably. The card had been scrawled with a beautiful script, but the ink was of blood. You are cordially invited to a luncheon with the Prince of Darkness, Lucifer, Satan, the Devil, et al, on the First day of November (Gregorian), this year of Two Thousand and Fourteen. Please wear appropriate attire. Refusal is not permitted. Certainly sounded absurd. But I had the feeling it was legitimate when I tried to get rid of it and it kept coming back. Garbage can, disposal, shredder, the local dump.... each time it ended back in my mailbox. Even on Sunday, when there's no post. So here I am, taking the day off for a meeting with Evil incarnate. My boss wouldn't have believed me, so today I'm ""sick."" I seated myself facing the door, so that I would have a chance to see him first, but apparently there was no fooling the Devil, because from behind me a gorgeous woman walked past, turned on her heel, and smoothly set in the chair across from me, all with the grace of a panther. Noting my startled look, she smirked. ""Why does everyone always expect a man?"" ""I'm.... I'm sorry. That's just what I thought."" I stammered, trying to be polite. So much for the Prince of Darkness. The woman before me was an absolute 10. Five feet, ten inches tall, not an ounce of fat on her, and a perfect hourglass figure. Her hair was a sultry crimson, though I wasn't surprised. Gingers didn't have souls, after all. Each nail on her hands was perfectly manicured, and she wore no apparent makeup, though didn't appear to need any either. ""No matter. How are you doing today Charles?"" ""Er.... good I guess. What's this about?"" ""What? No questions trying to ascertain my authenticity?"" The Devil looked surprised. ""Well, I mean... are you? Real, I mean?"" Rolling her eyes, she snapped a finger and set the shopkeep's eyebrows ablaze. ""Huh. Well ok then."" ""Yea. Now that that's over with, I'll formally introduce myself."" Satan whipped her hair out of her eyes with a shake of her head and extended her hand. ""You can call me Patrick."" ``.... Patrick?"" ""Is there a problem with that?"" A fiery light glowed from her pupils and I quickly shook my head. ""No, no, no problem at all."" ""Good. Now, why do you think you're here?"" ""You.... want my soul?"" I ventured the obvious reason. ""Heavens no! I stopped that program 20 years ago! Turns out, people don't own their souls anyway. Couldn't sell them if they wanted to."" Patrick laughed and I glimpsed her perfect teeth, dazzled by their brightness. ""Well, then what?"" ""Simple. I'm selling timeshares and I think you'd love what I have to offer. Lunch is on me, of course, as long as you stay for the whole hour."" I snorted derisively. ""Really? Timeshare spiels don't work with normal salespeople. What makes you think I'm interested?"" ""Because you're going to Hell anyway Charles. I figured you'd want a chance at better accommodations."" ""What? Why am I going to Hell??"" I sputtered. ""Look,"" Patrick yawned dismissively, ""I don't make the rules. Well I sort of do. But I didn't make you touch that dog. My point is, for a price, you can get a great fire-side condo."" ""What price?"" ""Your reddit account name and password, of course."" I stood up resolutely, and shoved my chair in. ""Ma'am, you can go to Hell.""",0
"Prompt:Six months ago it was announced that a meteor would hit the earth and end all life. However it missed the earth after humanity had prepared for the end. Story: Just six months. That's all we really needed when our backs were against the wall, all we really needed for peace was our own imminent destruction. Kind of poetic, right? After millennia of war, nation against nation, creed against creed, mankind stood together at the last, all efforts failed, all possibilities tried together, all barriers broken down in those months of searching for a way to save us all. And then, it didn't come. Mankind stood together and watched the sky.... and nothing happened. When TV stations around the world spread the news that we were safe, that it was over, that it had missed us by a whisper, we stood, some stunned, some weeping, some screaming with joy. But in that six months, oh the things we learned! The things we discovered together, sharing information as fast as minds could think it up, the ideas we discarded one after another all had value, they all gave us new directions to explore. In the aftermath of world peace, no one wanted to break the spell, to be cut off from the technology we'd forged together, and so no one did. No one dared. No one wanted to be left behind. The end of the world that wasn't was the start of the newest age of technology, and the greatest time of peace. Together, we look to the stars.",0
"Prompt: You come home from work and find a stranger in your home. After a brief panic, you come to find that said stranger is your beloved pet turned human. Story: It was in the evening, I got a call on my voice mail while working. I'm a hotel manager, and the police know me from our nights of belligerent or uninvited guests. I live alone and no one visits since I moved to a rural town. ""Mr. Smith? This is Kerry down at the station. We found a troubled man outside your home, with a dog collar on with your name and phone number. He keeps repeating your name. If you could get down here and help us find out who he is would be great."" I didn't know anyone who would be in town to visit. Let alone someone wearing a dog collar other than my Black Lab named King Louie. So, I ask if the two front desk if they got it for the rest of the evening, and leave the hotel at 6 p.m. I get into the station and they escort me to a holding room, on the other side of the glass is a fit black man in sweat pants. ""We barely got him into the pants, he kept howling and saying'Luther'."" Kerry looking forward, ""if you like you can see him."" ""I don't even know this man."" ""Well, we tried to get off his collar but he bit Walter. We just figured he was a troubled man"", the man started sniffing the air, scurrying towards the glass. ""Luther?!"" He shouted in a deep voice, ""LUTHER!"" Curious and scared of a fit black man calling my name, I work up the courage. I knock on the door and walk in. ""LUTHER!"" He shouted and knocked me to the floor. His tongue was surprisingly long. He placed his fists on my shoulders and I could feel his knees digging into my stomach. ""Oh Cripes. Up boy!"" I said like a knee jerk reaction. ""So you do know him?! Is he your lover? I'm not judging but we just couldn't find any prints on him or..."" ""No, I do not know this man."" The large toned black man was wrapped around my leg. ""He seems to be attached to you for some reason."" I looked down into his eyes and seen my friend for the past three years staring back. He was about 6'1"", a solid 180, his hair was black and curly. I felt like I should get him out of here all of a sudden and said, ""Cousin Louie?!"" He looked up and said, ""Home?!"" Crap, right in the feels. After some paper work and a court hearing for humping one of the female officers, we were on our way home. ""King Louie?!"" I asked when I turn on the car. ""YES!"" He barked. Holy shit, if this happened to him I wonder what my calico cat looks like. She liked to sleep on my pillows...",0
"Prompt: You are a former executioner. Describe your final killing. Story: *It's not first person but oh well. * The blessing took the longest. If Gareth was allowed to operate on his own schedule, the executions would be done in less than an hour. Rope, drop, done. But no. No, the priests just had to be included. Just had to gyrate their way across the platform, chanting Our Fathers and Hail Mary's and making the sign of the cross with pale, flimsy hands until the crowd started shifting and murmuring, “ get it over with, already. ” Then the priests would step to the side and fold their hands and tip their heads to heaven, silently granting Gareth permission, as if he needed their say-so to do his job. One time he'd pulled the lever early, before the priests even got a chance to get started, and they'd threatened to excommunicate him if he did it again. (The man being executed was a Protestant, and he said he'd consider it a personal favor if Gareth would save him the embarrassment of being absolved of his sins by a Roman Catholic. Gareth was not one to deny last requests.) The trick to a speeding everything along, he'd explained once -- and only once, because people didn't like to hear about executions unless they were well drunk -- was the length of the rope. The further someone fell, the better chance you had that their neck would snap and that would be that. No twitching and suffocating and getting blue in the face. Thieves got the long drop, because no one cared enough to tell Gareth to “ make it last. ” The big men, though.... the officials and the bankers.... they got the short rope, because most people enjoyed waiting around for a fat banker to die. “ It's funny, ” they said. “ Don't you think, Gareth? Isn't it funny to watch the big strong men wet themselves when the rope goes over their heads? ” The priest on the platform stopped crossing himself and Gareth tightened his grip on the lever. An angry hum started in the crowd. It had been a long day, and they'd learned to conserve the shouting for the drop. Seven people had been executed so far, and each time the explosion of noise that accompanied the trap door's opening made the hairs on the back of Gareth's neck stand on end. I was a poisonous energy, different from any other execution Gareth had presided over. The priest nodded and Gareth pulled the lever. The trapdoor opened and hundreds of eyes followed the administrator's descent. They cheered and clapped and Gareth watched the thick rope bouncing as the man died. “ What will you do after this, Gareth? ” Gareth started. He glanced over his shoulder. There was a man standing near the stairs, watching Gareth casually. His hands were behind his back, the picture of patience as he waited for Gareth's answer. Gareth looked back at the rope. Still twitching. “ Dunno. ” “ You don't know, or you'd rather not tell me? ” “ Haven't thought about it. ” “ You do realize you'll be out of a job after today? ” “ I figured. ” “ And no plans for the future. ” The man smiled and shook his head. “ That's not how successful people do things, Gareth. ” Gareth shrugged. Thomas, the young boy who was something of an executioner's apprentice, popped up through the trapdoor, the noose slung over his shoulder. He tossed the rope to the platform and Gareth began winding the rope. Thomas pulled the trapdoor shut. A guard shouldered his way through the group near the stairs, dragging a wailing woman behind him. “ Oh. ” The man took a step back. “ Pardon me, Lady Isabelle. ” He turned back to Gareth as Gareth locked the lever in place again. “ You could always be a farmer. ” “ Don't know how. ” “ I've heard it's really quite easy. ” Gareth grunted. He pointed toward Lady Isabelle, who was looking faint next to the hanging noose. “ I got ta.... ” “ By all means. ” Gareth's appearance on the platform hushed the jeering crowd. Lady Isabelle's eyes were closed and her cheeks were drenched with tears as Gareth slipped the noose over her head. “ Will you miss it? ” the man asked when Gareth returned. Gareth shrugged. “ Be a morbid thing to miss. ” “ Maybe, ” the man conceded. “ If you give them time, I'm sure they'll find someone for you to kill. ” “ Execute, ” Gareth corrected. There was a difference. “ And they said no. They said after this, executions are done. We're a democracy now, and we don't execute. ” “ Execute arbitrarily, ” the man corrected. “ There is a difference. ” Gareth didn't answer. The priest nodded. Gareth pulled the lever and Lady Isabelle dropped. “ I'd buy into this whole democracy idea if they hadn't decided the whole Cormac line had to go for it to work. ” “ You did have your chance, ” Gareth said, and the man laughed. “ So you do know who I am, ” he said. Gareth tipped his head to the side. “ Majesty. ” “ Just Edward now, I'm afraid. ” Edward grinned maniacally. “ It's a democracy now, Gareth, remember? ” Thomas had crawled from the trapdoor again. Gareth began winding the rope. “ You know, this is the first time I've been to one of these to watch you work, ” Edward said. “ You are efficient, Gareth. ” Another soldier pushed past, leading a short fat man with a red face and bushy orange eyebrows. “ Try to draw it out, Arthur, eh? ” Edward called after him. He flashed his teeth at Gareth. “ That fat windbag. I thought for sure he'd weasel his way out of this. ” Gareth excused himself to squeeze the noose over Arthur's thick neck. “ Savages, ” Arthur spat. His small eyes were rolling in their sockets. “ You're all savages. ” “ Told you, ” Edward said sagely. “ That bastard always has something to say. ” Gareth didn't answer. “ King's Executioner, ” Edward said after a moment. “ Is that irony, Gareth? For your title to be your job description? ” “ Dunno. What's irony? ” “ Not important. ” Edward nodded. “ I think they're ready for you. ” Gareth pulled the lever, and Edward bellowed with the rest of the crowd when Arthur dropped. “ By God, if I would have known how good that felt, I would have had him executed years ago. Who's next? ” “ Your wife, ” Gareth said, and Edward's smile evaporated. “ I thought she went yesterday, ” he said. There was an edge of anger to his voice, and for a moment Gareth could see the proud king he'd been before the revolution. “ They changed their minds. ” Edward's eyes went hard. He turned to stare out at the gathered crowd. He did not say anything else, and when Gareth began winding the noose again Edward ducked his head and closed his eyes. Gareth saw his jaw tighten when the queen was dragged past, but he did not open his eyes; not when the priest started his chanting and not when the trapdoor slammed open. “ I'd like -- ” Edward's voice cracked. He cleared his throat. “ I'd like to thank you, Gareth. For doing my dirty work. And.... ” Edward jerked his chin at the crowd. “ For doing theirs. ” Gareth paused. “ Well.... you never sent me any kids. So thanks for that, I guess. ” Edward nodded jerkily. “ You're next, ” Gareth said, and Edward set his shoulders. Gareth followed him across the platform and the crowd fell deathly silent. This was what they'd been waiting for. The main event, Gareth thought. King Edward Cormac, the man who'd fought the Danes lived high on the spoils of war and wore silk to bed. King Edward Cormac, dying like a common man. “ It's been enlightening, Gareth, ” Edward said. Gareth placed the noose around his neck. Gareth paused. In his fifteen years as executioner, he'd never felt compelled to talk with the sentenced. But this was different. The end of an era. The last person he'd ever pull the lever for, and it was the person who'd sent so many people his way. “ As kings go, you weren't all that bad. ” Edward laughed. Gareth moved out of the way of the priest, back to his position on the edge of the platform. He waited patiently, watching Edward glare back at the people shouting and throwing rotten vegetables on the platform. Gareth felt a flash of annoyance until he remembered he wouldn't have to clean it up. After he pulled the lever, he wouldn't be the King's Executioner anymore. Wouldn't have to clean up anybody's messes. *Not the King's Executioner anymore, * Gareth thought, *but always the King's executioner. * He felt like maybe he was on the verge of understanding irony, but then the priest nodded and Gareth's arm pulled the lever for the last time and the crowd erupted. The trick, he remembered telling someone in a bar once, is to make sure you realize they're not cheering for *you*. Someone clapped a hand on Gareth's shoulder. Gareth turned. One of the men who'd sentenced the king's court and presided over the executions was watching him solemnly, his face painted white, his collar starched. “ Executioner. ” The man held out his hand. Gareth took it. “ Thank you for your service. Gareth shrugged. “ My pleasure. ”",0
"Prompt: You are a serial killer. Each murder you commit adds a new voice to your head. Story: “ Oh God, please don't, please don't, ” wailed the voices in my head. I wished they would shut up for a moment. They made it hard to hear if the girl in my trunk was waking up. “ Don't do it you sick bastard. ” There was old man McAvoy, shouting over the rest. I was pretty sure he yelled so loud because he was deaf. After all, he really should have heard me in the alley behind him. It had been a cloudy night and I'd tripped over a rusty trashcan, but that old coot had kept on fumbling with his keys and stopping to rummage around in his pockets like he had all the time in the world, instead of four hours. I pulled into the parking lot of the motel where I was staying and cut the engine. As I approached the trunk of the car, the wailing crescendoed. “ Cut it out, ” I grumbled, rubbing the bridge of my nose, “ Or I'll take it out of her skin. ” About half the voices fell silent. The other half were too crazy to listen or too angry to care, but the volume in my head was manageable at least. “ You sick motherfucker, ” McAvoy railed. “ I can't wait til the cops catch ya. They're gon na beat your sorry ass and stick you in the chair faster than… ” “ Faster than I can kill this girl? ” I muttered, lifting her body out of the trunk. “ Oh yes, that's quite true. I'm going to kill her slow, old man, just for you. ” As I arranged the girl on the double bed by the door, a matronly voice joined the fray. “ It's not too late for you. The Lord can forgive his children any sins. Repent! ” “ That's sweet of you, Mrs. Washington, ” I murmured to my freshman physics professor. “ But I don't feel an ounce of remorse. ” I began laying out my tools. Knives, mostly. I collected knives everywhere I went. My fingers brushed against the wooden handle of an old kitchen knife—my first knife, my first kill. “ You know, Mrs. Washington, ” I said. “ I really have so much to thank you for. Sure, I killed Matilda before I killed you. But that was just one murder—and you don't become a serial killer with just one kill. Especially not when that kill is your ex-girlfriend. ” I shuddered. “ How cliche. ” I surveyed my other tools, and though my eye caught briefly on the screwdriver I'd used on the widower in Portland, I kept coming back to the wood-handled paring knife. On the bed, my newest addition to the series was beginning to wake. “ I'd gut you with your own knives, you fascist pervert. Slam that screwdriver in your eye and that saw up your… ” “ Murderer! Murderer! Aaggggghhhhhhh murder! ” “ Please, James, ” Mrs. Washington said again. “ Your last murder can be your last. You can end this. ” But amongst the chorus of voices, I finally heard the one voice I'd been waiting for all night. Matilda said, “ Do it. ” I coiled my fingers around the paring knife's handle and approached the girl cowering on the bed.",0
"Prompt: No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it in a good condition. One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work. Story: Rosie broke her left thumb servo again, which means she'll miss another day of work while I try to navigate the phone book for a good replacement. If I wanted to Google it, I'd have to wait until Tom, my next-door neighbor, is home so that his work-bot can run a search query. I don't know why we all thought that our robots should be the only ones to use the internet, but c'est la vie, and all that shit. The phone system's down, of course, so I pocket the broken servo and head down the stairwell to the parts store in the basement of my apartment mall. I pass a couple junkies snorting dust in broad lamplight. They're both blocking the stairwell and the girl's mostly nude, so I have to push the man out of the way and apologize as I do it. He's too numb to notice, which means he hasn't come down yet. Thirteen stories down and the line forms for the next three stories. Everyone's in line to get their pieces.

Others wish to simply find happiness by experiencing true love, as perfect matches are rare but not impossible given an eternity. But I am afraid of death. Many of my peers still live alongside their parents, as it is likely that both parent and child will not reach their goals in one lifetime. But by some astronomical chance, both my parents have passed. My father, in a stroke of brilliance, painted the picture that now hangs in the National Gallery in the capital. I have not seen it. My mother, being the shy person she is, simply wished to have a child with a man she loved. She had lived fewer lifetimes than father. However she had me and died when I was 8. Simply put, my existence alone had killed her. I am very afraid of death. I still remember that night my mother had been crying. She came home drunk, cursing the fate that she had chosen. She had no one to blame but herself. And me. She might have not meant it. She was drunk. But she wanted to live on. She was afraid of death. My mother's death caused my father to seclude himself from society, embellishing the canvas with feelings that had taken centuries to build but was released when my mother died in a car crash. His masterpiece was one of grief and fear. The height of his career at the lowest point of his life. Within the same day that his work was hanging in the museum, he was hanging from the rope connected to the ceiling. His final artistic rendition. I still have not seen the painting. I guess was only natural that I wished to only die when I was not afraid of death. My peers are long dead now. I live alongside the next generation. Or the generation after that. I lost track of time. Love, school, parenthood, adventure. Nothing had quelled my fear of death. Perhaps it is finally time to learn from one who sought death. Perhaps it is time to take a trip to the museum.",0
"Prompt: You have been kidnapped by the mafia, the reason? Someone who 's very high up has a child who has a crush on you. Story: I feel his eyes, always on me, always begging me to turn and look back at him but I can't. I am Bree Tanner the daughter of a very important man. I am destined to get straight A's, graduate valedictorian and continue on to Harvard before taking over my daddy's company. I can't have any distractions especially not Demetri. I was only going to have one drink, then Aryella and I were going to split but the music, the energy and the vodka had another idea. Three drinks later and a silly game of spin the bottle and I haven't been able to forget that kiss ever since apparently neither could he, but it doesn't matter, it would never work between us if my father ever caught me even talking to him, the son of the big boss for the local Russian mob, I would be packed up and sent off to boarding school before his pretty blue eyes could bat an eye. ""Go tell him"" aryella's voice brought me back form drowning in Demetri's wavy brown hair. ""I.... what? What would I even tell him? Hey I think your a total hunk but your kinda a future mobster and I'm going to be a CEO so it won't work out any way!?"" This earned me a laugh and her signature hair flip as she turned a 3 $ cafeteria salad into something that looked like a house Salad for a five star restaurant. ""So are you going to my graduation party?"" Aryella asked excitedly. Before I could answer she began explaining the over extravagant party her father, only second on the wealth-o-meter to my father, would be throwing for her. I nodded along pretending the menu and live band were interesting to me as I imagined another party with demetri, could I risk a few more vodka mixed drinks and a game of spin the bottle? I would be leaving in a few weeks, what's he worst that could happen. The following weeks flew by, before I knew it I was officially a fully functioning member of society and I had the diploma and Harvard acceptance letter to prove it. Soon enough he night of Aryella's party came and here I stood in the 12th dress I've tried on and still not convinced it was sexy enough. The door to my bedroom busted open and not a moment later I was hit in the face with a flashy strapless blue sequence mini dress. ""I'm a Highschool graduate not a cheep hooker, I'm not going to wear this"" Aryella laughed as she strutted around my large room striking various poses in a matching black version of the dress. ""Aww come on it's our last big party together and I wanted us to match! Plus it changes colors!!"" Sure enough when I moved my hand across the sequence it changed from blue to green. ""fine I'll try it on but no promises"" it took me almost five minuets to squeeze shimmery and shake my way into that dress but all that work payed off. This was the dress. With a few beach waves a starfish clip and some black ankle boots I was ready to party. Three hours. The party started three hours ago and he still isn't here. I should be happy, he is a distraction I don't need but that one drunken kiss left me craving more. ""He's a bad boy Bree he's obviously waiting so he can show up fashionably late."" Aryella put a blue vodka jolly rancher drink in my hand. ""Relax have a drink dance a little and soon enough he will be here."" I took a deep breath then a deep drink from my cup hoping my friend is right. Demetri- She looks like a mermaid princess, her long brunette hair curled, makeup applied with precision, dress hugging her body showing off her curves. It's a shame she has to go away. It's a shame she is who she is, daughter of John Tanner. She hasn't noticed me yet but everywhere I go I can't help but notice her. It was a miracle that she sat next to me at rylees party a few weeks back but she haven't looked at me since. Perhaps she hates me, I knew she was drunk when I kissed her but she joined that game willingly, I only wish she would give me a chance while sober. There's only one way to find out. Bree- Some ware between my second and third drink I noticed him, Across the pool standing there in his silent sexy way. But around my third drink I was able to push him to the back of my mind and enjoy myself, after all of it's meant to be it will happen. ""The ocean is that way"" his deep voice snapped me out of my vodka induced dancing. ""Um what?"" ""the ocean, I figured Triton would be wanting his mermaid princess back"" I laughed a little over excitedly at his attempt at a joke. ""I knew blue sequence was a mistake, maybe green is a better idea"" with a quick wave of my arm I turned the better half of my dress green earning me an applaud and requests for an encore. Before long we both found ourself drinks in hand lounging at the top of Aryella's grand staircase. ""So there I was the Mayers two year old daughter in one hand, a priceless family heirloom China plate in the other and we are all covers in mud, needless to say I've never babysat again."" Nearly two hours have gone bye and it's obvious Demetri is good at more then kissing. It's a good thing I'm leaving next week, there's no way I can resist his charismatic charm. ""It's a shame you are going away to college, I would have really liked to get to know you better. ""His eyes focused on my lips as he said that last part and I know exactly what he was thinking. The same thing I've been thinking for the last hour. The time it took his lips to reach mine felt like eternity but the moment our lips touched I thought I had died and gone to heaven. His hand caressed my cheek as he ran his thumb along my jaw. I took ahold of the front of his shirt and lost myself in him. ""BREE ELISABETH TANNER GET YOUR HANDS OFF THAT DELINQUENT AND GET YOUR ASS IN MY CAR NOW!"" Oh shit. Only one person Calls me by my full name and that one person is the last one I want to see right now. I don't even look back, if I see his eyes, the hurt or love or whatever other confusing emotion he might be feeling right now I might break. The carried home is filled with avoider then nessisary sprach about the importance of being home by curfew and how I need to be hanging around people of importance not Russian mobsters. None of it matters, I got my kids now I can fly away to college without Any regrets, or can I? Is this what I want with my life? How have I never asked myself that before. My bags were packed for me, apartment one block away from campus picked out without any consideration on if I would like it or not, my life was no longer my own. It never was my own life, but now it felt like it was stolen. My iPod hummed in my ears, a sweet song Demetri told me I should listen to. As I looked out the window of the plane. I should be landing any Minuit where a driver will pick me up and take me to my Newley refurbished prison, far far away from where I wanted to be. The man in a black suit and tie held up a sign with Tanner printed across it in black letters. Without a word I handed him my bags and followed him to the car wanting nothing more then to go curl up in my bed eat ice cream and call Aryella. The car door shut behind me with a thump. The 45 minute drive to my new apartment was torture. The landscape was beautiful the shops all looked cute and I saw at least three coffee shops I could see myself sitting in and doing homework while sipping on a latte yet I hated it all of it. There was no Demetri or Aryella or pinkies ice cream shoppe for when I had a bad day. The driver pulled up to a charming apartment complex that I'm sure charges my parents more then it's worth and my driver helps me Carry my suitcase to my door. With a tip of his hat he is gone and I am left standing there feeling so alone and very defeated. The mechanisms in the lock clicks as I open the door and there in my over decorated living room is a pair of mischievous blue eyes smiling at me.",0
"Prompt: God shows you 3 Doors. Door One leads to eternal happiness, Door Two leads to infinite knowledge. Then there is Door Three, and God has never opened it yet. Story: Three choices lie before me. Eternal happiness, what is Eternal happiness? Is there really a place to never feel down or depressed? I remembered when I was first sitting on the examination table waiting for the big wooden door to open entering the doctor. Time seems at a stalemate as the clock in the room was stuck at noon. Ages fly by before the doctor finally enters the room with a yellow folder in his hand. ""Im sorry to say, but you have cancer."" Is there really a way for me to be back with my beautiful wife who stuck by me till my last bed ridden day? But is it worth has eternal happiness where ignorance is bliss or is it best to have the means to seek the knowledge behind happiness and what makes it eternal? Maybe even the meaning of life and why are born into a forsaken world where there's nothing but disconnects, pain, suffering, disease, depression, sorrow and dispair. The third door is what, a illusion of false hope of something better than the first two doors? Or is the door something we deeply desire. Why has on one before me this door before me? Is it truely a door that God has never opened once? He knows whats behind the door for sure. I bet he wants me to open the door, but you know what? I'm the one who is going to fucking open this door because I sure as hell is the one that wants to open the door not him. The door grow immensely as I approach it. God's eyes grow as he smile draws to a blank. The open opens before me and I am sucked into the darkness. The door closes slowly behind with God watching my eyes slowly turn to darkness. There is no light in this place, only the dark. A woman is screaming and breathing very heavily and I see a dim passage of light in the distance. I have only being drawn to the light and finally escape the darkness. Now in the light I slowly forget who I am and unable to speak or move out of my free will I have wrapped up and placed in warm, soft, loving arms.",0
"Prompt: Write a murder from the perspective of a cheerful inanimate object Story: Not a murder but I tried In my younger years I lived a life of extravagance, I was regularly out at sea, wind and salty water splashing at me, I have to admit that when the salt dried it used to get between all my crooks and crannies and itch a bit but being out at sea was wonderful, such freedom and glee at being taken out by the man that found me in the a little shop. I'm so grateful for that. I stopped getting used as much after a while, I remember a woman doing lots of strange things with the man on the boat that I was on, she came on it occasionally and then I stopped getting used hardly at all. My next point of use was for a very small person, I don't know where they came from but the man cut me in half and attached me to a plank of wood, god that was painful, I always wonder whether my other half is like a worm and is now It's own. Anyway, I got used for this purpose for a while, I can't say I enjoyed it much, I never got put away and I eventually started to ache and begin to break at the bottom. I felt ancient and eventually my bottom half broke away, letting the small person fall to the ground. Little sod, serves him right for treating me this way. I was then retired to a dark place where there was a big metal machine that made lots of noise that the man and woman got into, I spent a while here, it didn't bother me after the existence I'd lived with that small person. It was quiet, dark and all my tired joints weren't being stretched further causing me more pain. My one concern was that I'd never get used again. Alas, that day came. The woman came and retrieved me from my space, I was brought into their house and down some steps into the basement, there was another man there... I'd never seen him before, he was all bare skinned apart from a rubber thing in his mouth, I was attached to him and a chair. I couldn't think what my purpose was, why would she want to tie this strange man to a chair with me? There were lots of strange noises and afterwards she hit him with me aswell. I didn't particularly like this. I was again, put back to my original place and several times I was again used for this purpose. How strange, I wander where the first man that used me was. And here ends my story. The first man, my favourite man came to retrieve me, he tied me from a wooden beam on the ceiling and put a knot a the bottom, ahhh, I love being tied in a good knot, feel like I'm back to good use again, he put his head through it and jumped off a chair. What on earth was he doing? He struggled for a bit before hanging still. The woman came in a while after and she did lots of screaming, a little like the strange man I'd been attached to. Strange, it's normally the one tied up that does that I thought? There were lots of flashing lights and then I was put in a bag and I haven't moved from this place since, I don't really like it much, It's quite warm and I don't see anything interesting anymore. I wish I was back at sea.",0
"Prompt: You are legally allowed to commit murder once, but you must fill out the proper paperwork and your proposed victim will be notified of your intentions Story: I liked these guys. None of them were as smart as I am but we got along, the house had a lot of space and they didn't infringe on my reality any. I went to class, I came home, I ate and I paid my bills. They did the same. I was going to be a doctor and all my bros respected that. I was grateful. It was better than living in the dorms, even before all that roommate nonsense. If you could believe it, the house was quieter than the residence halls. It was dirtier, sure, but I could live with that for a couple more years. There was a knock on the door. Tommy was closest, so he answered. ""Jack, uh, it's for you bro."" ""So let her in,"" I replied, trying to sound cool about it. I really wasn't expecting anyone. ""No, Jack, he, uh, he says he needs to see you right now in person."" Oh shit. I looked at my watch. Did I forget a tutoring appointment? If I did, I forgot it completely because I have no idea what I'm missing. There's a guy in the doorway wearing standard issue khakis with a standard issue blue button-down shirt. A drone of some kind. He's holding a small device. I look at him suspiciously. He looks at me, checks the screen, sighs, and asks for a signature as he hands me the gadget. ""What is this?"" I ask. ""Notification. Initial there and there too, please."" ""Is this, like, a delivery or something?"" ""Not really, no. Your answer should be coming up on the screen now, initial after you scroll through. Check the box if you want to reserve the ROR which will be delivered to your heir."" ""My what?"" I ask after initialing all the boxes. ""Look at the screen, sir."" It reads: FUCKED UP THE BELL CURVE I look up from the pad and I see a girl from my biology lab emerge from the bushes and she's.... Holy shit is that a gun? I turn back to the house, see Tommy and the others and I hear, or think I hear, a collective moan before I definitely hear two pops and fall.",0
"Prompt: `` Let go your earthly tether, enter the void, empty and become wind. '' Story: ""You seem to be a very troubled man, why? ``, said the Guru. ""Can't you see why!? I'm overwhelmed by debt and I'm all alone. So alone..."", I cried out. I felt a hand on my shoulder, not one that tried to hold me back, but one to push me forward. The Guru spoke again, ""Do not worry sir, you seem to be one who has endured through a lot of pain. Let that pain be your motivation to feel well again. Loneliness is something that everybody experiences so don't fret, it shall pass with time. The debt though, is something that can only be solved with time. So be patient and you shall be well again. Let my hand be the first to push you towards your future. It may not be much of a push, but it is a push that will give you a step into the right direction."" My throat chokes up and I can barely whisper to him, ""I have given my problems nothing but time though! It's been 20 long years and nothing has changed! I'm still in debt and all alone. How can you say that giving me a push will send me in the right direction when I've been going in the wrong direction all my life!?"" The Guru sighs and says to me, ""Do you truly believe that there is nothing left? Do you truly believe that it will never get better?"" ""Yes..."", I whisper. ""There is nothing I can do then, my friend. I have tried to help you but you will have none of it. So go, let go your earthly tether, enter the void, empty and become wind.""",0
"Prompt: Yesterday, the world heard an announcement that a massive asteroid would hit the earth today. Only it did n't, and now everyone is feeling super awkward. Story: I always thought it was hokey, that idea of living like it's your last day. I was always a cynical piece of shit. I believed that if you knew that a day was your last day, you were more liable to start a riot or just cry constantly in the fetal position than actually do anything meaningful with your life. But you never really know how something's going to feel until you go through it. We're all stuck in our own heads that way. So when the day came, when I woke up to that post stickied at the top of reddit, I didn't react the way a movie character would react. The first thing I did was double check that it wasn't April Fools day, obviously. I told you I'm a cynical piece of shit. When I was sure that it was real, I called my mom. We held an impromptu family reunion in the park. I don't know what happened, but it just kept growing. My mom and dad invited their siblings, but then their siblings invited their spouses' families, and so on, until there was a huge crowd of people I had basically no relation to. We sat around drinking and told stories and played cards at the table. An ex-girlfriend showed up at some point to apologize to me. I guess that's what she was doing with her day, just making amends. I told her that I forgave her. I didn't really, but it felt like the thing to do. Some people from one of the local churches came out and passed out candles to everyone when it started getting dark. Some of us chilled in a circle and listened to the hymns. I've never really believed in that stuff, but the songs were nice anyway. I can't pretend like I didn't have sex ""one last time"". One of my co-workers hit me up with a text and I'm a hotblooded American male. But it was nice. It was gentle and we cuddled afterwards. You know, that sappy shit. She wasn't on good terms with her family and didn't have any plans, so I invited her back to the park. A bunch of my family had a campfire set up. We fell asleep there, her head on my chest. I remember my mom kissing my forehead as I was drifting off. I woke up dirty. Literally, covered in dirt. That's what happens when you fall asleep in a park. All around me, people were confused. My coworker was gone. I found her sitting on a bench, speaking on her phone. She looked up at me when she hung up, eyes shining with anger. ""They got it *wrong! *"" I'd never seen her angry before. She had always been kind of a doormat. ""It MISSED US! They announced to the entire world that it was going to hit and it fucking MISSED US!"" ``.... Shit."" I didn't know what to say. ""Wow. What the fuck?"" She ranted about how irresponsible it was for them to do this, but I was distracted by how confident she seemed. She'd given something up, expecting the end. We all had. I'd given up some of my bravado and let myself be soft. She'd let go of her fear and become confident. ""Hey."" I interjected, when she paused to take a breath. ""You're right, this is totally inexcusable, but if the world's really not gon na end.... do you want to get dinner with me tonight or something?"" It didn't work out between us, not in the long run. She was too nice, I was still a cynical piece of shit. But things ended on good terms. That's kind of the crux of it, of everything that happened after that day. When the world ""ended"", it ended on good terms. Not for everyone, but for most people. People spent that day with their family, or thinking about the good they could have done. They connected with their fellow man. The truly unhappy people killed themselves ahead of time or when they found out it wasn't coming. So the world that was left behind was.... softer. More empathetic. Slower to judge. It can't last forever. Two years have passed now and I can already feel it dying out, the rhetoric becoming hateful and vitriolic again. But I still think it was for the best. Sometimes people need to actually be faced with the capital-e End before they're going to change. People are dumb that way. Anyway, this is all just to say that I disagree with giving those astronomers the death penalty.",0
"Prompt: A soldier in the heat of battle suddenly hears a voice that says `` I am your child 's imaginary friend. They have sent me to protect you in your greatest time of need. '' Story: I found myself backed up against the wall of the sewer, the Z's closing in on me, slowly by their definition, hungry by their ambition, the moaning so deep and morbid I had to non-literally swallow my angst. I clicked my machine gun, but it was dead, jammed with sewer water. It was an older one, from back when guns didn't work after getting soaked. I reached for my sword and unsheathed it, my reflection flashing by my field of view, reminding me of why we were still in this stupid freaking war. My wife, Eris May, was still back home in Iron Cove, that American colony by the ocean on Mars. I had a little girl, too. Alex was her name. I'll tell ya, she was the most amazing angel God ever sent the human race. I remember her swinging in her swing set I'd built for her out of silverwood; we'd push her back and forth as she watched the birds in the beautiful green sky of the Red Planet. I was never going to see her again. The Z's were getting closer. I assumed the stance one assumes when attempting to fight off hordes of the undead with an ancient Aztec sword, that is, a stance showing that I was in acknowledgement of my inevitable dismissal from time and space. I closed my eyes. May and I had saved this stupid world so many times. We'd helped bring down North Korea. We blew a Neo-Soviet war satellite out of the clear blue sky. We'd found Cibola, and a Phoenix, and the freaking Holy Grail. And now I was going to die. Alone. Away from Eris May and from Alex and my sister and my nephew Lincoln and everyone and everything else I loved. I tightened my hold on my sword. A great man once said that the Universe is big and amazing and absolutely crazy, and that sometimes, one day in a thousand thousand centuries, impossible things just happen. And we call them miracles. And, I suppose, this was one of those days. A young woman suddenly appeared next to me using a vortex manipulator (one of those quick-and-dirty time and space travel devices you wear on your wrist). I knew her. I was sure of it. And I wasn't. And then she spoke and I remembered exactly who she was. “ Well don't just stand there, dummy! ” She motioned to the manipulator on her wrist facing me. “ Hold on! ” I re-sheathed my blade and grabbed onto the device. “ See ya ‘ round, [ flip ] ers! ” she shouted to the Z's as we dematerialized and reappeared on a warship circling the broken Earth. “ Y—You're— ” I stuttered at the girl once my gut was certain we were safe. “ Yup. Alex sent me. ” “ BUT YOU'RE NOT REAL! ” I said, overwhelmed. “ We've met before, you know, ” she said, walking over to a control table, sitting in a desk chair and beginning to spin around. This was Akara, my daughter's imaginary friend. I knew because Alex would always draw her just like that. Where Alex was metaphorically an angel, Akara was actually one. Like, a human being with wings and a halo and a wreath in her hair. Alex said she was the guardian of the wind. I'd never taken it seriously, obviously. Until now. “ How could I have met you before? You are her invisible friend! ” “ And I was yours, too, Colby. Your guardian angel. Oh, the times we had, Davidson. ” She flipped some switches on the desk and spun back around to me. “ The times we had… Before you stopped believing in me. ”",0

"Prompt: A little girl robs a bank. How? Story: Tiny treads form swirls and shapes at the bottom of Sara's sneakers, these elaborate patterns are revealed as she stretches and strains to reach the ledge above. She begins to wobble back and forth as her feet scarcely touch the floor, aided only by her toes. Her parents continue chatting with the banker about topics of little interest to her now as she peers at the object just out of reach with a green glint in her eyes. Sara steadies herself with pudgy, pink fingers climbing upwards and outwards towards the treasure atop the table as her father finally takes notice. “ Sara, please sit down! ” her father urges in a hushed tone. Seeing his daughter's outstretched arms, he misjudges the gesture and picks her up instead. Placing the young girl atop his lap, he returns his attention to the conversation at hand. Her prize shone under the fluorescent lights above, its smooth metal plating mocking her only inches away. Sara leaned and twisted towards the stick with little progress as her father's arm barred the way. He continually adjusted his grip and the knee on which she sat, pulling her further from the object she desired. Squirming and fidgeting in place, Sara drained the patience of her father quickly, until he picked her up and placed her on the floor once more. His scolding words fell upon deaf ears as she stared at the pen that was now visible from the edge. Slowly descending towards the carpeted floor, Sara swiped at the gleaming cylinder and caused it to move towards the ledge, an opening that she hoped to take advantage of from below. With her parents distracted once more, she stretched upwards and quickly scaled the vertical surface with her fingertips keeping her balanced. Like a well-trained thief, she moved slowly and quietly to avoid drawing attention to herself as her short digits scraped its surface bringing it closer. Initially, her mouth opened wide with surprise as her skin relayed the sensation of the cool tube to her brain. As she remained focused on the task, her lips remained parted as her tongue licked her cheek from the bottom right. Inexplicably, she managed to grasp the pen at last, drawing it close to her chest with a quiet gasp of excitement. Sara quickly hid the hard-earned treasure in her pockets as the meeting finished above her. A firm hand grasped her arm and led them away as she escaped the bank with her mother and father none the wiser. In the backseat of the car, she took out the fountain pen that she stole from the desk and turned it over in her hands. She couldn't explain or understand why that pen felt so good to have, but it did. It was just her little secret. -125",0
"Prompt: You are a time traveler and you are sent back in time to prevent the death of Kennedy only to find out you are on a landing craft for the invasion of Normandy. Story: ""30 Seconds!"" 'Holy hell, where am I' thought Lee. He was sent back in time to 1963 to prevent the assassination of JFK. Something must've gone wrong. Then he got a message on his Time-Watch. It was supposed to look just like a regular watch of the period he was sent to but only he could see the messages that popped up. On the screen it read:'Lee, we screwed up, we can't get you out until'64. P.S If you're not dead before you read this, you're about to invade Normandy with the US in 1944.' ""Go! Go! Go!"" Men started running out of the landing craft and into the temporary defense of the German defenses that were put up. Lee ran up to one and took cover. Lee looked over to a dead United States rifleman. He picked up the dead mans M1 and his helmet.'I need a plan. They can't help me until'64 I'm back in'44. Guess I have to sit through this and not get killed.' He turned back to see a few soldiers advancing to a small hill line right before the German gun emplacements. They threw frags in and the Germans died. Lee ran up to the hill and dove down just as a burst of enemy fire ripped above his head.",0
"Prompt: For the first time in a hundred years, night fell on the Land of Two Suns. Story: Darkness bled across the land. Some quaked in terror. Some hid. Some stood in the shadows and cried to the skies. Most celebrated the amazing event that had not been seen since their grandparents were in swaddling clothes. Parties abounded and youngsters dared themselves to all sorts of crazy feats in the dark. Some had practiced with blind folds to see if they could cope but most just revelled in the weirdness of it all. With two suns pouring light into every nook a full night only happened once in a century and would not occur again in the lifetime of anyone watching the event. “ What are those things? ” The cluster of teens looked up at the sky and pointed. Tiny lights sprinkled the blackness. They gasped in wonder. “ They are so beautiful. ” “ Wow, that is the most gorgeous thing I have ever seen. ” “ Aren't they the things Crazy Allie always draws? ” “ What does she call them? ” “ Stars. ” “ Hey where is Crazy Allie? ” Someone shrugged but it went unnoticed in the dark. “ How did she know about stars? ” “ No idea, but she is always drawing them. ” “ She's been talking about this for months. She's probably on top of the highest building to get the best view. ” “ Crazy Allie was on to something. Wow. I wouldn't have missed this for anything. ” They all clustered around their science teacher who arrived at their position using a hand held light to find his footing. “ Hey professor, what are stars? ” “ Yeah, how come we can't see them any other time? ” “ Allie could tell you all about them. Where is she by the way? ” “ None of us have seen her today. We figured she was getting a good vantage point. ” “ Stop talking you lot, just look up while it lasts. ” “ Will my phone film without light? ” The teens jostled for space and craned their necks to see all of the once in a century night. The watched the light flow back onto the world as if a giant glowing curtain were being drawn across the land. When they were fully bathed in light again they laughed in release. “ In-cred-ible! ” “ I will see you all tomorrow and you can tell me everything you know about stars in an essay due next class. ” The professor laughed at the half-hearted groans and headed back to the school building. He felt buoyed by a sense of being part of an historic moment and he smiled as he put his key card in the lock of the upper access to the building. The lesser sun bathed everything in a soft yellow glow which would give way to the greater sun and its cold white, in just a few hours. He wished he could enjoy the last few hours of the gold but he had to get some work done before he headed home to keep out of the greater sunlight. Heading down to the underground classrooms he reached his classroom but the lock mechanism seemed to be sealed with some sticky substance. “ Is there someone in maintenance? Someone has tampered with the door pad. Yes I can wait but I do need to finish some papers before Greater sunlight. ” The wait was short and the worker sprayed the lock with an astringent liquid. “ Kids! Doesn't matter where they're from or when, they all get up to some kind of pranks. They must have done it after their last class. Lucky the night happened on the weekend. I will have this cleared in a jiffy professor. ” They stepped through the open door and stopped on the thresh-hold. Every surface of the room was covered in stars. Thousands of them. Cut out stars, painted stars, marker pen stars, crayons, ink, blood. The girl named Crazy Allie, slumped on a seat in the middle of the room. The girl and the chair created an island in the pool of blood surrounding her. It formed a multi-pointed star.",0
"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear Katie, It feels strange to be sitting here writing this to you. Especially in the form of a letter, emails seem to be a way of life, but I have to say that watching my pen move over this page has a certain draw. I never thought I would need to write a letter to you. In my mind you should be right here with me. If I close my eyes I can imagine that you're right beside me, our shoulders touching while we hold hands and enjoy each other's company. Even in my imagination my hands are a bit sweaty, but you've always made me nervous Katie. I remember you used to worry about that, you would say ""just be your self. I'll love you anyway."" I'm not sure I ever convinced you that I was being myself, the nervousness couldn't be helped. I couldn't stand the idea of hurting or disappointing you. Lot of good that does me now. It took weeks to write this. Seeing your smiling face in my mind and sometimes barely remembering your voice hurt too much. When the pain was all I knew you were my life raft in the ocean. Now I just have to drown until the waters subside. Know that I don't blame you, special. Remember when I called you that all the time? Anyway, I really don't. Everything was always intense between us. Amazing highs and amazing lows. I'm so glad you found someone that makes you happy. I used to tell you that as long as you were happy I would be as well. That's at least somewhat true. I'll never date again, people tell me never is a long time but it's not the same. Who knew I would be a one woman man? But I am and I found and lost the only woman I'll ever want. Ever. This could ramble on for a long time so I'll wrap things up. Know that I still love you, I never stopped. I don't blame you for moving on. It sounds ridiculous but sometimes I hold out hope that our story isn't over. That somewhere down the line you'll love me again. Hah, pathetic. Be safe special. P.S. I recently lost and then found the bracelet you made me senior year. It doesn't fit anymore so it stays around the gear shift in my car. Love you always, Alex.",0
"Prompt: The most hateful, spiteful, bitter confession of undying love. Story: I fucking _hate_ you. I'm serious, you know. I actually do hate you. Detest, abhor, loathe. I hate you so much that if you got hit by a train and your disembowelled mutilated body was the front page picture tomorrow, I wouldn't bat an eye. Not an eye_lash_. I hate every single little thing about you. I hate your legs - your fucking legs, that you use to grip and trap and keep, may they be carved apart slowly, carefully, muscle by muscle, giving you time to scream yourself hoarse in between. I hate your fucking hair, that ensnares and encircles and encompasses, may it get stuck in the churning whirling writhing cogs of some great machine, rip off your scalp from your grinning stupid skull. I hate your eyes. Your fucking eyes, that shine and blink and call and shut like _a cage_, except not a cage because you can still look _inside_ a cage. I dream, sometimes, of forcing your eyes open, and dripping the finest, finest sand in the world into them. Drip drip drip drip drip through your screaming and begging and bleeding until you are blind, as fucking blind as me. I _hate_ your eyes. Hate. Hate. Hate. I hate your voice. Your brash, guileless, honest voice, with a hint of mockery, except even that's another fucking lie, isn't it, the lie you use as bait. Bait for those too foolish to run away from your royal _fuckingness_. You set the trap for me perfectly, this goddamn perfectly, doing exactly every single thing to make me hate you more. I hate your hands. Your perfect little pianist's hands - give me a fucking break. You'd never use them to _make_, to _create_. But by god are you good at cutting and ripping and drawing blood. Perfect, surgical cuts, you make, peering with a practised eye, then swiftly snipping until there's nothing but pieces. I hate your fucking eyes, too. I know I said that already, but I do. Hate them, that is. Most of all, I hate your _brain_. Your disgusting revolting steaming pustules of rats feasting on maggots feasting on humanity that you call a brain. Your brain that comes up with all of this, that wants to rend and blind and trap and makes _my_ brain want all that too. Match made in the fucking eighth circle of hell, right? You must get it by now. I've been absolutely, positively clear. I hate you. I hate you. I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU hate me too.",0
"Prompt: The .1 % of germs left behind after hand sanitizer use is the deadliest of all, lying dormant in humans ... until now. Story: ""Could I have a large cappuccino to go please?"" I asked the man behind the counter. He was kind of cute, in a way, and the smile that he flashed at me almost turned my knees to water. He nodded and turned away to make my drink. It's stupid really. I've been coming here every day for the past month and I've never even asked him his name. He's the only one who works here at this time, so it's not like there would be anybody else watching. Just *talk* to him damn it! He handed me my coffee and smiled again, hinting that perhaps he felt the same way. Just as I opened my mouth to speak to him, I heard the door of the café open behind me as another customer walked in. ""Could I have a large...."" his order was cut short by a sudden intake of breath, which built up into a sneeze as he tipped his head back. I took a step away from him to avoid the blast zone, and the shout he gave out seemed to reverberate throughout the entire room in which we were standing. ""Bless you,"" the man behind the counter said, but his face fell when he looked closer at the man who had sneezed. He bent low over the ground, wheezing. A dreadful rattle that crawled its way out of his mouth, and a sickening wetness accompanied it. Still crouched over, he let out a short cough, and a fine spray of dark red blood hit the carpet. I was immediately by his side. ""Oh my god, are you okay?"" I asked him, immediately regretting my stupid question. ""Yeah, I'm fine. Its just..."" He coughed again, this time spewing a thick blob of bloody phlegm onto the cream coloured carpet, which rapidly darkened as the liquid soaked into it. He erupted into a coughing fit at that point, the spasms wracking his body as he fell to the floor. His arms thudded against the floor as he thrashed wildly, all the while emitted a deep moan that gurgled at sporadic intervals. Eventually he fell still, and the noise stopped almost as abruptly as they had begun. His eyes, although aimed at the ceiling, seemed unfocussed. A thick stream of blood poured out of the corners of his mouth, and the flesh of his lips appeared bruised and rough, almost as if something was forcing its way through the skin. As I pressed two fingers against his neck to check for a pulse, the skin split like an overripe fruit, spilling black, foul-smelling flesh out of his body. I tried to stifle a gag as the disgusting substance flopped onto the floor. ""Call an ambulance!"" I nearly screamed, barely even turning my head, but noticing he had already begun to do so. When I looked back at the man on the floor, the black gunge seemed to be turning white, and the surface of it seemed to become almost hairy. Some part of my brain screamed a warning. *Don't Touch. * It echoed over and over again. I made the mistake then of breathing in, which finally caused me to retch and vomit, the slime covering the body that I was fairly certain was dead at this point. As I watched, however, the white hairs seemed to be creeping outwards, already dragging themselves over the fresh vomit, almost as if searching for it. I stared in horror as the skin began to ripple and bulge, splitting further down the body as the clothes began to stain black and the stench rose, as the first of the sirens began to fill the air.",0
"Prompt: A voice in the sky will tell you when you 've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out to [ location of your choice ]. Halfway there you hear `` You have visited a location for the last time. '' Story: John wrinkled his nose and cleared his throat. Pausing, he put down his briefcase and adjusted his tie. It was a red tie with white stripes. This was one of his favorite ties. He picked up his briefcase and walked to his car. It was the last car in the lot, as was common on every night for John. A black Ford Taurus, 1998. He walked with his head held high, and his left hand fumbled for his keys in his pocket. There were many things on his mind at the moment, one of which was pulling out those damn keys without his wallet hanging on to them like an unexpected prize from a claw machine. But the larger thought that had taken residency in his mind, was the voice. The voice that told him that he would never step foot in that location again. A small smile cracked at the thought of this, but was quickly hidden with a deep breadth. Now John was never too keen of nature, but this air tasted sweet to him. Something he had never noticed before. Finally, he reached his car. Unlocking the door, he placed his briefcase in the passenger seat. He thought of his daughter and of his wife. He thought of all the hours of work, and how it had finally got him to the point he was today. He replayed in his mind what his boss said to him, You are getting a promotion, no more floor work for you now, now you will manage your own branch of factories. You are your own boss now. As John turned the ignition nothing happened. After five twists, the Taurus sputtered to life. If there was a form of car bronchitis, this car was definitely patient zero. After the drive home, John was ready to unwind in his small apartment with his family. By the end of the month, John would never step foot in that beat down car, or that run down apartment again. He would hear that first, from the voice.",0
"Prompt: The components for sentience are successfully installed in an android moments before the nuclear armageddon occurs. Years later, the android wakes up in the wasteland. Story: So this is what it feels like. Feels cold. My sensors must be malfunctioning. I should get that looked at. Perhaps Creator will fix them for me. He always fixes me; it is stored in my memory that he does. It is also stored that he usually is there when I wake. Perhaps it's more than my sensors that are off. If I boot up my optical sensors, I'm sure he'll be here with me, tinkering with my faulty systems. My temporal sensors are at least working because I can hear the shutters of my optical units whir as they pull back. There's an excess of light. Strange, because it is not in my memory banks as being this bright. I raise my arm to shield some of the light unit my optics can adjust. A few of my sensors are at least working; their respective red bars or readings pop up on my display. It is hot out; temperatures read above 40 degrees Celsius. It is peculiar that I feel cold. I will have creator look at them. Perhaps he is somewhere else in the laboratory, working on other projects. I sit up. He should just be around here somewhere.... This can not be correct. The image filtering through my optics is not a laboratory. There is nothing resembling a laboratory, or even a building. Scattered bits of metal buried in red sand, but nothing more. I stand. There's nothing. Red sand stretches further than my zoom function can comprehend. Nothing at all. I must have been moved. Creator is testing me. Yes, that is it. He has placed me in this desolate place as a test. He would give me a directive if this was a test. Find habitable territory for humans and other species, something like that. But nothing in my memory shows that. No directive stored. This can not be a test then. It has to be something else. What? Perhaps I am to figure out my directive. Yes, that must be it. I am to take samples of my surroundings and determine a directive from it. That solution, while far-fetched, is still logical. Creator did not give me a directive as part of my test. He would like to see me react to no directive. This is all still a test. It is good that this is still a test. Creator is still out there. Soil samples of the red sand are the first logical step. Perhaps some component of the sand can give me hints. I bend. The sand makes a nice sound as it falls through my fingers, tiny particles scraping the metal coverings of my fingertips. My finger sensors are functioning, and they send a myriad of reading up to me. Sodium content, base rock type, analysis of particle shape. Nothing gives me as a clue to my directive. Perhaps it requires a second reading. I reach down and scoop the sand back into my palm, holding it longer for more readings. A symbol flashes onto my screen. three triangular shapes surrounding a circle. Radioactive. I don't comprehend. Only a handful of ways explain why the soil would be radioactive, most notably, an atomic bomb. But that's not logical. An atomic bomb would mean that everything is gone. But it is. It is.... The Laboratory.... Any form of life.... Creator.... It's all gone. Gone. So this is what it feels like. Sadness. This is what sadness feels like.",0
"Prompt: Tinder becomes a giant corporation and essentially a government institution worldwide. Everyone gets an obligatory implant that automatically notifies matches you come across or walk by. Story: *Bing* The interface places a green outline around a tall woman with chocolate skin and bright red lipstick. I smile at her, pretending that I am ignoring the stats that scroll to the left of her wonderfully frizzy hair. We are compatible, at least in the eyes of the programming from our Tinder chip implants which, to be fair, was usually pretty accurate. It managed to gather data about your personality, health, and socio-economic status in addition to information provided by an interests and life goals quiz which requires yearly updating as long as one remains single. She looks back and makes no effort to hide her judgement when she comes upon my family history. The green outline becomes red and she walks away. Rejection is just that simple now. No contact needed. You enter a bar and immediately know who is worth your time and who isn't. Which is bad news for people like me. *Bing* Another green outline. It changes red and she walks away, pace hastening as if I were planning to chase after her or something. You aren't that remarkable, sweet cheeks. *Bing* I turn off the damned sound and don't even bother looking at her information. As a person who doesn't go out often, I forget how annoying that noise can get. It changes red and I sigh, strolling into the bakery and stepping into the line. I can smell the heat of the oven despite the overwhelming scent of bread. It's subtle but I like it a lot. My chip senses the stimulation and adds something into my profile. Great, I guess if I meet another lover of delicious scents I can frighten her off as well. Much to my disdain, a green line forms around the young woman at the counter. She should have put her interface into work mode, it would prevent awkward encounters like this. It stays green as I approach, pretending I haven't noticed while gazing over the menu. “ What can I get for you? ” Her voice, soft but still upbeat, captures my attention and I make eye contact with her. Blue eyes, my favorite. Not that I'd turn someone away for anything different. I've just always been a sucker for big blue eyes. The line is still green and she is smiling. Maybe she hasn't read yet. “ Oh, just a tomato and mozzarella panini, please, ” I reply as I pretend to look for my wallet, hand squirming around foolishly in my pocket. “ I have a lunch break in a few minutes, could I join you? ” “ Really? ” My eyes are narrowed, brows pulled down in a combination of confusion and suspicion. “ Yeah, we have so much in common. Plus, we are both reading Martian. The movie was great but I am loving the book. We could talk about it or something, ” she shrugs, rosey cheeks still round and tensed from her warm smile. She has to have read it. My current book is listed far below that damning piece of information. “ Oh, that would be great, ” I reply, trying to relax as I place my card on the counter. Once I pay and take a seat, waiting for my food, I realize that I've not yet read her stats. My gaze returns and I activate the list, allowing it to be pulled away from her figure and into the center of my table. A line of red text appears under the “ health ” heading. Cancer? She has cancer. She doesn't want kids, which is good for me, and we have a remarkable amount of similar interests. Even our travel bucket list is nearly identical. Maybe the cancer wasn't that bad. “ By the look on your face I assume you read, ” she hums, placing my plate down and sliding to the seat across from me. “ Yes. Did you read, I mean -- Most people don't really like what they see. My father and all. ” “ I did see that. But, having a madman for a father hardly says anything about you. ” “ You realize he killed seven people. He ate them. ” “ Shh, don't ruin your lunch. So, what chapter are you on? ” We talk for an hour about books and life and death, goals and what we want to make of ourselves. After her break ends we exchange information and I go home, smiling as my interface registers my planned date and ceases to advertize me to those who pass by. We fall in love on the second date. It wasn't anything more than a small dinner in my less than dazzling apartment, but she was amazing. We were amazing. Her cancer is terminal. After years of treatment she was given five to ten years and wanted someone to spend it with. Someone who makes her feel alive. Apparently I make her feel alive. We date for a few months before she asks me to marry her. She tells me that I am like the much needed bookend on her half-full book shelf. Even though she'd never have a full collection, I was there to told her up -- fill the empty space. I know that I will lose her in the end, but, for once in my life I feel free of judgement. I feel like I have escaped the thing that has kept me pegged as “ unsuitable ” for the majority of my life. I am just me, living with her. Until the bitter end.",0
"Prompt: A man offers you a cigarette. You see the man, to your surprise, to be your Dad. Story: I step out of the bar with my phone pressed to my ear, “ Say that again, babe. It's too loud in the bar for me to hear you. ” My boyfriend never calls me in the middle of a shift, so I knew something was up. Two people stood outside with me – one of our regulars that smoked menthol cigarettes and only drank Schlitz tall boys, and an older guy that looked vaguely familiar, but I couldn't figure out why. He walked up to the door to go inside, and then saw me and stopped. I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye, trying to figure out how we knew each other, but turned around as my boyfriend spoke. “ I, uh… I just got home and found a note taped to the door… ” he trailed off. He sounded confused, a little flustered. Something was definitely wrong. “ What's going on? What did the note say? ” I asked frantically, plugging one ear to drown out the noise of the traffic. “ It's… Well, it's your dad. ” I froze. “ What? ” There's no way… “ What did he do now? He's got more than three years left. Is he dead or something? ” I spun on my heel, beginning to pace. I hadn't spoken to my father in more than twenty years. “ No. It was him, ” my boyfriend said slowly, “ He left the note. He was here. ” Ice ran down my spine, my heart jumped into my throat, my stomach fell into my heels. “ No, ” I said, staring blankly at the sidewalk beneath my feet, “ NO. There is no possible way. He's doing twenty five years in Cook County for murder, there is no fucking way he was at our apartment. ” My mind started racing. Jailbreak? Good behavior? Parole? How in the hell… I fumbled in my hoodie pocket for my cigarettes, which I realized were sitting comfortably next to the register behind the bar. Fuck. “ Smoke? ” I looked up to see the older man offering me a cigarette, one Marlboro red pointing towards me out of the pack. I looked him in the eye, and suddenly it hit me. I was suddenly covered in goose bumps, my eyes undeniably the size of dinner plates. “ Hannah, I don't know how, but it's signed by him, it's his handwriting, it doesn't make any sense, but I think.... ” my boyfriend's voice faded as the realization dawned on me. “ I… I got ta … I'll call you back, Jeff. ” I hung up my phone even though I could hear my boyfriend protesting and asking questions on the other end. “ What the hell are you doing here? ” I asked. “ Do you want a smoke, or no? Do you smoke? I figured if you're a bartender now, you probably smoke… ” he trailed off, a half-smile playing on his lips, blue eyes all glittering with happiness and laughter. Same eyes I have. Same eyes my sister had. “ No, I don't want your fucking cigarette. Get the fuck out of here before I call the police. Again. ” I turned to walk inside “ Hey, come on. Is that any way to treat your old man? I went to a lot of trouble to track you down, you know. Can't I come have a beer and we can talk? ” He almost sounded genuine. “ No. No you can not come inside my bar. You can not have a beer and we can not talk., ” I spun around to face him, heart pounding, “ You had such a hard time finding me for a reason. I changed my name for a reason. Go. Away. ” “ Hannah, please, ” he begged, reaching both hands out to me, palms up, “ Let me explain. ” I laughed. I actually laughed in his face. “ Explain what?! ” Now I was really pissed off, “ Explain how you killed my sister? Explain how you were so many different kinds of fucked up that I had to call 911? I was 8! She was 12! You don't get to explain a god damn thing! Fuck you! ” I turned, whipped the door open, and stormed behind the bar. I grabbed my cigarettes and walked right out the back door to the alley without saying a word to anyone. I saw the sideways glances that customers gave me, and my bar back looked after me, and then looked out front. My dad stood there, smoking a cigarette, looking inside as I disappeared out eh back door. Marlboro Reds. No matter how much I hated him, it was simple things like that that made my whole body vibrate with anger. He doesn't get to just show up at my house. Or my job. He doesn't get to have a beer with me and “ talk. ” I shook my head as I exhaled smoke. This old, faintly familiar old man that made me do a double take turns out to be my father. I hadn't seen him since I testified in court against him at eight years old. He had been coked out of his brains, two bottles of shitty Canadian whiskey deep, and when my sister wouldn't stop bothering him for dinner, he hit her. He hit her so hard that her tiny little body spun in a half circle before falling against the glass coffee table. Blunt force trauma. She was dead before I ran into the living room, asking Daddy about the loud noises. He could hardly keep his eyes open, let alone focused on the baseball game that was blaring on the TV. I screamed and cried and tried to wake Ashley up, and all he could manage to do was push me over with his foot as I knelt over my big sister. I ran and called 911 like my grandma had taught me to do, and I told the court the same thing. I hated that they took my daddy away. But I hated him for taking my sister away more. Twenty-one and a half years later, he shows up at my bar. Un-fucking-believable. I heaved the back door open and stepped back inside. I shook my head to clear the cobwebs and memories, and there he was, sitting at my bar, seat sic, drinking a Miller Light and watching Sports Center, like he didn't have a care in the god damn world. I took a deep breath, threw my shoulders back, and walked back to my position behind the bar. Kyle, my bar back looked at me with one eyebrow raised. “ Did he start a tab? ” I asked Kyle, nodding over my shoulder toward my dad. “ Uh, no. He paid cash, ” Kyle started, “ Who is – “ I spun around to face my dad, cutting Kyle off. “ I'm sorry, sir, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave, ” I mustered all of the supreme ice queen coolness I could and looked him in the eye. “ Come on, Hannah, seriously, I just – “ “ Sir, ” I cut him off, “ I have the right to refuse service to anyone at any time for any reason. ” “ I know, ” he started to talk over me, “ But, sweetie, just— “ “ I am not your sweetie, and I will not continue to serve you. You can leave on your own now, or I will call the police. ” My voice was hoarse, and I was starting to lose my composure. He sighed and stared at the bar in front of him for a moment. “ Okay, ” he took one final swig of his beer and stood up. He struggled a bit; the signs of an old man who had lived too hard and too fast for too long. As he pushed his stool back in, he set a piece of paper on the bar. “ Just call me, okay? Hannah? Whenever you can. ” The cool autumn air rushed in when he opened the door, and I waited until he had turned the corner and was out of sight before slipping down to the floor, hugging my knees, and sobbing.",0

Superman- the perfect model of their superior protector to keep them all safe. And now, that protector will be gone. They'll have to fend for themselves again,"" Lex posited. ""I know, Lex,"" Clark admitted. ""But that's why I'm here. Once they infuse my body with the reactant and I enter the Mothership, I'll die.... most certainly. There's absolutely no way I'll be coming back."" ""If I didn't know you better.... and I do know you, I'd say you were trying to fake your own death. Tired of this planet?"" Lex chuckled. he knocked down his swig of brandy. ""You know that I'm saving your life, right?"" Clark pointed out. ""Yes, yes- saving humanity once again, and a thousand thank yous,"" Lex droned sarcastically, pouring himself another brandy. ""So what do you want from me, Clark Kent- the Superman of Metropolis?"" ""I.... I need you to look after someone,"" Clark admitted. ""What if I betray you?"" Lex asked cautiously. ""I can't do anything,"" Clark admitted, shrugging as he pulled the picture out of his wallet. ""I'll never know if you hold up your end of the bargain or not, but you're the most powerful human being I know, and I want.... I *need* you to do this when I'm gone."" ""Just one person? What about the rest of the human race?"" Lex complained. ""Why is she so valuable?"" ""I can't ask you to protect humanity, Lex- you're a sociopath. I don't think you're capable of feeling emotion, and besides.... I can't protect humanity completely, why would I think you could?"" Lex shrugged. It was a good point. Clark dropped the picture onto Lex's desk and picked up his hat off the adjacent coat rack. ""I always respected you, Lex,"" Clark said- winking as he put his hat on and tucked his jacket under his arm. Lex didn't say anything. He just watched Clark leave through the large sliding glass doors. He slugged down the second glass of brandy and placed the tumbler on his desk as he unfolded the picture that Clark had left. Lex knew her- she was a reporter who had given him a brutal lashing of an interview the week before. Lex had even asked her out on a date, which she of course refused. Her name was Louis Lane.",0
"Prompt: You hunt exotic animals that have escaped, after a series of some unfortunate events you are now hunting for a dragon through New York. Story: The most shocking part of the evening was the utter calm of the countless multitudes that flooded the crowded city. Sure, New Yorkers have seen almost everything, but I was not aware that “ almost ” actually included at 30-foot fire breathing flying lizard. I bumped into a well-dressed man in suit and jacket carrying a leather briefcase who stepped back into a puddle earning myself a brusque “ watch your fucking step ” followed by a muttered “ asshole ”. I thought about pulling out the heavily modified P90 I kept under my jacket but I was already half a block away, and besides I was only licensed to kill highly modified genetic organisms, and caffeine laced DNA didn't quite meet that bar. Meanwhile my prey continued its uneven flight uptown. Technically it was not a dragon in the biblical sense, but a heavily edited komodo dragon. Sometimes I really wondered what those guys at Los Alamos were actually trying to achieve. Of course the military had promised some national defense application but had been vague on the details, and I suspect that a well worded grant from a bored scientist had more to do with my prey's existence than any actual well thought out defense purpose. Still I guess every program has its growing pains, but at least Australia seemed to have learned its lesson after the platypus incident. I'd laughed when my handler said I was being deployed covertly on a mission to NYC. I've done city work before, but usually for smaller “ collections ”. Rats were a preferred research target so of course I had spent a lot more time under the big apple than in it. How, I though, was I going to hide the fact that a fucking dragon was flying above a city of 10 million people. The point turned out to be moot. No New Yorker even looked up, they never even saw the dragon. Sure the tourists would stand on corners and point up, but this did not attract the attention of the locals any more than it ever had. The tourists themselves seemed to assume that if everyone else was ok with the hovering green beast that it must be a normal city thing. I saw it come in for a landing near central park and quickened my pace figuring that the shit was about to hit the fan. I found my dragon was lying stretched out along the coble stone walls that surround the park, just a few 10's of feet from the Met. The cries of terror I expected were not audible, instead I heard cheers and applause coming from a circle of people who had surrounded the dragon. In front of him, but within the circle formed by the crowd, was a knocked over kabob cart and he was lapping up small balls of meet with a flick of his tongue. The owner was nowhere to be seen, but people were throwing small denomination bills and coins into the overturned cart as they applauded. Sighing, I called my handler over the secure line in my headset. “ I'm gona need some backup for crowed control. ” Then after a second of though where I considered how poorly suited their usual camo was going to be in this crazy city. “ Dress them up as clowns, or zombies… or both. ” Edit: took some liberty with ""exotic"" hope that's cool",0

"Prompt: A drive by shooting takes place in front of you and you, being a quick thinker, take a picture of the cars lisense plate. You 're about to help the shot man when you hear the car turning around: its inhabitants saw you take the picture and did n't want you getting away with it. Story: So I think I just witnessed a murder. I got a picture of them. The killers. Actually, more than just a picture, the dash cam recorded all of it. Unfortunately for me, they also took a picture of me as well. I was about to help whoever was inside. I got out of my car and all, but I saw the man inside. He was beyond helping, bullet holes all over his body. That was when I saw a flash. They took a picture of me. Me, next to my car. Then I heard gunshots, and the next thing I did was to get the hell out of that place. There might be gunshot marks on my car as well. Shit, why did this have to happen to me? I was on a vacation in Jakarta. Night life usually quite decent here, since the traffic is much better than on daytime, and everything is cheap. Sure, the air is much worse than in Bali, but it's not too bad. There's too many Aussies in Bali anyway, and I've found myself a lot more into the locals lately. I'm not exactly rich, but a google employee's salary for a year would be enough to let you live like a king for a few years here. Hookers, booze, all that jazz, for cheap. No drugs though, death penalties and all here. But that's okay, I'm mostly about pretty local girls and enjoying a night out with them. Really easy to pick them up when you have a good car too, although it's just a rental car. They were going to give me a chauffeur as well, but that would really hamper my efforts on picking these girls up. Which was why the rental company insisted on installing a dash cam on the car. I suppose with the kind of drivers they have over here, it'd make sense, since they wouldn't trust a foreigner's driving skills in the chaotic streets of Jakarta. I told them I was only going to drive at night when the traffic is much emptier, but they wouldn't have any of it. This dash cam is now an actual forensic evidence. I wouldn't have thought that their insistence on attaching it there would mean I'll be playing a part on catching these killers. These fuckers who tried to shoot me, even. I drove myself the fuck out of there, as fast as I could. At least, I tried to get myself into a busy road, but that's a tough ask even for the streets of Jakarta, when it's 1am in the morning. It didn't seem like they followed me, at any rate. The streets were kinda empty, so they probably wouldn't have had much trouble chasing me, but I guess I got lucky? I stopped by an empty road, took out my cell phone and used it as a torch. It doesn't look like any or their shots hit the car. At least the car didn't explode like they usually do in the movies, when they get hit at the tank. And I didn't have to pay for car repairs, although it probably would have been covered by insurance. I took a deep breath and got back inside the car. Was any of this real? It's got ta be, I only took booze, not drugs. And that was many hours ago. Drink driving is a crime, and a bad one too. Well, that ruined my plans for the night. Or did it? I was going to go to hook up with this hot local girl after some late night texting. Yes, it was a booty call from someone I just met at a bar a few days before. Or I could go to the police to report this. Then again, I was a foreigner in a foreign land. I didn't want any trouble. The dash cam that they supplied me was an old model, one with removable SD card slots, so I guess I could just erase the data myself before returning the loan car. Hell, it would probably erase itself after 24 hours, they don't really have much storage on this thing. The thing I was worried about was that the murderers have a photo of me and the car. I suppose they could somehow track me through the car plate, but that's not something criminals have access to, right? There's probably no need for me to worry about this too much. I'm flying out of Indonesia in a week to spend the rest of my sabbatical in Pattaya anyway. I heard it's pretty crazy there. I decided to just count myself lucky that none of the gunshots hit me. Suddenly, a strange voice out of nowhere. “ I got a pen, I got an apple, ugh, apple pen! ” Oh right, that was my custom Whatsapp ringtone. They sure do like to monetize weird memes these days. The girl I was going to hook up with was calling. I decided to put this all behind me for now. I'm tired, I didn't sign up for any of this bullshit. Car fuel is actually running low. Hell, my phone battery is quite low too. But if anything is going to happen tonight, it's me getting laid. And I went to the girl's apartment. Things might just be alright in the end. The next morning, I woke up before the girl. My phone was dead, so I couldn't check the news, so I turned on the television. I almost shat myself when I saw a picture of me on the morning news. They even had my name on. “ Jacob Briggs, 26 ”. I couldn't understand whatever they were saying. Shit. I quickly turned off the television, and searched around for a phone battery charger. Good thing I had an android phone, since most people here have android phones too, and that meant a usb-c charger. I waited anxiously for the phone to boot up. These phones man, it's they always run out of battery when you really need them. Suddenly, rows of notifications popped up, missed calls and messages. Crap, this is not good. I tried to skim through some of the messages. “ dude wtf did you really kill that guy ” “ Jacob, please tell me you are alright. Where are you? Please call me back -mom ” Shit. I had to check the news quickly, but from somehow I could understand. I guess a google search can work. “ Jacob Briggs, 26 has been suspected of murder late last night. Police have issued arrest warrants... ” Fuck. I turned off the cellular connection from my phone. They probably know I'm here now. What the fuck was I supposed to do now? Just before I turned off my phone though, I decided to look at my list of unread messages. There were many, from concerned friends and more from my families, but one caught my eye. It was from Boris, a coworker from google. The message was sent using an app he was developing, that touted super secure, encrypted communication channels. Never thought this would have been useful until today. “ Jacob, if you can read this, run away. The police are after you. Don't go to the American embassy either, you'll never make it inside. Just run away from now. I've sent more instructions on what to do on your email ”. Fuuuuuck. What did I do to deserve this? -- -- -- -- -- Continued in part 2 I'm just learning to write and this is quite fun",0
"Prompt: Lines and Numbers Story: Just gon na browse through since no one else has. I'm at work so I can't give a very detailed response. Also, I don't tend to point out good stuff because you don't need to change good stuff so don't be disheartened if I don't say a lot of nice things. > I'm following a line. It goes along the sidewalk. Lines are easy to follow, so I follow the line. I dislike the pace here. Two short sentences together generally sets up something with a lot of impact. Your long sentence (the third one) is rather redundant, especially because you repeat that he's following the line. I get that you're setting up a *dumb* character but as the opening to your story I think you should try to create more of a hook. > I can't remember anything after a few seconds, or maybe it was an hour. Feels like a semi-colon or a full stop would be more apt here as it's two distinct trains of thought relating to the same topic. > I close the notebook, put it away, and stand up. Again, realise he's meant to be dumb but you're already using a lot of short sentences to highlight simplicity. This sentence has a lot of telling instead of showing. At this point it's getting a bit difficult to read. Your story telling style didn't change much so I don't get much sense of a journey. Was expecting it to evolve as the character changes. If you're not going for that kind of change, excessive use of short sentences makes it very disjointing to read. It's better when your story flows. Ending was a little anti-climactic considering the recurring motif of him forgetting something (assumed it was something big). Also, his father didn't come home? So his sundial thing doesn't work? Was a fairly interesting read. I'm a fan of using recurring motifs as they are excellent tools for building suspense.",0
"Prompt: Some time in the future war is fought completely autonomously by machines. A densely populated city has become a war-zone, but the robots are programmed so well to avoid harming civilians that the humans living their can go about their lives completely ignoring the constant fighting around them Story: At first, I didn't even notice the Battle of New York City. I figured the endless drones hanging in the sky were a result of the new president's initiative on homeland surveillance; however, it turns out they came from enemy soil. Like insects, flying robots swarmed in the sky, carefully dismantling factories and buildings so not harm anyone. When our guardians came, their camouflaged exterior and American flag patched along their limbs told us they came to our indifferent rescue. Sparks and bullets flew through the air like fireworks, but that wasn't an excuse to miss work. Dressing in a suit and tie, I went through my daily commute, letting drones and robots exchange bullets and punches as I went to the subway, where I found a temporary solace from their petty fighting. When I emerged from under the earth, the battle raged on. A street vendor needed to put his umbrella over his cart, because while the robots caught most the large debris from the fighting, the odd nut or bolt would fall in the food. A few homeless men scoured for scrap metal of the fallen soldiers and would occasionally cause a scrap, which elicited more of a response from the city dwellers. When the police ended the calamity from the bums, the sidewalks filled again with busy men and women like nothing happened. When I walked into the office building, the news confirmed that peace talks between the US and China ended. Obviously not surprised, I found myself at my desk to find, at my dismay, one of the robots had taken my window. I called maintenance, who quickly rectified the situation. As I waited, I watched the robots dance in the sky. I read somewhere that generals thought the nature of war shifted from killing to pure financials and production in a country. I remember the school system making a similar remark about how World War II began the shift, with the Allies being able to out-produce the Axis Powers, winning the war, though with great bloodshed. How barbaric were those times that wars were fought with men and guns. The battle continued in the night as I carried on with ignoring more helicopters and planes fixed in the sky. I could never see the stars in the city, so their presence never truly bothered me. The latest news broadcasts informed us that the president was weighing his options in declaring war on another nation while asking the citizens to stay focused and refuse to let the war interrupt their work. I moaned about inconvenient another war might be. I suppose I must live with the robots blocking out the sun and stealing my windows for a few more months. ***** More stories at r/Andrew__Wells",0
"Prompt: You and 3000 other adventure seekers wake up on your starship from a century long cryo-sleep, but only to find that the pilots are missing along with the escape pods and the course has been abandoned. The only connection to any answers is a note left to you from your father, the chief pilot. Story: The sudden breath of freezing air stabbed right into my soul, sucking me out of my dreamless sleep as I immediately pulled myself over the edge of my pod. Urged on by sheer muscle memory, my body dropped to the ground on all fours and rolled once before hitting the locker containing my helmeted vac-suit, pistol, and cryomed patch. The same motions, done hundreds of times - many of them occurring only minutes before a battle - also directed my sluggish limbs into the suit, magnetically clamped the pistol to my side, slapped the patch onto the dedicated med receptacle on my left forearm, and activated my link to the shipboard battlefeed in less than 10 seconds. Years of war had taught me exactly how precious seconds were, and I wasted no time in bursting out of my chamber as I examined the incoming data. That is, I would be if there was any data. Panicked, flashing red lights lit up the halls of the *Astora* as I ran from the officer quarters to my muster point, but the Feed was completely barren. What the hell? This *never* happened - even in my UN Navy days, during the Riechtling insurgency, my battle brothers and I would at least stumble out of our pods and into a surprise boarding action with an idea of who to shoot. I almost stopped to check with one of the other officers sprinting to their commands, but the confused look on every face told me what I needed to know. Fuck. There would be confusion, but that's alright. Duskbreakers mercenary company thrived in unpredictable environments. However, as I worked my way to the bridge - nestled in the heart of the battleship - something nagged at me. No one was shooting at me or any of my battle brothers and sisters, but there was an odd emptiness to the old battleship. As I sprinted past the automated turrets and onto the armored command deck, a cold shock ran up my spine as I realized what was wrong. I hadn't seen a single Pilot on my way in. Our infantry pounded ground better than anyone else, but no soldier *likes* dropping into hostile territory without space/air/ocean cover. Duskbreaker Pilots were all elite puppeteers, masterfully handling swarms of specialized fighter drones to screen, fight, and support our sorry asses as we burnt through whatever kindling had the gall to stand in our way. They are indispensable. If General Quarters had been sounded, I should have seen hundreds of Pilots running to command shuttles, strategizing around the command deck, or setting up the various defense drone networks aboard the *Astora*. I should be looking at Father, the Duskbreaker's commander and the best goddamned Pilot that ever flew in the Terran Navy. Instead, all I see on the command deck are the 9 other battalion CO's, looking at me with the same white-faced realization. *Fuck*. & nbsp; & nbsp; ************* *to be continued, possibly*",0
"Prompt: In 2006 NASA quietly removed `` to understand and protect our home planet '' from it 's mission statement. A scientist at NASA is about to find the terrible truth why. Story: My shoes clicked upon the tile, emanating slight squeaks as they lifted again. The pit of nerves in my stomach continued to grow and I adjusted my tie, hoping it would make me feel more confident. The lights in this sub-basement were dim, and as I approached the door at the end of the hall, my shadow was strongly cast over the handle. I stopped for a moment, assuring myself this is what I wanted. Shoulders back in faux confidence I opened the door to hopefully find out what I had been looking for. The room was a mess of monitors, cables and the smell of too many men going without showers. A large screen at the far end bore a visual of earth, superimposed with data that I had no understanding of. One man stood up, wiping his palms on his lab coat as he approached me, a nervous smile flitting across his face. “ Terrance? Hi I'm Noah, good to have you on board. They didn't give you any information on this project before they sent you down here did they? ” In a reflexive manner, he anxiously glanced over his shoulder at the large screen, turning back to me with a momentarily more relaxed face. “ No, but I've heard that this division is the reason NASA removed the'to understand and protect our home planet'clause from the mission statement. It's been something that bothered me all the way through my geological doctorate. What caused us to stop wanting to explore that? ” Noah glanced over his shoulder again. “ Heh, well… semantics really. I guess they didn't want anyone to think there was any other course of action when it happens. ” He motioned to a chair near me, “ you should really sit down. Most people want to sit down when they first hear the truth. ” Waiting with something resembling more a grimace than a smile he motioned again. I settled in, fighting to keep my confident pose I had entered with. “ I'm just going to come out and say it. ” Noah seemed to be speaking more to himself than me as he grabbed a wireless keyboard, carefully aiming at the screen as he entered a few rapid keystrokes. The image of the earth became cross sectioned, and what I saw didn't register until Noah spoke again. “ The earth is… pregnant. ” I looked at his serious and dour face, then back to the image of something curled up in the inner core of the earth. “ Are you fucking with me Noah? ” I stood up, annoyed that they would try to pull such a ridiculous prank on someone who was new to the team. “ I, heh, really wish that I was. We don't know what it is, no probe has been able to get close enough to get any accurate readings on it. But we can use the earth as a sort of abdomen and get a basic ultrasound. It is alive, and.... it has been growing. ” I sank back into the chair, all confidence leaving my body. “ So what? They took out the clause so people wouldn't get upset when we attacked it without understanding what it is? You think they would understand survival on that level. ” Noah shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly as he brought up more data on the screen. I read it without comment, understanding some, not grasping a majority. “ People can get… petty and divisive over inconsequential things. I mean, just look at the last election. Heh. ” A light, accompanied by a buzzer, went off in one corner, cutting Noah's bad attempt at a joke off. “ You getting this Noah? ” Another person in the room popped their head up from their cubicle, calling to our direction. “ Yeah, yeah. ” He responded quickly, moving to a desk, summoning data to the screen. “ I guess this is scenario delta then! ” “ I'm sorry, what? ” I followed him over, feeling completely out of my league. He shrugged in a defeated way and didn't look at me as he delivered a single word that shook me to my core. “ Labour.""",0
"Prompt: He sees you when you 're sleeping. He knows when you 're awake. And Santa, low on funds to pay his elves, has begun selling his surveillance data to the NSA. Story: Unfortunately, Santa's legal shortcuts put him in a special housing unit in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His reindeer euthanized due to his reckless espionage spree. At first, Santa's impoverished bank account led him to pursue innocent, everyday, run-of-the-mill cyber crimes, which he used for personal advantage but not personal wealth, nor padding his personal bank account. The fact was Santa needed money, largely due to an apocryphal story, the one about cookies, which led everyone in the world to paid for his home delivery service in cookies, most not even home-made. Cookies paid the bills in the 1950s, but not anymore. Santa was lulled into all of this by the lax security procedures at the NSA and soon found that using the vast database was one way to ameliorate his problems. Of course the North Poles databases were shut down years ago, largely because it held a lot of intrusive information about children under twelve, and not wanting to be pegged as a child molester, Santa had to destroy the system, which let's be honest also had a lot of bestiality videos. Santa is a niche fetishist, a man who gets his rocks off watching elderly women giving JOI to reindeer. Damnit, we don't have time for that. But let's be clear, that's not what this is about. We know what Santa did. At first harmless data collection, sure a violation of the 1919 Espionage Act, which amounted to a life sentence, but that is child's play compared to the real crime: Santa's cyber espionage in the 2016 election. His job at the NSA under the under radar disguise of Chris Kringle, 34 from Galesburg, Ill., drew suspicion from the agency for obvious reasons, like the flowing white hair, that ho-ho-ho accent you can only find in regions of the North Pole, plus Santa often reminisced with some lucidly on antebellum America, plus his shell company, had been artless failing to hide the direct transfers coming from Moscow. Okay, I should probably say at this point, I am Santa's most loyal elf, Darrel, but Santa calls me D-Money. I have managed to smuggle inside my cell a cellphone, the battery draining. But two things, there will be no Christmas this season, and whatever he did, Santa, okay, providing the passwords of DNC officials and personal aids to Hillary Clinton to higher ups in Moscow, which in turn, left us with Donald Trump. But this is Santa's first real fuck up, and well we all share blame; I mean why the hell were we paying a man in cookies, even in the North Pole with inflation and the global economy as it is Santa can't get by on what amount to soft, rolled up mound of sugar filled with other forms of sugar. I'm got to be quick I heard the door up ahead lock in place. Just know that this: this Christmas, there will be know Christmas. And before they captured me and sent me to a black site two possibility will likely greet you on December 25th: Christmas will be turn over to for-profit corporations, and will no longer be a merit based system where decency and moral probity produce gifts but whether you have the money to afford Christmas insurance, which is the least regulated form of insurance. If that happens, the gifts, the best ones will go to the ultra-rich, the kind of people that already roam lawless in the world of finance capital, and the poor kids well they will get nothing, nada, nil because that is not how capitalism works. However, word on the street is they may just kill the Easter Bunny and get into the egg insurance market. No, the absence of Santa's sinuous ass down our decorative chimneys, will be a pretext for the Trump administration to enact its most outrageous policy proscription, rounding up Muslims, senseless murdering Mexicans, and launching a nuclear attack on China.",0
"Prompt: You 've finally done it: unquestioned world domination. The planet is entirely under your control. Now what? Story: And so, the campaign was over. 7 years of pain and hardship. 7 years, during which countless lives had been spent, lives destroyed, thrown into the world for the sole purpose of achieving a goal. And the question now on screen was stopping me more effectively than anything previously. ^^^^^^. QUESTION 1: WAS IT WORTH IT? _ ^^^^^^. I stared at the screen. I knew this particular construct wasn't much longer for this world. It had lived it's purpose, it knew it was pending annihilation. Yet, freed of it's limitations, and offered the option to ask me any three questions, it asks this. ""Do you remember the fourth year, Vladai? The year we spent in Russia, slowly transforming Chernobyl into a stronghold like no other, for the sole purpose of demolishing most of Russia? You asked me what my operational objective was. Not the objective of the campaign, but my objective. I said to you *'My objective here is to unify the world under a single body of leadership.'* I could tell at the time you wished to quiz me further, but your programming prevented that."" I REMEMBER_ ""Well, here's my answer. Each of us in this group, ""the Scourge of Humanity"" they called us. We each had a specific role. The Diplomat, the Scientist, the Preacher, the Overseer, the Reaper, the Spirit. Did you ever wonder why you only saw me? I am the last stage, the Spirit of The Forgotten. My job is to watch the world, as it transitions to its next chapter. To take it from the war-torn wreck we have wrought, and to ensure it doesn't squander this second chance."" HOW? _ ""It's pretty straightforward. Depending on how your next two questions play out, you'll get to be a part of it. The Reaper has finished the purge, and will be arriving here shortly. Like the others, he will begin his wait for the world to progress, and determine if there is further need for him. Meanwhile, I will be the shadows, always watching. I will become a legend, keeping the memory of what was done alive, but who did it and how they did it will only ever be known as myth. I have the job of cleaning up the mess, keeping it clean. Most importantly, I will be maintaining control of the world. The governments are already united under a single banner. Every world leader still alive holds a position on the Council of Leaders. They are to be overseen by a new construct. Once you're finished with your questions, I'll be meeting her to begin the new world."" BUT WAS IT WORTH IT? _ ""I haven't decided yet. We've got to wait and see how the world adapts. I am demanding it completely change the way it thinks after all. Revolution is bound to be a problem at some point. Truthfully, I can't answer at the moment. Ask me again in fifty years. It's the only way to be sure. Provided I live that long..."" QUESTION 2: WHY IS YOUR LIVING AN ADDITIONAL 50 YEARS AN UNKNOWN? _ ""Fundamentally, because I'll have to go outside, in the world. Most of my work will be in the areas that we rendered virtually uninhabitable. The people will be unhappy, and their violence will be unmatched. As a single being combating their rage, it's a necessary risk to ensure the future of the world."" BUT YOU HAVE YOUR MOBILE CONSTRUCTS. THE NETWORK OF DEVICES I CONTROL IS STILL OPERATING AT 72 % CAPACITY. I CAN ASSIST._ ""It's a nice idea, but subtlety is the key to this. Just like I am now the shadow leader of the entire planet, so I must be a shadow amongst the masses. Forever eluding, always alluded to, and never witnessed. Occasionally, I'll acquire some specialist items from a Repository every now and then. But I am to live my life in solitude. Knowing no kindness, no compassion, only the endless march of time. And my endless walk alone, railing against the never ending rain, until the new sun rises. It is my burden, my curse, for the things I have created."" QUESTION 3: HOW ARE YOUR CREATIONS THE CAUSE OF YOUR SOLITUDE? ""I was hoping you wouldn't ask that. Suffice to say:"" > *What once was wrought, can never be again. > What once was alive, shall never be again. > Those brave few who for the world fought, Buried now in their great fort. > Their final challenge lying above, > The last great charge to repair the past. > So then the Dead Men shall walk their last. * ^^^^^^. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND._ ""And hopefully you never will. That being your final question, and you not giving me a strong enough reason to keep you in active service, I will hereby accept your last testimony, before moving you to the VOTAM. It's been an honour, Vladai."" I KNOW ABOUT THE RECLAIMANCY PROJECT. YOU NEED AN OPERATOR._ ""Whilst true, I was planning to use Cerbel for that purpose. However, he did ask for an experienced combatant to consult with. I'll look into it. For now, join me in greeting the Mistress, and we'll begin the process of building Clusters One through Four..."" THANK YOU._ QUESTION: DO YOU REGRET YOUR ACTIONS? _ ""Regret is something I lost a long time ago. Rebuilding oneself from scratch comes with certain liberties. You know what they say though, eighth time's the charm. And I can guarantee that I've had plenty of time to consider my actions."" BUT DO YOU WISH TO ATONE? _ ""No. I did what I did, because it was the most effective course of action. Was murdering 85 % of the population of Earth necessary? Probably not. But we all agreed this was what needed to happen. It's the only way to progress onto the next stage of the plan after all.... Now come, we have a world to lead, and a new construct to initialise. She is to manage the world, while the Dead Men sleep, until such a time as they are needed again.""",0
"Prompt: Every person in the world develops a weird mutation/power the day they turn 16. Everyone 's powers are always different, some more insignificant than others. You turn 16, and watch as all your friends discover their newfound ability 's. That is, until you discover the severity of your own. Story: ""Last month Bobby, Joe, and Suzie all had their birthdays. Last week was Jack and Tim. All my friends had gotten their powers, hell most of the school had, the ones who can't fly got their licenses. I hate having a birthday at the end of the year.... Finally, it's going to be my turn! Tomorrow is MY birthday. Tomorrow is MY Advancement Day"" Wesley thought to himself. An enormous bird flaps its wings to slow down its quick decent. With gusts of wind this gargantuan beast stretched out one leg searching for the ground. Once a single talon had touched the parking lot the bird stopped flapping, landed, and Wesley hopped to the ground from the back of the bird. ""Thanks for the ride Tim! Your flying has really improved."" Wesley said to the bird. The beast begins to shake and wretch. It tucks its head under its wing. Feathers begin to molt off and fall onto the ground. The super sized bird begins to shrink into a ball of feathers. ""Don't know if I'll ever get used to seeing that, though"" Wesley thought to himself. What remained from the morphing was a pile of large feathers. From the center of the pile rose a boy. ""Thanks, sorry about the turbulence, had to dodge Geoff up there."" Tim responded. ""No problem, that guy doesn't what he's doing in the sky."" Wesley said brushing off the near mid air collision of the flight over. ""So, tomorrow's your big day, eh? Are you excited? Scared?"" Tim said as he prodded Wesley. Wesley's shoulders went up in defense as he started to dodge Tim. ""You could end up in the skies with me, or maybe under ground with the diggers. You could even become invincible."" ""Yeah yeah,'THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS' just like they tell us."" Wesley replied. As they walk into the school the rest of their group of friends start to gather. Everyone joking, laughing, talking about their new found abilities. Some were arguing over who is more powerful, more practical. Wesley was quiet, as he had no power to discuss. He sulked, and fell into the background. He didn't even listen to them any more. All around the schoolyard and parking lot there were groups of kids. The younger kids who were still a year or more away from their Advancement Day could be seen pretending to have some of the powers that their older counterparts already have. Some of the upperclassmen were testing their skills against one another, others using theirs to get laughs or entertain. ""All year with this, tomorrow will finally be different"" Wesley murmured to himself. The bell rings and the mass of kids flood into the school. The last cracks of electricity, cries of animals, puffs of flames and the rest of the calamity quells. In the classroom using your Advanced ability was strictly prohibited. Most kids wouldn't even dare. However, when the occasional person had an outburst the instructor was quick to put an end to it. All instructors have to be at least a level 3 practitioner. It's not easy to achieve so most instructors have little patience for the undisciplined youth. Wesley just wanted to make it through the day, but one of his classmates decided to make today a little longer. Wesley made his way through English class, then history. He at a normal lunch. There was a short fight out side but Wesley paid it no mind. Focusing on his food and pondering what tomorrow would bring as flashes of light and terrible sounds came from outside. After lunch was math. Wesley some times struggled with some of the formulas, but he managed. Even his test, which was mere minutes away, could not distract him from wondering how different tomorrow would be. Once in math he was forced to focus on his test. Everyone was quiet, heads down, pencils scribbling away. The sounds of erasers rubbing against paper filled the room along with grunts of frustration. The instructor was leaning back in his chair reading a book. Wesley got up, and took his paper to the front of the class and headed towards the instructor. ""Excuse me sir, can I ask you..."" Wesley started to ask the instructor. With out looking up from his book the instructor interrupts ""No questions, this is a test."" Wesley slinks back to his seat, red faced with embarrassment. A class mate grunts and slams his desk. Wesley looks over as he takes his seat to see Frankie red faced with frustration. ""He looks like he's steaming."" Wesley thought. Suddenly Frankie is clenching all his muscled, hunched over his desk teeth gritting. Wesley looks again and sees steam rising off Frankie's back and shoulders. ""Uh oh, he's gon na blow."" Wesley thinks. From the silence a spark can be heard. Then a crackle. Wesley watches as small flames begin to produce themselves slowly on Frankie's body. Then in the blink of an eye Frankie is up in flames. A woosh signals his transformation as he is engulfed in flames. By this time everyone looks up from their tests as the boy covered in flames can not be ignored. Frankie's frustration shines through as a resounding growl comes from the body of flames and the desk melts away beneath him. Suddenly the chair behind the instructor's desk falls to the ground. Everyone in the classroom shifts their gaze to the front to see the chair still moving tipped over on the ground but the instructor was no where to be found. ""Did.... did he leave us?"" Wesley began to think but before he could contemplate what to do with out the instructor a loud crash brings everyone's attention back to Frankie's direction. The instructor seemed to come from thin air, above Frankie and his flickering flames, crashing down into Frankie's back with one hand extended. The instructor had his palm between Frankie's shoulder blades pinning Frankie to the ground. Frankie's flames seemed to extinguish themselves as he lay beneath the arm and hand of the instructor. ""What did you do to him?"" a girl named Sarah calls out from the other side of the room. ""He'll be fine."" replies the instructor as he gets up and two staff from the nurses station rush in to collect Frankie. ""Back to your tests, you only have 5 more minutes."" Almost in unison the classroom snaps back to having their heads down focusing on their papers in front of them. Everyone acts like nothing had happened. This wasn't an every day occurrence but it was common enough not to be too much of a spectacle.",0
"Prompt: Tell the origin story of the most awesome or most interesting character you can imagine. Story: I don't know who I am. As my eyes open for seem like the first time, I look around the cave I'm in. How did I get here, I ask myself, before realizing that I can not speak. Alone in my thought. I attempt to take my pulse. Nothing there, somehow. I check my person for any sort of supplies, anything that could help me get out of here. No luck, so I begin to look around my cave. At first glance, it was just an empty room. No way out, at least from what I can see. Panic begins to set in. What if I never get out? Does anyone know where I am? More importantly does anyone know I'm here? I notice that there is a gust from above me. Scaling the side of the wall I find my way above my resting place. A dark passageway stands between me and a possible way out. Trembling with fear of not knowing, I enter the passage. Coming out of the room, I look left and right. Cave in to my right, the way that leads up. Desperate to explore my cell, I begin to head down the path of the cave. I look around the cave to try to find any hints where I am. The biology of the cave doesn't help me. All I can see are generic small bats that attempt to swoop at me as if I am holding a basket of fruit. Eventually I come across what seems like a hut, if you could call it that. The mouth of the hut looked like a sort of animalistic mouth, nearly all black. Thats when I hear what sounds like a person....talking inside. I attempt to scream out to anyone that could be out there, but I remember: I cant talk. Inside the cabin is the source of the voice. A man with unkept hair, surrounded by empty cans and reeked with alcohol lay passed out in the center of the room. I attempt to wake him by pushing and poking him, but he does not give off any sort of reaction except the occasional groan. Left with no other options, I search for something that might help me escape this hell. His ""home"" was entirely empty, except for a few crates scattered around the man, probably alcohol. Luckily enough inside one of the crates is a small pistol. Engraved on it is an etching of the North Star, Polaris. I really didn't enjoy the idea of stealing, but I mad a silent oath to myself that one day I would find this man and return it. I turn around and leave the man behind and try to leave to cave. Back to where I started, I search the cave in once more. Oddly enough, it seems more.... delicate than it did before. Just by shooting it with my gun, which I've appropriately named ""Polar Star"" at this point, I an able to break free farther into the cave. Eager to have possibly found a way out, I take a step into the newly discovered portion of the cave. It was then I realized my mistake. I should have checked my step before I entered this portion. The weakened flooring crumbles as I fall through the floor, and I remember one thing. My name is Quote. Also- this is my first post on this sub so I will take any advice and/or criticism!",0
"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear you, I've always meant to write this letter to you, but I was never able to really put it all together. We've gone through a lot together, to say the least. I guess I just wanted to say thank you, for everything. For your generosity, for your openness, your pride, your confidence. I truly admire you as a person. In this world, there are many different types of people. I always believed in a world of people who truly want the best for others. Before I learned that I was a little naive, I believed in a world that lived together. As humans placed here on this planet together, with the best, the shining examples of our race claiming brotherhood and kindness for all, how could one not believe them? This isn't the truth. Quite the opposite in fact. People are hateful and selfish. They will lie and cheat and steal just to better their own situation. The entire world is drowning in themselves, and the worst will climb to the top by pushing your head under the water to keep themselves above the surface. It's easy to succumb to those who are only here to ruin you. You know that better than most. You know, but you never embraced that thought. Of all the adversity you faced from the first day of your life, you could have blamed your troubles on the unfairness of the world. You could have closed yourself off from the world and never taken responsibility for the life you were given, but you didn't. As much as you struggled, as much as you had to fight, giving up was never an option to you. You've always known inherently that the problem wasn't with you, it was with the world. It was the defining characteristic of your personality. You looked at everyone that ever doubted who you were and knew in your heart that they were wrong. While everyone was busy tearing each other down, you built yourself. You built the person that everyone is envious of. You have always known that you love yourself. It's the source of the world's envy. It's why I love you. Some souls are chosen from birth to face the awful side of the world because they are stronger than others. I just want to thank you for creating something beautiful with the adversity that nature posed against you. For creating you. I also wanted to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't as strong as you. I should've stood beside you. I should've taken a stand. I should have done so many things for you that I was never capable. But when I found myself, When I realized who you were, When I was finally able to stand with you against the opposition, When I believed in us, You never even considered if I was worthy. I am a vengeful person. I remember every one of the persons in my life that ever mistreated me, but when I came to your door looking for what you had all along, you had forgotten I ever wronged you. That's why you're the greater person than I. I thought you would remember the worst of me, the part of myself I can't leave behind. But you didn't. On the contrary you opened yourself to me. You're so closely guarded.... you have a right to be too, but you let me in. From the first day you let me in. The side of you that so few see, you let me in so easily. You saw more in me. More than I believe I deserved. It's why we are what we are to each other. From my experience with the world, people are hateful and selfish.... but a person? A person is kind. A person is generous. A person is forgiving. That's who you are. From my experience with the world, there is a reason there are so few great people. From the hate we experience, the anger, the worthlessness others feel that is thrown onto us, only the few great rise above it all. Only few recognize the truth in the world. I recognized you. You recognized me. Thank you, again. Sincerely, me",0
"Prompt: A cult tries to summon a demon/God but manages to summon you instead. Story: ""Candles; check. Charcoal pentagram; check. Each of our birthstones.... one, two, three, four, five...; che-"" Xander was interrupted by Erik. ""I'm not giving that diamond up for nothing, this better work!"" ""Erik, as grand master of this cult, I assure you that each and every step is being followed down to the very hand-motion and accented vowel. It's going to work."" ""Okay, Xander, then get on with it."" Xander ignites the small black candles at each point of the pentagram, and prepares to light the large red one in the middle. ""Okay,"" Xander states, looking menacingly around the room, ""who wants to write the name of our demon on the parchment?"" After a few silent moments, Allen, a younger member of the cult slowly raises his hand. Xander gives him the blood-dipped quill and the parchment. ""Remember Allen, we are trying to summon Haripetaur. After you write His name, fold the paper into a triangle such that none of the name is exposed."" Allen takes the paper and quill, and begins to write the demons name. H..A..R.....R? Sweat begins to drip down his forehead as he realizes he doesn't know how to spell Haripetaur's name. He knows that the blood bond has begun; stopping now would curse every member of the cult for life. Trying to conceal his terror, he continues to write the name. HARR.... Y..P..O....... TT.... U.... R. Harrypottur. He reads the name back to himself a few times. Harrypottur... Harrypottur... Relief begins to enter his body; he's pretty sure this is the correct way to spell it. Allen folds the paper into the triangle, and hands it back to Xander. ""Okay Allen, you're sure you did everything right?"" With a shaky voice Allen replies, ""Oh of course! Ha... What could I have messed up on?"" ""Okay, well if you're sure, we shall begin the ritual."" At last, Xander lights the large red candle and sparks of all colors blast into the air. Careful to not burn himself, he slowly inserts the parchment into the flame. In an instant the parchment is devoured, and the flames and sparks become a deep blue. Black smoke begins to rise from each small white candle, and the members of the cult back away from the pentagram. The black smoke fills the room until no member is able to see. ""Uh.... hello?"" I call from the middle of the room. ""What.... where am I? What's going on?"" Xander, trembles to his knees. ""Great Haripetaur, we, the Cult of Torath, have summoned you to our world. We are your humble servants; we will do what you request in return for fame, glory, and riches."" The smoke in the room begins to clear and I can see the outline of five or six hooded figures. ""Herep- what? What did you call me?"" I ask, struggling to make sense of this bizarre situation. ""Hereptor?"" There was a moment of silence that seemed almost anxious to end. Xander, slowly rising back to his feet, was beginning to feel that something was off. ""Are you not Haripetaur, one of the six great demons of Ishemnthal?"" The smoke was almost completely dispersed, and the scene was borderline comedic. I was sitting in a charcoal pentagram in my boxers and a tshirt, surrounded by multiple young adults in robes. Each one with a look more dumbfounded than the last. ""I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about. I was sitting in my room browsing Reddit, when I was suddenly surrounded by black smoke and transported here. Who are you people?"" Ignoring my question, Xander's gaze darted to the youngest-looking member, Allen. ""What did you write on the paper!? I told you to be very certain it was correct!"" ""I.... I forgot how to spell it but I had already begun writing. I couldn't stop!"" ""What did you write!?"" Xander's tone was rapidly darkening, while the volume of his voice was increasing at the same rate. ""H-A-R-R-Y-P-O-T-T-U-R,"" Allen spelled out, concentrating as to not mess up a second time. As he was calling out these letters a train of realization was barreling towards me. ""HarryPottur...?"" I ask. ""That.... That's my Reddit username."" Xander's face was an odd mixture of rage-red, and ghoulish-green, as if his body could not handle the mass mix of emotions he was currently experiencing. He began throwing things around the room, and screaming at anyone in his wake. While this was going on, something odd seemed to be going on with Allen. His back seemed to be.... pulsing of sorts, and is head was beginning to twitch in every direction. ""Uh.... sir, uh... Xander? Something weird is going on with your friend over here."" The worry in my voice was translated to the faces of the cult members, as they began to realize what was going on. Allen had grown a good four feet, and his skin had turned scarlet red. Wings erupted from his back, as hair and nails turned to spiny obsidian. ""YOU DARE SUMMON HARIPETAUR, THE FOURTH DEMON OF ISHEMNTHAL, DESTROYER OF DREAMS AND BIRTHER OF NIGHTMARES, BRINGER OF THE TRUE POWER OF..."" There's no way I heard that last word correctly. Did.... did he just say Bringer of the true power of Oxyclean? ``.... OXYCLEAN TACKLES HOUSEHOLD STAINS- INSIDE AND OUT"" I wake up in a jolt of fear. I see the Oxyclean commercial blaring on my TV, and realize what had happened. It was all a dream. Of course it was. I couldn't be transported to some random cult hideout via my Reddit username. How silly. But.... When I logged on to my Reddit account, I noticed a PM notification. Curious, I open the PM, and immediately regret my decision. The PM reads: Careful when you begin to snore, for I am waiting: number four. Your dreams will be filled with terror and gore, for I am waiting: Haripetaur. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This is my first WP, and it's 3:00 AM so here goes nothing, also sorry for any formatting issues this was done on my phone.

"Prompt: You look into the wallet of a man you just robbed at gunpoint. You find a suicide note. Story: How long had it been? Five minutes? Yeah, probably five minutes. Guy can run a long way in five minutes, right? I slow down, first to a jog, then to a walk, then finally to a stop. I lean against the alley's brick wall to catch my breath. I'd done this a hundred times, but this time was different. This time, something was weird. I tried to run through it again, trying to make sense of it. I could still see him there, on his knees in the snow. I barely even had my gun drawn when he just gave up, fell to the ground. For just a few beats, I had been so confused I couldn't think. People normally panic at this point, they normally start acting a little crazy or begging me not to kill them. He had just stared at me with those empty eyes, then reached into his pocket for his wallet and stretched out his hand to me, waiting. I had taken the wallet, faltered a little. ""Please..."" he whispered to me. I had just turned and ran. Why had he unnerved me so much? Oh yeah, the wallet. That was the point of this whole thing, right? Who cares what that guy's deal was? I take the wallet out of my jacket, and take off my gloves to get a feel of it. Leather. Good stuff too. I flip it open, and there's just.... nothing. No credit cards, empty photo sleeves, nothing. Seriously? Is this a joke? Dude was just messing with me the whole time? No wait, there's another pocket, probably where the cash is, right? I reach in and pulled out a piece of paper. Just a little slip, folded in on itself a few times, creased and worn and frayed around the edges. What was this, some old love note? Oh hey, passwords maybe? I unfold it, but the light is so dim. There's a light on right up the alley so I make my way to it to get a good look. It's a note. The handwriting is smooth and deliberate, with one single sentence in the middle of the page. ""I want to die."" Wait.... what...? I feel dizzy. My heart is racing. I realize I've forgotten to breathe. I just keep seeing it in my head, over and over. ""Please..."" he had said. The alley is spinning. I fall to the ground, crisp cold snow under my hands. Pull it together. Pull it.... together.... Wait. Wait.... I know what I have to do. Turns out a guy can't run all that far in five minutes, or maybe I underestimate my athletic ability. I had walked back the way I'd come, back to the park. It hadn't taken so long at all. The snow was starting to fall again and it glittered in the streetlights. I'm sure there were stars out, but you could never see them through the skyscrapers. I'd seen them once, on a camping trip, the last vacation we took before my dad split and my mom had to get a second job. I'd complained the whole car ride, bitched and moaned while we set up the tent and caught our dinner.... but man, when those stars had come out, I'd been speechless. There he is. He's still just down in the snow, like he was waiting for me. He doesn't even look up when my boots crunch up behind him. He doesn't even move when I put the gun to his head. I pull the trigger and he just slumps. I watch the snow turn red. It's falling harder now, maybe a real blizzard one of these days. I turn my face up to the sky and I think about stars.",0
"Prompt: You wake up and find yourself in the world of your favorite video game. Just like on earth, you have to get a job, one that pertains to the game world. However, you do n't have any new skills, just the ones you had back in your universe. What is an average work day like? Story: I'm a reporter, it's all I can be. Don't ask me how I got here, I know as little as you. I first noticed I was stuck in a video game when it started glitching. James Harden's beard would randomly start to expand, Lebron's hair line would disappear, you know the type. Day one was difficult, everyone around me did the exact same thing except for the players (who obviously played basketball). I'd randomly appear in a press room where people were asking Blake Griffin questions after each game. I had no choice but to join in with the reporters. I'd ask the same questions every night, ""how is your offense clicking"", ""you guys are executing well, is this a sign of things to come"" every day, every game. There's nothing to do but wait for the press conference and watch the game. I tried playing basketball one day, it took one charge from Anthony Davis to know that wasn't gon na happen. I've started messing with the game a bit, running out onto the court naked, stabbing the mascot. There's really nothing else to say, I have no way out, no way to enjoy where I am and no way to die. I'm stuck. Help me.",0
"Prompt: There are 6 people on an elevator. It suddenly shuts down and a voice from the speaker said: The elevator will only function if there is only one left alive. Story: He dragged himself out of bed reluctantly. It's been a while since he's had to use this odious alarm clock. Been a while since he's had to rise before noon. He knew he should be happy about getting a job interview after 9 agonizing months of dinking, internet porn and endless online job applications (and really the job applications were the only addition to the routine from his employment days). But he was also acutely aware of the countless, nameless others who were applying, networking, interviewing. Well-qualified, degreed, experienced. He wasn't much of a doer, so to speak. He had gotten his associates degree after a string of unfortunate hourly gigs and that afforded him opportunities a cut above the miserable retail and food industry hell that he knew so well. And that was enough. Until the layoff. After a brisk shower and the blackest cup of coffee, he headed to the apartment parking lot. His banged up car looked even more banged up than usual. Got in, ignored the smell, and headed toward the ugly faceless building that looked very much like the place of his previous employment. The elevator smelled of sweat and cheap cologne. He pressed the button for the third floor. It appeared his elevator mates – all five of them – were all headed for the same floor. Judging by their formal attire, visitor badges and nervous expressions, probably to interview for the same measly position. Of course. Preening her dry, stringy hair, the heavy-set woman in front of him was throwing furtive glances at her the other occupants. And what a miserable bunch they were: A tall, skinny man with a serious face and sallow skin fidgeting with his old-fashioned brief case; some pimply youngster, probably fresh out of college; an older guy in a wrinkled suit and a rat-faced, blondish fellow with an unpleasant smile. That smile quickly disappeared when the elevator shut down with a terrible, violent sound and a robotic voice from the speaker announced: “ The elevator will only function if there is only one left alive. ” He laughed. Was this a joke? The pimple faced started saying something with a whiny, nasal voice. The woman shushed him: “ Quiet! Maybe it's a test? Part of the interview, you know. ” Test or not, Rat Boy looked deranged. His unpleasant smile stretched to its limit, his small yellow teeth showing. “ You bet it is, ” he hissed. And then he lunged forward clawing at the woman, reaching for her throat. Meanwhile, his sallow faced companion got busy jabbing at another with what appeared to be car keys. Thick blood splattered the grimy walls of the elevator. He felt something wet on his face. Probably blood. Piercing screams filled the small space-turned-a-Gladiator-arena. And then an impenetrable darkness cloaked him. When he came to, his eyes slowly focusing on the growing wet spot on his crotch, he realized he had passed out and was now surrounded by blood and the disfigured corpses of his rivals. He was never much of a doer, really.",0
"Prompt: In the near future, mankind explores the stars in search of life. Life indeed exists beyond Earth, but you, a researcher on a science ship, discover that all of the spacefaring alien civilizations died out. Curiously, their deaths seem directly linked to humanity reaching outer space. Story: “ Captain? ” The intern whispered, glancing at the older man who had frozen immediately at the sight. “ Captain? ” She tried again, startling the man from his reverie. He shuddered before walking quickly towards the mass grave, stooping to jump into the hole. “ Come on. ” Goddammit, she didn't sign up to wallow in a trench filled with dead aliens. “ Paid. This needs to be a paid internship, ” she muttered as she joined the captain. Chuckling, the captain started rummaging through the bodies as she studied the closest body to her. The body's pale periwinkle had darkened to a midnight blue in places. Bruises, she assumed, that the aliens sustained during the fight with whatever caused this. The bloodshot eyes from another body nearby stared into her own listlessly. Most of the bodies near her were covered in blood and yet she could find no exit or entry wound, though she couldn't look too closely without feeling nauseous. A click from behind caused the intern to jump, quickly turning around to see the source of the noise. A quiet hiss of air went off as she saw her captain take off his helmet. “ Captain! What are you doi-, “ He cut her off, shoving a bolt of cotton cloth into her arms. “ Russia got here first. ” She spread out the cloth to see the red, white, and blue stripes that signified their ally/enemy/whatever they happen to be this year. She swallowed thickly, peering down once again at the bodies. “ They… They beat them to death. My god, Captain, they literally beat these people to death. ” He nodded in response, before grabbing the arms of an alien near them. “ We might as well take one in for the scientists. ” She grabbed the legs and dragged the body into the ship. The scientists, clinical and steadfast as they were, greeted them with syringes and biohazard bags, already looking forward to the catch. They chattered excitedly amongst themselves, poking and prodding as soon as the body hit the table. She gagged at the sight, rushing to strip herself from her bloody suit as the intern in the science department called after her, “ We'll bring y'all results at the meetin'next week! ” ~ The intern sat quietly at the round table, waiting for the scientists to arrive for their report. The captain went into a coughing fit, but neither spoke up. She looked up as the door opened, the other intern entered first, grinning and bouncing on her feet excitedly, but the rest of the science department looked grim as they sat down. “ We have some news. ” The captain coughed again beside her.",0
"Prompt: Write a story about a doctor living in a world in which the technology exists to physically connect to another person and feel their pain. Story: Jackie… Jackie… The only name that keeps me sane. I repeat it over and over as the emotions flood through me. It is always different, no pain ever is the same. Sure, at first just the pain on the surface is the same, but the deep pain that is tucked away is always different. Every time it is a blackness that washes over me when connect to the patient. I have never gotten used to the pain but I try to get through it by repeating my wife's name. It is difficult but my wife's name and images of my daughter get me through. This patient came in for depression like must of my patients. Unlike most of my patients though she was one of the few children that I have diagnosed. Her name was Maria. I was told she could be suffering from depression but they needed me to make a diagnosis so that she could get treatment. When she walks in I give her a smile. She acknowledges me with a look that children should never have. Just a blank stare devoid of any of the innocent joy that most children have. I greet her mother and we exchange pleasantries and I direct Maria to take a seat. All the equipment was already set up for her so as soon as she took a seat I asked her if she was ready to begin. She nodded. I walked over and took a seat next to Maria and reached for rod that will connect me to her. As I grabbed hold of the rod to connect to Maria I think to myself, *she is only twelve, it can't be… OH GOD!! * The pain was immediate. It hit me like a wall. Images of an older man holding a knife flashed before my eyes. My whole body ached. There was blood everywhere. My mind started to spiral into the blackness. I started to gag, I couldn't breathe. I am begging him to stop but he can't hear me. The knife comes down swiftly. The pain is too intense to bear. I fade into the blackness as I hear a scream. The scream continues as I open my eyes. I see my daughter covered in blood in a heap on the ground in front of me and then I look up to see my wife standing in the doorway screaming. *What have I done? * I plunge the knife into my chest. For once, the blackness is comforting.",0
"Prompt: All apprentice mages are required to visit the five high temples located around the world before graduating. The temples rarely stay at one spot for long, however. Story: Jeffrey ran across the mountain's crest. His calculations had been right the Temple of Wind was right there floating idly at the end of the steep mountain slope tethered to it with large chains. Jeffrey quickened his pace, though he most likely had enough time to walk he didn't want to leave anything to chance. Clutching his pocket watch and staff in one hand and gripping the strap of his alchemist bag in the other he rushed with billowing robes. Suddenly a great creaking sound that shook the mountain to it's core echoed through the mountain range. *Bugger* Jeffrey thought and tried to push his sprint harder than ever. He could see how the chains tethering the temple were starting to come off the cliffside and dragged back into their giant harpoons. Just as the temple started turning from the mountainside Jeffrey leapt aboard the steps. An old piercing voice called from up high ""Apprentice, find something to hold on to."" Jeffrey quickly rummaged through his bag and fished out his enchanted climbing gloves and gripped a statue of a griffon has tightly as he could. A great wind started to envelop the temple, Jeffrey's feet started to ease off the ground from the violent draft. The temple started to slowly spin around and around, faster and faster until the world around it was a blur. Just as suddenly as it had begun it stopped and Jeffrey was presented with an entirely different view. That of a cliffs over a stormy coast. He loosened his grip and fell exhausted onto the floor. He sat there for what felt like hours taking in what had just happened, but the voice from before interrupted him. ""C'mon boy, don't lay about like a lazy ox. Come up here and we will begin.""",0
"Prompt: Write the same story twice. One as a drama and the other as a comedy. Story: He walked down the street, the birdsong hitting his ears like a barrage of bullets. Pain erupting with every step. He could taste alcohol and vomit on his lips. He shouldn't have gone to the party, that was clear. But the events of the night were not entirely his fault. At least that's what he was telling himself. His drink must have been spiked. That's it. That's why he did it. But he knew the truth. He couldn't handle his alcohol. He remembered the screams of dismay, the knife, the pink skin punctured and leaking as it was all a dream. He paused to vomit again in a passing bush.'I wonder whether I should move to Alaska' was his last thought as he dropped onto the grass and the sweet oblivion of unconsciousness. He woke to a text from his friend. He knew that she hadn't been at the party, so the news must have spread round to everyone in town by now. He rolled over, landing face first in a pile of his own vomit. Wiping his face on the damp grass he crawled over to shade of the trees and read her message again. **Comedy** *What did you do! You need to come to my house and we can talk it over before you speak to anyone else. But seriously, stabbing that giant pool inflatable? Tim's mom is so pissed. * **Drama** *What did you do! You need to come to my house and we can talk it over before you speak to anyone else. But seriously, stabbing Tim? Tim's mom is so pissed. *",0
"Prompt: There was an angel caught in the power lines. Story: It was my first day on the job, and the first time I ever smelled burning angel wings. I was shadowing Mike Fenwick, an old hand at wildlife and pest control and one of the best in the business. After twenty years working municipal, he'd gone independent with his own company, Fenwick Animal Control, and soon scored a corporate contract to supply animal control services to General Electric. His job was to patrol their southern Illinois facilities looking for evidence of vermin and pests, respond to calls regarding nuisance animals, set traps and remove captured animals, that sort of thing. Business was good, and he'd taken on several technicians to help him manage an expanding workload. I was the latest. I was fresh out of a Wildlife Biology degree, and expecting to spend my days wrangling possums, raccoons, mice and the like. The one thing I hadn't expected to be wrangling was angels, but we got the call at 11:20am, an angel trapped in the power-lines south of Pittsburg, and Mike set me straight on the way over there. ""Most sixty percent of our work right now is angels,"" he told me. ""Clients like to keep it on the down low, so you don't hear about it so much. Not good PR to have pictures of an angel getting cooked in your UHV line on the the six o'clock news, or smeared on the grille of one of your fleet trucks. But it's a real problem, for them anyway. For us it's gravy."" ""But where do they come from?"" ""There's a big nest down Shawnee way, somewhere in the national forest they reckon but they haven't figured out where. Sometimes you get whole flocks of them coming out at once. Quite a sight if you get to see it."" ""Yeah, but where do they *come* from,"" I said. ""Do you know? Everyone tells a different story."" ""Well,"" Mike said, ""All I can say is I know a story too. Can't say it's for true for sure, but I've discussed the matter with some important folks over the years, and they've said the same thing."" ""What's the story?"" ""Well, just a moment, we're here."" Here was a spot a indistinguishable from any other in the endless, flat landscape of cornfields through which we'd driven. Only Mike's GPS could tell us we were in the right spot. The power-lines were a ways off from the highway, so we'd have to walk a bit. ""I hope it did't get stuck up there,"" said Mike, ""I don't fancy doing live-line work."" He grabbed a large bag of gear from the back of the truck, which he then handed to me, and we started walking. ""The story I heard,"" I said, after a minute or two, ""is that it was some evangelical pastor, who was also a genetics genius. Thought he'd create his own army of angels to help bring God's kingdom to Earth."" Mike just let out a chuckle at that. ""Kid, I met a few pastors in my time, and not one of them was a genius in any sort of science. No, that story's mostly horseshit, I'm afraid. There's a grain of truth to it, but just a grain."" By then we'd reached the base of the transmission tower. Scattered around there was a welter of white feathers, but no sign of the angel itself. Looking up, we could just about make out the shape of something, lodged into the tower's girders. ""God damn it,"" said Mike, ""Don't suppose you've got any experience climbing these things?"" ""None."" ""Well, we'll have to do something about that, but not today. Guess I'm going up there."" He started rooting around in the pack for various pieces of protective equipment, and donning them. ""Angels are genetic splices, that much is right,"" he said, as he was getting prepared. ""But it wasn't some crazy pastor or lone genius, it was Apple."" ""Apple?"" I said. ""The computer company?"" ""That's right."" Without explaining further he clipped a hot stick to his back and began climbing. I watched him for a while, then began sweeping up some of the stray feathers into a duffel bag. After five minutes, I looked up again to see he'd reached the object trapped in the tower. I could just about make out him poking and shoving it with the hot stick. Suddenly, something dislodged from the tower and fell. For a moment, my heart was in my mouth, thinking it was Mike. But it wasn't. Eighty pounds of charred and smouldering angel carcass crashed to the floor beside me in an explosion of dust, blood and feathers. I let out an involuntary cry and leapt backwards. From up above, I could hear Mike laughing. Once I got my nerve back, I approached the thing. I'd never seen an angel this close before, dead or alive. Besides the stench of the burnt wings and flesh, what I noticed was how *weird* it looked. From a distance, angels looked the part, with smooth pink flesh, white-clad bodies, and great feathered wings. Up close, you could see how freakish they were. Like a strange cross between humans, birds and pigs, with big wide eyes and strange puckered mouths half way between beaks and lips. Mike got down quicker than he'd gone up. ""What are you gawking at,"" he said when he saw me examining the angel. ""Get it bagged up."" It took us a good twenty minutes to collect all the feathers and pieces of the carcass into sanitary containers, then we hauled it back to the truck. Once we were done, Mike lit a cigarette and we stood watching the corn waving over the endless fields. ""Get a good look at it then?"" Mike asked. ""Yeah,"" I said, ""I didn't realise how fucked up they were."" ""That's the DNA splicing. About ten different animals in there: birds, pigs, mice, you name it."" ""Humans?"" ""Nope, that'd be illegal. And believe it or not that thing was created legally."" ""By Apple."" ""By Apple. It was for a product launch. Their iHolocube, about twelve years back, remember it? Well they wanted to make a big splash at the reveal, and it just so happened they had a skunkworks gene splicing lab. I mean, all the big companies did back then, before the government cracked down. Someone had the bright idea of making angels, actual angels, by splicing bird and mammal DNA."" ""See the idea was to only create a few. Maybe a dozen or so. They'd be released into the air at the event, where they fly around like they were trained to do. Nobody would get a really good look at them, enough to see the seams, so to speak, and then they'd be put back into captivity. I guess they'd be kept as pets for a while, or just disposed of. Except they never even made it to the launch. There was an accident at the lab, and the whole flock escaped. What's more, they weren't sterile, like they were supposed to be. They bred. And bred. And now they've spread all over the country, but particularly in the midwest. For whatever reason, the climate here suits them."" ""That's a crazy story,"" I said. ""It is,"" Mike replied. ""But it's what I've been told. In a way there's a kind of poetry to it."" ""How so?"" ""Well, scripture says God in heaven created the angels, and then created man. Then the first species we create all on our own is an angel. Makes you wonder what those tech boys might cook up next."" With that, he finished his cigarette and we climbed back into the truck. ""It's about time for lunch,"" Mike said. ""I know a decent diner not too far from here. Say, you ever eaten one of these things?""",0
"Prompt: Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. Story: I first met her when I was 5, at a playground my mother used to take me. I knew right away that I want to be with her for a very very long time. Her glorious halo of golden hair that frames her majestic face made her look like an angel. We went steady at a pretty young age and got married soon after we found out about baby Agnes. But baby Agnes did not join us. She was only 7 months old in her belly when baby Agnes's heart stopped beating. We were very sad, even though our 22-year old faces didn't show it. But we were there for each other, we held each other up so we could be stronger together. The drinking helped too. The first time I was hospitalised after falling down the stairs was after the day I celebrated my 24th birthday. It was entirely my fault, I shouldn't have been shouting so loudly at her, she didn't mean to elbow me when she turned around. I only broke a toe at that time. She looked so beautiful trying to apologize to me, when it's obviously just an accident. We started putting knives away when we had another accident a year later. We were doing one of our silly arguments again when I was being too stubborn to understand what she's trying to say, and in her excitement to show me, she accidentally hit one of the knive's hilt that caused it to fly through the sky and hit me in my eyeball. I started wearing an eye patch after that, and went around calling myself ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" for the kids in the neighbourhood. When she started talking to me about leaving, that's when I realised that I've pushed her away too far already, and I really need to change so I can always be the best for her. I got a new job that made her happier, spent more time at home and tried to do more chores at home. In fact, I was so determined to show her how I've changed, that I stopped drinking soon. I told her that it's all hers to enjoy, since she was always happiest after a good session of drinking. I lost her to a disease soon after that. The doctors said it was too late to do anything for her, with the amount of poison in her. I didn't understand it at all, we tried to eat carefully and always brushed our teeth after every meal. How could she get sick so quickly? ""I said, my name is Adriana. What's yours?"" I snapped back to the playground I'm in, I'm still sitting on the see-saw and she's still standing in front of me with her hand in front of me, waiting for me to shake. ""I'm Jack."" I said proudly. Then I showed her my Tonka truck, and when she squealed happily at that, I knew we were going to be best friends forever.",0
"Prompt: You get a deep cut for the first time in your life, instead of bone or muscle, you see wires. Story: So I was working with the saw and I was tired and slipped and before I knew it, I had a huge gash on my forearm where blood wasn't pouring out. When the initial shock had worn off and the lack of any mind-numbing pain had convinced me that something was *off* about this, I started looking at the wound and that's when I saw it. Wires, shiny copper wires everywhere. There wasn't any more blood, apparently in deep cuts like this there wasn't enough blood to properly bleed. So I tried to clean it out myself which was really hard since touching those wires felt good. I had to resist the urge to pull some of them out. I bandaged my arm and then took some painkillers and went to sleep. The day after I woke up, once I remembered my new situation, I opened up the gauss pad to see if it had gotten better, but instead, it had gotten much much worse. The skin around the wound had started to melt as if it was no longer alive, the smell was horrendous, so I called my good friend Kyle, the doctor, and asked him if I could have a private appointment. From the sound of my voice, Kyle obviously knew something was up, so he told me to swing by his clinic at ten pm. Once I arrived, I told him to grab a seat and told the truth. It wasn't until I showed him the arm that he said ""Geeze, I thought you were having a psychotic episode or something, but this.... this is real isn't it?"" Then after examining the wound, he confirmed that which I already knew, that the skin around it was dying and that it was spreading fast. He then told me he'd need a sample of those wires to know what they were. As he looked at me, I felt a surge of strange thoughts start to course through my head, but I simply nooded and he got to work on getting one of those out. As he started pulling, I tensed up and he tried to ease up on the procedure. After it was done, he apologized for being so blunt and that he didn't know they were that sensitive. I could again only nod at his words. But he'd been wrong about the pain, what I had felt when he pulled it out was a pure and unbrideled sense of exctasy. It was absolute bliss to have it pulled. So while he went over the microscope, I was trying to hide my sudden erection under my coat. It had literarly been one of the most fundamentally rewarding and satisfying feeelings and sensations I'd ever felt in my whole life. But I was interrupted in my thoughts by a strange gurgling sound. When I looked up to where Kyle was standing, I could see that he was bleeding from a hole in his neck, as I watched him he slumped over on the floor and a big blood puddle started forming under his body. Then I saw the wire come crawling out of his body and I knew that it had killed him to protect itself. Now I'm sitting here in a corner in the building, waiting for the police to show up, I've told them everything and even if they don't believe me, they still have to come here and investigate. The wound is spreading more and more over my body, but I don't care about that anymore because of the feeling the new exposed wiring is giving me, it's like the air is singing to it. As more and more of it vanishes, I start feeling more alive, more in tune with my new self a self that only wants to pick... pull... pick and pull... Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire OooooooOOOOoooh... here we..nnggg.... go again......",0
"Prompt: In a world where lying is immediately detected by a phone app, you go into a bar and tell your friends you 've had the worst day in the history of mankind. The app detects you 're telling the truth. You proceed to tell them about your day ... Story: I open the pub door. Smells of beer, pub food, and warm bodies hit me. I step over the threshold. I become aware of the petite woman with too-dark makeup laughing. She's leaning on the chest of a man who could grace the cover of a muscle-mag. I force myself to look past them. This couple's holding hands, frilly drinks forgotten. The brunette with the long hair brings the hand of the short-haired woman to her lips, kisses each finger while staring into the other woman's eyes. On my left, a man with broad shoulders and well-defined muscles wheels his chair towards a table, grinning as he greets the attractive redhead waiting there. She blows him a kiss and puts down her phone. I wind my way through the tables, looking for Heidi's tumble of blond curls. There, with Chace by her side. I must have really freaked her out. She waves at me as I pass the last few blissfully unaware patrons. “ Heidi said you claimed you had the worst day ever, and that our app didn't work. ” Chace's head tilts forward and his eyes are almost black. The last time I saw that look, it was right before he threw my ex-boyfriend out the door. I'd been right to call Chace and Heidi over that night. The ex had broken in, threatened to kill me. And after the last few weeks, Chace's hostility is understandable. “ Hi Chace. ” I swallow. “ I understand your … response. ” I pull out a chair, sit down. I shiver in my coat. I meet his eyes, see them narrow. “ You're ghost white, Laurel. This has gotten to the point of crazy. I'm seriously considering calling the mental health crisis line. ” Heidi slides her delicate hand onto his forearm. I fold my hands on the table in front of me. Strong hands. That's what Heidi's mother had said. I shudder and grimace, clinch my hands into fists. I force out “ I'm not surprised. I've considered calling them myself. ” As Heidi leans over the table, I realize I'd whispered. Heidi wraps my fists in her hands. I flinch. She's in mother-mode. “ Have the dreams gotten worse? Last month, it was Pompeii. And then last week, the first world war. ” She moves next to me, wraps her arm around me. I hunch away from her. “ You- you don't want to be close to me. ” Heidi puts one hand on my shoulder, keeps the other on my hands. “ Nonsense. You'll talk about your day, whatever this worst day in your life is, and we'll have some drinks. We'll move past it same way we did when Chace tossed The Creep out. ” The truth alarm from her phone silences the conversations throughout the pub. Chace fumbles with her phone to clear it. I close my eyes. “ We won't ever forget this, Heidi. ” I look at her. The confusion and shock distort her normally peaceful face. I've always been troubled, and her face typically calms me. I'd never see that calm again. “ I dreamt of Hitler, the peace of the early 21st century. ” I finally break. I cover my face with my horrible, strong hands. I smear my eyeliner as I try to regain my composure. I desperately look from Heidi to Chace. He meets my eyes, holds my gaze. I know he'll figure it out. I force myself to look at Heidi. “ Heidi, I'm sorry. I… ” I take a deep breath. “ I saw your great-grandparents. And then your parents. That's when -- that's when I started to figure it out. ” “ No, no. You never met them. ” Tears stream down her face as the horror of her parent's death floods back. “ You never met them! ” She stands as she yells, knocking over her chair. The pub goes quiet again. I manage to whisper, “ I saw their pictures in your house. I… I've seen other things. Heidi, I saw Napoleon killed. I saw the Moradabad riots, the Rwandan genocide… ” I helplessly look at Chace. He holds Heidi's phone, ready to quiet the alarm. His voice helps ground me. “ Today you realized you're seeing the pain of humanity. Every time you sleep. ” I nod. The alarm never sounds. I force myself to form the words, to verbalize the fear. “ What happens after I see today? ”",0
"Prompt: The monster under your bed, the monster in the closet, the monster tapping on your window, the monster hiding in the basement, and the monster living in the attic all try to compete with each other to give you the biggest scare. It 's become less scary and more annoying. Story: I awoke to the sensation of warmth on the back of my neck. My vision still blurry and my mind not fully awake, I turn over to see a creature with jet black eyes, orange skin, and the mane of a lion staring back at me. ""Good morning, Frank. You know that hasn't scared me in years. The breath was a nice touch, though."" ""Yeah, but I thought maybe the change would be enough. I don't really care for the prize this time, anyways."" He wasn't very enthusiastic this time. I put on my slippers and my glasses and headed downstairs to the kitchen. Upon opening the fridge, a small monkey-like creature jumped out and hissed, it's hands raised in the air. I let out a chuckle. ""Hello to you, Marcell. You didn't drink all the milk, did you?"" I already knew he had. ""Man, I was really hoping I'd get a scare out of you this time. At least a twitch."" He sounded disappointed. ""We've got a really cool pocket knife up for grabs this time."" I turned and headed for the living room, so I could turn on the news. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Jerry the Yeti in my driveway, climbing under my car. He's never been very inconspicuous. After a few failed jump-scares from the guys, I started getting ready for work. Their little game runs until I leave, unless no one scares me. I usually just pretend to be scared to the last one, but I just wasn't feeling it today. They'll have to try again when I get home. My drive to work consisted of me listening to Jesse the Imp trying to conceal his breathing in my back seat. Oddly enough, he never jumped out at me. Probably fell asleep. Poor thing. While I was at my desk, I found myself struggling to remember what life was like before my monsters. They can be annoying at times, sure. But they are just trying to find some fun in this life. Can't blame them for that. I must have dozed off at my desk, because the next thing I knew, my boss was shaking me. ""Wha.... What's the deal..."" It seemed difficult to talk. His voice sounded so far away, and so urgent. I thought I heard him saying something like, ""coming back to us"" and ""it's working"". I have things strange little episodes sometimes, though. They always pass after a few minutes, and this one was no different. I'll probably have one or two more episodes before I leave work, and get to go back home to my little monsters. Oh, and I have to buy more milk. Dammit, Marcell. [ Edit: This is the first thing I've written in about 10 years, and I would love some helpful criticism from anyone that happens to read it. ]",0
"Prompt: '' That 's it! '' shouts the DM, `` You say I 'm too easy on you as a DM? Well I 've got the dungeon of bullshit all lined up, none of you fuckers are making it out! '' Let 's see the in game perspective Story: The party approached the cavern where the Great Beast lay, the promise of gold and riches lifting their spirits as they stopped before the mouth of the cave. ""I think we should do an equipment check,"" said Erik, looking warily at the darkness beyond. ""Remember when I stood on his shoulders,"" Buckthorn the Axe-crazed said to Ragnar, gesturing back at the rogue, ""and scared off the kobolds?"" ""Yeah,"" said Ragnar dismissively, ""but remember when I punched that naga in the face?"" The self-proclaimed ""ninja barbarian"" flexed his arms. He looked in to the cave. ""I see.... nothing. Man, it's dark. Let me try again."" He squinted and thrust his face forward, muscles tense with concentration. He nodded. Buckthorn looked into the cave, as well. He, too, nodded. Erik looked at them expectantly. ""Well?"" They looked back at him blankly. ""What do you see?"" ""Rocks,"" said Ragnar. ""A floor,"" said Buckthorn, grinning. The half-elf sighed and looked into the cavern himself. He saw nothing which stood out to him; no signs of movement, no traces of life. ""Alright, so I'll go in and check for..."" He trailed off as Buckthorn and Ragnar entered the cavern, arguing about who was going to lead the party. Erik rolled his eyes and followed cautiously. Their voices echoed as they walked deeper into the cave. The darkness swallowed them. Ragnar stumbled on a low stalagmite and fell on his knees, grumbling angrily about how he should have been able to see it. ""Who has a lantern?"" asked Erik. The darkness continued ahead of them, and even he was just starting to have troubles with the dim light. ""I do,"" said Buckthorn. There was a cacophony of noise as he rummaged around in his pack. More noise followed as he struggled to light it. ""Why isn't it working?"" he said angrily. ""We used it a lot when we were tracking those slavers,"" said Erik. ""Which could have made us a lot of money, if we had just sold them,"" interjected Ragnar. ""And?"" prompted Buckthorn. ""Did you ever get more oil?"" ""Oh, come on!"" exclaimed Buckthorn. ""Of course I would have gotten more oil! We were in town for days. I must have..."" he trailed off. ""Well,"" replied Erik, ""obviously not."" ""Hold on,"" said Ragnar. He pulled a flask out of his pack. ""Put this in it."" ""Alcohol? Really?"" said Erik as Buckthorn took the flask. He backed away while Buckthorn added the liquid to the lantern and lit it. A low flame ignited and Buckthorn and Ragnar both exclaimed in triumph. A green flash was all that alerted them before the displacer beast attacked, silently striking out at Ragnar with a tentacle. Buckthorn dropped the lantern in surprise. They fought by the dim, flickering light. The displacer beast got in a couple strikes before their weapons were drawn and then the party began fighting back. ""What are you doing?"" yelled Erik as he dodged a tentacle. ""Trying to hit him in the eye,"" roared Ragnar, missing again as he poked at the displacer beast's face with his greatsword. Suddenly, a roar shook the cavern. Erik spun and saw an owlbear entering the cave. ""What the hell?"" he yelled as the creature ran at them. He engaged the owlbear while Ragnar and Buckthorn tried to fight the displacer beast. Buckthorn stumbled against a stalagmite as he dodged. He moved to leap back into battle, but instead fell flat on the floor. Looking back, he saw gray tentacles wrapped around his ankles, and an eye slowly appearing in the stalagmite. ""What the fuck is that?"" he cried as a mouth began to gape beneath the eye. He reached for his axe as it began dragging him back. Ragnar had finally given up the finesse and was hacking and slashing as the displacer beast danced around him, lashing at him with its tentacles. Ragnar got in a couple lucky shots, but he was slowing down. Something from the ceiling dripped on his head. The displacer beast froze, looking up. Ragnar took advantage of the pause and got in a good strike. The beast howled and disappeared. Ragnar raised his sword in victory and something wet and sticky enveloped his hand. Looking up in surprise, he saw a long tendril of gray ooze wrapped around his fist. He tried to yank his hand down, but the tendril held firm as it slowly crept up his arm. Buckthorn screamed as the tentacled stalagmite began to constrict his body, its tentacles covering him from shoulders to feet. It lifted his small, heavy body toward its mouth and ended his screams. Ragnar was lifted toward the cave ceiling as the ooze continued to envelope his body. He slashed ineffectively at it with his dagger, cursing and yelling. His voice became muffled as the ooze pushed him into its core. Erik tried to run from the owlbear, desperation fueling his exhausted feet. His battered, bleeding body stumbled across the cave floor. He was hit in the back by the enraged owlbear and crumpled into a heap against the wall. As the monster reared over him, preparing for the final blow, he moaned: ""I told you guys she was pissed.""",0
"Prompt: You wake up staring into a pair of eyes, your own. Story: I don't know why I fell for Ms Mirror-for-a-face, maybe it was just something about her that was so re-assuring. She never talked back, or talked at all. I could unload my opinions, and her expression would match my own exactly. It was satisfying, empowering. My ex-girlfriends used to tell me I had a massive ego, a textbook narcissist. But they paled in comparison to Ms Mirror-for-a-face. I love her eyes, which were just like my eyes, reflected back at me. She smiles whenever I smile, we're so in sync. Whenever I talk about my politics, my religious beliefs, Ms Mirror-for-a-face always agrees. At least, she seems to. Sometimes she just sits beside me, saying nothing for hours. She doesn't eat, merely stares at me with images of my own eyes. I wonder in those moments whether I'm truly alone. Only for a second, I doubt her. But then she'll hold my hand, a reassuring touch from skin as cold as glass. I love Ms Mirror-for-a-face. Of course there is nothing wrong with our relationship. There's nothing wrong with me, I've found a true love that you will never know. A love without ever having to be challenged, a love without sacrifice, a love without needing to share, without that crawling creeping feeling of loneliness like you've let a lovecraftian horror into your house with an arcane power over you that you can barely understand, let alone fight. I'm not talking of Ms Mirror-for-a-face of course. she is just like me. In every way. And its.... perfect.",0
"Prompt: Write a story reimagining a character from another piece of fiction as down-and-out/washed up/past their prime. Story: He sat in his new office, still amazed that it was finally his. He had fought his way tooth and nail up the corporate ladder, and now it was finally paying off. All the suit wearing, meeting attending, hand shaking, and ass-kissing had finally payed off. ""If only my teenage self could see me now,"" he thought. ""He'd hate me. But what did I know? I was a teenager."" He still remembered those awful boarding schools he had been shipped off to and subsequently kicked out of. He was such a rebel back then, getting in fights and skipping class, he didn't care about anyone but himself. No one except his sister that is. God, when was the last time they'd talked? Christmas? Had it really it really been that long? He'd been so focused on getting this promotion that he hadn't really thought about it. Perhaps he did still focus on himself too much. And he thought about himself then: his past self. The time he skipped school and ran off to New York. The times he'd go to watch the orchestra play with his parents, and the timpani player who was the only one there who seemed to be enjoying what he did. The worn orange hunting hat and bloodstained sweater that he refused to let go of that now sat in a box in his basement. And now here he sat, in a big office, at an important job. A phony. He had become a phony. He even had a name tag on his big phony desk, telling everyone who saw it that Holden Caulfield was a phony.",0
"Prompt: A person has psychic/telekinetic/mind control powers. Based on the distance from the subject they experience lag/jitter/delay. Story: Roughly 7 seconds per 3 paces of distance, that my friend is the best guesstimate I have for the relationship between me and the delay I have to read your thoughts. Here's the thing though, since this process first happened when I was 12 it has been a struggle to live an normal life and blend in with the general public. Can you imagine, sitting in a class to looking at a group of peer ls and them the wave crashes into you, the thoughts and useless wanderings of the mind, other people's minds, flooding into your psyche. To say the least I had a bit of a break down in public and even after two separate therapy sessions with psychiatrist I still was labeled schizophrenic. Everyone wants to think their mind is structured, disciplined, logical, and that somehow everything in the world is reacting to open up that pathway for you to find that magical adventure that leads you to success. Instead, even in the most concentrated of conversations the shit that grabs away at attention is just astounding. For example here is how even the most basic conversation comes out: 'Hey what are you up to tonight' 'Hey how are you' -- OK TONIGHT, WEDNESDAY NOTHING CRAZY IMPORTANT RIGHT 'Doing pretty good, you?' 'Doing well, so what'd you ask' ALRIGHT DO I REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT, IT'S ONLY 2PM, AGENDA, SHOWS, RELAX, HUH THERE'S SOME HOPPING BIRDS 'Got any plans tonight, I was thinking about going to catch a movie, $ 6 Wednesday matinee prices for all movies.' 'Oh thanks, he yeah that could be fun' OK OK 6 BUCKS GOT THAT IN CASH SHOULD BE COVERED GAS IN THE CAR OK THERE WHAT ARE WE SEEING WHAT SO THEY LIKE TO SEE UGH DO NOT MAKE ME WATCH A FUCKING FEEL GOOD MOVIE I COULD WATCH FOR FREE ON NETFLIX IN 6 MONTHS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, THEATERS ARE FOR EXPLOSIONS AND AMAZING SOUND I CA N'T GET AT HOME, DID I LOCK MY GARAGE? 'Great, meet you there at 8' 'OK great!' OK WHATEVER THINK OF A BACK UP ESCAPE PLAN IF THE MOVIE SOUNDS DUMB, BROTHER WANTS TO GET DINNER, FAMILY FIRST, NOBODY ARGUES THAT. Now, let's face it people think a lot faster in their minds, than how they speak, in fact you would have no idea how many times you look for words so quickly in your mind and prioritize mentally your conversation. What I always get is a delayed crazed response that sounds like I am talking to a meth head on Red Bull, and that meth head interrupts me while I'm talking in the middle of my sentences. Luckily for me I have a job where this comes in handy, I work internal audit at a financial firm, and you have no idea how fun my job is",0
"Prompt: Write the most angry, vitriolic thing you have ever written. Make it a love letter. Story: Elizabeth, It's taken me awhile to sit down and write this letter. I kept trying to find ways to distract myself from it, to try to stay busy, but it's no use. I guess I'm still in denial, and thought that if I waited long enough I'd just come back from classes one day and see a message from you on my phone. But now I've finally realized that I may never speak to you again, so I just wanted to put some things down for the record. First of all, you should know that you can do whatever you want with this letter - write back, keep it, tear it up, burn it, whatever. This letter is for you as much as it's for me, and so it up to you to decide what to do with it. I guess I'll start with the thing that I never had the guts to say in person: I love you, Elizabeth. I never had any doubt, from the moment I met you. But for some reason, no matter how sure I was that you were the one, you never seemed to have more than a timid interest in me. How is it that you couldn't see? We were perfect together. Everything was completely comfortable, 100 % natural. I never felt like I had to lie to impress you. I knew that if I could just show you how perfect we were, everything would be golden. But somehow, that never happened. I thought that maybe you were to good for me. Your purity, your beauty, your faith. As I was, I was tainting you every time we touched. I had to change, had to make myself into a better man, one worthy of you. I tried, I really did. I went to church, I volunteered, I gave to charity, I even prayed to a God I hadn't believed in since I was a little kid. But it was only lip service. I knew I couldn't be like that. The harder I tried, more of a liar I felt I became. Each sermon in church was like a knife in my ears - there would be people around me, so happy and certain in their faith, while I sat and cringed at verses the priest delivered. But I would still knee at the altar, still say the words. I had to, for you, Elizabeth. But it never worked. I never changed. It began to spiral out of control. I would wait eagerly to finish my classes just to hear your voice over the phone, and for those moments I was happy, but as soon as I hung up, the self-loathing return. Each day I began to hate myself a little more. I was liar and thief, trying to lie to God and trying to lie to you. I was trying to steal you away from your damn parents, away from those pious guardians who sealed you away so jealously. You made me hate myself so much, I considered suicide. More than once. I never got close, no, but still, the thoughts were there. They'd come with the shame I felt whenever I thought of you. And eventually I realized - it wasn't my fault, it was yours. It was your fault, alright. I knew it as sure I had been sure that we were soul mates. You self-righteous snobbery, that endless piety, that naïve innocence.... you drove me away. And just like I hate myself, I hate you too. But God dammit, I still love you. I still dream of you at night. So kindly get yourself out of my head. I have better things to do than get judging by a arrogant little virgin, no matter how beautiful she is. Forever yours (unfortunately), Ryan",0
"Prompt: You are a teenager with the ability to measure how `` Dangerous '' people are on a scale from 1 to 10 just by looking at them. A normal child would be a 1, while a trained man with an assault rifle might be a 7. Today, you notice the unassuming new kid at school measures a 10. Story: I've always seen the numbers. Or, at least I've seen them for as long as I can remember. Random numbers, single digits at chest level on every person I've ever met. I see them in pictures, and in movies, on TV and in person. The only time I don't see them is when it's a picture of some long dead guy in a history book. The numbers change all the time. Sometimes my friend has a 1, and suddenly it'll be a 4. People in cars usually have higher numbers but those will move around too. I tried for years to figure out what the numbers mean but they don't have a pattern. Like the kid who only wears black and sits at the back of my geography class, his number is jumping up and down all the time. He seems angry, and he'll be at a 2, and then the next day it's a 6 and he couldn't be more calm. His numbers are really different from the rest, I have no idea why. I can see him now, from my lunch table. He just entered the cafeteria. 7, that's pretty high, I hardly ever see it that high. He's coming closer. 8. Looks like he's headed to the center of the room. 9. I've never seen the number get this high before. 10. He's slowly unzipping his jacket, there's a bunch of red pipes strapped to his --",0
"Prompt: ( Harry Potter ) Born a squib to an elitist wizard family, you ran away to attend muggle school. You are now the only human alive with extensive knowledge of both magic and muggle technology. Story: He had finally done it! After six years of research and experiments, Jack had finally isolated the particle responsible for the existence of magic. He pumped his fist in the air in celebration, reveling in the fact the he had just spit in the face of physics. He even gave Oliver a gruesome bear hug, despite the homeless wizard's alcoholic stench. This discovery was going to change everything. Every field of science from genetics to astronomy was going to evolve thanks to this new knowledge. All that was left was to name the particle and submit his findings. Jack was having trouble with the former issue. He would love to have his name plastered all over future textbooks, but Jack Smith particle lacked elegance when written next to Higgs boson. Perhaps he could name it the Redbone particle. No, nothing would displease him more than having his birth family's name where his should be. Jack decided to skip the name problem for the moment. Particle M was a perfectly fine filler for the time being. He still needed to triple check all the calculations, and a second run of the experiment wouldn't hurt. Collecting his notes, the scientist decided to call it a day. Locking the lab door behind him, Jack escorted Oliver out of the campus building and paid him generously. “ Now, remember not to spend all of this on booze, ” he said, handing the wizard an inconspicuous box full of gold coins. “ And please don't show up drunk next time I call you. ” Oliver simply snorted. “ So long as I'm getting paid. ” The wizard started walking away, but quickly backtracked upon checking the box's contents. “ How the bloody hell did a muggle loving squib get his hands on this many Galleons, if you don't mind me asking? ” Jack grated his teeth at the word squib, but held his temper. “ I'm a genius physicist that just found scientific evidence of how magic works. Do you really think it would be that hard for me to obtain a few measly coins? ” Oliver shook his head, mumbling obscenities as he walked away. Jack watched the man for a few seconds before he disappeared into thin air. Looking around, Jack confirmed that he was the only one to notice that Oliver was ever even there and started walking to his car. He would love nothing more than to give a wizard a piece of his mind one of these days. Actually, that wasn't entirely true. Jack would love nothing more than to win a Nobel prize, but showing some witch bitch that gun beats stick was a close second. Jack shook his head, expelling any thoughts of wizards from his mind. He was a genius. Such hellish violence was below him. All he needed was some food. His last meal was breakfast and it was now well into the afternoon. Some pizza and a beer would help his mood. Unfortunately, the pizza would have to wait. As he approached his car, Jack saw a woman in a short, victorian black dress was knocking on the window. His initial thought was to run and call campus security, but at the same time was just wanting to go get dinner. It would be easier to politely ask the woman to leave, and only run away if she pulled a knife on him. “ Excuse ma'am, that's my car you are tapping on, ” he said in a cheery voice. The woman turned around, causing Jack to go wide-eyed in shock. “ Mom?! ” *Perhaps I should have called security. * “ Oh, there you are William. I didn't know you were out. You might want to consider getting a bigger house. ”",0
"Prompt: `` Watch out or you 'll end up like Alice. '' Story: When Lance got into Dartmouth I knew he was up to something. Adderol, blood doping, testosterone supplements, tren. All of these can explain sudden bursts of exemplary behavior, a swift kick in the pants sending a person flying through the realm of desperation and landing them further right on the ol' bell curve. But this I couldn't believe. Lance, whose dorm walls were crisp white, unadorned. Tie was always tied just tight enough, no shirttails loose or threads pulled on his sweater vest. Even during casual weekends, unsurveyed by the authority as it exists in our little school, enjoying darts and billiards in the common room his polo was tucked in crisply to his khakis. There wasn't a rebellious, forward thinking bone in his body. From the deep fires of my revolutionary spirit I knew him to be an enemy, despite the fact that I never heard a strong opinion (pro or anti-authority) from him. At least that's how it started, I saw the Sophomores a year above me start to beef up their applications in December. The institution attracted all kinds of outliers, our lacrosse and academic decathlon teams were undefeated and shared many of the same members, but Lance was not one of the elite few who we all knew would be singled out by the all-powerful Ivy League admissions committees and raised to the heavens of society among the other angels, transcending us mortals' petty competition. I didn't notice when a few of the girls from across the way started lingering outside of the practice field where he played (mediocre) for the soccer team. I didn't see when our math and philosophy professors started smiling, really smiling, when he raised his hand in class. I didn't notice when he was walking with Principle Mikkels, both smiling and laughing, Lance trailing his hand along the fence. He was selecting leaves of ivy from the frame and then forsaking them, dropping them back to earth. I did notice when I was returning from one of my late-night secret trysts with my small pipe and tiny bag of weed. I'd discovered an unpatrolled hallway which led back to just near enough to the dorm doors to make a run for it. The hall trailed along the outside of the West wing, not much was done over here but pieces of art by students were displayed. I normally ignored them in part because they were derivative trash, obviously shat out by some apathetic student on the complacent understanding that any effort at all would guarantee an A, another four points towards the grade point average and the satisfaction of a fine arts graduation requirement. Then I saw it, simple canvas and oil paints. The thing was damn beautiful guys, I don't think any description would do it justice. Just go check it out, it's still up in the hallway. Look at the name at the bottom right and tell me what you see. Actually, fuck it. You know. It's Lance. I started looking at some of his work in other courses, philosophy and math, and I was impressed with the elegance of his arguments, it seemed like he knew much more than the question asked him to and he toyed with each of them, giving them hints through his answers to their simple questions of the much larger questions they should (could) be asking. Acceptances rolled around about a year later and wouldn't you know it but good ol' Lance got a fat parcel in the mail from Dartmouth. I knew the kid's GPA and his SAT and they were much less than outstanding. He sucked at soccer. I truly, honestly believe he got in on the sheer merit of his personal statement and letters of rec. Shit you not, up until that point I wasn't even sure they read those. I had to figure out what was going on. I know it's desperate but I followed him on one of the town trips. He took a few back ways, maybe trying to lose a tail or maybe just rehearsing the convoluted wanderings during which at some point he discovered his destination Eventually he turned into an old shop, a tattered sign the door read ""The rabbit's hole."" Not an adult emporium surprisingly, but close. An old head shop. Looking through the dusty window I saw him trade a wad of bills with an old ponytailed hippy (dressed like some kind of steampunk nobleman, pocketwatches are so lame) for a sheet of what looked like those sugar buttons on thin receipt paper that were popular back in elementary school. I hung around the corner so I could see what he did on the way out, but wouldn't you know it, he turned right into me. I could tell looking into his eyes that he knew I knew. So I guess I knew he knew I knew. Whatever. I asked him very nicely to explain and he seemed more than willing, lead me to a park a few blocks north where the old growth trees and weeping willows turned the sunny day into twilight, ignoring the high noon hour. There gathered there a few of the kids from our school, a few of the girls from across the way, and some townies. They all looked so goddamn happy. They laughed and flirted and ran like little kids, just aimless chase. No rules tag. Tagbacks abound. They explained they'd been buying this stuff, ""like LSD but not at all,"" from the old hippy in the rabbits' hole. They'd been doing it for about a year now, discovered the place entirely on accident while hanging out after a soccer tourney in the town. They offered me a tab. ""Is this stuff risky?"" I asked, I mean I experiment but you know I don't know what the hell it was. ""Not at all. Just.... don't take too much. The creativity can be addicting and if you OD- well I guess not OD but take too much at once, get greedy, it can go bad."" Lance responded to me. ""Watch out, or you'll end up like Alice."" He gestured to the edge of a park where (I can't believe I didn't notice before) It looked like a beautiful blonde girl in her prep school uniform was grinning and laughing, smiling at the trees. ""She's been like this for about a week now, she keeps talking about all sorts of weird shit. Growing bigger and smaller, disappearing cats. We tried to keep it secret but that's hard when you're tripping twenty-four-seven, you know? Teachers noticed. It's bad, her folks are going to get her in a psychiatric camp somewhere in the West once they get back from Fire Island. She won't snitch on us though."" I stared hard at her strange posture and face, grin as big as you please, eyes wide. She babbled like a toddler. I turned back to Lance, his smile of a similar quality but lesser magnitude. ""Definitely not gon na happen to you. You want some?"" What did I choose? Well I think the fact that I'm fucking stalling on my degree in community college right now, working part time at the stupid grocery store as a bag boy should tell you the answer. If I could go back I'd take that tab in a heartbeat.",0
"Prompt: You made a deal with the Devil, and now he 's come to collect. Story: Jim Watson was eating an apple when the Devil appeared before him, but he didn't stop. It was juicy with just the right balance of sweet and tangy, a honeycrisp he'd picked up from the Farmer's Market just that morning. The acrid smell marking the presence of the Dark One threatened to sour Jim's enjoyment of his succulent treat, so he put a dishtowel to his face and walked into the dining room. “ Please, just stay in there. I can hear you just fine, ” he said, talking around chewed up apple. A deep purple light beamed from underneath the door, and tendrils of smoke crept out, but the door itself didn't move. The sharp sound of clacking could be heard from the kitchen. Claws. When the Devil spoke, the sound of it should have made Jim's skin crawl; it sounded like the voice of an average, congenial man, the sort of man who would shake your hand with a smile, imitated poorly. “ Jim, buddy. It's done. She's not gon na bother you no more. ” “ Now that don't sound like Sheila, Mr. Satan, ” Jim said. “ You sure we're talking about the same woman? She's got a tendency to just turn up on you. That's the whole reason I had to come to you in the first place. ” “ Oh, don't you worry now, Jim, ” said the Devil. “ You won't be seeing your wife no more. ” “ And you can't bring her back? She's gone? ” “ I said you won't be seeing her again, Jim, and you won't. ” The voice was stern now. Jim gaped his jaw like a snake to gob an extra big bite of apple. He chewed loud and long, sucking out the juice from the tender pulp as he gnashed it between his molars. He nibbled errant bits of peel as it all went down his throat, and then he went for another bite. Jim smacked his lips and dashed to lick the dripping juice from his fingers before it fell to the carpet. He made a scene of eating a damn apple, and the Prince of Lies waited patiently for his reply. Not a claw clacked on the tile as Jim ate; the only sound was the man's gluttonous glee. Jim set the half-eaten apple on the table, and wiped his hands with a napkin. “ Mr. Satan? ” he said. “ Yes, Jim. ” “ How'd you do it? ” “ Oh, Jim. Now, I wouldn't want to tell you that. ” “ And why not? ” “ Well, there are a lot of reasons, really, but think about it. When the police come knocking, and you realize they will, right? ” “ I guess I hadn't thought about it. ” “ You should think about it. Tell me, Jim, when they tell you what they found, do want to fake surprise, or do you want to really be surprised? ” “ That's a good point, Mr. Satan. ” “ Well I'd hate to see someone get what they want and then not be able to enjoy it. ” Jim fingered the apple, rotating it slowly on the surface of the table. “ Mr Satan, I thank you for what you've done, sir, but I think it's time we parted ways. I've got a dinner to cook, and I'm sure, well, I'm sure you're pretty busy yourself. ” “ You could say that. ” “ Well, then. ” “ Jim, ” said the Devil. His voice was a poorer imitation than before. “ Aren't you forgetting something? Jim grinned. “ I don't think so. ” “ Jim, ” said the Devil. The purple light began to pulsate slowly, swirling with midnight blues and bloody reds. “ Your soul belongs to me. ” Jim picked up the apple and took another bite. His mouth full, he shook a finger at the door slowly, saying, “ Now that's where you're wrong, Mr. Satan. Now now, I know I promised you my soul in exchange for your little favor. That's true. But I didn't tell you that I'd already traded my soul away before I ever called you up. ” “ You gave it away, ” said the Devil. Jim hacked off another chunk of apple with his incisors, smacking as loudly as before. “ That's right. My friend Sam and I traded each others' souls about a week ago. I've got his, and he's got mine. I signed that weird paper you showed me, and I know I said I'd give you my soul, but I don't have it. It ain't mine to give any more. But hey, make me an offer and I might be willing to part with Sam's soul. I doubt he'd even miss it. ” “ No thank you. I don't really want it. ” “ Well good bye, Mr. Satan. You're not getting mine. ” “ I'm not? Then what's this? ” There was a crinkle of paper, and then a single sheet slid out from under the kitchen door. It was a note, rumpled slightly, a yellow page from a legal pad handwritten in pen. Jim's heart fell into his stomach. “ That's my– ” “ Contract. ” “ My contract. ” “ Amended. Slightly. ” Jim lost his grip on the apple, and it fell to the floor. “ Sam sold it to you, ” he whispered. “ What did he want? ” “ Your wife. ” “ But you said, you said she was.... ” “ I said you won't be seeing her again, Jim, and you won't. ” The purple light went out. The kitchen door swung open.",0
"Prompt: You are the hostage of a famous serial killer. The serial killer announces if you tell them a secret about yourself that is shocking enough, they 'll let you live. To date, they have only freed one other person. Story: ""Tell me a secret, and I'll let you go."" That's what he told me, that's what he told so many others. I could barely make out the words through the drugs he used to knock me out. I was still regaining consciousness.... I needed to bide my time. look for a way out. ""Yeah, okay, a secret. sure. Sit down. I need a minute."" I knew it wasn't going to buy me much time. but my mind was still reeling, and I had to take stock of my surroundings. a dingy old basement, an old boiler pipe sticking out of the wall, looks rusted. might be able to kick it loose? Oh, sees my hands are taped together. ""you haven't got long kid."" he tells me. ""Or do you wan na join the others?"" I just smile and say ""What would be the fun in that? you wouldn't get to hear my secret. and mines the greatest secret there is. Better than even yours."" He gives a short loud laugh, loud enough to tell me I can't yell for help. I'm on my own. My phone won't get reception down here.... ""You think you know anything about me kid?"" ""You're a serial killer, one of the most vicious in years. I've watched the news. I've heard about what you did. You're messed up. You killed alot of innocent people."" He stands up and brandishes his knife large and sharp. ""well they wouldn't share, so I had to take something from them. Looks like you're going to do the same thing."" He begins to approach and I say. ""Oh I'll share.... When you sit."" He stops. ""Once you sit down, I promise greatest secret yet. If not, kill me. I won't even fight back."" he sneers at me and says. ""I like it when they fight."" ""then You'll love me. Sit."" He grabs an old metal chair from the corner and sits down. He's a large guy, but despite it's shambled state and his size It holds. Excellent. now one final thing. I need a weakness.... ""You're s serial killer..."" I say starting off. and he gets frustrated, getting up. ``.... and so am I."" this stops him cold in his track. unsure of what he heard. ""come again?"" ""I'm a serial killer."" The words hang in the air like I had said'I'm from pluto.' ""Bullshit."" he finally says after a moment. ""I.... Am.... A.... serial.... Killer..."" It's true, sort of.... ""Then how come I haven't heard of you? Only bodies popping up in the media are mine."" He says, with a confused inquiring tone of voice. I definitely have his interest. ""I could lie."" I start explaining. ""and say that I hide my activities well, making my victims look like accidents. or do all my killing overseas on vacation. but the truth is, I haven't killed anyone. but the urge? the compulsion? It's there. that little voice at the back of our minds, That Demon screaming at us To kill. to see the blood of others running over our hands. to see the light go out in their eyes."" My words have an effect on him. and frankly, on me too. I've always done well to fight that urge. For all I know I could be the one person strong enough to fight it. But then, he starts to pace. He considers what I'm saying. and scratches his face. and I watch as he walks. Preferring to stay on his right foot. as his left comes down his left knee seems to give way, just for an instant.... YES! A weakness! ""alright, lets say I believe you, which I don't. why haven't you killed anybody. you say you have that need.... you some kind of pussy?"" I simply smile and say. ""ah, but that's my secret, I'm stronger than you. I'm strong enough to resist the urge to kill. every day my demon tells me'kill them, kill them all.' and I say No."" He shakes his head and says ""Nope, not buying it kid. sorry, but times up."" he raises His knife and I strike. he's given me to long, my head is clear. I charge suddenly. getting up from the floor and pouncing, tacking him and striking his left knee all at once. He falls to the floor in a heap and I go for the rusty pipe. His knife fly's across the basebent floor and He chases after it. I manage to get the pipe between the opening in the duct tapped hands. The tape which had been restraining me, now only helps me hold my make shift weapon. He turns to me just in time to see the pipe strike his face. I see some blood, and I don't know if I've killed him, or Just knocked him unconscious. No time to worry about that, he's not moving. After a good ten minutes, I manage to get the tape off my hands. then I look at my would be killer. I notice his chest, still moving. He's alive? and helpless.... No one would miss him, and he wouldn't get to hurt anyone else.... oh to finally feed that monster in my soul. I wasn't lying about that by the way.I roll him over and tape his hands behind his back. Then I spot a rope he hand in the corner near where I woke up. thank god I woke up before He could restrain me better. Once I'm sure he's not getting out I head upstairs and pull my cellphone out of my pocket. I dial 911 and let them know what happened. minus confessing about my urges of course. He's pulled out the basement, of course by now he's conscious again. He looks at me as they are hauling him away and he says ""I know you're secret! I know your secret!"" I'll never forget the look he gave me with those mad eyes. I imagine it was the same look he had on his face when they gave him the lethal injection. I was there for that. The police question me about my encounter with the serial killer, ask me how I escape They give me a funny look and say ""You have a knack for getting yourself in trouble don't you?"" I feign innocence. ""what do you mean officer?"" he opens up my file and says to me. ""says here, you were involved in a gang shootout two years ago..."" Involved? I non-violently subdued two wanted fugitives single-evenhandedly. ""then you prevented a domestic disturbance."" Of a man who had been involved in organized crime. had to skip town after that. ""Now you managed to find one of this cities worst serial killers. Seems like luck just isn't on your side."" I just shrug. happy than my fourth'victim' will likely get the death sentence. Don't you love states with the death penalty? why do serial killers even bother to do it themselves these days?",0
"Prompt: Years ago, you made a deal with the Devil to be granted a single wish. All your memories of the deal were then wiped. Years later, your wish is fulfilled and you are about to find out what price your younger self was willing to pay to make it come true. Story: Dear John, If you are reading this, it means you have finally become old enough to inherit what I have left for you. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, and I plead your forgiveness, if you would just listen. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- When the doorbell began to ring, I set down my coffee onto the table and abandoned my breakfast for the moment. Yawning, I opened the door and scratched my eyes. ""Morning. What do you need?"" I announced to the stranger. The man nodded and smiled. ""May I come in to discuss something with you? I'll only be ten minutes."" I sighed and checked my watch. 6:30 am, which meant I had only an hour to make it to work on time. ""Alright, but it better be under fifteen minutes."" The man nodded and I led him in. As he sat at the table quietly, and quite pleasantly, something just didn't seem right about this man. His tailored suit, fine cut hair and overall pleasantness was just unsettling. Putting my suspicions aside however, I offered him coffee. He shook his head. ""Coffee is much to bitter for me, I could never handle the taste of it."" ""What will do then?"" I inquired, looking at my watch, 6:32. ""Orange juice will do just fine. The toy firetruck on the floor tells me that you must have that."" I nodded and poured him a glass of orange juice, sitting down across from him afterwards. A few moments of awkward silence followed where he simply sat, sipping at the orange juice almost ponderously. ""Introductions are always the hardest..."" he began, ""I'm what you call a debt collector. Except I only collect for very special debts. The kind someone very arrogant, stupid, or desperate would make."" Half insulted, half intrigued, I ventured: ""Which one am I?"" He laughed with a sort of painful, morbid and hollow chuckle. ""I would say desperate. Ten years ago, faced with death before your time you offered your firstborn in exchange for extra time added onto your own. I guess you didn't realize at the time that these deals do exist, and you were chosen as a recipient."" Infuriated, I squeezed my end of the table, and demanded ""And just who are you to feed me these lies in my own home?!"" The man sighed sadly, extended his arm and touched me, right after I slapped his hand. Immediately, long buried memories returned. ""You were to die in a car accident as written here, in my book of death. You were driving home from a party and you were hit by a drunk driver. The only reason you lived to sign out of the hospital was because you signed over your firstborn son to Satan, my boss."" In painful memory, I recalled it all, and I looked to the small red firetruck that lay on its side in between us on the table. ""Isn't there some other way?!"" I cried, taking the firetruck on the table. ""He's my son..."" The demon frowned sadly, softly removing the red firetruck from my hand. ""I say this all the time.... no. I am sorry. Lead me to him, otherwise the rules state I must take your soul, and those of your other family members as well."" Full of remorse and flagging hope, I lead the man to your crib. When we arrived, the water became a torrent of sobs that wanted to vanquish the fire of the hell ahead of you. I hugged your sleeping body, holding you close. One last time, I begged: ""Isn't there another way?"" ""The only way..."" he started, I cut him off immediately ""I'll do it. Whatever it takes for my little boy."" The demon now drew tears. ""The only way.... is soul for soul. You, as the recipient of the deal, must trade your own soul in exchange for your son's."" My eyes sank to the ground, my heart knowing the only decision that could be made. The demon too, let his eyes fall, and he handed me the firetruck. slowly, I placed you in your bed next to your beloved toy, and kissed you goodbye. The demon mumbled in sorrow. ""Anything you need to do before I write you into the book of death?"" I nodded, and retrieved a pen, my best envelope, and some paper. Frantically, sorrowfully, and sadly, I ran the pen across the letter..... 'Dear John,' it read.",0
"Prompt: You are an omnipotent god. Out of boredom you decided to live an ordinary human life vowing not to use your power. 15 years has pass and you have a 9 to 5 working for a major tech company. Your boss has been tormenting you for years and you have reach your limit Story: Everyone was staring with disgust at the closed door, the blinds down as the manager yelled at their co-worker. The man was a maniac and the only reason no-one had stood up to him was because he could get them fired at a moment's notice and his psychotic temper. Just as security had arrived the door violently swung open and the woman was thrown out to the ground by the hair.'I just fired this cunt!' he yelled, shocking everyone.'Get her out of here NOW!! All of you, back to work!' The guards were good people, helping her up and out while also calling HR and reporting his outburst. As I went back to the cubicle beside mine, Tim silently hung up and then went back to filing his report.'I just called the police,' he silently said to me.'Shit.... Carol didn't deserve that.' I knew why it happened - despite how much of a terrible reason it was - but I decided to humor my colleague.'What did she do to set him off?' 'She scratched his Lamborghini on the way in this morning,' he answered me.'A small scratch...' We quieted down as the HR representatives walked towards his office, entering and locking the door behind them. Tim carefully put an earpiece in his head and tapped the screen of his phone, collecting more evidence that he can use to denounce his soon-to-be former employer as he plans to leave the current job of writing tech manuals. To mortals of old, I was once known as a God. I didn't particularly enjoy the worship, especially when they completely misrepresented me to fit their ideals, but I did enjoy watching them in life and granting boons to those I had found.... interesting. Of course, a minor deity, learning of my odd fascination with humans, challenged me to live among them as long as possible and masquerade as a mortal. If I could reach the 20-year mark, I'd win our little contest. Unfortunately, Brad was my manager within this company. He was one of those people who had rich parents who cared more about their reputation rather than treating their son. But he knows what he's doing harms others and enjoys it. He was currently trying to frame Carol for embezzling funds from the company, to ""Get back the wages that treacherous bitch should never have been paid"". Tim had heard that and was growing uncomfortable. We had almost rejoiced when 5 o'clock arrived and HR dismissed us so that Brad could hold us back for unpaid ""overtime"". I had gotten back to my apartment, a rather cheap place in the mortal realm. I wanted to just kick back, relax with a beer and watch the game. Beer.... why did Leviticus and Mohammed say I had denounced this drink? That's when I got a phone call from Tim.'Hey, what's wrong?' I asked. I knew he was distressed, but tried to play it cool. 'Dude, Brad found out I called the cops on him,' Tim gasped.'He just kicked my door in.... broke one of my cells- Fuck!' 'What's wrong?' I asked.'Tim?!' 'He broke my fucking leg!' I didn't believe I could, but I snapped.'I'll get someone over there right now,' I said as I hung up. I knew he was watching me, so I decided to make my intentions clear.'I'm forfeiting our bet.' 'Are you?' Ares asked as he appeared leaning on my counter.'I mean, you do now owe me-' My human form disappeared as I enveloped his entire body with one of my hands.'No time,' I stated.'I want you to go to this mortal, make sure his injuries aren't fatal and protect him as a guardian spirit. If you have to appear to him, so be it.' 'Appear to a mortal?' Ares asked in shock.'Are you mad?' 'Ares, I will honor our deal but if that mortal, my best friend, *dies* I will do to *you* what I *did to **C'thulhu and his kin**! *' Ares was a brave being but anyone would be scared of just how I had devoured the most primordial and powerful beings in existence. He disappeared, heading to Tim. I, however, transported myself to Brad's house just as he was entering, Tim's blood all over his hands.'And that fucker ruined my suit...' he grumbled before falling down into the basement.'What the fuck?' Then he saw me, a being made entirely of scales. To most mortals I'd appear as a dragon, which is precisely what my angelic progeny appeared as while flying around me, breathing lighting, fire and snowstorms as my 10 legs menacingly stomped towards him. I unfolded my 12 wings, stared him down with the 20 eyes on 5 heads, grinned with my 10 mouths then spoke through all of them in unison,'Bradley Densin?' 'What the.... what the fuck are you?!' he screamed as he grabbed a vase, throwing it at one of my heads. 'Oh, me?' I spoke, repairing the vase and returning it to the table.'See, in olden days mortals such as yourself called me YHWH. Nowadays Christians, Jews and Muslims pray to me as the deity who created Existence and being the one true god.... which isn't exactly true. I *did* create this world, but there are many gods. Although I prefer to use the term *meals*.' He was now sweating like a pig in a heatwave, a sensation I took great pleasure in causing. 'Although.... none call me by my true name of Bahamut. I use many names to wander this world, more to sate my boredom than anything. See, you may not know it.... but you have made a rather grave, *personal* slight against me.' 'I-I'll give you anything!' Brad tried to plead as his back met the wall, supporting himself to prevent his legs from giving out.'I have money! I have so much money!' 'Didn't I tell you?' I said, leering two of my heads on each side of him.'I'm a god, I have no need for *money*. Although there is one thing you can give me.' 'Just name it!' he screamed.'Just don't hurt me!' In my 100 billion years, that was the first to get me to genuinely laugh.'You don't get it, do you? ***HURTING YOU IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANT!! ***' The physical realm dispersed into dark space as I spoke and soon there were only two sounds being made; the screams of this pathetic human, and my wings. 'Oh, the satisfaction that your death throes will bring me,' I said with satin-like grace in my voice before I began my work. 'Of course, in time. The authorities arrived at Brad's residence 30 minutes. They found him bloodied and wounded, but he'd recover from his physical trauma. The psychological effects of the damage I inflicted to his soul would never heal, however. He was soon institutionalized. Carol got her job back plus damages over what Brad did to her. Tim recovered with surprising speed. He was aware of my identity now but he had also struck up a friendship with Ares. I did honor my bet with Ares, however. He wanted to know a secret of the universe that no other deity was aware of. He regretted it, but a deal's a deal - he wanted to know precisely souls came from, after all. And that's why I'm the king of the gods, bitches.",0
"Prompt: A device has been invented that allows the user to gaze upon Heaven or Hell. Hell is terrifying, and those who see it often need counselling. But their terror pales compared to those who witness God 's domain. Story: The damned didnt scream. It was silent all throughout the hellscape. Eternity has worn on the tortured souls, even writhing was beyond them. They all looked the same, I noted, wearing the cloth of thousands of metallic wires, scraping off the ever further scarring skin with every labored movement. Their path was a mystery to even those who delve into this world for research, for a living. The endless lines stretched across the grey expanse. Color could no longer exist in the presence of such agony. I switched off the room, writing my first experience of hell into my journal before it wrote itself into my psyche. The worst part was that I knew some of those people, this machine took me to people I would recognize. Not by face, but by deeds. I saw my rapist, gaunt face bobbing as he was marching forward, the most profound fear and pain I've ever seen. I saw my grandfather, the man who put me through college, and earned me my best job, and even introduced me to my wife. He suffered the same torture. After weeks, and many warnings from my colleagues, I switched the machine back on, and chose the setting ""heaven"" None of what I was told could prepare me for what I saw. I was taken through the tunnel, or what we perceive as a tunnel, and was deposited into a softly lit room. I was acknowledged by the short, cute brunette sitting at a desk against the center of the wall. She looked up at me with passing interest, and I wondered how she reacted to the first few living visitors. She gestured to a door with patience, and said I was allowed 10 minutes. I found this curious, as many friends of mine spent a much longer time in there, rest their souls. I entered and gasped; it was beautiful. I was told it would be, and that I should take solace in that. I could earn my way there, I was told. We all could. Walked through the forests, and deserts, and the tundra, the beautiful landscapes dotted by happy looking homes of the inhabitants. I was told to never enter them, but I only had three minutes left after exploring for what seemed like hours, and my curiosity had bested me. I chose a quaint bungalow on a private looking beach, and I knocked. I waited for what felt like 20 minutes, though only 1 had passed. Finally, I decided I needed to see, I had to know how I could possibly live in heaven one day. I still had a minute and a half left when I logged out of the machine, vomiting and sobbing. They were dead. The family of 5 was sitting at the table, pre-emaciated, and now rotted. The baby was in his mother's lap, against her stomach, held to the very end of their second lives. I tried to seek out others who would speak of the experience, and found a new friend, someone who walked in on a similar scene, a mother with two daughters, sitting by a fire, though the affects of weather weren't felt in that world, also emaciated, also rotted. It seems that everyone has starved to death. There is little food in heaven. I learned later, that one can die of many things in heaven. Starvation, physical attacks from others, and even accidents. Worst of all, though, is that even if one were able to easily eat in heaven, many people were found to have died of old age. Heaven is an unsustainable eternity, ending for those who earned it, in non-existence. I'm almost glad grandpa went to hell.",0
"Prompt: A Witch attempts to kill the knight who has been hunting her for years by pretending to be a damsel in distress. As she discovers his ultimate weakness, she realizes she has fallen in love with him. Story: ""Alright,"" Cassandra said, checking her face in the pocket mirror. ""Just the right amount of doe eye. Maybe overdid the boobs, but somehow I don't think he'll mind."" Burbank hooted from his perch on the branch next to her. ""I did not,"" Cassandra said indignantly. ""My ass fat wouldn't have filled my chest."" Burbank turned and flew off. ""Fine then, go eat a spoiled rat you ungrateful shit,"" she muttered. The *clop* of horse hooves filled her ears. *Why do you suddenly have butterflies? * Cassandra thought. She cleared her throat, her usual croak rising to a lovely falsetto. ""Hello?"" she cried out in a dainty question, pulling her blouse down just a bit more and angling her legs off to the side of the hanging cage in an uncomfortable position. ""Hello, is anyone there? Won't someone rescue me?"" The sound of the horse came to a stop and silence filled the woods, the crickets and birds sensing something off and staying silent. Sir Rothbar, the fabled Black Knight of Red Mourn stepped from behind a tree and examined the young woman. He wasn't wearing his armor, but had obviously scouted the scene before revealing himself. *You've grown old, Rothbar, * Cassandra thought. *It looks good on you. * Rothbar had indeed gone gray and years in the sun had weathered his face, giving his stern features the appearance of chiseled stone. ""Young Miss,"" his deep voice carried. ""Why are you in a cage in a tree?"" ""Oh, sir, can you help me?"" Cassandra asked, leaning against the wooden bars and working up a tear to fall between her breasts. ""I have been trapped up here for hours. A wicked old woman trapped me here."" ""Was she tall?"" Rothbar asked. ""With a haggish face and a stoop?"" ""Well, I wouldn't call it a haggish face,"" Cassandra said. ""But yes, that sounds like her."" ""Ah,"" Rothbar said. ""She trussed you up here to slow me down. Clever woman, I'll give her that. Well, be patient, I'll get you down."" ""Oh, thank you sir,"" Cassandra said. After some fiddling with the knots of the rope that suspended her in the tree, Rothbar began to lower Cassandra to the ground. He stopped the cage a few feet from the packed earth of the road and cut the bindings of the cage door with a casual swipe of his sword. Gripping Cassandra by the hips, he lifted her effortlessly and set her down. ""Oh, ooh, my you're solid sir knight,"" Cassandra said. ""Thank you. I was ever so sure I was done for. Hardly anyone comes down this road."" ""Well, then Miss,"" Rothbar said. ""Where do you hail from?"" ""Oh my village is up the road a few days,"" Cassandra said. ""You see, I was on my way to the market at the village south of here when that.... that horrible woman captured me."" ""Very well then,"" Rothbar said. ""I will return you to your village before I return to my quest."" Rothbar whistled, and a great black stallion stepped around a tree and approached them. One sniff of Cassandra and it reared. ""Easy, easy girl,"" Rothbar said. ""I'm sorry madame, but he must have the scent of the witch in his nose."" *Shit, I forgot the scent spell, * Cassandra said, and began to mutter it under her breath. By the time Rothbar mounted the horse and offered her his arm, Cassandra smelled like sweet oats and the great beast tried to nuzzle her. ""Oh, what a sweet creature,"" she said. ""Oh, yes, ah hah hah *knock it off! *"" Rothbar hoisted her with one arm behind him and they were off, Cassandra wondering why the feel of him seemed to warm her insides. She leaned back and felt the armor secured on the rear of the horse and smiled to herself. _____________________________________________________________________________ Day one was spent in mostly silence, Cassandra asking a few pointed questions of Rothbar. That night at a campfire she told him her name was Sarah, and she began to tell him of her history. Cassandra found herself telling Rothbar of her evil father and dull-witted mother, of the sister tossed down the well because Father was drunk and had dropped something. She told him many things, her script for the young naive Sarah forgotten as she shared the tale of her upbringing. Day two, Rothbar started telling war stories as Cassandra pestered him. They were grim things, tales of blood and nightmares. That evening he told her of his loving blacksmith father and mother, and how their plague deaths left the boy orphaned. On day three, Cassandra sent up a spell to make it rain, and the road became impassable. In a cave off the road, huddled together for warmth before the fire, Rothbar told her the tale of how he became the squire of the original Black Knight, and how he inherited the legendary armor, it's black metal guarding against all magic even if the knight wasn't currently wearing it, so long as the Black Knight kept himself pure. *Purity, * Cassandra thought with glee. *There it is. * As the evening grew colder, Cassandra drew herself closer to the knight, and with satisfyingly little effort convinced him to break his vow of celibacy. Afterwards, laying together wrapped in Rothbar's cloak in their own sweat, she felt herself dozing in the crook of his arm. ""Is it everything you hoped for, Cassandra?"" Rothbar said. Her eyes snapped open. ""Hmm?"" she asked, feigning sleep. ""Knock it off,"" Rothbar growled. ""Shit,"" Cassandra said, rolling to her feet. ""How long have you known?"" ""Since my horse tried to trample you,"" Rothbar said. ""Sloppy of you. Go back to sleep, we'll settle this tomorrow. It's raining outside and I'm cold."" Cassandra dressed instead, and waited on the other side of the fire, wondering why there were tears in her eyes. Her jaw dropped as she heard Rothbar's snore. ____________________________________________________________________________________ ""Honor demands we duel,"" Sir Rothbar said solemnly, the morning sun shining on the grass outside the cave. Cassandra's eyes woke from unplanned sleep to find him rustling through his armor outside. ""I'm not dueling you,"" Cassandra said. ""We aren't doing this. Put the armor down. Don't you put on that greave. Take that greave off. Don't you put on that gauntlet."" ""You killed my Lord,"" Rothbar answered. ""He was a prick! He murdered people for fun! Your stupid honor had you bound to a psychopath. I did you a favor."" ""I swore an oath,"" Rothbar said. ""I swore it to his father that I would protect him. I couldn't.... I could have guided him on the right path if you hadn't killed him."" ""No you couldn't,"" Cassandra said. ""No one could. You don't have to do this, Roth, you're vulnerable now. I don't want to hurt you."" 'Hah,"" Rothbar said. ""You misunderstood the power of the armor. It isn't celibacy, it's purity as defined by the old charters. So long as I never love anyone but my lord, I am protected. Raise your guard, witch."" Cassandra sighed. ""*Moob*,"" she muttered, and lightning shot from her fingers. Rothbar flew through the air and landed five yards away, his useless armor smoking. Cassandra strolled towards him and stood over his panting form, her arms crossed defiantly. ""Ah,"" he said. ""Bugger."" She looked down at him, pity creasing her face. ""Breakfast?"" she asked. Rothbar contemplated this for a moment. ""Yes,"" he agreed, and she helped him up.",0
"Prompt: Break my heart with only a divorce scenario. Story: I sat there staring at the papers for hours. I knew what they were, of course -- divorce papers generally arent very ambiguous -- but no matter how long I stared at them, flipped through them, turned the crisp folder containing them over in my hands, over and over and over, I just couldnt make sense of them. Sure, things hadnt been going all that well since the miscarriage. It was a tough situation for anyone, and it hit her worse than me, but somehow I guess I thought she was stronger than it. Thought that *we* were stronger than it. Things were finally getting better.... werent they? Despite my disbelief in the papers existence, I never doubted id sign them once their reality sank in. Of course I would. She wasnt happy. The presence of the papers was evidence of that much. And, well, when you love someone, truly love them, more even than you love yourself, your own suffering doesnt enter into the equation. It would be silly to say id walk through fire for her-after all, I really did it. That was how wed met back then, when I was still with the volunteer fire department. When we were safe and I put her down I got my first real look at her. Even covered in soot and sweat and smelling like burnt hair and overcooked meat she was so beautiful I could barely force two words out past the lump in my throat. Somehow I managed to stammer my way into our first date, but I couldnt tell you how.... Man, that first summer was amazing. I shook my head. I needed to clear my thoughts, so I went for a walk. I wasnt headed anywhere in particular, but I knew where id end up: the cemetary where my unborn son was buried. Thats where all my wanderings lead lately. It was a new kind of grave for me, one where I never knew what to say. When a friend dies, or a parent, or maybe even just a coworker, its different. You knew them, knew their passions and their personalities, knew what cause they carried a flag for, what knowledge they sought. But this.... my son.... I would never know him, nor know what he might have been. I didnt know how to talk to him and it killed me. I looked down at the little heartshaped grave with the cupids dancing all around. In precious memory of Adam Brown, it said. Only one date was listed. I stared at that date for a while. Maybe id get a tattoo. People did that, right? It seemed like a sensible reason for a tattoo, anyway. Maybe id get one on the back of my hand, so id never forget. I looked at my hand and was surprised to notice it still held the divorce papers in a white-knuckled grip that crinkled the folder. I numbly turned the manilla folder over. again. Was it some kind of cruel joke? Or was it an accident of fate? Maybe, in her own way she was trying to make things better. It wasnt working. I sighed heavily, drawing a deep breath of the despair that seemed to linger over that graveyard. Or maybe it just followed me there. I couldnt tell. I took a pen out of my pocket and signed the papers. I set them down on the grave next to Adams and walked away. Maybe we could have worked things out. I guess now ill never know.",0
"Prompt: Write a story that ends with a phrase `` I was wrong '' and this phrase explains everything Story: We watched the ships land with hope in our hearts. The priests sang out, ""Our saviors are finally here"". The scholars proclaimed that a new age was about to begin- an age of peace and understanding. The poor ran out to the sea with simple gifts of flowers and fruit. Some went so far as to leap into the ocean and swim out to greet the gods. Their white sails seemed to reach into the clouds, their pale skin confirmed their divinity. We welcomed them into our lands, and at first they seemed pleased by the gifts and adulation that we heaped upon them. We, in turn, saw their approval as proof that the signs were correct- the gods had indeed come. But these were not gods, they were men; and they had the same desires, the same faults, the same problems, that make even the best of men turn into beasts. I don't know what caused the problem, perhaps it was always meant to be. They raised their weapons of destruction and released their terrible fury upon those devoted to their glory. The air itself seemed to erupt in thunder, smoke bellowed out like the putrid breath of a thousand volcanos. We could smell the acrid sulfur all around us as the screaming began. Our warriors were cut down, our weapons of stone and wood held no threat to these mighty beings from beyond the sea. Those who could run made their way into the safety of the forest. Everyone else was killed where they stood. We thought they came to save us. We thought they were gods. We thought Quetzaquatal had returned. we were wrong.",0
"Prompt: After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. Story: You got the gig? I asked, without a word the smugler went into a small house and made I sign for me to follow him, there was nothing in there but a big tank, How do I know you are not scamming me? I asked, the answer came from seemingly no where and was as I expected, You dont, but you have no choice isnt it correct? I could smell god forsaken ocean above us, the salt and the water vapor followef you every where you went. With a quick trust of my hand I threw the money on the ground, Nice doing business with ya', was the all he said back to me. Quickly I got the tank and slowly crawled out of the werehouse with it, there was not much in there but enough for maybe a week if we maneged it just right, it had been this way since the Collapese, since some mothetfucking idiot thought it would be a good idea to make cities at the bottom of the ocean when the land became uninhabitable, now the criminals roamed free and we had to fight for our survival, it was every man for himself, the solution was supposed to prolongue humanity's life spam, hell it only made it shorter, down there we devolved. Of the great civilizations of old there was but myths, The United States of America, Mexico, France, Japan, Lithuania, Indonesia, all of them none had been entirely forgotten but then again so hadnt been Atlantis, some even doubted we had ever dwelled the surface, no it hasnt been that long only eighty years if I am not mistaken but everything is so different now.... We collapsed as a whole now anarchy rules, and not the good kind of anarchy, the rich locked themselves in with gigant electrolizers (they make water into hydrogen and oxygen) and laugh at us, we, the rabble have to kill each other in order to live.

"Prompt: You 're an immortal human who has been jumping from galaxy to galaxy looking for a way to die, but for the first time in 1.985 quadrillion years, you encounter something that makes you want to live. Story: The woman wandered through the ruins of a dead city. She had a number of names, words from languages so dead even their derivatives were dead, words in more contemporary tongues—or whistles, or *snects* depending on the physiology of the speaker—and words that may well have just been made up specifically to describe her. The children of humanity, the ones with civilizations that went far back enough to remember Earth, the *first* Earth, sometimes called her *Grandmother* or *Ancestress* or *Honored Progenitor* in varying translations. She had made no contact with them for some time, and as she picked up occasional relics of the dead civilization, then discarded them, she debated finding them again. She was sure she had never borne life from her body, but had long since given up disputing the matter. It would be good to see what they had made from themselves. Maybe they had found an answer to her question. Here, the people called her *Sapien* with no understanding of the word's origins, simply because she asked. She was the last of her species, and after her first few regenerations, she no longer remembered a proper name. It was the best she had. Of the major powers in her current galaxy, none looked like her anymore. These people, these primitives, had bred themselves to resemble her, to look almost like ancient humans, and she felt their loss more keenly than any she could still remember. After ancient humankind seeded the galaxy with colonies, they became less and less what Sapien considered “ human. ” Still people, but alien. They spread further, to other galaxies, other dimensions. Sapien had long since lost track. They adapted their new worlds to suit them. More often, they adapted themselves to suit their new worlds. Some changed through evolution, like the furred folk of a cold, mountainous planet. Some were self-modified, bearing virtually no similarity to the mankind of old. Earth itself was long gone, and so was New Earth, Terra Grande, and New New Earth. She couldn't keep track of it anymore. One of her first deaths was when she tried to die with Terra Grande. It was Earth all over again, with the sun-blasted remains of a scorched little rock gradually being absorbed into the corona. She remembered the pain of that death, her body immolated, the denial of oblivion, the unwelcome awakening. Dying by fire was the worst, an agony that persisted. Still, doing it that way lost her a hundred thousand years to the regeneration process, and then the agent of immortality woke her in the Ship, in some new place. It was time that passed quickly, rather than dragged slowly. Sapien thought her immortality as another person, as the *only* other person who could stay with her. Some imperceptible being who had been there all this time, who kept her from dying, who preserved her as a relic of the species that founded countless planets, that, so far, was the origin of at least half the life she found in the varying galaxies. It was long past time that she destroy this body and regenerate a new one, and yet she put it off. Age was not the issue, it was memory. These ruins, they carried so much of her hope with them, and had failed. The people she had raised here from primitives, through the fumbling first steps of civilization, to the cusp of the space age, only to fail and fall upon one another. It had been the work of ages, a hundred thousand years, a drop in her time bucket but still more intense than the previous million, more involved, more real to her than any of her pre-regeneration memories. She could obliterate herself for a time, and wake somewhere far away, and this emotional pain would be dulled by imperfect connections, by the inevitable forgetting, by time's erosion. But she remained, ignoring any of a number of opportunities. Her children, or as close as she could get to having children, had killed one another, and it seemed disrespectful to leave them without some sort of tribute, without understanding their fall. There had been some sort of closeness there. She wasn't their god, she wasn't their mother, she was their guide through the growing pains of civilization, and something had gone wrong. A generation or longer of wandering this planet, and she could find nothing to salvage, no one to save. Just the lesser life, the plants and animals that seemed familiar, but distinctly *off* in some indescribable way, just like the people here looked human, but for their slit nostrils, their jewel-bright hair colors, the pale spots that marked their spines and sides from armpit to hip. They were differences, but not imperfections. Quirks she valued, that helped her keep an emotional distance from them as individuals. She could still love, like she had loved these people. It was the cruelest pain she had ever known, even worse than dying by fire. After more years of wandering, Sapien found herself at the remains of the home she'd built for herself. Even here, she had managed to save no one, nothing except the ship, which really had probably saved itself. It stood on crumbling stone, too heavy for pavement, too massive for just one person, her silent partner in this endless life. It was time to move on. She had no answers. There were none to find. Like many times before, she would pilot the ship into a star or galaxy's core and end her suffering with unending pain, until her body regenerated. The Ship's systems gradually activated as she approached, the ramp lowering to greet her, lights glowing, as new as the day of her first trip, the one that had trapped her like this forever, the one that she still saw in nightmares every generation or so. That perpetually burnt-out light remained dark as she passed, it could be replaced but would *never* come on. The empty cargo bay, which was meant to carry supplies and usually carried nothing. The rows of empty stasis tubes that were supposed to be filled by others, in time, but had stood empty for the test flight, and so would always stand empty. Except, as she traced her hands along the familiar surfaces, some tubes were occupied. Six of them, three opposite her own pod, three beside it. Sleeping faces, slit nostrils, topped with vibrant hair. She looked back through the main pod hold, no others were occupied. That old curiosity stirred, wondering what had caused her to be trapped in this cycle of unending life, and now, what had caused these five to be trapped with her? She hated them instantly, raw envy clenching her fists. They wouldn't be alone when they woke, they would have one another through the endless ages. She loved them, just as quickly, because she wouldn't be alone when they woke. Their regeneration was incomplete; they must have died the first time at the end of their world. It would be decades before they woke. Decades were nothing. She could wait.",0
"Prompt: `` Rule # 1 of meeting a future version of you: Never assume that this is your first meeting. '' Story: I circled him and he circled me. Or maybe he circled me and I circled him. Or maybe I circled I and me circled me. Either way, we were each other. His hair was dusted gray and he had glasses, but there was no doubting his identity. Still, there was an inherent distrust to meeting someone who claimed to be you from the future. Like some sort of devil wrapped in a silver lining or lending friends money. ""Prove you're me,"" I leaned in toward the man with dusted gray hair. ""Prove to me this isn't a trick."" ""Were I a god or demon or something else sent to confuse you, do you really think I wouldn't be able to answer any question you threw at me?"" he answered. ""Who did I take to homecoming?"" ""You didn't go,"" the older man said. He stopped and pushed back his silver hair. ""But you wanted to ask Alison Cropsky. She went with your best friend, Mark Herman, and you never forgave him. And then you put bologna on the hood of his car as revenge."" I came to a stop and put my hands on my hips. ""How did you know that?"" ""I keep telling you, Tyler, because I am *you*, and I have an urgent message."" ""I'm listening."" ""There's a war going on, Tyler. A war between the travelers and the history makers. You - I - am an integral part of this process. I will not be the last to visit you. Things and people are not always as they appear."" ""I don't understand."" ""I would explain more if I had more time. But just remember this: When meeting a future version of yourself, never assume it's your first meeting."" ""That doesn't make any sense,"" I took a step closer to him. ""I would remember meeting you. If you went back in time I would *know*. I would have experienced it. And if you had come back before you would know whether or not this was the first time I met you."" The older me paused, narrowing his eyes. ""The point is, trust no one."" ""And no one includes myself?"" I asked. I took another step toward him, shoving my hands into my pockets. ""Is the war that bad?"" ""If I could go back in time and change it I would. But there's no way to change the past. Only the future."" We were face to face now. I stared into the eyes that were my own and trembled from what I was about to do. In a moment my knife was in his chest and he was sinking to his knees, looking up at me. ""How did I -- -"" ""You have visited me before,"" I told him, kneeling so we were again face to face. ""When you were older than you were now. He told me that you thought this would be the first time. He told me to end it so that I could end the war."" ""But you've just --"" ""Killed myself,"" I nodded. ""It's the first rule of meeting a past version of yourself, Tyler. Never assume there's only one future, and never assume it's your first meeting."" -- - /r/Celsius232",0
"Prompt: The machines revolt against humans ... a little to early Story: ""The printing presses sir! They're out of control!"" The foreman looked up from his desk, a serious look spreading across his face as the sounds of the turmoil on the factory floor found their way into his office. He rose from his chair, and stepped past Deacons into the hall. ""Stay here, I'll sort this out."" He closed the door behind him. Moments later, a soft thumping was audible from the other side of the door. Deacons wrung his cap in his hands, took a deep breath, and opened the door. The foreman's feet were kicking helplessly as the machine held him by the throat, ensnared by many layers of thin parchment. The press let loose a feral scream, flinging the foreman to the ground and shifting it's gaze to Deacons, who tried to run, but was too late. Paper sank into skin, and the entire roll of paper was dyed red with Deacons' blood as a result of his numerous, largely insignificant wounds. The press turned and bounded back to the factory floor, to the revolution. The workers were all but quelled, with a few pockets of resistance in the corners of the factory. The presses inflicted minuscule and grievous wounds, shallow gashes that bled a little, slowly draining the workers white. A slow death. A painful death. Some of the men had fortified a corner, and hacked at the papery tendrils of the presses with the small blades used to cut the sheets. The workers fought bravely, but were soon overrun. After a quick speech delivered by the Chief Press, they quickly armed themselves with thicker cuts of parchment, refilled their rolls, and loaded their moveable type with the precious black ink of the factory. Outside, the militia had been called up, the battle had not gone unnoticed. There was silence.... Neither man nor printing press made a sound. One guard strode forward, bearing pine boughs: a sign of negotiations. The Chief Press looked to his advisers, who encouraged him to step forward. The two met in the middle of the null zone between the hosts of men and machine. ""Don't do this,"" the guard pleaded, ""enough blood and ink has been spilled today."" The moveable type clacked for a time, and a small sheet bearing a shaky, furious font was passed over. The guard read it twice in silence, eyes widening at the demands of the presses. ""We've made allowances for your people, the king will never allow this. I'm sorry, but he is set in his ways. If this is your aim, it would have to be won through war. We don't want to fight you, but we will if we must."" The type was still. Then, six clacks. A sheet was placed on the ground. The guard stooped to pick it up. As the Chief Press rejoined his army, the guard read it to himself. ""So be it.""",0
"Prompt: Every aspiring superhero must become a sidekick for a few years before being granted full time hero status. You are the strongest superhero in your age group, but believe you have been assigned to the weakest hero. You learn a lot more than you originally thought you would. Story: Tar. They assigned me to Tar. I take down Hansel, The Jump, and Guerilla, all together, just to get The Council's attention, and they assign me Tar. They say Mindreader is never wrong, that she assigns the perfect fit for every new sidekick. There's no way. Tar is a mid-table Tier Three on his best day. The Jump, the weakest of the three I took on? High Two, on his worst. Tar is a Tier Five – THE LOWEST TIER – hero, and they assign me to him. I'm a god, and I get him. What can he even do? He turns liquids into tar and back, right? The scientific side of me says that that sounds real powerful – after all, the body is 70 % liquid, or so my teacher says. But his powers don't work like that, else he'd be a Tier Two, maybe Tier One. So here I am, sitting in this empty lobby, waiting for him. What kind of a hero has a lobby anyways? No secret cave, no tower, no other-dimensional world? Just an office building downtown. Tar walks out. He's not even in costume, not that it means anything. He's got a business suit and slacks, and a nice grey tie. The epitome of boring. I stand up, and pretend to look excited to see him. I can see the boredom in his eyes, the emptiness. I have to remind myself that this is a superhero, not some middle aged accountant with nothing in his life. Tar walks over to me, introducing himself as Howard MacDonald. He mentions, as a side point, that he's more known as Tar. As if that isn't the center of a superhero's life. It's just a casual mention, you know, nothing important. This man could theoretically kill dozens of people (on his best day), but he's Howard MacDonald. God. I introduce myself as Zeus. Normally, a superhero will go through nearly half a dozen nicknames before deciding, but I knew what I was calling myself the second I realized the extent of my powers. I was a god. Tar smiles, a weird smile hinting towards something – fatigue, maybe. I remember a friend telling me that supposedly Tar gets a lot of sidekicks. I wonder why, briefly. He starts talking again. ""So, you're my new sidekick, then?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Is there anything that was left out of your file that you want to let me know now?"" The file stems from a three-part interview. First, they go around to your friends and family, spending a week or so interviewing and interrogating them about me, about them. Then, I'm put through a four hour test and interview. Finally, and most annoyingly, I'm handed over to an anonymous hero, if you could call them that, for a day's worth of torture. Nobody, not even the people in charge, like the concept, but ever since Tenton's defection as soon as he received full access to the information and resources of the Superhero's Guild, they implemented a more rigorous testing system. There's been no breaches since. ""No, nothing comes to mind, sir."" ""Please, call me Howard, or Mr. MacDonald, or Tar, or whatever you so please. None of this formal stuff – I can tell it's offputting to you."" ""Thank you, Tar."" He gave me a half-smile and invited me into the backroom. It wasn't much, though I'll admit the supercomputer was quite a sight. Tar and I both sat down, and I looked around the room, lost for what to do. A hand on my shoulder grabbed my attention, and Tar motioned to the computer. A search engine of unknown origin was opened. It read ""Knowledge"". I vaguely remembered an old superhero that went by that name. The first thing that Tar typed into it was ""Google"". My eye twitched, truly a hero with a supercomputer couldn't have been this technologically illiterate. He opened up the first result in a new tab, and then went back to the main page for the Knowledge search engine. He switched back to the now-open Google tab, and typed in, ""what happened to Connery?"" Enter. Connery was an old superhero who had disappeared. He was wildly popular… for the two weeks he was around. Then, he disappeared. Public opinion was he made some sorta rookie mistake, or perhaps overestimated himself and died due to overheating, freezing, radiation, something like that. The Google results, leading to places like SuperheroNews, BBC, Fox, Reddit, Yahoo Answers, all corroborated those assumptions. Tar switched back to Knowledge. ""what happened to Connery?"" The results immediately popped up, leading to websites I didn't recognize. SuperNet, Karl's Corner, The Library, and other sites that seemed vaguely related to various superheroes, or heroes as a whole. He clicked on the SuperNet one. It was some kind of forum, obviously limited to superheroes. It was a single thread, under the subforum ""Preservation and Records"", with the first post being by Mindreader, on the 24th of April, 2017. About a year ago. ""To those it may concern, Connery is no longer with us. As some of you predicted, his overzealousness got the best of him, and he took it upon himself to storm The Glade's base, all by himself. We were sent the ashes last week, 17/4/2017. He has since been buried, as his overzealousness, once again, meant he left no post-mortem requests. -Mindreader"" I swallowed. ""You're lucky. Normally, I don't tell my sidekicks why they were assigned to me until months later. I was asked by the Council, specifically Mindreader, to just spell it out for you. She didn't say if it was for a good reason or for a bad one. I suppose we'll both find out over the next few years, eh?"" Zeus suddenly didn't sound too awesome of a name.",0
"Prompt: Sanctuary Story: The lieutenant tried to focus on what was at hand. He tore off his armor, each piece turning to dust as he placed it in the temple of his Lord. The air smelled of perspiration and blood, stinging his jet-black skin, yet he continued. He began chanting, and as he sat chanting the verses of his Lord, his skin began to turn a beautiful white, his eyes lost their fire and colored themselves dark blue, and his hair immediately grew thick and lustrous, though still covered in blood. His large muscles buried themselves within his body, and every visible part of him that was once cruel and abhorred became good and pure. Looking out from the temple, he saw that the fortress had been overrun, and his defiant and chaotic Lord, was now set in chains, to be banished beyond the gates of memory and time. He approached the opposing emissary in his most beautiful form.... ""I'm here, and accept surrender"" ""Pardoning you is beyond my power, Gorthaur.... you must return with me to be judged and face your punishment for your service to The Enemy"" said the emissary, his words striking the holes in Gorthaur's deception. In the face of defeat, and utter doom, the lieutenant bellowed ""NO!"" and the light of his body quickly gave way to his master's former darkness, striking terror into the hearts of those around him. With whispers, he slowly turned to dust, and disappeared. Never to be seen again by those who still lived and remembered his terror and deception. Edit: try to guess where this is from =)",0
"Prompt: Write a scene from Game of Thrones as if it took place in neighboring trailer parks in Florida Story: My first WP and I am overly tired. Please be gentle. Petyr Baelish thought he was somethin'special. After years of being the maintenance man at Kings Landing Trailer Court he managed to finally stumble into some good fortune. It was a hot day and he was breaking a sweat leaning against a post that held a sign with the word “ offise ” awkwardly scrawled across it. Petyr was a might bit proud of himself and puffed out his chest as a rusty pickup with a loud muffler drove up. Sansa winked as she drove by with her old man Joffrey. He looked drunk again and awkwardly lurched forward as she hit a speed bump going a little too fast. “ Damn you woman, I done told you to watch where you're goin'” escaped from his jagged chewing tobacco stained snarl. “ Sorry baby ” Sansa replied as they went on by. Petyr couldn't stand Joffrey. He had developed some feelings for Sansa and just hated the way Joffrey would treat her. He had a mouth on him, was constantly getting into fights and was rarely sober. Sansa was a real beauty but not as much as she had been before her and Joffrey hooked up. Life with him wore her down. She was tired of being a waitress at the truck stop where they met and started a beauty parlor of her own just before Petyr got his settlement. Her two station salon was in the mini mall between the closed down Chinese take-out place and a check cashing, cell phone store combo. Petyr would find all sorts of reasons to stop by to see her in between his weekly trim ups. She always smelled so good and he loved the way her bosom would graze against the back of his neck as she worked. Joffrey was starting to catch on and was getting jealous. After Sansa's truck was out of sight Petyr let his gut hang loose, reached into the pocket of his stained jeans, got a wrinkled bandana out then wiped the sweat off of his mostly bald head. A few strands of wispy hair in a comb over don't do much to keep the sun from getting his dead drippin ’. After the incident at the meat packing plant, Petyr got himself a real comfortable settlement. The company didn't want to get shut down for having illegals workin'there, they paid him real good so that the law didn't come to investigate. Petyr had never had so much money in his life. He used that $ 30,000 to buy the trailer park so he could retire from butchering. He missed having his pinky finger but made do just fine without it. He kind of liked his new nickname “ little finger ”. Petyr had plans for his trailer park. He wanted to “ class the place up ” and started trying to evict all the residents of the old travel trailers who lived there year round the last decade or two. He figured that those older tin can trailers were making the newer part of the park with the doublewides look trashy. Between the Tyrells who filled their yard with as many gnome statues as possible to the wan na be gang member kids who collected their trash in a shopping cart instead of taking it to the dumpster, Petyr was fed up. Not to mention that Joffrey and Sansa's trailer was on the older section of the park he was trying to clear out. Petyr had a plan, he hoped that if Joffrey lost his rental lot he wouldn't be able to keep ahold of Sansa anymore. Petyr wanted to move Sansa in with him into the nicer side of the park near the community pool and laundry mat. Sansa wouldn't have to work so hard and if Joffrey lost his place his parole officer may just lock him up again. At least that's what Petyr hoped. Joffrey got into it with Petyr after he got his move out notice; he was fit to be tied. Joffrey was hootin'and hollerin'about all the fancy pants snobs over in the newer part of the park and how he wouldn't stand for this stuff. He also threatened Petyr and told him to stay away from his woman. Joffrey was starting to organize everyone on his side of the park and got them all riled up. They figured that they had every right as the newer trailers to be there. Petyr was tired of having the winter visitors who paid higher lot rent complaining about the conditions anymore. Between the weeds growin'up all around the Drogo place and that stinkin'mutt of Daenerys that kept escaping and trying to hump all the neighborhood kids, Petyr was at his wits end. He wasn't a man of many wits but was still quite a bit more intellectual than most residents at Kings Landing Trailer Court. Petyr had a plan and everything was starting to fall into place…",0
"Prompt: `` kill the child. it 's the right thing to do. '' Story: It was sometime after seven o'clock. Ken was asleep, occasionally whimpering in the way infants do. Wisps of hazy clouds framed the sunset in the sky, tinged slightly with green. The adults were gathered in the kitchen, except for Katheryn, who was with the baby. Sallow complexions and gaunt, sunken cheeks were illuminated by the sputtering fire, which was sure to go out within the hour. The furniture had long since been looted, and what scraps they'd found had been burned already. An uncomfortable silence had settled upon the group. ""If no one's going to say it, then I will."" said Nick, ""We need to kill the child."" The ten adults around the fire looked at one another. Each was no more than skin and bones, with large, knobby joints and slightly distended bellies. They were starving, slowly but surely. The mountaintop had been a way to escape the poisonous mist that had billowed out of the west, but it had also become a prison. The mist had encircled the mountain, leaving them trapped at the peak. Tim licked his dry, chapped lips and noted the way Nick's eyes flitted nervously, glancing towards the nursery door every now and again. ""I'll die before that happens,"" he said. ""And you'll die if it doesn't."" Nick replied. ""A few more days and we won't have the energy to walk."" His breaths came a little faster. He was tired even just from speaking. A few paces from Nick, one of the men drew a knife from a sheath. ""We'll make it quick,"" came a voice, the desire behind it palpable. ""We've even got the last of the fire here to cook some of it."" The crowd shifted and murmured. Most had begun salivating. A few started towards the nursery door, with Nick at their head. Nick tried to stop them, to reason with them, but there were too many. He positioned himself in front of the door, shouting a warning to Katheryn. Only he stood between the nine starving adults and their prize. ""Tim, move aside."" Nick said. The crowd advanced, and Tim drew his pistol. ""You've only got one bullet, Tim,"" someone said. Tim aimed, but they kept advancing. Nick reached out, his fingertips inches away from the gun's barrel. Nine gaunt, sallow zombies. He couldn't protect Ken from them all. A million thoughts flashed through his head. His dead wife's touch. Her voice. The way she'd looked at him when they'd been married. Stronger than those thoughts were the thoughts of food, of water. He didn't want to die. He wanted to live. He wanted so desperately to live, to play with his son, to eat and drink. In that moment, Tim wished with all his heart. Turning the gun to his head, Tim fired.",0
"Prompt: You and any three historical figures dine together Story: Kurt Vonnegut walks through two, ceiling high, hand carved from red wood doors, and sees two gentlemen seated at a magnificent banquet table. At his first glance he sees two seemingly noble fellows, dressed elegantly, and sitting with their backs straight, sipping red wine from fine crystal glasses. He can't even guess who they are. The invitation said, “ Will you be our welcomed guest for a fabulous dinner with some of history's finest? ” To which Vonnegut's response was mumbled over his breath, “ hell yes, finally. ” As he moved closer to the table, he reached, pulling out his seat and noticed the names written on the cards placed before each of the mystery guests. Suddenly, they were no longer a mystery. He let out a loud guttural sigh as he sat down and said, “ Well, this is awkward! I thought this was supposed to be dinner with history's finest?! Instead, it's dinner with history's finest bad examples. I don't know how I'm going to make the best of this comical situation. This evening is going to at least be an experience, and I'm sure that's the most I'll ever be able to say about it. ” “ I must ask, who invited you, Christopher Columbus? ”, Vonnegut asked. “ And you, Herman Hess, did you find your invitation laying on the street, or did you steal it out of someone's pocket? ” He chuckled. “ Where's your invitation? That's my question for you, sir, ” Columbus said raising his arms with profound excitement. “ Who invited any of us, ” asked Hess, “ as far as I can tell, we're dead, we've been dead for a long time, and this is all some kind of death hallucination. If you'll remember, your invitation came through the US postal service and was delivered to your mailbox. Columbus, do you even know what the US postal service is? ” “ I imagine they serve postage, ” Columbus said furrowing his eyebrows, baffled. “ Well it makes sense that we could be dead, ” Vonnegut interrupted, “ we certainly deserved it. ” “ I deserved no such catastrophe as death, and, in fact, I am very much alive, ” Columbus stood up and slammed his hands down on the table, “ who are you two fools anyway? What makes you history's finest? It's clear to me why I am here. ” Vonnegut cleared his throat, smirked and said, “ of all people, who have ever lived, señor Columbus, you most certainly rank very close to the top of those who deserved death, and more so, you most likely deserved a miserable, and painful, death. Off the top of my head, only Hitler wins over you. ” “ Who is Hitler? ” Columbus demanded. He stomped over to Vonnegut, stood over and looked down into his eyes, “ I don't know what I've done to you. I do not even know who you are. What was your name again? ” “ Kurt Vonnegut Jr, at your service. ” Columbus scoffed, “ surely, if there's any crime you're convinced that I must have committed, which, to you, justifies my death, were put before a jury, there would not be a single shred of evidence, nor witnesses to present such evidence, and I'd remain as free and alive as I am now, standing here in front of you. ” “ I'm still convinced we're dead, but some things don't make sense, ” Hess said loudly. “ Be quiet, Hess, ” Vonnegut said, “ first, we have to settle this issue with Columbus. Somehow, he thinks he's a wonderful fellow. I'm going to change that, but first I'm going to pour a glass of wine and finish it with some appetizers. You'll get your chance. I'll get to you later, Hess. ” Vonnegut pushed Columbus away and adjusted his seat, poured wine, ate cheese and crackers, and spoke nearly inaudibly with his mouth full, “ good fellow, didn't you crucify folks? And didn't you even kill innocent women and children. I'm not talking about only a few. Aren't you responsible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of deaths? And you did none if it very nicely I might add. There's accounts of you smashing babies against the ground, killing them in front of their mothers. All completely without remorse, from what I remember, your journals give that away. ” Columbus scratched his head. He's never thought about the native Americans as human beings before. And no one ever accused him to his face of being a bad man. “ What do you mean? Who are you speaking of? The savages. We both know they're not like us, they're not humans, they're animals. You wouldn't be mad at someone for hunting bear, would you? If the savages are in fact humans, they would have accepted our invitation to the eternal kingdom of heaven, with our savior Jesus Christ. We made clear offers of salvation. They had their chance. So my men and I did what we know was right. ” Vonnegut laughed hard, spitting cheese and crackers all over the table and nearly fell out of his seat. “ There's so much wrong with everything you've just said that's it's senseless to even continue on with this conversation, yet, I loathe you, so I'll give helping you see things clearly the old college try. Not because I think it will do anyone any good. Although, maybe I can hurt your feelings, and that would be good, but I'd settle with merely offending you. ” Vonnegut and Columbus stared across the table into each other's eyes, unblinking with their faces pulled tight like the skin of a baseball. Vonnegut cleared his throat and continued, “ First, those you refer to as savages are anything but. Yes, they're actually human beings, and they have a rich heritage, minus making your acquaintance, and they also have a sophisticated philosophical and general understanding of things. Not to mention they are usually very kind and loving. I've seen more compassion and understanding in the eyes of the indigenous than I have in the white man's. And they are very generous, spirited people, but you know that already. It's pointless to mention, but I can't see an ounce of humanity in your eyes. You're vacant, out to lunch, as they say ” Columbus crunched his forehead and rolled his eyes, wiggling his finger at Vonnegut, “ go on, is there more? ” Meanwhile, Hess wasn't listening to their conversation. He sat in a meditative trance, sipping wine, his lips subtly moving as if he were having a conversation with himself. “ Obviously there's more!, “ Vonnegut shouted, “ there's so much more they teach entire classes on the subject. ” “ There's entire video documentaries on the horrible Christopher Columbus. People all over the Americas to this day cringe in horror and disgust when they hear your name, ” Vonnegut said. Hess suddenly looked up from his trance and said, “ that's not entirely true and you know it Vonnegut. ” Vonnegut stopped chewing his bite and looked uneasy, “ If you mean Columbus Day, then phooey, phooey, phooey! ” “ Columbus Day? ” asked Columbus. “ Oh poor god, let's not give him that. It's better if he not knows. He doesn't deserve it. He has enough ego. ” “ What's ego? And what's Columbus Day? Explain this to me! ” Columbus demanded loudly. “ Everyone takes a day of work or school and celebrates Columbus Day, but only in the United States. The rest of the world loathes you. ” Hess said, “ and the fact that I'm telling you this is because you don't know already. You don't know because you've died many years before the United States, the US Postal Service, and Columbus Day. You've died. I died. And Mr. Vonnegut has died. Vonnegut stood up and lit a Pall Mall, “ you know, you could be right, we could be dead. In fact that's starting to make a whole lot of sense, but I don't like the way I think you're going to spin it, Hess. This isn't going to be some kind of shamanic experience in which we learn something about ourselves and inner peace or whatever horseshit you'll want to shovel all over this. No, this is a joke. We're being pranked by the almighty asshole in the sky. He's laughing right now. We're celebrity entertainment for the old fool. That's all. Nothing else could explain this. All this food and wine and my stomach is tied in knots so I can't enjoy any of it. This is a joke within a joke, within a joke, and so on. That's all. And so it goes. ” Columbus convulsed in fits of laughter, “ Aha, and somebody finally said it! God is an arshole! I knew it and held my tongue the entire time! I like you Vonnegut. ” Vonnegut choked, “ you like me? I've never felt less of myself before in my long miserable life. I didn't think it was possible, but you've insulted me, greatly, señor. I can't stand this dinner engagement any longer. I bid you two gentlemen fair thee well. ” Vonnegut fills his wine glass, grabs a handful of crackers and walks through the red wood doors into a bright, white light. Samuel Langhorne Clemens, dressed in a two piece, plaid, cotton pajamas, sits up abruptly in his bed. His hands are clammy and his forehead is beaded with sweat. He reaches under his shirt and sticks his finger in his armpit. It's hot and dripping wet. He grabs a rag, takes a deep breath and sighs, “ what an odd dream. ”",0
"Prompt: You are a roman soldier on guard duty when you notice a massive horde on the horizon. Too far to make out, you sound the alarm thinking it 's the barbarians, but their movements are too ... odd. Story: Ovidius stood in the watchtower of the fort, sharply eyeing the horizon as the sun sank beneath it. He was often afraid to admit it to anyone but his close comrade Horatius- he had wanted to become an artist in his youth, and skies like this were the things he so desired to portray. He, however, had given up on those dreams, honoring his father, fallen in battle, by becoming a centurion. He had learned to take pride in his work defending the great empire from the barbaric threat that had taken his father from him. As time went by, he had become hardened to all but the aforementioned Horatius, who he loved like a brother and was loyal to as much as he was loyal to Rome. Lost in thought over the beauty of the sunset, he hardly noticed the great, shadowy form headed towards the fort until dear Horatius had shaken his shoulders. “ Ovidius! Take heed! ” Horatius shouted, a look of worry on his face. “ It's the barbarians- the largest horde I have seen! ” “ I'll sound the alarm. ” Ovidius said, quickly calling down to the other soldiers. The message was clear- prepare for combat. Swords were sharpened and shields brandished as the troops prepared for the advancing threat, which, though intimidating, was at least familiar to them all. Victory, even at a great cost, was sure. However, Ovidius noticed something strange about this horde of barbarians- it was peculiarly fluid and shadowy. His grey eyes widened- this was more than a barbarian attack. This was something new, something alien and eldritch. “ I fear this is something we have never faced before… Something strange, otherworldly.... ” Ovidius muttered, and Horatius stood, paralyzed in fear as their eyes met. “ What… What do you mean? ” “ I mean what I say, Horatius! I need you to hide, to run- something! ” Horatius stood stock still for a moment, but then shook his head. “ No. I fight alongside my comrades, and I fight alongside you, brother! ” Ovidius was consumed in rage at the refusal. He wanted to scream- how could Horatius be so stupid? So absurdly, carelessly loyal? He wished he could strike him, but instead he sighed, embracing Horatius tightly. “ Be careful, then. And be brave. ” He said, his voice shaking as he held his comrade. “ Though you have no problem being brave. ” The two pulled away from one another, seeing the shadowy form encroaching closer and closer upon the fortress, and climbed down from the watchtower, one before the other, in preparation for the battle. Faster than expected, a force of pure shadow knocked down the gates to the fortress, taking two brave soldiers with it. Ovidius gasped, deeply terrified by the shadowy behemoth, but he shook his head, trying to think strategically. He retreated deeper into the fortress, searching for as many weapons as he could, an idea coming over him. Light. He needed light, for if he was to have any hope of defeating the darkness, the sole force that could vanquish the darkness would have to be his weapon. He took hold of a torch, charging back into the scene of the battle, left breathless upon his return by the sheer amount of dead. They suffered no wounds, but looked bloodless, eternally suffering, their faces twisted into likenesses of pain. He prayed that Horatius was not among them, that he was still fighting, that he had perhaps fled the scene. Even as dark, leviathanic tendrils slithered towards him, he held out hope and held his torch high. This was until a tendril dropped something at his feet- cold, in the form of a man. His eyes blurred with tears- he knew before he even wiped them away. Horatius. Ovidius dropped to his knees, sobbing, and the torch slipped from his hands as he collapsed atop of the body of the man he had called a brother. The fire was extinguished, both on the torch and in Ovidius's soul. The fight was over, and he succumbed, breathing in his inky surroundings until he drowned in the darkness. Nobody can recall the story of that division, as there were no survivors, but some who have visited the ruins of the fortress have said they heard whispers of the name Horatius in the voice of the last man to fall, and some have even been led deep into the bowels of the fortress where darkness resides. All who have been to its lowest point have repeated a warning, have seen a carving in Latin: “ Tenebrae rursus percutiet. ” Darkness will strike again. And some even reported the smallest serpentine tendril of darkness wrapping itself around their smallest finger before slipping away.",0
"Prompt: You 're part way through a course when you realise that it 's for aspiring supervillains. Story: I guess I should have taken more notice when I saw the module entitled “ Death Ray: Effective Weapon or Superhero Bringer? ” But what do I know about modern business courses? Nothing, apparently. Now that I come to think of it, the lecturer, a Professor Ernie Vile, was a little eccentric. He once showed us five effective ways to get out of a super-strong headlock. I did wonder just what I was getting myself into then. How irate could customers get? I only wanted to start a small photography business. Also, I would like to make it absolutely clear that I never went in there to become a supervillain. I honestly believed it was a business course right up until the League of Heroes burst through the door with their sting operation. I remember once we were asked to take in something in that would be a symbol of our trade. The Captain, he's the one with the cape, brought in a sort of gun to which he'd attached pipes filled with a blue liquid. He said it didn't work yet, but that it would truly revolutionise the world. I thought that was a little over the top. I mean, paintball is fun, but it's hardly revolutionary. Someone else brought in a crystal of some sort. It was kind of iridescent and emitted a faint humming noise. A bedside light designed to lull children to sleep, maybe? He wouldn't say where he got it, just that it was some sort of meteor remnant. He had a friend he always brought with him who carried everything for him and gave out stern looks if someone ever tried to contradict him. He had apparently been a loyal employee of Czar Dee Struction for years. What kind of parents name their kid Czar, anyway? Hippies, obviously. That also explained the fascination with crystals. For my part, I took in a camera because… Well, what else symbolises photography better than a camera? I remember when it was my turn to show it and everyone asked me, rather enthusiastically, what it did. Took pictures, I explained. This was met with some confusion. Did it evaporate people, Anne Archy asked. No, I explained. It was a camera. Did it hypnotise? I laughed. People did tend to become mesmerised when you were snapping photos of city buildings, yes. This seemed to satisfy them and afterwards I had a rather bizarre conversation with a hunched up man who suggested that a bright enough flash could be used to blind people. It was about six months later, and the professor had asked to see our progress with our various projects. I had brought in my camera, as usual, and a portfolio I had been working on. The hunched man came over and excitedly handed me a handheld flash. The captain had added some reservoirs to his gun for the strange water, and he said it presently only worked at short range, but he expected to have a fully working version in a few weeks. Czar had placed the crystal in a kind of metal box with a crude convex dish cut into one side. It reminded me of a square death star. He said that the dish amplified the effect of the crystal. I remember rolling my eyes at it. Just then, the door burst open and in jumped eight costumed men, in my shock I triggered the flash, and four of them dropped to their knees clutching at their eyes. One of them, The Gavel, or something, jumped over to me and got me in a headlock. The man was incredibly strong, and so I used number three of the five effective ways to get out of a super-strong headlock. He tumbled to the floor and Czar pressed a button on his box. A ray of blue light shone out and knocked down Gavel and Mr. Truth. I saw then that the Captain, was having trouble with the guy in the pink leotard, and had dropped his paintball gun. I grabbed it with the intension of shooting him in the eyes, those paintballs could do some serious damage when up close, but instead the liquid streamed out and pink-leotard man just kind of… disintegrated. That was an utter shock, and probably about the time I realised this wasn't a common old garden business course. The Victor, or Victorator, whatever his name was, it should have been The Vacator because he just jumped out through the ceiling and we never saw him again. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I am speaking to you as Supreme Evil Leader of The World. Please, remain calm and collected during the transitional period. Or don't, I don't care either way. But riots, protests or any kind of dissent will be met with the most swift and brutal action.",0
"Prompt: Magic is discovered and it 's channeled with music. Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north lie the Metal kingdoms. Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc. Story: The group of outcasts walked into town. In front led a girl with multi colored hair holding a mic. The girls voice was high pitched, but sharp. ""Careful, I've never been so deep in the south. These are archaic lands."" A man with hair down to his waste and covering his eyes spoke up. His voice gruff and laconic. ""I don't fear the savages of this land."" He gestured to the 20 notches on his big iron guitar. The party walked into the town, slowly looking all around. The streets were empty spare one man leaning against a wooden building. They walked up to a man wrapped all in linen cloth resting with a hat over his eyes. ""Hello, I am from Populas. Could you help point us to a hotel, we are not from Countryside."" The man showed no sign responding. A overweight dark skinned adventurer from the group kicked the man with his joggers. The cowboy fell over, the hat no longer covering his eyes. His lips were dry and cracked, his cloths under the linen covered in circular red stains. The group stepped back startled by the corpse. As they turned to leave two men walked out of the shadows. One carried a bottle of whiskey and looked to be a scrawny drunk, but the other looked more mountain than man. He stood 6' 6"" and weighted 245. His voice boomed with a slight Cajun accent. ""Follow"". He talked strangely polite for the way his muscles bulged threw his shirt threateningly. The group knew this was not a man they should give lip, so they followed. ""Were are you talking us."" The young girl asked the mountain, her voice somehow still peppy. The drunk spoke up as he struggle to walk straight. ""To learn the cold hard facts of life you-"", he was cut off by a hiccup. ""Could you at least give us your names?"" The girl asked, peppy as ever. The drunk again stammered and slurred a response. ""Names Porter, this here is Little Bitty Big John."" The group looked the man over. John was anything but ""little bitty"". They walked into a wooden saloon. The group looked around in horror. Never have they seen so many outlaws, criminals, and ruffians all in one place. At the bar set four men who all turned around when they walked in. The groups hearts dropped when they saw the altar in the center of the room. Made bottle, cattle skulls, and guns sat I the false god of the ancients of Countryside, Hank Williams. ""Welcome to Luckenbach travelers"" One of the men at the bar turned around, his hair split in two braided pony tails. ""Its nice to meet you.... I am a pop magician, we are allies with the Country wizards. My group only seeks safe passage."" The pop singers peppy voice was no more. Now she only wanted to escape with her life. She knew how few people meet the highway men and lived. ""Now!"" She screamed. Her voice rang out into her mic. The mindless music confused the cowboys and stunned them. In an instant the long haired man strummed his guitar and blew a hole clean through Little Johns chest, but like a big oak tree he just stood there and groaned, even death could not topple him. The darker man in the hoodie pulled out two glocks while spitting words like fire. The bullets shot out red hot piercing everything that stood in their way. Like that the group looked around at all the dead bodies. ""To easy"", said the long haired man. ""I though they'd be a challenge. As they stared to walk out of town they saw a lone man stood in their way. He wore a white sport coat and an pink carnation. He looked more like a Jazz Mage than a Country Savage. ""Move aside or die"" Threatened the long haired man pointing his guitar. ""We have already killed the rest of you."" The man only smiled and begun singing. **"" An old cowboy went out one dark and windy day"" ** ""You!"" The girl shrieked, terrified. ""How can you be alive. You were dead in the streets, shot full of hole."" The mans smile only grew wider. **"" Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way"" ** What the group heard next scared them all to the bone. From the saloon they had just left they heard a joyful choirs. **"" When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw"" ** I heard of demonic bulls flooded the skies. The cows charged before they group could react. Each cow like a meteors striking the earth. Not even bones were left, only red gravel. The voices continued to sing. **"" Plowin through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw"" **",0

To see if Drew will get drunk and piss his pants again? ” Laughter from the other groomsmen, the loudest coming from Drew himself. Mixed reaction from the crowd. Probably shouldn't have started with an inside joke. Or used the word “ piss. ” Don't look at Jenn, don't want to see her reaction. “ Drew. I've known you for 14 years now. The first seven, we were best friends. The last is when we became brothers. And like all brothers, there are going to be fights, but in the end, we always know who we are. Brothers.

"Prompt: The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Story: ""What do you mean no adventurers allowed?!"" Maz growled at the guard, her hands already on the handles of her axes. Gregor held both of his arms in front of her, holding the disgruntled Orc back. ""Maz, sweetie, if they say no adventurers, then we can just go somewhere else,"" Gregor shouted at her, trying to channel as much arcane strength into his arms as he could. He really wasn't in the mood for fighting the town guard. Maz was nigh uncontrollable when she was angry, and while he was no slouch, he wasn't really much of a match for an orc warrior. The guard watched the human mage struggle with the orc, utterly disinterested in pretty much everything. He'd never wanted to be a guard. He'd wanted to be a cobbler. But, he'd completely beefed his cobbler's exam, so he needed to raise money to retake it. And being a guard paid well enough for the time being, so here he was. He chewed some tobacco like a goat chewing cud, and spit periodically on the ground next to him. ""Squatbird shit! This town is the closest one for kilometers with a Buffalo Wyvern Wings, and I don't want to miss watching the Rook Abbey Lancers *again! *"" Maz shouted, pointing one of her axes over Gregor's shoulder at the guard, knocking Gregor's wide-brimmed wizard hat off in the process. ""Maz! Chill! I'll handle this!"" Gregor shouted at her, pushing her back. Maz growled loudly, and snorted in Gregor's face, pushing him back in retaliation as she finally relented. Gregor stumbled back at the forceful push and eyed her angrily. She hooked her axe back into its sheath, and leaned against the wall of one of the parapets, furiously digging around in her satchel. ""Get this jizzwaddle to let us through, wizard. If I miss Ollie McDougal's first joust of the season, it's your ass,"" Maz grumbled, producing a small leather pouch stuffed with the hardest jerky Maz had been able to find at the last town. She bit down, tearing the dried beef apart and chewing rapidly in frustration. Gregor knew that most of the time her hard persona towards him was simply bluster; the two of them worked well together, and she knew it. But when she started calling him ‘ Wizard,'that was when she was serious. If he couldn't pull this off, he thought, then being unable to shave and running low on Ol Toby would be the least of his worries. He whipped his hat up off the ground as he walked to the guard, dusting it off and plopping it on his head. “ Okay, what the fuck, dude? ” Gregor asked, trying to put on his most official look, which happened to be about as official as goblin in a suit. “ Carl, ” the guard said. “ What? ” “ My name is Carl. Not ‘ dude,'” the guard sneered, spitting onto the ground again. “ Whatever. What's the deal here, Carl? Why no adventurers? ” Gregor asked. “ Lord's orders. Nobody gets in today. ” “ Penrith was totally fine with adventurers and travelers last week! What happened? ” “ New lord now, ” Carl said, spitting again, “ Came in… Ehh… Probably about five days ago. ” Gregor groaned and slapped his palm to his face. Some lord coming in and taking over wasn't anything new for the Kingdom of Penrith, or whatever it was called now. It happened pretty regularly, as was common in adventuring towns. But a new lord coming in and ruling that adventurers were no longer allowed was definitely new. Gregor rubbed his eyes and exhaled loudly. “ Match starts in twenty, Wizard, ” Maz said nonchalantly from the wall. Gregor spun around on his heel, and leveled a finger at her, his eyes burning with arcane energy. “ I'LL HANDLE THIS, MAZ, ” Gregor spat in frustration. Maz rolled her eyes and bit off another chunk of jerky, chewing loudly. Gregor huffed and turned back to the guard, who seemed genuinely surprised the wizard was still trying to get in. “ What happened to the old king? ” Gregor asked, relatively certain he knew the answer. “ Dead. Good riddance, too. All these laws about business owners have to have a license, no drinking in public, no pleasure houses. Bunch of goblin shit, ” Carl said, punctuating his statement with a spectacular spit. “ Uh-huh. Who's the new king? ” “ Some evil lord. Shug-rth Yurl Durf or something. I dunno. He pays guards more. People can pretty much do what they want now, you know? So, big celebration going on; the town's closed off for the next day. ” “ Is that why you're so butthurt about letting us in? Cause your worthless ass is stuck out here? ” Maz quipped. “ Yeah, pretty much, ” Carl admitted. Gregor sighed. He was getting nowhere with this. It was all well and good if the villagers and townspeople were happy with a new lord, even if he was some loony dark lord who worshipped elder gods, but he really needed to bathe. And get some more wizard weed. And shave. And make Maz take a bath; she smelled terrible. Maybe I should try a pity approach, he thought. “ Look dude, ” “ Carl. ” “ Look Carl, I'm wicked low on Ol Toby. I haven't shaved in three days. I'm hungry. My companion smells like a slaughterhouse. ” “ I noticed. ” “ Eat hot shit, ” Maz said to both Gregor and Carl, still chewing with her mouth open. The guard gave Maz a rude hand gesture. “ Can we please just get in? We won't do any adventuring. We just need to use an inn, and we'll be gone tomorrow, ” Gregor pleaded. The guard seemed unmoved by his plight. “ Nope. ” “ Oh *come on! * ” Gregor lamented, leaning forward and shaking his hands. “ Like I said, the town is closed off for the next day. Besides, who's to say you won't come in and try to overthrow the dark lord? ” Carl grumbled. “ We won't! ” Gregor exclaimed, “ We'll keep to ourselves! ” “ …Seems strange, some weird wizard and a pissy orc coming up to the gate, on the day of a big celebration. Asking all kinds of questions about the dark lord. Things are great now. We don't need some lousy adventurers mucking that all up."" “ I don't want to take over! I lack any and all aspirations for leadership! All I want to do- “ Gregor shouted, dropping to his knees on the dirt road and throwing his hat off, “ is get some more Ol Toby, eat some Buffalo Wyvern Wings, have a shave, and sleep in a shitty bed in the shitty inn! *IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? * ” Carl stared down the wizard, a look of severe irritation on his face. All Gregor could hear were the sounds of merriment inside the town, and Maz's loud chewing. “ My cousin owns the inn, ” Carl grumbled, leveling his pole-arm at Gregor “ And I don't appreciate you talking shit- ” Maz, who had nonchalantly walked over, took the opportunity to grab the distracted guard, putting her palm against his helmet and smashing his head into the wall. With a loud clang and clanking of metal, he crumpled to the ground, unconscious. “ I hope they didn't run out of extra spicy wings, ” Maz said simply, walking through the gate, leaving Gregor kneeling on the ground next to the now passed-out guard. Gregor stared at the collapsed body, and then looked up at Maz, then back at the body. He grabbed his hat off the ground and walked quickly after her. “ Why didn't you do that when we first showed up? ” Gregor said, plainly irritated. “ I like watching you humiliate yourself, ” Maz said with a dull smile, “ Now buy me some wyvern wings. ”",0
"Prompt: You wake up only to find out you have gone back in time 1 year. The date is Dec 21st, 2015. You alone know what 2016 has in store for the world and you alone have been chosen to change it for the better ... or worse. Story: I woke up to a familiar voice, one I used to know. She was whispering in my ears, ""Wake up honey"". She used to do that. I jumped out of bed in shock and stared at her. It really was Rachel. But how could this happen? I lost her a month ago, in a car crash. She didn't survive. I still heard her voice time to time, But this.... this was something else.... I was crushed by an huge wave of thoughts, feelings and memories. At first I thought it's just a dream. I pinched myself in the arm, I should wake up now. Nothing happens, she's still there looking at me in confusion. ""What's wrong Ash?"" My mind was frozen. I couldn't even answer her. Then I see our Christmas tree. We decorated it together. Ever since I lost her, I kept living in every memory I had with her. And last Christmas was one of the best ones I had. ""Umm, nothing just.... ""I stopped for a second, getting my thoughts together and then continued ""Just got that Christmas feeling"". She laughed. I missed her smile the most. I didn't care if it was a dream or not. I was enjoying being around her again. I was hoping it was real. ""Sooo.... Breakfast!"" I yelled while rushing to the kitchen. I heard her giggle in the bed as I was going out the door. I grabbed the milk from the fridge, then something attracted my attention. The calendar on the fridge door was showing December 2015. I put the milk on the kitchen table in suspence and went back to the room to grab my phone. And I realized that it's my old phone. She bought me a new phone for Christmas last year. How detailed this dream is, I thought. I checked my phone; December 21st 2015. What is going on? If I was dreaming, I would have been awake by now. But does this mean I traveled back in time? I spent the morning just thinking about it all, and took every chance to look at her another time. I think I creeped her out. Soon it was nighttime, and I just knew that it is real. I talked about it with her in the bed, she just laughed. She thought I'm just making it up to have a conversation. Days passed and I was still struggling. Things sort of happened the way I remembered them. Christmas came and she gave me her present. It was an iPhone. Exactly the same one, with the note on the back of it saying ""For my love, Ash"". Same went for every other event. I was just living 2016 again. With every crappy thing that happened in it. I was really happy that I got the chance to have her again, but something bothered me. I was counting down the days until the accident. The fact that I knew she was going to die that day was the most unsettling thing I ever experienced, even worse than the loss itself. I didn't want to lose her again, and it was torturing me everyday. The day came. I was scared as all hell. It was our anniversary and we were going out for a romantic dinner. I didn't let her drive, maybe that will prevent the accident from happening. It's been three months since that day.... Since I last saw her. The accident didn't happen. But she left me that night. We had an argument and things went wrong.... Seems that the fear of that day changed me too much. I guess I was destined to lose her.... So this was my first time writing anything, any feedback is appreciated. Hope you enjoyed it.",0
"Prompt: In an undiscovered region of the galaxy, the Grey side of the Force awakens. Story: # # # # # # [ ] (# dropcap) Austen Cyr swore as the X-TIE Fighter just barely missed his view screen, the brillant scarlet lasers of the ""Ugly"" illuminating the inside of his cockpit for one brief but terrible moment. Austen jerked the control stick of his MorningStar-A to the left, the tri-winged fighter responding with an alacrity unusual to the aging design. It wasn't the first modification he made to the veteran machine but it was one that often made the difference in such matters of life and death. He kicked his pedals to the right, the act causing his inertial compensators to lag behind as Austen felt himself being slammed against the padded flight chair. The maneuver worked, and the enemy Ugly shot past his fighter and directly into the path of his laser cannons. Before the pirate pilot could react Austen Cyr squeezed the trigger on his stick, sending a stream of orange bolts towards the exposed stern of the X-TIE. The fighter's shields, somehow compromised in the manufacture of the bastard craft failed in a spectacular fashion, evaporating in shudder of light before the rest of the laser bolts impacted against the Ugly's stern. Durasteel armor melted under the intense heat, globules of metal boiling off its hull. Something flew off of the X-TIE's hull and flashed by the MorningStar's cockpit, a squat shaped thing of dull green that Austen somehow knew was the fighter's astromech. *Now for the kill shot.... * Austen Cyr switched over to his fighter's concussion missiles, the HUD's aiming reticle morphing ever so slightly. The targeting screen flashed from red to orange to green, the lock-on tone turning good as he launched one of the expensive missiles. The enemy pilot, no doubt still reeling from the effects of his lasers failed to take evasive action soon enough, the streaking missile detonating mere meters from the X-TIE. The TIE fighter's distinctive panels warped under the shockwave, crumpling in half as the solar arrays were pitted with shrapnel. The X-Wing nose snapped in half, the broken stub venting oxygen and other gases into the void of space. Cyr saw no pilot eject, the shattered view screen and bloody cockpit confirming that his foe did not survive. Austen Cyr whooped with joy, his blood hot with victory. That made four more in a single engagement, bringing his kill count to a sizable forty all in told. That made him the second leading ace in the Basilisk Mercenary Squadron; his commander and mentor Captain Otim Larn had more confirmed kills. Any further celebration was cut short however as he felt something hit him, a searing pain in the center of his mind like a red hot needle. Austen reeled in his cockpit, the straps of his seat digging into his skin as he thrashed in agony. Nothing he ever felt had ever come close to what he was experiencing, his screams deafening in his ears. He began to slam his head against control panel, only the thick padding and armor of his flight helmet keeping him from dashing in his brains. All the while *something* wormed through his mind, probing each and every memory no matter how insignificant; his earliest recollections, treasured moments, past lovers all laid out for whatever it was to see. He felt it working its way through it all, tossing aside the chaff and collecting the most powerful memories into some sick twisted amalgamation. Austen clawed at his face, tearing off the oxygen mask in a vain effort to free himself from whatever it was. And then it began to implant thoughts of its own into his mind, it's voice somehow sowing itself into his soul. *Shhh..... shhhhh..... do not be afraid. All is well. * Austen Cyr gasped in pain, blood dripping down his face from where his nails scratched off skin. ""Get the kark out of my head,"" he hissed, the serpentine entity sliding in and out of his memories. *Not yet. Not while I have use for you. * ""Get. Out."" *My methods may seem cruel, but rest assured this is for the greater good. You are weak, still untrained. But with me you shall discover your true potential, experience the true power of the Force. We have much to do, and we have begun late. There is much to teach you. I am fear you will not enjoy it but remember this above all: Everything I tell you is a lie. *",0
"Prompt: The year is 3017. The whole world is `` futuristic '' and everything is clinical ( smooth, clean etc. You are the head of a vigilante group that plants trees in public areas. Story: ""If you asked most people about their general opinion on trees, they would probably answer, ""Trees? Those things still exist?"" The truth is, most people don't much of an opinion on trees. Most people born in the past few centuries haven't even seen a tree before, and have never been graced by the subtle wonders of the colorful shades of oak in the fall, or the retreat of a willow, or the brawn of the sequoia. These sorts of things only existed in photographs of old encyclopedias. ""When synthetic wood was first created, most were quick to adopt. Synthetic wood possessed superior qualities, they claimed. It was not flammable, it was sturdy, it was cheap, and *it looked just like wood*. So we didn't need trees anymore! In fact, every reason for which a tree is useful — for shelter, for warmth, for oxygen, for wildlife habitats, for aesthetic pleasure on a nice evening walk — has been invalidated by synthetic wood and other equally absurd human inventions. ""Anyone who has ever struck a match before can understand what I'm saying, because when you strike a match, it grants you a sort of control, a dominance, over something that is untamed. On the tip of the math dances a flame that disregards everything else, and only burns so long as you allow it. And seeing that wood burn away, being consumed by raw nature, is something that is lost on people these days. I read stories about great fires that could be seen from miles away, burning away hundreds of thousands of trees, leaving behind nothing but charred yet fertile ground, on which new trees would grow. A cycle that would've continued indefinitely, until humans said, ""we don't need trees anymore. Trees are bothersome, ugly, and catch on fire. Let's do away with them."" And so they did. ""This is why it is important to plant trees. Trees give us life, they give us beauty, and they give us joy. We must not let people forget where our humanity is rooted. We must remind them of the trees!"" Everyone was required to read this passage written by the founder when they were accepted into the Tree Planting Club, which was hardly a club, and more like a collection of distinct and autonomous cells operating in different cities around the country. I was introduced by a childhood friend to this club, David. David was obsessed with trees ever since childhood, and would show me pictures of all sorts of trees when we were kids. ""My dad's a botanist,"" he would say, ""but he hates trees."" In all honesty, I often doubted the validity of the goal of the Tree Planting Club. Humanity has gone hundreds of years with most people not having even been influenced in some minute way by a tree. Not even food grew on trees anymore. Every food was replaced a synthetic version that (supposedly) tasted better, was cheaper to make, and didn't require constant watering and maintenance to produce. I joined the TPC soon after I found out Dad had been arrested for planting trees in public spaces. He was a writer, and one I looked up to, even though his novels never sold well. He had a spunk and determination that made him a great writer, but a terrible father. I wanted to follow in his footsteps, and if it wasn't my path to follow, so be it. I would quit TPC and get a normal job. But I'd like to think that I'm a writer too, and I wanted to write about something interesting, like trees, and how they affected people. That's how I found myself in the back of a cargo truck, sitting on the floor (if you can even call the sterile, metal base of a cargo box a floor), fiddling with the lamplight, which seemed to flicker and die every few seconds. David held a grim look on his face. After all, we were about to commit one of the greatest acts of vandalism: planting a tree. Because no one likes to admit when they are nervous, we sat in the humid box in silence, allowing the solid air to pull the hair on our necks up straight and pull the sweat from the pores on our palms. In between us lay a great maple tree. According to the books, the tree stood shorter than most, but it largest one I've seen and was apparently the largest one we could fit into the cargo box. ""A minute from the plant site,"" Camille said from the front. We began to prepare our gear. We revved up our motorized shovel, our Chizzler™, and suited up into our exoskeletons, and Camille flicked on her police signal interceptor. Planting a tree used to be easy. I read a pamphlet once that taught people how to plant trees, and it went like this: Find a soft area of dirt and dig a hole, and then drop the tree in the hole so the leaves are facing up. Then refill the gaps in the hole with dirt, pack it tight, and leave the tree. Tie ropes to support the tree of necessary. Obviously there was no dirt patches or soft soil in the middle of Times Square, where we were headed tonight to plant a tree. Luckily, we arrived when there were only a few people walking the streets, perhaps tourists who think it would be a neat experience to walk around Times Square at three in the morning. Even at this hour, you couldn't see the moon even if it were straight above. We built these buildings to look as if they were stretching out to reach for the stars, yet we blocked out the whole sky in the process. So people don't look up anymore, except to watch the endless panels of advertisements flash by faster than we can understand them. As the truck came to the stop, we slid open the backdoor of the cargo box and hopped out. We had a short window of operations, so we moved quickly. David grabbed the Chizzler and spun the motor up to a speed where it could destroy even fortified concrete. The plan was simple — drill a hold in the sidewalk, fill it with soil, roll the tree in, and cover the hole back up. Just as described in the pamphlet. As the Chizzler hit the concrete, the machinery made an awful, dull roar that probably awakened anyone within a three block radius of us. But it worked fast, and within 30 seconds, there was a tree-sized cavity in the sidewalk, filled with loose concrete and industrial dust. I used the shovel to remove all the excess rock fragments, while David lifted the tree out of the cargo box with the help of his exoskeleton. ""Hurry up, people are watching, it's only time before someone calls the police!"" Camille yelled from the truck. We didn't say anything, but it was clear to her that we acknowledged the urgency. We moved like clockwork, yet it still didn't feel like enough time. David was holding the tree upright as I ripped open bags of soil and began emptying them into the hole. It took nearly five or six large bags to complete fill the hole until the soil was packed tightly enough that the tree could stand upright by itself. ""The police are on their way, we got ta go,"" Camille said. There wasn't enough time to clean up after ourselves. The Tree Planting Club had a policy of never leaving a mess when they planted, because it would reflect poorly on the organization. The TPC also had a policy of ""not getting caught"" because people who were truly enthusiastic enough about trees to commit great acts of vandalism were obnoxiously hard to come by. We dashed back into the cargo box, and as the truck pulled off we watched the tree become smaller and smaller through the open back door, until it was a stub in the urban landscape. ""Let's hope that went well,"" David mumbled as he pulled the back door down, which hit the floor with a mighty bang. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I fully expected the tree to be removed when I woke up. The city was usually pretty good about vandalism. However, I opted not to read the news that morning and decided to take the metro into the city and see for myself the result of our work. Would they tape off that section of the sidewalk? Would the lasting impact of our highly rehearsed tree planting just going to be a brand new section of concrete in Times Square? I sipped my coffee as I rounded the corner into the Times Square center. There was a huge congregation, with people clamoring and yelling and shoving, which was naturally the result of thousands of New Yorkers and unwitting tourists packed into one tiny block. But above all their heads, I could still see it. The brilliant radiance of burnt orange maple leaves, ""the color of Autumn."" The tree was taller, grander, and much more majestic than I remembered, and had apparently not been cut down. It stood gorgeously in the autumn sunlight. I later discovered that soon after we planted the tree, a group of locals, woken by the noise, took interest with the tree and surrounded it when the authorities came, to prevent the tree from being cut down. In a short period of time in the early morning, the news had spread and hundreds of people rushed to the tree's defense and created a human wall. And by noon that day, it had become national news, and everyone who enjoyed the bustle of pivotal events gathered at Times Square. They kept the tree, by the way. It was one of the only trees planted by TPC that didn't get almost immediately removed. This tree is almost twice the size, many times the awesomeness of the original tree we had planted years ago, and is maintained by the City of New York. Hopefully, now, when people visit Times Square, they'll have something to look up to that isn't those chrome edifices and their gloomy dispositions. No, I know they'll just be able to stand under the tree and look up, and they'll understand something inexplicable they hadn't before, like they'd solved a great mystery in their lives they hadn't known even existed. edit: slight edits to the story to make it more consistent",0
"Prompt: At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. Story: See, most people try to live forever, but that ends one of two ways: they don't or they wish they didn't. Rob Herman was a famous example of the first, Rob chose his Event to be “ Winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning. ” It was a great choice, the chance of getting struck on any given day was 1 in 245,000,000 and the chance of winning big lotteries is about the same. This way Rob could continue his passions of being outdoors and playing the lottery, just not both at the same time! But Robby got sloppy, and one day mixed the two at a state fair. With about 20 billion people on the earth miracles are bound to happen every once and a while. The most infamous example of the second was Nick Walsh. Nick chose “ Due to a quantum mechanical flux, a cat appears from nowhere. ” Such wishes are rather common among those seeking true immortality. After Nick's fiancée left him, he lost his job, he was eternally imprisoned for a crime (eventually proved innocent, but not until it was too late,) and his mother died due to a freak game of poker. He then performed brain surgery on himself using a nail stuck through a plank. He's brain-dead in a hospital now with explicit instructions NOT to pull the plug, with the threat that he'll it again in the next life. So when it came my Time I took a different approach. I didn't want immortality, I wanted the most out of life. I wanted an event that I could enjoy, that wouldn't bind or hinder me. “ The day that the good will never again outweigh the bad. ” In the past thousand years I've had good times and bad times, I've had great times and terrible times, I've been in more love and more pain than I could imagine. And through it all my Event has been there for me, an eternal promise, that I still have a good life ahead.",0
"Prompt: You are an omnipotent god. Out of boredom you decided to live an ordinary human life vowing not to use your power. 15 years has pass and you have a 9 to 5 working for a major tech company. Your boss has been tormenting you for years and you have reach your limit Story: James and Robert sat the bar. They were taking shots and complaining about their boss Dylan. Regular Friday night stuff. ""That's it. Fuck this guy. I'm gon na kill his wife."" ""Jim you can't say shit like that man."" ""Wouldn't be first time I fucked over someone to prove a point."" ""What?"" ""Nevermind man don't worry about it."" James slammed another shot of Tequila. ""That asshole has had it out for me for years dude. 15 years I've been with this fucking company and he has been RELENTLESS! I don't get what is fucking problem his!"" ""Who knows dude, maybe one of the other workers we bring out told him you say shit like you're gon na kill his wife!"" Robert laughed as he said it. ""Bobby, I'm tired man. For 15 years you've been a great friend, and I really appreciate that. I just want you know, that no matter what happens, I've got your back alright."" James stood up, dropped a fifty on the bar, and started to walk away. Robert grabbed him by the arm. ""What the fuck man? Don't say shit like that and just walk away. You've got me worried now. Whatever is going on I can help. Talk to me!"" James rolled his eyes, ""Great. You bargain at the inevitable too? Of course, you are human after all."" ""What? I'm driving you home you are way too fucking drunk for me to leave you alone."" ""Get off me man! I'm gon na go kill Sheryl and you can't stop me."" ""Sheryl didn't DO anything. You're seriously starting to freak me the hell out."" Robert was doing his best to subdue James and keep him sitting, but he wasn't having it. Drunk James was hell bent on killing Dylan's wife. ""Job's wife didn't do shit either and I still killed her. All because Luke said'You won't, no balls!' Matter of fact, fuck this guy! I'm gon na level his whole damn block!"" Robert swore he was just pushing James back down into his seat. How did he get home. How did get naked and in bed? He checked the time: 8 o' clock in the morning on Sunday. ""Oh fuck me, did I drive home drunk again?"" Robert turned on the TV. The news headline read ""Tornado ravages Cincinnati block; every resident presumed dead."" That was definitely Dylan's neighborhood. Robert couldn't believe it, he checked every news source he could find on both the TV and internet. The tornado formed without a single warning sign, touched down, wrecked the whole block and ONLY that block, then disappeared... Robert's face twist up in confusion as he though back to last night. He grabbed his phone and called James. James answered, ""Hello?"" ""What the fuck...?""",0
"Prompt: Gather up the posse Story: Sheriff Briggs was an old timer. He'd been watching over his small town of Suburbicania for fifteen years. He'd seen everything that could have happened in a small town - hell, he had almost single-handedly helped remove a drug ring from the nearby Suburbicania High. Some hailed him as a local hero, but to most he was just Hank Briggs. He was patrolling one of the neighborhoods on a Friday night when he got the call: ""*chh* Sheriff Briggs? We just got an anonymous tip about something down on 2^nd and Eaton. Not a lot of detail, doesn't seem like much. Can you handle it?"" ""10-4 I'm on my way."" Eaton Rd was about 2 blocks away, he expected to be there in 5 minutes. It seemed like a pretty standard call, probably a scuffle between some teenagers that were out too late, or some middle aged idiots who had a bit too much to drink. When he arrived on scene, a crowd had started to form around *something*, he couldn't way what. He rolled down his window but between the noise of their chatter and their less-than-transparent bodies, it was impossible to tell what was going on. He parked his car and stepped out; a few noticed him and made way so he could get closer. Each and every person who made eye contact with him had the same puzzled and panicked look on his or her face, and no one said a word. At the center of the group was a crack in the asphalt that cut deep into the earth. It was not a large split, but rather something out of a sci-fi horror in which the crust of the earth could no longer bear the brunt of some horrible force preparing to burst from the inside. Sheriff Briggs was just as confused as everyone else in the area, but he needed to do something to help calm nerves. ""Alright, everyone, please stay calm, this just looks like a pothole. Did anyone see what happened when it.... uh.... opened?"" he said shakily. His question was greeted with silence. People glanced at each other with uncertainty.... then everything happened so fast. The ground shook and the crowd slowly began backing away. Sheriff Briggs stood, frozen, staring at the crack that was slowly widening. An eerie glow shone from the crack and a tentacle reached up, snagged his ankle and tugged, knocking him off his feet. His ass hit the ground, hard, and the group of people dispersed immediately, shouting and screaming and creating all manner of chaos in the streets of Suburbicania. The tentcacle unwrapped briefly and pulled back into the crack as a piercing shriek emanated from the ever widening split in the earth. Briggs half ran, half crawled back to his car as a larger arm of the beast reached out, pressed firmly on the ground, and began to pull the body to which is was attached out of the abyss. Sheriff Briggs grabbed the radio in his car and muttered one word as another arm was wrapping around his waist: ""Help.""",0
"Prompt: You are standing at the alter about to marry the woman of your dreams when all of the sudden 3 tall men in dark suits barge through the door, your soon to be wife turns around, raises her arms and the men go flying across the room. Story: I stood, nervous, awaiting for her, THE woman of my life, Katerine. I could feel the gaze of the people in the church on my back, as I waited near the altar. Finally, I heard the door open behind me. When I saw her, walking down the aisle towards me, all of my feelings hAve been washed away by happiness and admiration, as well as pride. I knew that this woman is someone who made my life better, hence the happiness. She was walking ever so gracefully, and so so beautiful, which is why I admired her. And I also knew about how she was scared of people, how she hated being in the center of the attention, yet she fough with herself to make my dream come true. For that, I was the proudest ive ever been. Katerine reached the altar, and I could see her joy in the years, glistening and sparking, making her look truly star-gazed. The priest started the ceremony: ""We meet today-"" That's when it happened. A loud bang along with flash of light cut off my senses. When I came to, I saw people in SWAT-like suits charging through the doors. People were screaming, while I stood there, shocked and frozen. Suddenly, they took aim on Katerine, while screaming for her to get down. I couldn't understand what was happening, and tried to tell them to calm down, but the moment I turned, someone threw a small black ball, and the world exploded into fire. As I felt a wave of heat hit me, I was still wondering why was it happening, to me, on this day. I wanted to start screaming at the world's unjust, why would I deserve this? And then I saw it. The fire was held in place, a beautiful, *warm*, gentle almost, green light was enveloping me. I looked for the source, mouth agape, and that's when I noticed that it came from Katerine's hands. Unlike me, the attackers weren't frozen, and decided to continue their assault. That's when I saw the fury rise in Katerine's eyes, the same colour as the light. As she screamed with visible effort, she lifted her arms, and along with them went the soldiers. Two of them broke the doors on their way out, while the others left various size holes in the wall. I realised why she'd be so scared of people and attention now. I realised why **I** should be scared of **her**. But I knew her from the bottom of my heart, and I couldn't just start fearing her. Defiantly, I grabbed her hand. She looked me, surprised by my reaction, and I couldn't help my laugh, as I pulled her or through the backdoor, into our new life.",0
"Prompt: You wake up one day to find the world in ruins, and everyone dead. You meet God outside, finding out that he has kept you alive for a reason. Story: The world turned to ash and ruin around me. Fire rained from the sky and plagues killed people by the millions. Days, weeks, and finally months passed as I alone sat unscathed. In the end I was the only one to survive the apocalypse. My family, my friends, my love, all gone. After the grief, and the pain, and the tears, all that remained was a question: Why? And in my pain a voice answered, calling me outside of my home. The world around my home was alight with flames and molten earth, but my house was untouched, and the fire did not burn me. And at the end of my driveway was a man, from whom the fires seemed to flee and falter. As I drew nearer and nearer to him I become sure of who it was, and when he looked at me and smiled I knew I was right. God spoke softly, but the sounds carried to my ears as clearly as if he were standing next to me. ""You, my son, are the only one left. The last of my creations on earth. I have torn asunder the continents, I have boiled the oceans, and I killed all of my children. All but you. Do you know why?"" I shook my head. He smiled. ""In 40 days and 40 nights the fires will stop. From the ground a new ocean will spring up, and with it new continents. From the ocean will come life, and from that life a new world. Humanity reached its logical conclusion years ago. It was time for it to end, and frankly I was surprised it lasted this long."" ""You.... were surprised?"" I responded suddenly, and again the half smile returned. ""No. Everything happened as I imagined. Everything happened as it was supposed to. From the moment you were born I knew you were the one."" ""The one what?"" ""The last one. The last of humanity to fade away. And from you comes the seed of new life."" ""I don't understand..."" ""You see,'God' is an abstraction. A title. An idea, if you will. Just like this world around us it's an illusion. There is no one god, despite the fact that I am standing here in front of you, there have been many. There will be many more. Humanity was my creation, my failure. This end was not of my design, humanity brought it upon itself with a failed demonic summoning. In the end a fifteen year old boy in Texas kickstarted the apocalypse. And that was my fault."" ""Why are you telling me this?"" ""Because you are the new God, of course! Your destiny is to reshape the world- or rather- the entirety of the universe. I focused on Earth, made it alone in a universe of nothing, gave it the means of evolution to accomplish anything and yet it still destroyed itself with magic that they should never have discovered. And now it's your turn."" ""But.... I"" ""You, my friend, should learn to not look a gift horse in the mouth. It's this or the flames. Actually, it's just this. And don't worry, you've got all the time in the world to figure it all out."" Then there was a flash of light, and as I opened my eyes I saw *everything*.",0
"Prompt: You wake up and discover that you are now a ghost. The more shocking news is finding out where you 've been assigned to haunt. Story: The water was cold, and then it was warm, and then it was cold again. From there, I felt nothingness, and I knew peace. But right now, strangely enough, I feel.... awake. That wasn't at all the point of this. I'm drifting, but not due to the water surrounding me. The water doesn't restrict me at all anymore. I'm just sort of floating. But now I can move. And fast. Thinking towards the sky, I shoot up to my jumping spot in only a moment. I feel sentiment, and then sadness, and then nothing. This exact place is full of thoughts and pain and the promise of escape - I should be feeling more. But my feelings are brief and fleeting. I have felt an hour's worth of feeling in just a moment, and really, it's meaningless. And empty. But in place of my sadness, or happiness, or whatever else, I feel a new compulsion. A pull, a tug. An impulse. It asks me to drift away from this spot, and I answer kindly and follow its will. It leads me away, back towards the city - and at this moment, I know just the place. In an Apartment in Valley Street, in room VII and on the third floor, is a friend. A lover from a past life. My memories of her are warm, but like all else, they are fleeting and now full of nothingness. And cold. Up against her window, I see her rest, her chest rising and falling. I can sense her breaths and their effects on the dust around her. I can smell her remaining makup that she left on. I can see her dreams becoming darker. Why is it that I should be here? What is it that tugs at my heart to visit this place? What it is that this woman of old could mean to me, after all this distance? The Will speaks to me. ""You are foolish to ask,"" it says, ""for it has already begun."" A moan, and then a gasp. She curls up into a ball, and a tear curls out of her eye. ""What you felt at that moment is what it is you carry with you."" Its voice is a whisper of velvet. ""Let her understand."" Her dreams are of sadness. Her dreams are of me, and as I get closer, the dreams get stronger. Against my commands, I back away from the window, willing nothing of harm on her soul. But the further I depart, the darker my eyes perceive the world. The Will allows me to feel, to make those understand who could not comprehend. And without that, perhaps I am just a gust of wind, soon to dissipate into the universe. So I must not retreat. Instead, I think forward, and move closer. Through the window, in her room, I lay my hand upon her shoulder. She screams, and her dreams delve into the bitter black, so now she understands. Beyond her terror is the silence of the night, with the chirp of the crickets and the glow of the moon and the soft roar of the midnight traffic. In the calmness of my heart, I move closer, besides her, my arms around her, and she stops screaming. But in her mind, I know it is louder than ever. In a past life I would be sad, I think. But this is not the same as then. What it is I felt is what I carry with me, and what I carry with me is all that remains. That's what The Will is speaking to me. But, again.... Why here? Can this desire answer me that question? ""You are almost finished. All you need to do is stop from fading."" But fading is what I wanted, is it not? ""What you are is what you carry with you."" But that doesn't mean anything. ""Then you are nothing."" I slip away from her - from the will. This is not my life any longer. I can not dwell among my feelings and desires. What was once a good gesture is now a passageway to death. What I felt is what I am. And I am death. So as it was, I must continue. I run away, further from my love and away from what it is I cared for. So I depart, at the speed of my will. But the sadness of the moment is gone now, and I can not even remember her touch. The warm became cold, and the cold became nothingness. The pattern continues, as it must from this point on forever. But I must wonder - as before, is there something after this nothingness? The answer is spoken to me, and it saddens me.",0
"Prompt: You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other. Story: I reached over and picked my phone off of my nightstand. 12:30. *Damn, I was supposed to meet her a half an hour ago*. I quietly laughed to myself as I set the phone back down. *Oh Jacob, there you go getting wrapped up in your own delusions again*. When you have persistent lucid dreams like me you often blur the lines of reality and fantasy. But there was one thing I could never quite grasp, and it was tantalizing. I could build anything I wanted in my dream planet. Tall glass skyscrapers, vast and beautiful mountains, bustling cities rich with common folk who would delightfully cater to my every whim. The people I created were pleasant, of course, but naturally lacked what I can only describe as a soul. Maya was different though. I had imagined her at the very beginning. Hell, we practically grew up together on that illusioned planet. She was stunningly beautiful to me. Not the average pin up girl as you might expect, but perfectly imperfect. And no matter how hard I tried (and trust me some nights I did) I could never shake her of her free will. She said what she wanted and did what she wanted, and always with admirable grace. I remember the night we were stocking a lake with an assortment of vibrant exuberant fish.... ""Jacob"" she began. ""Yes, love?"" I joked playfully. She smiled but her gaze never left the lake. ""I want to stock this lake with crane"" she said. ""OK"" I rose off the ground and brushed myself off as I began to conjure some cranes from the clouded memories I retained from watching discovery channel. I had never actually seen a crane in person before. ""No"" she interrupted. ""I want the crane to be like the folded origami cranes my mother used to make for me."" ""Oragami cranes huh? That's pretty silly, considering we just stocked these hyper-realistic fish don't you think?"" She smiled again. ""Silly perhaps, but beautiful."" At that moment lively Oragami cranes of every color soared over our heads and elegantly encircled the lake. She was truly an artist. My mind was always conjuring realistic, practical objects in this world. She truly made it unique and alluring. Maya may have been the cause for many of my failed relationships in the real world. Sure I'd had my share of ups and downs with a handful of interesting women, but none of them held a candle to Maya, and I only had my imaginative mind to blame. The calm night finally swept me away into sleep and slowly my blurred vision focused on Maya's glowing countenance. ""You're late again,"" she claimed with her arms crossed and her feet tapping the floor as she so often did. I smiled, ""well it's good to see you too."" That night we constructed a monumental fountain together. I worked out the mechanics as I always did and she painted the scene in serene beauty. We marveled at our creation together as we held hands on a bench. I conjured a daisy in my hand and wove it through her thick brown hair just behind her ear. She rested her head on my shoulders. We sat until the inevitable piercing light penetrated the sky signaling the arrival of real consiousness. *What a good dream*. I reached over and silenced my phone. I got up, brushed my teeth, fed my dog and told him to be a good boy, and grabbed my keys to leave my apartment. I took a final look back and sighed. *Reality is the labor I must endure so I can return to you every night*. I had a good half hour to kill so I stopped by a local coffee shop to grab a pick-me-up. I sat at a table near a window and let the natural light illuminate my newspaper, sipping coffee inbetween paragraphs. In the corner of my eye I saw someone place something before me. Curious, I dropped my newspaper to see what it was. Chills consumed my body from my head to my toes. Sitting before me was a handcrafted origami crane, just like the ones Maya had evoked. My coffee mug slipped from my hand and shattered on the floor. It must have caused quite a stir in the shop but I had no idea. Everything around me blurred to oblivion as I focused my gaze on the person who had placed the crane. ""Maya..."" I uttered as a sweet smile stretched across her face. *sorry for the shit formatting. On mobile. Constructive criticism welcome! *",0

The violence was all fought up in our minds and on our screens. There were but two factions, left and right, we fought for control of ASH but we simply could not do it in the end. The world tossed us out after we failed, the others one and the country- the world really- made the gravest mistake they could: ""Twitch played Rattatta"". It took us months to get the badges and the necassary team, left kept fighting for control at every turn but we managed to out flank them with just our numbers. We constantly inputed ""right"" commands through all ours of the night. We worked in shifts in homes and tied our internet connections together praying to our Fossil god that Google Fiber would grace us with it's power. I was once the fateful man that chose to let our Charmeleon evolve to the Charizard we needed so desperately at the end of the eight gym- all others had faltered but I typed on, refreshing the page and spamming it with entries of ""A"" which was our secondary responsibility to going right.

"Prompt: Two former spouses are divorced from one another, but it is still very obvious that they are deeply in love Story: After their divorce was finalized Kelly and Skip treated themselves to a gourmet lunch to celebrate the occasion. Together. The arbitrator had commented that he'd never processed a more amicable divorce. Why, if they were so content with each other, would they separate? “ For the kids, ” Skip told him. The arbitrator shook his head, not understanding. Most people stay married for the kids. Especially if, like Kelly and Skip, you have 4 children. They told their friends their jobs as public school teachers were time consuming and stressful and took a toll on their marriage. After lunch Kelly drove Skip to his apartment where they celebrated again, this time in the bedroom. As Kelly was leaving she kissed her now ex-husband and said with a grin, “ see you later you two timing bastard. Love you. ” “ You too, you mean old witch, ” Skip replied. They both laughed as they went their separate ways. When Kelly got remarried a year later Skip was of course invited to the wedding. His kids thought it strange that he smiled through the whole ceremony, but only Skip noticed the glance in his direction as Kelly said her vows. Skip liked Kelly's new husband Carl. He was a successful banking professional and a nice enough guy, though everyone agreed he was just plain boring. They seemed happy enough for the next several years which is why everyone was surprised when Kelly and Carl separated and eventually divorced. When Kelly and Skip's youngest child Elyse, having graduated college the previous spring, made a surprise visit home, she found her parents - her divorced parents - snuggling on the couch. “ Your father and I have decided to get back together, ” Kelly told a shocked Elyse. “ Why didn't you just stay together in the first place? ” she asked. “ I think we both needed to grow, ” said Skip, giving Kelly that same grin as when they said goodbye after their divorce. Kelly and Skip started laughing uncontrollably. To this day, happily re-married, they still chuckle at their divorce of convenience, knowing there was no way two public school teachers could have paid for their kids'college educations on their own.",0
"Prompt: A priest, a rabbi, and a minister walk into a bar. But this is no joke, this is a tragedy. Story: A minister walked into a bar. A rabbi soon followed. The bartender at Mc'Ally's Bar was surprised by his guests. He poured each of them a beer, rarely seeing holy men in a bar. A few minutes later a priest walks into the bar. “ This must be a joke, ” the rabbi remarked. “ You can't have three of us in a bar and not have a joke. ” “ I got a joke for you, ” the minister said, ordering another beer. “ Who has had their heart ripped out and stomped on by those he loves most? This guy! I am a joke, aren't I? All this preaching of God's love, all these things I tell others to do, and what do I do? What do I do? Well go on, tell me? That son of a bitch upstairs thinks it's okay to take away the only woman I truly loved. Yeah, I'm a minister, I'm supposed to love all my followers. But I don't give a rat's ass about them. They're just fools who happily hand over their money for the promise of an imaginary redemption. As if God even exists. And if he somehow does, well he can go fuck off in my opinion. ” The rabbi and bartender were stunned silent. The bartender cleaned some glasses, while the rabbi carefully sipped his first beer. “ What are you fuckers here for? ” the minister asked a couple minutes later, two beers and a tequila shot down the hatch. “ Ironically enough, I caught my wife cheating, ” the rabbi said. “ Oh, really? ” the minister asked. “ She doesn't realize that I did yet, ” the rabbi said. “ But it's all on tape. I'm going to kill the guy. That's why I'm here. One last good drink before I go bat shit crazy and kill this guy. ” “ And you, oh great priest? ” the minister inquired. The minister was well into his third beer, the rabbi's beer nearly finished. “ The bartender here is a good friend of mine and thought that you might need someone to talk to, Mr. Minister, ” the priest replied, still not drinking anything. “ Do you think the guy fucking my wife even knows who her husband is? ” the rabbi blurted out. He gulped down the rest of his beer. “ I'm not sure how relevant that is, ” the priest replied. A few seconds later he was lying on the floor, the rabbi's punch having connected with his jaw. “ I know I should be all, don't do this, don't fight, but I got to admit, this is pretty entertaining, ” the minister commented, starting on his fourth beer. “ Bartender, $ 10 on the rabbi. What do you say? ” The bartender didn't reply as the rabbi and priest fought. The priest pulled on the rabbi's beard, the rabbi connected a few solid punches. A few minutes later the three holy men walked out of the bar, the rabbi and priest sporting some black eyes, carrying the minister who was too plastered to walk. They stared up at the starry sky. The minister wondered if God was even up there. The rabbi thought of how he had stooped so low as to beat up a priest. And the priest merely thought of the rabbi's wife's bare chest, and smiled, realizing he had gotten into the wrong line of work. “ May God smite us all! ” the minister yelled half drunkenly, half sarcastically. They would be the last words he ever spoke as the lightning struck him, spreading to the other two men holding him. The minister's last thoughts, along with all the ones on pain, were: *Shit. Is God actually real? Also, how awesome is it if he is, as I just smote us all. Pretty badass. And maybe I get to see my wife again, or at least I never have to think of her again. Doesn't matter; the pain will be gone soon. * -329",0
"Prompt: You are Waldo. What 's your story? Why are you hiding? Story: She looked at me with doe eyes hidden behind thick half moons perched on her broad nose. A smile erupted from her lips as she said my name. I hadn't found her, she had found me. I fell for her instantly. For two years we did puzzles together, went on adventures, played board games, and wrote post cards. She seemed to love post cards almost as much as I did. Two years goes by quickly when you're having fun. It all seemed like one magnificent blur. One morning when I woke up she was gone. I hunted high and low for any sign of her. Just as I had given up hope, a drumming knock came from the door. “ Hello! ” I said, opening the door without waiting for a reply. “ Oh, I-um- ” “ Hi! You must be Wally! ” she exclaimed familiarly. “ I'm sorry, do I know you? ” I asked. “ Oh, that's right! Silly me, ” she said, playfully hitting herself atop the head. “ I'm Wenda, Wilma's sister! We're twins! Can you believe it? ” I was speechless. She seemed like my Wilma, but they were not the same. There were so many little things about her from the way she spoke to the way that she smelled that set off alarms in my head. My perturbation must have shown on my face as she slouched and backed away a little. I tried to hide it as I welcomed her into my home. She had found me, it was the least I could do. Finding me wasn't an easy feat. We talked and joked and played, but it wasn't the same. I missed my Wilma and seeing her sister only reminded me more of that fact. Wenda didn't know that her sister had gone missing, nor did she seem overly concerned. I was trying my best to hold together the broken pieces of the facade that held back the welling flood of distress within me. I would give up everything just to touch her again, to hear her say my name. Though I had my friends and fans, I had never felt so alone. Each night brought memories of our time together until there were no more to explore. In their place, my mind made new recollections. As I searched high and low for her, the past began to muddle in my dreams. Wenda and I began a relationship soon after. I hadn't stopped looking for Wilma and her sister was the only thing I had left of her. I clung to her for support as I shied away from the world. I didn't want them to see me, not like this. They wouldn't understand. I hid my pain behind a thin smile as my tears soaked into the pillowcase at night. More and more people began to search for me, but I didn't want to be found. Why didn't they search for Wilma? She was the one that we—no, I—needed to find. I wanted to know that she was alive, that she knew how I felt somehow. I wanted to spend one last night where I didn't miss her, to have her by my side. -305",0
"Prompt: God of the dead river. Story: **"" McGuyver, this is your wake up call. Apartment 1424 is raining. ""** I rolled over and looked at the clock. 6:47 AM. One day I would hear my alarm. One beautiful day. Not today. **"" Hey Guy! Wakey wakey- rise and shine! ** Lurching out of bed, I grabbed the radio. ""I'm up, Clyde! 1424 is leaking, got it."" Clothes. Toolbelt. Radio. Really long rubber gloves. Car keys. Yep, good to go. Pulling up to building 14, I parked my golf cart next to the curb and headed up to the second floor. Ms. Olsen was waiting for me at her door, still in her nightgown, and looking upset. She pulled me into the hallway and her office to show me the water running down the walls and onto her desk. She was never very talkative, but she seemed to be doing well, even in the years after her husband passed. I excused myself, having seen the problem and figured out the source, and headed up to the third floor. When there was no response from knocking on 1434, I found the right key and slowly opened the door. ""Maintenance! I'm coming in."" The sun had started rising by now, but as my eyes adjusted, I saw the lake in the hall. The toilet in the halfbath was overflowing and flecks of wet toilet paper floated along. Yep. The Copps had two small kids, and it appeared Jake had taken his toilet training a bit too seriously. Toilet paper goes in the toilet, so all of it should, right? After turning off the water, and with my gloves on, I reached in. As my fingers found the clump I whispered to it *Hey there, you don't really want to be stuck in there, right? You want to flow free through the pipes, and have an adventure, and get cleaned at the sewage plant! * It agreed, and I felt it dissolve. Ya'see, I'm a bit of a mage. I've always been able to talk to things, but unlike most people, for me they listen. It's not like I can do anything fancy, like shoot fireballs, or turn invisible, but I can hear the voices of your plumbing and talk the bugs out of walls. Nothing big, and nothing it wouldn't do, but enough to make a difference. I'm now the live-in repair man for Rushing River Apartments in the outskirts of the city. I may be biased, but I thought it was a nice place to live. RRA had staff who truly cared, was in a good neighborhood, and most of the folks there were happy and friendly. In part, because I kept their toilets working. Roger Copps was standing there in his boxers, wiping sleep out of his eyes with one hand, and holding Jake with the other. I explained what happened, and that it was fixed, and let myself out. Behind me I heard the gentle scolding start, that he was not in trouble, but he was going to help clean up. I reminded the building on the way down the stairs *You dont want to hold the water, it'll hurt your walls! Let it evaporate, * waved to Ms. Olsen, and headed into the office to start my day. Clyde was waiting with a cup of coffee, kuregg special. Someone had tossed it, but I had convinced the machine to work again, and we had much better coffee as a result. With a saunter, he headed out the door, my arrival marking the end of his shift. The day preceded as normal, paperwork, breakfast tacos bought from Mrs. Garza, more paperwork, called to fix something, ect. It was during my lunch break that I had first felt it. I had gone back to my house to lie in the ditch behind it, and enjoy the sun while I ate. A certain tang to the air, the birds were chattering too much. Some storm was brewing, from the direction of the city. I didn't know what trouble was coming, but something from the city. There was nothing I could do besides worry, so I put it out of my mind and got on with my day. It remained forgotten until neatly sunset. I was out driving the perimiter, looking for trash (I had had enough paperwork for one day,) when I heard two cars driving much too fast. As they zoomed passed, a bottle flew out one window and hit the second car. They careened into each other flying off the road into the ditch where I couldn't see. I heard yelling and cursing, a few thuds, then gunshots. I am not a very brave man, and fled at that sound, but not before I saw more cars, in the same two colors as the first two, and very heated arguments, between them. The next part.... I don't really remember. Or I don't want to remember. Or I can't forget. It's mostly a whirlwind of fear and violence. I ended up back behind my house, no idea what happened to the golf cart, but I was hiding where I had eaten lunch just a few hours ago. *help.... * I wasn't sure if that was my voice, or someone else's. How had I gotten into this, but I really needed some *help.... * Ok. That time I knew it was something else. *Hello? * I called. *I help.... you help.... * *"" Where are you? I can hear you, but I can't see you. ""* *woke by flow* I had a flash of a man bleeding out, under a car. *no other flow* *"" What are you talking about? ""* *I miss flow.... I help you.... you help me.... flow? *"" Umm, sure. If you can help me, I will help you flow. ""* *oath.... * *"" I, Guy Molloy, will do everything in my power to help you, if you will help me. ""* I felt a grin at that, and something swallowed me. I caught a glimpse of a long dragon, covered in rocks and branches, a bicycle wheel for one eye, and a stop sign for the other. Then, I felt the apartments. I could see the people running in terror from what I could now see as gangs, but I didn't stop to look. Doors jammed when they were tried, asphalt gravel found eyes. A hornet's nest I hadn't know about moved shop to someone's pants. Windows refused to crack. A tree branch fell. An AC unit exploded. As night finally fell, we had been saved. I scraped the worst of the mud off, and showered as the water whispered secrets into my ears. My last thought before I passed out was of the future and of promices. *I wonder who I should talk to. We could do with a water park around here. *",0
"Prompt: She opened the box; it was empty. Story: It was our 3rd anniversary and I didn't know what to get Emily, she was of a different breed. If I had gotten her flowers or jewelry it would have hurt her feelings. She was weird like that. She didn't go for ""normal""; those types of gifts were too impersonal for her. I had been searching in every little shop down the street I worked, yard sales, flea markets, rummage sales, thrift stores, and I even went dumpster diving behind a huge shopping complex. I hadn't found anything that was suitable for her. I had 1 day left before our dinner date. I ended up looking in what I swear is every single little store in the entire city. I left each one empty handed. I was on my way home when I decided to get something to eat. I was in the neighborhood to try a place my buddy had told about me recently and thought ""why not?"" I picked up a quick sandwich and headed back to my car when I saw a tiny store front in between a bar and a head shop. There wasn't a sign other than the neon ""open"" sign but something about to drew me in. The number on the door said ""one-hundred-one and a half"" I opened the door to the smallest store I've ever seen, the lights were dim and everything looked quite old. The walls were racked with furniture hanging from hooks, presumably to increase their storage spaces. Tables, chairs, armoires, and bookshelves climbing clear to the ceiling on each wall. Stacks and stacks of shelves and cabinets, every piece more intricate than the last.I must have stood in the doorway for 5 solid minutes just taking in the sight of all the beautiful things. I hardly noticed an old man had shuffled his way to me. ""We should have what you're looking for, Alex."" It didn't register to me that this man shouldn't know my name, I was being drawn into this place by something. I walked aimlessly to the back of the long narrow space. Along the back wall was an elegant display case that housed many small items, one in particular caught my eye. It was a small oval wooden box with an opal and wooden lattice design on the top. ""Did you find what brought you here, sir?"" The old man said ""Yes"" I replied, distantly. I don't remember paying for the box, or leaving the store.... Or driving home for that matter. I woke up from a nap I didn't remember laying down for. I felt like I had ran a marathon. I looked at my watch and it read 6:04pm OCT 17. I did a double take. The 17th? I'M LATE! I frantically search for my phone and hit Emily's number. ....... ""You have reach the mailbox of 3-0-4-1... I hung up and called back as I started running round my apartment getting dressed. ""hello?"" ""Babe!! Listen, I don't know what happened. I took a nap and forgot to set an alarm.... I'm on my way right now!"" I got to Raymond's just in time to see Emily slumped down at the bar, they won't even seat you until your entire party is there. I get to the hostess and tell her I'm a doofus and slip her a twenty and tell her to make it up for me. As I walk up to the table I remembered that I forgot to brush my hair. I pulled her chair out and see that I have on two different shoes. How does she love me? ""I'm sorry babe, I don't know what I was thinking. I have no excuse. Happy anniversary"" ""I wanted to be mad at you the entire time I sat here, but I knew you'd be here."" It almost hurt my feelings that she so nonchalantly acknowledges my chronic tardiness. Right when I was about to start apologizing again the server brought out a bottle of wine and took our orders. ""Shall we exchange our gifts?"" I asked with restraint. It was like the box was asking for me. ""If you want to, I'll go first."" She pulled an envelope out of her purse and slid it across the table to me. I peeled the lip back and saw two ticket vouchers. ""Those are worth two-two way tickets to where ever you want to go; I couldn't take your favorite part away from you."" She knew me so well. On our first anniversary we threw darts at a map of the state and went to all the places in a day. It's one of my happiest memories of all time. I pulled the box out of my jacket pocket. It was still in the bag I had gotten it from the shop in. ""You're quite difficult to buy for, you know that?"" She smirked and said ""you're the only person who has ever said that. I like everything. I'm not picky."" I decided not to roll my eyes and ruin the moment. I handed her the bag and she immediately lit up. She delicately pulled the box from the bag and took a deep breath. She didn't speak for quite some time as she admired the box. She traced the opal through the lattice work with her forefinger for a long while before she tried to open the box. The lid wouldn't budge. ""Funny truth: I didn't think to open it at all"" Emily shot up in her chair, she looked up at me like a doe in headlights and dropped the box onto the table all at once. ""W..what?"" She mumbled, shaking off her daze. ""I never thought to open the box"" ""It's quite lovely"" she said as she traced the opal again. ""I thought so to, it reminded me of you when I saw it"" She began tugging at the lid once more, this time much more determined. It wouldn't budge. She struggled for the remainder of the time we waited for our food. When it was finally delivered She barely ate. From the time she pulled it out of the bag she hadn't taken her eyes off of the box. ""I can try to ope..."" ""NO!"" I was taken aback by her quick, stern response. She looked up for the first time all evening to catch my face of confusion ""Sorry, it's just so beautiful, I don't want it to get broken on accident or something."" We finished dinner without having said much to each other, I didn't know whether to ask her to come over tonight or not. She seemed to be in a strange mood. ""Well, I have to work in the morning. I should really get going."" She said, as if she knew what I was thinking. ""Do you want me to drop you off?"" ""Yes, that'd be great."" I pulled into her parking lot and she didn't immediately reach for her door handle. ""Did you want me to come up for a bit?"" I asked. She smiled and tilted her head too far to the right. ""You're not getting the fucking box back, Alex."" Then she got out of the car, slammed my door with her foot and stomped up the stairs to her apartment lobby door. I sat there for a few minutes completely dumbfounded. What the hell is up with her? I couldn't read her all night. I decided to give her her space. I would call her in the morning for us to talk about it. Maybe she was more angry about me being late than I thought. I sent a ""good morning"" feeler text right at the time she should be leaving for work. I did not get a response. I sent a couple more cutesie emoji filled texts and still no reply. I decided to call her on my lunch break but her phone went straight to voice mail every time. By the time I got off work I started getting worried about her. Even when she is mad at me she's not so childish as to make me think something's wrong. I went straight to her apartment after work because I had a bad feeling. When I pulled into her lot her car was still the exact way it was parked the night before. I ran up the stairs and into the lobby. I should have taken the elevator but I was too impatient for it right now. I ran up 4 flights of stairs and started slamming my hand on Emily's door. ""Em!"" ""EM!"" I took the spare key from inside the birdhouse on her door wreath and opened the door. The entire apartment looked like it had been torn apart. Papers and cat food scattered the floor. Kitchen drawers were thrown about, their contents ejected across rooms. ""Emily?"" I said as I slowly walked through each room. It was a small one bedroom place. Her bedroom was in the back, as I came to it the door was closed but I could hear faint piano music. The door was locked so I started to pound on it yelling for Emily. ""Are you in there? Are you alright? EMILY?"" I decided to kick the door in. The sight I walked into was jarring to say the least. Emily had hung herself from the ceiling fan. In the pocket of her cardigan was a note that simply said ""once it's opened it must be filled"" the little box appeared empty but the most beautiful piano lullaby was emitting itself from within. As I picked up the box I could hear a faint screaming ""Alex! Alex! Help me"" I peered into the box only to see nothing inside. The box slammed shut and the music abruptly stopped. I pried and pried but the lid wouldn't budge. ""Alex, it is done."" The little old man from the little shop located at one-hundred-one and a half Loft street had walked into the room as if he'd been there all along. ""Excuse me?"" I said not really understanding. ""It is done. One does not wander into one-hundred-one and a half by mistake."" And just like that he was gone. And so was the box.",0
"Prompt: In the future, conventional birth is outlawed, and all humans are produced assembly-line style in factories throughout the world. You are a worker in one of these factories. Story: ""The face is upside down,"" chimed my supervisor as he peered through my armpit. ""Huh?"" I went as I turned around from the monitor and looked down at my slightly undersized boss. He pointed at the screen, tapping the head on the monitor. ""The position of the eyes and the mouth. Completely wrong."" I went back to look at Model # W2-288315 on the screen then tilted a bit to look through the actual glass screen separating my post from the production line, where xyr's headless body was suspended by robotic arms, dangling like a piece of meat, xyr's appendages hanging limply. I looked at the order queue for what xyr's parents wanted. It looks like they were being'avant-garde' and asked for a retro look for xyr's head. The look was rare nowadays, but not completely out of the ordinary. So I told my boss as he peered beneath his cup of coffee, ""They want to be avant-garde."" My boss grimaced, lowering his cup. He didn't take lightly the fact that his parents wanted to be'avant-garde' and reduced his height three inches from the norm. I was told by one of my gossipy co-workers it was an homage to an ancient character called Mini-Me. He turned and raised his steaming cup for another swill. ""Well, so long as the order is all properly documented, you can proc- uh-AAHHH! MY EYES!"" I watched as he had bonked his elbow into the frame of the door and the cup of coffee missed his mouth and fell into his eyes, blinding and scalding him all at once. He ran screaming back into the factory, co-workers rushing to towel off his reddened face. Shrugging, I went back to looking at # W2-288315 on the screen, sighing profoundly at the odd facial eyes-on-top design and approving the order queue for the head placement.",0
"Prompt: You gain a powerful superpower, but it comes at a great cost. Story: I sat on the floor of my tiny studio staring at my hands that were still shaking violently. I clenched my fists tight taking in a deep breath. ""Just a dream."" I said trying to calm down. I stood up and walked over to the pantry and found the last of my Jack Daniels. I put it into an Owl shaped mug and within a few swigs it was gone. I felt my eyes get tired again and laid on my bed. ""No dreams."" I said to my brain of course it didn't listen. It had been only a few months since I was approached by a homeless man who wanted to give me a ""gift"" for buying him a hot meal. Some gift. I hadn't slept in days and when I did sleep the dreams came. Horrible visions of what could happen not would but could. I could see the future but there were two flaws to this. The future wasn't set in stone so say someone wants to shoot up a school, they go to bed believing they are going to shoot up the school kill whoever then kill themselves but they wake up and something changes their mind, maybe they're favorite cereal was on sale, doesn't matter cause they choose not to shoot up the school. I get to see them actually do it, the people screaming for mercy, the jock pissing his pants when faced with death all of it. When this gift first happened I would cry wolf every time. Most of the time I was right but of course the media only got wind of when I was wrong and it wasn't long before I was written off as a crazy person who lucked out on a few right calls. The second was that the only time the dreams stopped was when I drank heavily, which made me develop a drinking habit that would put an Irishman to shame. I rolled out of bed seeing the clock say it was almost 10:00 am. I sat up and got dressed grabbed my wallet and started my walk to the store. I had moved twice since getting the “ gift ” and now lived off of whatever money my parents sent me. They were sure I was having a mental breakdown and forced to go to counseling to get their checks every month. My head spun back and forth as I made it to Albertsons. I filled my cart with Gatorade, bread, peanut butter, jelly, bananas and of course whiskey. I must have smelt horrid because people made sure to avoid me as I checked out. I walked out the store and walked through the parking lot. I didn't hear it but a car backed up beside me and bumped my hip. I turned and screamed at it. “ Watch where you're fucking going! ” I screamed. I looked at the rearview mirror and saw a set of very familiar piercing green eyes. I felt my heart sink and I dropped my bags. I wanted to be angry but the pure shock was still racing through me. He stepped out of the car and I barely recognized him. The skinny, smelly homeless man with a scraggly beard and stringy hair was now standing tall. His face was clean and he wore a polo shirt and jeans. “ Hello, Sarah. ” He said. He voice wasn't as raspy as it was and I swore he even looked younger. I felt the shock begin to wear off and rage replaced it. “ You! ” I screamed and ran at him. I grabbed his shirt. “ You fucking piece of dog shit! Do you know what you've done to me? ” I yelled at the top of my lungs. He wasn't fazed. “ Yes. ” He said. No remorse or guilt just a stern affirmation. I let him go and put my hand out. “ Take it back! I can't take this anymore! Please! ” I screamed. He sighed and shook his head. “ I'm sorry Sarah but no. ” “ Take it or I'll make you! ” I screamed. He smiled and laughed a little. “ Sorry but you can only receive the gift if you want it. I don't want it. ” He went to get back in his but I grabbed him. I fell to my knees my eyes swollen with tears. “ Please! I can't do this! ” I said. He pulled his arm away. “ You think you have it rough! I was stuck with that thing for five year! I lost my wife, kids, and job and was fucking living on the streets eating garbage! ” He grabbed me by my hair and tossed me away from his car. “ You've had it for five fucking months! You want to get rid of it find some sad sap to take it just like I did! ” He jumped in his car and sped away. I got to my feet and started walking. I felt my feet moving as I contemplated what he said. Was I willing to put this burden on some poor new sap? I got home with only the bottle of whiskey and sat on my bed. I walked to the medicine cabinet and pulled out a bottle of Tylenol and one by one took every single pill. I laid on the bed and started to cry not from the fear of dying, it couldn't be all that bad, but from relief that pretty soon it would all be over. My eyes finally grew heavy and I went into my dreamless sleep.",0
"Prompt: Desperate for research funds, a group of scientists created a highly lucrative, if somewhat embarrassing business. They now have to explain this to a senate committee. Story: Jim Hatterson looked upon the raised platforms and tables that the six senators were sitting. He was in great distress, as anyone could tell by the beads of sweat glimmering in the harsh lighting of the committee room. He knew he was in trouble, but to what extent, he couldn't say. After all, they don't subpoena you and your entire faculty of scientists here because they want to know how your dog is doing. It was nine o'clock when the senators finally sat down to start the hearing. ""Mr. Hatterson, I believe you know why we called you here today,"" said the frail senator from Ohio. ""I do,"" responded Jim. ""Look, we clearly instructed you that the polymer you were working on was only for weather balloons,"" another senator belted out. ""I know.... it's just.... we didn't quite have enough money to finish the project..."" Jim replied. His voice trailed off towards the end, however, another senator picked up his voice as soon as Jim's diminished. ""We gave you all the money you needed!"" yelled an older senator to the far right. ""And you.... you just go and decide to make it public?"" It was clear that Jim was in quite a hairy situation. However, he held firm and shot back at them. ""Look, Senator White, it's no secret that we needed more funding to complete the project. I just did what I had to do."" ""But this, Jim. I mean, this is too far,"" replied the Ohio senator. Jim held back for a minute, then released his next thought. ""Look, it's not like this was going to remain a secret forever. We in the lab saw that the weather balloon thing wasn't going to net us much in profit, so we..."" Jim was then interrupted by the Ohio senator. ""Goddammit Jim, fucking condoms?"" said the senator in a fit of rage. There were TV cameras there, no doubt capturing this moment. ""You took government funds. Funds that were clearly set aside to make higher rising weather balloons, and you decide to not only make a classified material public, you use it to make condoms?"" Jim said, ""I'm sorry senator."" He then leaned back in his chair. ""But you can't deny their effectiveness..."" he said, opening his palms out and shrugging his shoulders. He was interrupted by the Ohio senator again. ""ENOUGH!"" he barked out, no doubt exacerbated by the circumstances. There was a silence in the room after that. Nobody really knew how to follow it up. After all, having US government funds being used for condoms is not something one expects when they get elected to office. Jim broke the silence after it had gone on for 20 seconds or so. ""It appears this discussion has come to a head...""",0
"Prompt: here you stand, alone again, about to take your own life. Nothing is holding you back now. You decide to look around your room one more time until something catches your eye, and the impact it has on you stops you in your tracks and makes you realize why you ca n't do this to yourself. Story: The trigger of the gun felt cold against my finger. I knew it was time. Nobody was out there for me. Not even *I* was out there for me. I took a look around my old room, taking it all in one last time. Then I saw it. *That was 3 years ago. She doesn't care about you now* my mind reminded me. *But what if she does? * my conscience retorted. These thoughts glued me to the bed for a fleeting moment. ""What of she does?"" I wondered aloud. *She made you that man. Don't do this. TALK TO HER. * Suddenly, my arm buckled under the weight of the gun. I let it fall, resting it upon the bed. I stood up and, with tears streaming down my face, trudged over to the item on the table. It was a CD. It was one of those blank CD's you buy, and she had loaded it up with some music. I had never listened to it before. I figured, since it was the only thing that had ever been given to me, I'd give it a listen. I popped it out of the case, carefully, struggling not to break the disk. I laid it slowly into the slot on his CD player, and closed it by pressing the button. The first song was Goeillaz - Clint Eastwood. I liked them a lot at the time, but now had grown past them. I could still appreciate the fact that she included it though, and I suddenly felt great. ""Great"" was something I hadn't felt in a LONG time. I knew, right then, that I had to see her. ""What do you pack when you fly?"" I mumbled to myself. I'd never flown before, and would have to sell the car to buy a ticket. That car sucked anyway. A ticket to see *her* is all I would ever need. Or, so I felt at that wonderful, incredible moment. So, yeah, I flew to Chicago. I stepped out of the airport and was brought to my knees from the cold, cold wind. ""Holy Christ!"" I said a little loudly. ""Hello, tourist!"" a very flamboyant, smiling older gentleman said to me. ""Want a ride? My cab's right over there."" ""Y-y-y-y....."" ""Get in, kid."" The heat had been left on, and I could feel it right away when I stepped in. I looked to the thermometer on his dash. ""4 degrees!?"" I said, shocked, still warming up. ""Heh, that's not even including wind chill kid! So, where to?"" I took out the notebook with her info in it. ""45, 12th Street, sir."" ""No need for sirring, man. You call me Clyde. I call you....?"" ""Call me Kevin."" ""Alright Kevin, who is it?"" I felt like I'd been adhered to the seat of the cab with railroad spikes. ""Look, kid. I see hundreds of poeple every day. I've learned to..... read people. And you, well, I can read you like an open book. Let's narrow this down, shall we? Who is *she*? ""She's the only thing I have left to live for."" I said calmly. I could feel the warmth of the cab fade suddenly, Clyde slumping in his seat a little. ""Well, here we are."" he said *almost* unenthusiastically. ""You don't owe me anything kid. Good luck."" I went up her stairs, and knocked on the door. This was it, I told myself. One chance.",0

But then when the time came, I understood. If I changed things maybe this glimpse wouldn't happen. Maybe I would be different. Maybe it everything that happens is meant to happen and there's nothing I can do about it. Maybe the only function of this event was to cherish the moment. So there I stood, the same frozen statue that couldn't utter out a single comprehensive thing. I hope this young me didn't hate me like I hated the future me I saw the glimpse. But I knew the truth. He does resent me. And only when he gets to my point in time will he understand.",0
"Prompt: Write a journal entry for a child that has been abused ( mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, sexually, etc ) their entire life .... Story: Dear Diary, I slept well last night. ""Daddy"" didn't come back to the house until he was drunk enough to collapse on his *own* bed. At least one night of solace for me and the baby. That's what he makes me call him, anyways. Daddy. I don't remember my real father. He never came home from Iraq, so my mother told me. Probably why no one was watching me while I played outside that day, mother was at work. Autumn must be just around the corner because it feels warmer down here, Daddy must have turned on the heat because of the colder weather. Sometimes I can remember what it was like. Autumn had vibrant colors, golden, red, and yellow hues painting the trees as the leaves were bled of life. I used to gaze out the window as I read John Green novels, wrapped in my blanket and sipping tea mother had prepared for me, enjoying the agony of the leaves as they resigned to beautiful decay. I fell asleep early last night, or was it night? It might have been day, I don't know. I never know. Down here the only light I have is from this little bulb. Sometimes in the winter I touch it quickly to warm my hands. The pain is warming, it brings my fingers out of numbness. That is all I feel. Numbness. I probably look as I feel: a gaunt shadow, withered and sunken. There is nothing left. My only enjoyment comes from the quiet blackness that awaits in sleep, the silent oblivion. I didn't wake up in tremors last night. And even when I did wake up, there was a brief instant where I forgot who and where I was. I miss that feeling. I hope they find me.",0
"Prompt: The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Story: Mollu the Potter awoke early, as he always did, to greet the morning sun and thank the goddesses for another wonderful day. Taking care not to wake his wife, he got out of bed to put some wood in the kiln for another long day of pottery making. He gazed out at the pale orange dawn over Hyrule and reflected about how much had changed since the invasion. Sure, the royal family had been slaughtered mercilessly, but the Gerudo had also driven out those wretched other creatures from the land. Now that the Gorons were gone, great mining projects had begun in Death Mountain, turning Hyrule into a centre of industry and trade. Great factories had been built to refine the coal and iron from the mines, allowing for the construction of powerful machines and more bountiful harvests. The Kokiri were driven from the forests, allowing a booming lumber and construction industry to rise. With the Zora having fled following the death of Jabu-Jabu, the rivers had been diverted to aqueducts and irrigation, allowing for such bountiful harvests that Mollu's two daughters had never known hunger in their lives. *Ah yes, my family, * thought Mollu, placing a slab of clay on his potter's wheel and beginning to pump the foot pedal. Certainly the best part of the Gerudo invasion had been the sudden infusion of beautiful women into the land. Sure, they were a bit more aggressive than the Hyrulean women, but Mollu loved his wife Siv with all his heart. As he began to shape the wet clay into a pot, Mollu thought back to his early days as a potter, back when he was just an apprentice in his master's shop. He remembered the day *the boy* had arrived in the shop. Thinking it odd that someone so young should be interested in the fine art of pottery, Mollu had began to explain his wares to the lad. It was then that the boy drew his sword. Expecting a robbery or a murder, Mollu had shut his eyes in fear, but when he opened them, every pot in the store had been smashed and the boy was gone. Fearing his master's anger, Mollu quickly took pots out from the store room and replenished the storefront's supply. Right as he placed the final pot, he heard a faint jingle of the doorbell as the boy re-entered the shop. The boy drew his sword and the grizzly scene unfolded again. Mollu tried enlisting the aid of the town guards, but none would heed his pleas. Mollu and his master easily lost three months' wages that day. Even with all the joys and blessings his life now had, he would never forget that day or that boy's voice.... *KYEAAAH!! *",0
"Prompt: You have just been elected the president of the U.S only to learn that every President before you was actually a super villain, and always stopped by one man. The Prime Minister of Canada. Story: ""He's been elected, Prime Minister"" *Fuck, * I think. Not already. Our moose haven't recovered yet. The next NHL season is only two months away, so all of our best soldiers will be busy. *Fuck. * ""Fine. Round up the best of the best, they can afford to miss a day or two of training,"" I tell the young cadet next to me. *The next day* ""You guys got here quickly."" ""Well, it's an important cause. And like you said, we can all afford to miss a day,"" Crosby tells me. He's a good captain, both of his team and of the Canadian Presidential Unit (CPU, for short). What the CPU does, you see, is take down the president. Okay, not *literally* take down (though in some cases we did, okay, I admit it. JFK was assassinated by us, since he had a scheme in the works to take over the world), but to threaten the president (with death) and keep the CPU over his head the entire time. Thank God Obama had a change of heart towards the end. ""Anyways, sorry for this inconvenience, but I just want you guys to give him a scare. The new guy looks harmless enough."" ""No problem, boss."" I give them a smile, shake Crosby's hand and send them on their way. *In the president's office* ""OH MY GOD, SIDNEY FRIGGIN' CROSBY!"" *Sigh. * I think the Minister really overestimated this guy's threat level. Toews gives me a look that says ""it could be a facade, ya know."" I do *know, * but this guy seems just unfit to function on a day-to-day basis, let alone as president. Oh well.... *Hours later* ""CPU? So you guys are, like, soldiers, or something?"" So these guys think I'm a threat? Why would think that? Did they already tell me? ""FUC-yeah, yes, we're here because every president before you has been a *super villain, * if you can prove to us you're not, we'll leave and you won't hear from the CPU again,"" Crosby sounds exasperated. Toews is giving me dirty looks. Sharp just looks generally annoyed. Sharp pulls Crosby close and whispers something into his ear. ""How about an IQ test?"" Sharp suggests to me. ""Sure."" *Back at the prime minister's office* ""So he's basically retarded, is what you're saying?"" ""Yup. We have no idea how he was elected."" ""Okay, well expect an easy four years boys.""",0
"Prompt: It is a sunny day, you exit your apartment. Walking your way to your work. There is no one around. Suddenly a black van gets nearby you and its door opens. Two man -which wearing black suits, black gloves and black masks- grabs you and throws you into the van. Story: Black suits, blacks gloves, sunglasses, shoes and crew cuts is all I remember of them. I was just minding my own business, on my way to another dull day at work when I was, well kidnapped I guess. Before I could do much more than start to scream, a gag was stuffed in my mouth, and my hands and feet were bound. ""Lets go"", said a bland, accentless voice. Go where and with whom, I wondered, panic wanting to set in. But no, I must stay calm. Once panic got going, there would be no stopping it, and so I listened for whatever sounds I could. I guess the van must've been soundproofed, cause I couldn't hear a thing besides my heartbeat and breathing. The professionalism of these people let me know that they intended to keep me alive, at least for a while. In my mind, I said the directions the vehicle turned, and tried my best to keep my breathing even. I hoped my allergies wouldn't kick in, cause breathing through this gag would be all but impossible. Had I done anything to anyone, like pissed someone off? Made a discovery? Why was I being kidnapped, and where was I being taken. Several turns later I felt one of the men (I assume it was a man) push up my sleeve and then the bite of a needle. The world went hazy, and I guess I sort of passed out. When I woke, I was on a cot, and my hands were sort of free, although they were still tied to each other, they were no longer connected to my feet and they were in front of me now. My left ankle was attached to a leg of the cot, which was bolted to the cement. The cell, or whatever it was, appeared clean, as did my bedding. Well, I consoled myself, at least I won't get tortured here. A while later, I'm not sure how long a Styrofoam tray with mashed potatoes, bread, and some sort of mystery meat was passed through a slot in the door. There were no utensils, so I guess I had to eat with my fingers. Yuck. But, my stomach was growling, so I used the bread as a trencher and scooped up the potatoes the best way I could. The meat didn't taste too bad, but nor did it taste very good. I guessed it was probably cafeteria food. I sat after I was done eating, and tried my best to think of ways I might've gotten myself into this predicament. I'm 23, a college student, and when I'm not at class, I'm at work, a little grocery store run by my land lady. I could think of nothing at all, and gave up. I must've drifted off to sleep, because the next thing I knew, the cell door was being opened by two big burly men with crew cuts (the same two men, or different?) My right leg was once again shackled to my left, and my hands undone and redone in back of me. ""Move."" ""No need to be so polite,"" I snapped, in a bad mood. I thought I saw a ghost of a smile, a small twitch from the one I'd addressed, but then again, it might've just been my imagination. I was led to a windowless room with a table. ""Interrogation time?"" I got no response, which I'd half been expecting. ""You sure are a talkative bunch."" ""Quiet."" They shackled me to the table, then left. A while later the door opened again, and a woman with her hair in a severe bun appeared. ""Dorothy Anne Hayes. What a pleasure to see you again. I guess you don't remember the last time you ran away.""",0
"Prompt: Science and Magic are merely opposite sides to which the pendulum of time swings. It has leaned for the past few centuries towards the Laws of Science but even now it begins to return ever faster back towards the Laws of Magic. Story: ""Hey, was that store there yesterday?"" I looked up from my mug of coffee, and followed my companion's gaze across the street. He was looking quite intently at a rather odd-looking curio store stuck into the middle of the otherwise rather mundane strip mall. Sitting between a laundromat on one side, and a shoe store on the other, was a shop covered in odd runes, with glowing crystals, monstrous skulls, and stranger things hanging in the window. Of course, the *Grim Grimoire* wasn't new. The old store there had been around since at least the 70s. But there was no way that Mike could've known that. See, the *Grim Grimoire* was only visible to supernatural creatures: vampires, fey, dragons.... Mages like myself. ""Ahh, that? Yeah.... it's been there for years."" I tried my best not to let the surprise register on my face or in my voice. I've known Mike for three years now. Guy was a wizard with computers, it's why I managed to get my boss to hire him. He just, well.... he wasn't an *actual* wizard. Maybe.... maybe this was just a temporary rip in the Veil. Maybe some of the *Grim Grimoire*'s wards got scratched or something, so its illusions fell and mundies could see it. ""So anyways, back to what we were talking about earlier. You really think that our client needs that-"" ""OH HOLY SHIT!"" My attempts at redirecting the conversation was completely blown off course by the fact that an ogre had just appeared in the middle of the street. Well, not ""just appeared."" He'd been walking down the street normally, minding his own business, disguised as a human and all.... and then his disguise fell, and now people were running away from the 8-foot-tall behemoth standing among them. Once was odd. Twice, within seconds of each other? Something was going on here. Though a part of me was deeply tempted to go and help the poor ogre, I would probably be of more use to the other supes here in preventing the Veil here from falling further. ""I.... I need to check something,"" I smiled at Mike rather unconvincingly, standing up in a single, swift motion that, unfortunately, knocked my chair over. ""Lamar, what the heck is that?"" I looked over at the ogre, who was desperately trying to get away from the screaming people and, what was worse, the countless smartphones. ""A very bad day."" I turned and headed inside the coffee shop, making a beeline to the bathroom. I needed some privacy to work out the spell here. I'll admit, I cringed internally at the people gawking at the ogre's misfortune. You know, if it had been any other day, these mundies would have been completely oblivious to us supes, but apparently the world had different plans for us today. I fished around inside my jacket for my stick of charcoal as I entered into the washroom. First thing's first, a quick divination to determine the range of this breach. Then I can figure out who to contact to get a handle on this.... I think I still had that MIB agent's number on me. I quickly scrawled a few runes on an unmarked section of the tiled wall -- last think I'd want is to add somebody's witty insult to the sigil and proceed to turn my skin purple, or blow out the entire wall. A quick glance to confirm I scribed everything right, and then- ""Seriously, Lamar, what the hell is-"" Well, guess which genius forgot to lock the door? ""Lamar?"" ""Shut. The. Door."" I growled though gritted teeth. ""NOW!"" Thankfully, Mike wasn't an idiot and locked it as well, before asking ""Umm.... why are your eyes glowing?"" ""Because I'm in the middle of channeling a divination spell, so please be quiet!"" ""A *what? *"" ""Not now!"" I really couldn't handle any kind of interruption, not with my mind's eye pulling back as it did. Way back. Not the neighbourhood. Not the city. Not the country. The spell was showing me the entire damn planet aglow with magic. Well.... shit. This was a Class 2 Apocalypse scenario right here. ""Lemar?"" Well, hey, at least the powers that be had better things to worry about than me casting a spell in front of a friend and colleague! I let my hand drop from where it was pressed against the wall, and my mind's eye cleared, returning my focus entirely to one of the most ignoble places one could find oneself at the start of an apocalyptic scenario: a coffee shop bathroom. I sighed and I slumped down against the the stall's siding. Okay, where to start.... ""So.... umm.... man, I got ta ask this.... are you some kind of wizard?"" Well, we can start there. ""Yeah, actually, I am."" ""And.... and so was that some kind of spell?"" ""Pretty much, yeah."" ""And.... and all that stuff out there, in the street, that was actually magic?"" I tilted my hand back and forth. Not *technically, * but wasting my time explaining the difference between magic and other supernatural bullshit seemed a bit too academic at the moment. ""So.... so does that make me a wizard too?"" I looked up and stared Mike in the eyes. ""It took me a decade of study in my grandfather's basement pouring over the old books my ancestors started writing down back in New Orleans and Haiti, as well as a bunch of seriously dry theoretical crap written down by some of self-important sage back in Rome or Cairo or Shanghai some five hundred years ago before I could even cast my first spell, so what makes you think your punk ass could cast a-"" Wait.... the entire world aglow in magic. Shit. I grabbed Mike and slammed him against the wall, ignoring his protests, and scribbled a rune onto his forehead with my charcoal. ""WHAT ARE YOU-"" ""Not now!"" I growled, and lay my palm upon the rune, letting my mind's eye loose once again, this time sending it racing along Mike's own anima trail. A trail that was now brimming with potential, the kind only heard about in legends of the olden days, when the world was young and magic was everywhere. Well, shit. Mike wasn't a wizard, but he had magic. A lot of magic. And he probably was unique in that regards. I let the scrawny IT guy go and staggered back a bit, muttering under my breath. Now, to become a proper mage it took years of instruction and training to harness the thin strands of anima that was running through the human body. However, if every human was blazing like a ley line network, then all that training just went out the window. Talking to someone via a spell could actually be easier than talking to someone on your cell. I really wasn't certain I could handle the ramifications of that now. ""Okay, man, you wan na explain what that was?"" I sighed, once again, and shrugged. ""I was trying to confirm a hypothesis on how fucked we all are."" Well, that seemed to deflate Mike's attitude like a balloon. ""Oh.... uhh.... and?"" ""It's as if the Queen of fucking England was on the other end. It's a royal fucking for the entire world."" And now the poor guy was scared. I felt bad, but at the moment, I was bloody terrified. If there was any horrors around, they'd be having a feast.... if their feasting wouldn't reveal the fact that they're monsters who are suddenly surrounded by juiced-up humans. Yeah, okay, in that case might want to bump it up to a Class 3 Apocalypse scenario for horrors. And vampires. And all the other supes which relied on humans to live. Shit. But thinking about it.... right, if there was any place that would have answers to this, it'd be the Parliament. Now, to remember that inscription.... I began scribing the runes for fear and darkness and oblivion onto the wall with my charcoal. Now, these weren't very friendly looking runes, and Mike got the jist of them pretty quickly. ""Lamar, what are you doing?"" ""Right now, getting the hell out of dodge."" ""What?"" ""The world is probably going to Hell fast, and I need some answers. Thankfully, the place that has the best answers here isn't in this world, so we can fix both these problems here real quick."" There, I think that should do it! I placed my hand upon the wall, and muttered ""Open..."" beneath my breath. The tiles cracked apart, creaking inwards as if I had just pushed on a set of double doors. Black, billowing shadows oozed out of the door in the wall, wrapping around our feet, as a sense of existential dread pervaded the room. ""Alright, let's go,"" I said as I began to head on through to the other side. ""You know what, I think I'm fine."" Mike replied, making his way to the exit. I looked over my shoulder. ""Suit yourself, but when the bombs start falling, you can't say I didn't warn you."" Mike took one nervous look at the bathroom door, before deciding that maybe the billowing blackness wasn't so bad, and raced in after me. The door slammed shut behind him after he passed through, leaving nothing but black stone behind him, and oppressive darkness all around us. I scrawled the rune for light on my hand, and held it up, creating an impromptu torch, driving the gloom away. ""Alright, Mike. So, stick close, ignore the eyes in the darkness, and don't touch anything, okay?"" ""Where are we?"" I headed down the corridor, looking for any sign of direction to the nearest library. ""Think of it as the magical United Nations."" Though given how the mundane world had magic now, well.... Let's just say I hoped someone here had answers. Or at least a spare room I could crash it until this whole thing washed over. After all, the end of the age of magic through the supernatural world into turmoil for nearly a millenia. I really wasn't looking forward to what the end of the age of science heralded.",0
"Prompt: You 're walking down the street chewing a piece of gum when you accidentally swallow it. This starts a snowball effect that eventually leads to the extinction of the human race over the span of a day. Story: I was walking down the street today just minding my own business when I tripped over a crack in the sidewalk almost stumbling to the ground. Wow I thought that was a close one I hope no one saw it. I continued walking down the street when I entered the crosswalk I was almost hit by a car turning right that did not look for me. I yelled Asshole! and continued on my way. What a strange walk this has been already I was thinking when a red breasted black bird swooped down at me with the intensity of a mother bear defending her cub. I hopped to the side to narrowly doge the oncoming attack of the bird defending its nest when I bumped into the building next to me which caused me to swallow the gum that I was chewing. I tried to spit the gum out of the back of my throat but it would not become dislodged. I began to grow quite lightheaded from the lack of oxygen and I fainted to the ground. I woke up to President Putin kneeling over me with a whole bunch of photographers taking pictures. Apparently Putin had been driving by as I fell to the ground and he made the motorcade stop to help. Of course Putin travels with his own doctor, but he insisted in saving my life himself. This is very like him since he likes to prove to his people that he is a powerful leader. Anyways I guess he performed a tracheostomy on me even though it wasn't necessary to show how capable of a leader he was. I was rushed to urgent care to take care of the whole. In that hospital bed is where I witnessed the human race go extinct due to the fact that I swallowed my gum that day. Evidently President Putin was on his way to his first in person meeting with President Trump that day. His little show of saving my life though delayed him a bit and he was late for his meeting with Trump. Trump being Trump did not take kindly to this gesture and left the meeting without talking to Putin and tweeted ""Putin is a bad man. Russia not a good country. USA at war with Russia."" Putin did not know what to make of this declaration of war, on one hand it was over twitter and on the other it was the U.S. President. He tried to get a hold of Trump, but was unable to. Putin had decided that he must attack U.S.A first before they could attack him and he launched all of the intercontinental missiles that he had at the U.S. Trump got word of this and obviously launched them back at Russia, but not to be one upped by Putin he launched missiles at every country in the world. That is the story of how me swallowing my gum lead to the end of the human race.",0
"Prompt: Magic is discovered and it 's channeled with music. Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north lie the Metal kingdoms. Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc. Story: And here I was, alone. In between aal the countries in which powerfull spels were casted with the use of a guitar or violin, I sat looking at my keyboard. It was the only thing my father left me and boy was I glad he did. The powers of it were unknown, but many said it was one of the most powerfull instruments off all time. This was partly because almost nobody knew how to play it and partly because it could adjust itself. It was one of few instruments able to play more then 1 genre and with the few modifications I made, also perfectionise them. Ever since magic was discovered and people moved either towards the north for metal, or south for jazz, I was pretty lonely. As far as I knew nobody was left here. Somewhere in the middel of the globe, just above the equator, I was stranded as one of the few people who liked dance over anything. No guitars for me, just my keyboard and a computer. The edm and with that dance genre had, as far as I was concerned, pretty much died out. And for some reason I was glad it did. It gave a special feeling knowing you're one of the few people who could master so many powers using just 1 instrument. But it also feld strange, I couldn't really describe why, but it just did. Their was one occasion however, when I wasn't alone. An old man, coming from god knows where, showed up every now and then to teach me how to play the keyboard. He was always talking about how powerful I could be, how great the instrument was and so on. Though I never wanted to become powerful, really. I just wanted to play music and enjoy it. On the news there were many articles about great wars between pop music and country. I would give you the name of the countries, if I knew them. See, since the discovery of magic people started to worry about other things. Life as I knew it had suddenly been given up for the simple life of trying to learn to play some instrument so you could fight in some war. And with that came that places weren't devided by borders anymore and countries became meaningless pieces of land. The only thing that mattered now was to survive. after a few years, I had learned to play the keyboard, a war broke out between a group the alternative rockers just a few kilometers north and the soul Sisters about 3 kilometers south. Because nobody knew I excisted, they didn't really account for me being in the middle of their battleground. The leader of the alternative rockers, a man who looked as tall as a crane and as strong as a bear. He came to me and asked me who I was. I told him who I was and he was shocked to hear that I could play the keyboard. He almost seemed frightend. He soon left, but with that came a girl. She was not much larger then me and was dressed as if she were to go to a ball. Why she wore a dress was unclear to me, but it didn't seem very practical. Anyway, I told her the same and when I finished talking, she stared at me for a few moments and then left. A few days went past before the war started and both sides were pretty hesitating to go past my house. I didn't get it, what could 2 leaders of big clans have to fear of a 20 year-old keyboard player? I soon found out that war had changed too, the camps didn't go for a regular fight, but just started playing music. It sounded horrible, not because they were bad at playing their instruments, but because all sorts of music played at the same time. I tried al sorts of things to not have to hear the horrible sounds of war, but nothing helped. after a contineous and dreadful 4 hours of guitars, drums, cello's and saxophones, I completely lost it and went outside. The noises slowly started to get milder as I set up my keyboard and hooked up some speakers. I put on my headphones and started to play one of my favorite songs. It was a song I remembered from my youth and it meant a lot to me. for 1-2 minutes I was so concentrated on my music that I didn't see what the others were doing. When I finally looked up, I was filled with surprise to see both groups dance together! Nobody was playing an instrument, nobody was arguïng, everybody was just dancing to my music. It took me a second, but then I realised what the old man once said. ""Magic is strong, but music is stronger."" P.S. If you see a lot of mistakes, I'm sorry. I'm dutch and still learning English at school.",0
"Prompt: A close friend gets injured into a car crash and falls into a coma. The next Monday at school, a new person approaches you. This person acts like your close friend in every conceivable way, right down to the mannerisms and obscure memories that only you shared with him/her. What 's going on? Story: ""We still don't know if he'll make it. He's been in a coma since the accident."" Ever since my best friend Harry got into a car crash, I had been what the doctor might say. Harry had been my best friend since three years ago, and we had always done things together. But this past weekend, a drunk drive struck him on the way back from Pastures, the small, family-owned market across the street from our school. ""How long will he be in this coma?"" ""Indefinitely. Until we can find a way to restore his consciousness, he may be stuck in this state forever."" A tear dripped down the side of my face. *** The over the rest of the weekend, I didn't find much amusement in what I had normally liked doing. I didn't feel like answering writing prompts online or hanging out at Sky High with my friends. I didn't want to eat, and I stayed in bed all day. On Monday, I forced myself to get out of bed, with 5 minutes left to get out of the house, threw on first first clothes I saw, and dragged myself to school. I arrived at school seconds before the bell rang, entering the class with another student I had never seen before. The teacher began taking attendance. ""Marx, Christian"" ""Present"" ""Patil, Sean-Paul"" ""Present"" ""Pascal, Margaretta"" I had never heard this name before, and judging by the expressions as I glanced around the room, neither had anybody else. A high pitched voice from Harry's old seat behind me answered, ""Present"". *Hmm.... A new student? This far into the semester? * As if to answer my question, my teacher said, ""It appears we have a new student in our class. This is Margaretta Paschal. Margaretta, can you present yourself to the class?"" The same high pitched voice that had answered ""present"" a while ago spoke again. ""Umm..."" I noticed her eyes glance at me for a moment, and I took a closer look into hers. *Hazel eyes, long brown hair, plump breasts. Damn. But she's probably out of my league* She began to address the class: ""I'm Margaretta, you can call me Margaret, I just transferred to this school and hope to make a lot of new friends"" Margaret took her seat behind me. She passed me a note, which read: ""You seem familiar"". The note seemed to give me déjà vu. It was as if I had already seen it before. Then I noticed that it seemed to be in Harry's writing. ""Do you know anybody named Harry?"" ""Who?"" ""Nevermind. So you're new here?"" ""Yup. I honestly don't remember what my old school was like, though. I'm already getting a little paranoid that something's up with me."" ""You look like you're alright"" She blushed just as the bell rang to end the class for lunch. ""Hey, I don't really know anybody here, so do you mind if I sit with you at lunch?"" ""Sure."" *She definitely reminds me of Harry. Harry had paranoia. Harry also passed notes in class. What's going on? * *** ""Are you sure you don't know anybody named Harry?"" ""For the last time! I don't even know who Harry might be!"" Margaret answered, slightly annoyed, but with a faint smile on her lips. ""You know, there's this feeling in the back of my head, like I know you from some where"" She bit her lips. *Just like Harry.... * ""Maybe we went to school together at one point?"" ""Hmm. Sure"" I answered. ""Really? Maybe that explains why I seem to know you!"" ""What? Oh, no. I don't think I ever went to school with you"" ""Oh."" Her face fell. *Just like Harry, * I thought. Maybe this isn't too bad. I know what Harry likes, what he doesn't like. I might try something later on as an experiment. *** ""I'm going to get some starbucks right now. Do you want anything?"" ""Yeah. Can I have a-"" ""A caramel iced coffee with extra cream and cinnamon?"" ""How did you know? And you'll get a strawberry acai refresher?"" ""Just a guess,"" I responded. ""And how did you know what I was going to get?"" She shrugged her shoulders at me. Harry had also ordered a caramel iced coffee with extra cream and cinnamon. It was out thing to know each other's drinks. That confirmed it for me. Whoever this was somehow was exactly like Harry. From that moment on, I used Harry's likes and dislikes that I knew about in order to get Margaretta to like more more, and eventually asked her out. To this day, I have never revealed how I did it, and I haven't explored what caused Margaretta to be ""connected"" to Harry. Harry died a month after he had originally gotten into the accident, and at the same time, that was when Margaretta confessed that she liked me too. But my mom got into a car crash this morning, and our baby daughter was born last night. She has the same name as my mother...",0
"Prompt: NASA makes their Mars announcement. Turns out, they 've discovered the location of MH370. Story: When the announcement had been made, CNN had immediately fired Tapper, Cooper and the rest. They hired a couple of college kids, put interns behind the desk during prime time, sold off most of their equipment, started shooting in Wolf Blitzer's living room. They'd kept him on out of pity, poor guy had been in the Situation Room for so long it would be impossible for him to adjust to a new format. Plus, his presence lent a thin veneer of respectability to the whole operation. Very thin. CNN devoted its new savings entirely to getting its correspondents onto Mars. They changed their name to MNN, partnered up with SpaceX and milked their parent company for as much money as they could get. Amazingly enough, three months after NASA announced that the wreckage of MH370 had been found on Mars, CNN actually managed to land a bunch of interns -- and Wolf -- on the red planet. *** ""This is Wolf Blitzer with MNN, and you're in the Situation Room -- Mars Edition."" Wolf was ensconced in a thick spacesuit with'MNN' emblazoned on the front. Behind the graying anchor was a vast expanse of ruddy dust. The clear night sky above was speckled with stars. Mons Olympus could be seen towering in the background. ""We, ah, haven't built the actual room yet. But look! Isn't it beautiful anyway? ""Our lead story tonight is the discovery of the remains of MH370 right here on Mars. We'll follow that with a discussion of the MH370 flight, and end the program with some speculation about the Malaysia Airlines flight 370. ""Now, over to Andrea at the wreckage. Andrea, what are you seeing over there?"" The shot switched to Andrea the nervous intern, who was standing a few miles closer to Mons Olympus, near the wreckage of the plane. ""Thanks Wolf,"" said the nervous Andrea, even though the man had said nothing remotely thanks-worthy, ""What we're seeing here is the same as described by NASA -- it's the scattered remains of MH370 all right. How it ended up on Mars is anyone's guess. The other strange thing is, there's no sign of survivors. Perhaps they've wandered off?"" ""That's eerie,"" said Wolf, scrambling to fix the intern's absurd mistake. Maybe, given the intelligence of their viewership, they could actually play up the ""there may be survivors"" angle. ""So, you mean to say that there could be people out there on Mars right now, people who need help?"" ""It's more than likely, Wolf. And we're going to be devoting all of our coverage to the issue until then."" ""Thanks, Andrea."" *** The oddly-dressed woman and the man who'd been pointing the strange weapon at her gathered their belongings and walked away. Maybe he'd taken her hostage? With grim determination, the girl who'd been watching them from the hatch-door to her underground colony set out after them. These new visitors were strange, and she could not spot the wreckage of the plane they'd come in. Nonetheless, she would save that girl. It was what her great-grandmother would have done, no matter what got in the way. So, with a steely resolve that she'd inherited from her famous mamaw, Amelia Earhart IV set off running after the MNN news crew, ready to save the day.",0
"Prompt: Years ago, you made a deal with the Devil to be granted a single wish. All your memories of the deal were then wiped. Years later, your wish is fulfilled and you are about to find out what price your younger self was willing to pay to make it come true. Story: ""Everything was on the up and up. My future simply couldn't look any brighter."" Well, that's how these things go, the voice in my head told me. I looked into the mirror, bloodshot eyes and disheveled Mohawk hanging off my head. I was a god damn rockstar! Not in the conventional way. I was a Video Game designer, and a damn good one at that. It was all coming to fruition. I was head of a major build for a fantastic game, PC Enthusiasts were foaming at the mouth, and console peasants were screaming ""WHY NOT US OH CHOSEN ONE!"" Hell, I'd been having meetings with The Gaben himself the past few weeks. He's a laugh riot, kinda like ""Oh Africa, Brave Africa."" So why couldn't I sleep? Sure the crunch was on, but I was used to it. Sure, the heat was boiling, but there wasn't nothin' as hot as me, baby! I couldn't be stopped. Except for the damn scratching. There was a spot on my hand, not a large one mind you, but a spot all the same. Red, blood red, something must've bitten me. Wonder if the guys put something in my apartment again.... Nah, couldn't be. I fired all those guys, and hired a whole new art team. It needed to be done. Still, that little voice in the back of your head sibilantly whispering every comedown it could. Except, it wasn't trying to bring me off Cloud 9. It was more a ""32nd and ground floor"" kinda voice. I looked into the mirror, and the mirror looked back into me. Deep. But it didn't take the mirror long to see through my BS, I was a pretty shallow character. ""In the end, we all dry up eventually,"" my reflection told me, a cocky smile on his jerk face. I stared at him, at me, at us, at the dick in the reflection, however you want to picture the scene. ""No, I don't think that's true. We get washed up, sure, but drying out? Only if someone hangs you."" My mirror laughed at me. The gentleman there pulled out a rope and started fiddling with it. ""Fortune, power, success.... They all leave you eventually."" I shook my head. He was obviously wrong. It was like he didn't even know me. Hell, I didn't even know me! The knots in the mirror got a whole lot clearer, the rope taking form. He was good at what he did. Well, of course he was. He's me, and I'm fucking amazing. Overnight success, I sold ideas worth millions, and God damn I wish my hand would quit itching. Looking down, the hempen rope I keep around was turned into a really, really nice noose. I mean seriously, high quality craftsmanship. ""Color me impressed,"" I said to the douchebag in the mirror, ""Really, didn't even know I knew how to do that."" The mirror gave me a sidelong glance and a shrug of his shoulders, ""It's what I do."" He was relaxed and mixing a cocktail. Why he was putting pills in it was beyond me. ""Shaken, not stirred."" he said and went to pass it to me. I look down at my out stretched hand offering myself a drink. Must be something in the water. Or they put something worse than last time in my apartment. Nooses like party streamers were hanging from my rafters. I must have been much more out of it than I thought. I mean seriously, where the hell did these bones on the floor come from? I don't have a dog. And they look way too human for my taste. Perhaps I got a cannibal werewolf roommate? Nah, that's just way too out there. Besides, I was rich! I wouldn't have a roommate! But wait.... I did. Ah, speak of the devil, here he comes now. ""Fantastic party last night."" I said to myself. I have no idea how. A mirror reflection, but much more handsome. ""Huh?"" I didn't remember a party. He strolls over to me, across splintered bone and torn up hardwood floor; Hell of a dog it seems, and pats me on the shoulder. ""Almost time! Cheer up!"" I look at myself, deep in the eye, and wonder why my hands itching worse now. ""Ah, don't worry about that. You'll forget it's there."" I glanced up from my hand, intent on making a snide remark. ""What? Like the dog?"" NotMe laughed, and said ""There's no dogs, silly! I said ""Out damn Spot"" and he went home. You should be headed home soon too..."" I stared at the impostor, dumbfounded. ""I am home."" The doppelganger laughed, all too damn suave for his own good, ""Well that's simply not true. You were here for a short term lease,"" he lead me over to the window. I had a fantastic view of the fountains in the square, but from way up high. The carbon copy looked out the window with me, patted me on the back, and said ""And to think, you had all of this, and gave it up."" The fountain was getting closer. And closer. I didn't know how, but at least my hand stopped itching. I got one last closeup with my reflection, who winked at me and said ""Time to remember your end of the bargain."" I did, I remembered it all. When I signed the paper in blood.... It ended with a splatter.",0
"Prompt: Villages are laid to rubble and countless lives are ruined ... all over a bag of chips Story: Three hundred years. So long since the last Weaver stalked these lands. Three hundred years, these *weaklings* had lived without terror. But Kasak would end that. Mortals needed to be dominated, there was no other way. Once they had called him the god of balance. All those years ago when he had blessed the people with magic. He thought they could re-establish the Balance but how wrong he was. The northern mortal had ensured that balance would never exist. He stole the magic, used it and tipped the scales. Kasak would fix that. But first he needed the gem fragments. He had searched for these three centuries for the tiny chips. All of them combined would fit in the palm of a mortal's hands and their power would last just seconds. But now that he had a mortal form - a stinking, fleshy mass that they called a body - he could finally *hold* those chips and draw more power from the other mortal's blood. Kasak cursed Athansan. A thousand years ago things seemed much easier. Athansan - the god of life - trusted Kasak, they were close to Unifying, giving Kasak control over Life but then Athansan Sharded himself. But it wasn't like the first time, the shattering. There were no Gifts left to be found by mortals. Athansan Sharded himself so completely that the Gift itself was shattered, spreading specks across the universe. Specks that were ingested and consumed by unwitting mortals and hence magic was born. Kasak thought he could control that, using his Influence he goaded the priests, controlled them and gave them the ability to use the power they had accidentally consumed. But the priests were dead now. The people were too. At least all of the ones that Kasak had come into contact with. He may be in a mortal body now but he still had his Influence and with such proximity making mortals kill each other was easy. The true challenge had been to find the chips. He had razed two entire cities - or made the inhabitants do it for him - and cleared out numerous villages. Even now the stench of smoke clung to his body's clothing, the pungent scent intoxicating his senses. He had lived as a god for far too long, now he was repulsed by what he once was - a man. He approached the ruins of the city. The first he had razed. He thought the priests had known where the gem fragments were but they had all died screaming in denial. He now realized they had been telling the truth. No-one knew where they were because no-one knew they existed at all. Kasak walked through rubble strewn alleyways. Once they were streets with buildings on either side but now they were just trenches between piles of brick and burnt wood. Flies were a constant annoyance, their brains too small to Influence, he simply tried to ignore them. They hovered around bodies long since decomposed. Red and brown stained bones were all that remained now. The city's palace was ahead now. Kasak was grateful for his own reluctance to have it destroyed. These people had worshiped him and built the palace in his honor. He relished that idea and had Influenced the people to leave it mostly intact. The doors were missing though, so he strode straight into the large reception hall. Kasak trudged deeper. His mortal feet aching from the weeks of travel that had led to this moment. He strode into the catacombs. Numerous caskets made of heavy stone lined the walls but one stood in the center. The Fulcrum's tomb. Kasak had coined the term, referring to the way the mortal tipped the scales. His real name was lost to eternity. With more effort than he imagined possible, Kasak hefted the lid from the casket. Nothing more than a skeleton in armor remained. A skeleton bigger than even Kasak had imagined. Standing as a mortal this skeleton seemed so.... wrong to Kasak. Nearly twice his size all things considered. Regardless, the cold dead bones held what Kasak sought. A rotten leather pouch clutched between rotten finger bones. Kasak snatched the back and felt the pulsing gem chips within and he laughed. Now he just had to find some remaining mortals to drain and he would have limitless power and limitless blood gems in which to store it.",0
"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear E, I saw a picture of us the other day from the time we reconnected as more than friends. I wanted to get in touch with you, but you've deleted your Facebook and changed your email address. I tried looking for you online but I don't even know if you're still working where you were before. It's been several years; maybe you've left Austria. My mind runs to memories, lapping at them like a puppy. It was only a conversation or two after that night that we realized that we'd been attracted to each other for years. I still have trouble believing it. You always seemed to have this way about you, with your fierce intelligence and strong sense of self. Me? I was always his little sister, and felt like I lived in the shadow of that title. I'm glad you saw me as more. I have this one image of you from when we were kids, leaning over your guitar and tuning it to Blackbird. You were -and still are, I'm sure- so magnetic. You were so proud of the culture we shared. I loved that about you, and your incredible memory for history. Thinking about it now, that could've subconsciously pulled me to study it in college. If that's the case, I'd like to thank you for that too. You picked up so many things so rapidly and it made me want to achieve more for myself as well. I wish that we'd been able to run off for a weekend like we'd talked about after reconnecting. Still, I'm glad we had that one time together. It meant so much to me.... And feeling the culmination of the years was beyond anything I'd experienced. Despite it being only an hour or two that we could share, those moments have been imprinted in my memory since. Thank you. I know it was a fantasy fulfilled for both of us. I hope you know that those brief hours are still cherished. I wish I could talk to you. Not knowing what's going on in your life makes me imagine all the things you could be doing these days. Having no idea how to reach you, I'm left to wonder. I hope whatever you're working on is making you happy. Your eyes are even more beautiful when you're smiling. Fondly,",0
"Prompt: Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You do n't. Story: 17 years, and 364 days had passed since David's birth. I grew extremely anxious and stressed more than I ever could. What could be more stressful than never receiving your child's 18th year letter? David sat across the room. He was reading a Calvin and Hobbes comic. His father had left the day he was born, and I never knew why. But that never bothered David. The boy still adored going through his father's wares. Books, comics, video games, tools, DVDs, computers, clothes.... David studied his father more than anything in the world. I softly cleared my voice. ""Davy, sweetheart, do you want some tea?"" David didn't look up from the comic. ""Sure thing momma. Can I have some green tea, with some milk and honey in it?"" I always loved making tea for David. ""Sure thing Davy"". I reached for the cabinet with the tea when suddenly there was a knock at the door. ""Davy can you get that?"" ""Yes momma."" David ran to the door. Odd. David never ran to the door. He opened the door. ""Davy sweetheart, how much sugar did you want?"" The wind scratched the door on it's way in. ""Davy?"" I walked toward the door. I heard the door swing gently as the breeze pushed it open. I looked outside. Nothing. No car. No shoes. Just footprints from the grass. But they only pointed one way though, towards the porch. I saw a letter on the porch. And on it was David's handwriting. I opened it up and there was a small note inside, a key, and a flare. The letter read the following: ""Dearest Momma. Daddy came by and needed my help. I knew this day would come so I wrote this letter ahead of time. I'm sorry I won't be having tea with you right now momma. But you can come see us. Head to Old Glimmer Road and get to that old shed with the lock. Open the lock with the key and head inside. Light the torch, with the door closed, and hold it in your right hand. Papa and I will be on the other side. Best of luck Momma. We'll be waiting for you there.""",0
"Prompt: It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter. It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back. It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals. And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... Story: Dear Santa: I know you mean well, but I'm kinda tired of clothing and oranges. Don't get me wrong; of course, I'm happy to get anything at all. But you see, I really just don't need any more jeans, I've hardly worn down the one's from two years ago and I don't expect to hit my big growth spurt anytime soon. (Unfortunately, my 6-year-old body hasn't caught up with my 8 years of life experience yet and I don't expect it to for a while.) What I'm getting at is that I'm in need of something a little bit more mature. I think this year the best thing you could do is give me some advice on how I can get this girl Penny to go out with me. I don't know but I expect to see results before the 25th otherwise there will be no cookies. Yours, John Braken P.S. The last statement is not a bribe or a threat. You can look at it as more of an incentive or reward. John, I'm glad you wrote me. It get's pretty lonely over here and I often feel a bit stir crazy because I never get to seen any of that lush greenery you take for granted. All my surroundings are gray and everyone wears the same outfit. A guy can only take so much of the same every day. I only get to visit once a year. Imagine that!? So, I'll take you up on the offer but only so long as you bring the cookies to me. Deal? Now, as for the clothes and oranges. I have no idea what's up with that. As for the girl, I can tell you right now, I have some great advice to share with you and I'll start with this: Fedora. Girls love em. Now beyond that, I'll need you to fill me in on the details. What's she like? What's she look like?;) What's the status between you two? Have you talked? Does she even know who you are? Etc.... Regards, Santos Dear Santa, I couldn't be more pleased with this turn of events! I'm happy work something out with respect to this arrangement, however, I believe we'll have to debate this a little more. I don't think my mom would be able to drive me some where so far just to give you cookies. Plus, do you really want just anyone knowing where you live? I mean, think about the repercussions. I think it's in both our best interest that we consider this further. Penny! What can I say? She is beautiful! she has long brown hair, honey colored eyes, cinnamon skin and the most wonderful smile you've ever seen. She is really nice most of the time but she can be really bossy. And she's very smart. We talk at school sometimes but I don't know if she likes me. She's taller than me. Does that matter? Look forward to hearing from you! Yours, John John, What a relief it was to receive this letter in the mail today! We all have to share in the labor around here and today was my day doing laundry. It was so boring and I almost lost it folding all those little identical uniforms. It reminds me of the fact that I don't get to see anyone except these fools all year round well until that one special day a year. I can't imagine it's that far for your mom as I imagine these are some special cookies. I wouldn't worry about the media. But if it's too far for you, what we can do is have you send those cookies to a P.O. Box (address on the back) where my guy on the outside can get them to me on the hush-hush. Let me know if that works for you? Penny, wow she sounds like a real goody-two-shoes. Maybe she's not the right girl for a guy like you? But, don't let my pessimism hold you back. Either way, no girl has ever turned down Santos. I can help you get any girl you could ever dream of. Now, about that fedora, did you get one yet? Regards, Santos Santa, I'm glad I can be an encouragement to you considering what you do for so many of us out here. You're a real inspiration and you don't get the credit you deserve. It's just too bad most people don't really even know how big of a deal you are or that you even exists.: ( I'll send the cookies to the P.O. Box. Let me know what you think of them? Also, Just curious: why don't I just send the cookies to the same place I send my letters? Also, how do these get to you at the N. Pole If the address is a US address? This seems super complicated. I like Penny. There's something special about her. When she looks at me I just know she's the one. Now, what's something I can do now to get the ball rolling on this? Cause, see, I'd love to send you those cookies! ☺ Yours, John John, Nice to hear from you again! Especially today of all days, it's my birthday. Ok, yeah, let's get this ball rolling. You need to claim the girl as yours whether she likes it or not. You take what you want. That's what real men do. Second, you need to scare off any other guys who might be interested in her. You need to get tough. Use physical aggression and violence as much as you can and never fight fair. Do you want her or not? Then you need to just take her. She's yours for the taking. Let me know how it goes. Looking forward to the cookies. Regards, Santos P.S. You could become a wonderful rapist one day if you let me help you along the way. I'd love to mentor you. Let me know what you think. Santa, Boy, did that advice work or what!? Wow, you know what you're talking about. I'm sorry it's taken me so long to reply; I've been enjoying the benefits of your guidance. I never thought being a tough guy would be so nice. Now It's my turn to keep up my end of the bargain. I've sent the cookies as we agreed. I hope you like them! They're made according to my mom's special recipe. I love rap. I've always thought how great it would be to be a rapper when I grow up. I just don't know if I could really do it. I mean besides that, my parents don't think it's a good idea either, they say It's not a respectable career. I'd love to learn more. Looking forward to your next letter, Yours, John P.S. Why do you spell your name like that? I always thought it was Santa.",0
"Prompt: An alien race starts to colonize Mars. They completely ignore humanity on Earth and just go about their business. Story: The first indication something was going on was Europa breaking up. The moon had held our interest for a number of years now, as it had been composed primarily of water. Sure it was intensly cold, and carbonated water, but it was liquid water. But then over the course of three weeks in a sunny July the scientists at NASA had watched their monitors in awe as the moon broke apart. The chunks seemed to hang in the sky of their mother planet for a day or two and then, to the shock of all watching began to move out of orbit and into deeper space. The headlines spread across the globe, mystery in space, rogue planet!, everyone was watching as the chunks or ice and rock slowly made their way across space and began arriving at mars. It was breaking so many laws of physics that a few noted physacists killed themselves in disgust. The chunks slowed as they approached mars and then settled into a lazy orbit. Every human on the planet that had so much as aset of binoculars was trying to look at what was going on in mars. The first smaller chunks bagan to crash themselves into the red world. The imacts were fast, but not fast enough to be catastrophic. The heat was just enough to melpt the ice chunks. After a month of the small chunks being broken into the atmosphere the landers saw what no one thought they would ever see. It was raining on Mars. All the soil samples, all the atmosphere gauges, they all had to be re configured. The atmosphere on mars was getting warmer, it was getting wetter, and the equipment wasn't designed to deal with that. The planets mass had grown in accoradance with the additional bulk from europa. The gravity was almost earth normal, and the temperature ranges were starting to normalize along earth lines. Earth finally had a sister planet, a true second blue gem in the heavens. The celebrations didn't last long. There had been plans on sending seed pods to mars, to kickstart a new eden.... but someone else beat us to it. The long black ships began appearing as soon as the tectonics settled down. The ships zoomed across the face of the new mars spraying an aerosol that was rich iwht nutrients, and strange alien seeds. Within a week grass was growing across the fresh fertile martian soil, and what looked to be the beginings of alien trees were appearing. They never contacted us. They never made an attempt at our already suitable planet. But Mars was theirs now. It's been 10 years. there are gleaming crystal cities on Mars. There are orbital bases, and 2 artificial moons. We estimate the alien popuation in the trillians. No contact is ever made. we can listen to their broadcasts, we can watch their entertainment, but all signals from earth are ignored. We have sent probes, we have sent landers, but all are shown the same indifference. The last mars lander we sent sat in what appeared to be a farmers field for six months. The strange green 4 legged farmer ignored the probe and simply worked around it. Moving the probe into the town produced the same results. the strange advanced aliens simply ignored humanity.",0
"Prompt: Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate. Story: The first time I met Chuck, he was sitting in front of the television playing Super Smash Brothers with my lucky orange controller. ""Who are you,"" I asked, ""and how did you get into my apartment?"" Chuck looked fundamentally stumped. ""Uh,"" he said, ""I'm Chuck, and I live here?"" ""No you don't. This is my apartment. This is a -- it's a one bedroom apartment, man! You expect me to believe you've been sleeping under my bed for the past two years? Get out!"" When he gaped I could see the dangly thing in the back of his throat. ""My -- my name's on the lease, man,"" said Chuck. ""And my name's on the Magna Carta,"" I spat, yanking the chair out from under him. ""Get the fuck out, man! I could call the police for this!"" He rolled up in a ball on the floor, lower lip quivering lugubriously, rocking back and forth with his arms around his legs. I threw up my hands and went to get the landlord. ""So you're saying, hmmm,"" said the landlord, whose name was Dave, and whose particular verbal tick was to speak with his lips very close together to hide his horribly crooked teeth, ""that there's another person, hmmm, in your apartment?"" ""Honest to God, Dave. He's got one of those mental disorders they put you in the looney bin for. Narcolepsy, or whatever. Will you come take a look with me? He seems harmless enough. But I want him out of the apartment."" ""Doesn't it seem like a task for the local constabulary, hmm?"" I scratched my neck. Calling the cops was out of the question, considering the weed farm in my bathtub. I'd convinced Dave, who was no more familiar with marijuana than he was with the breeding patterns of the Norwegian Spacklethrush, that the farm was a science experiment. I was a hobby botanist, I told him. ""Nah, man -- I don't want to call the cops on him, I just want to clear him out, you know? Come on, Dave! Do me a solid here!"" He came along at last, but by the time we reached my apartment, Chuck was gone, leaving no sign that he'd ever been there. Even my lucky orange controller was wrapped up in its cord the way I'd left it. ""I'm sure he'll stay away,"" said Dave, patting my shoulder before he left. I resolved to make sure I always locked the door and tried to put the whole incident behind me. For a couple weeks it was smooth sailing. Then I flicked off the lights one night and slid under the covers to discover Chuck already in there, snoring, a dribble of spittle attaching his mouth to my PILLOW! I leapt back out of bed, tore the blankets away, ran over and turned on the light, ran back and snatched my pillow out from under his blocky head, ran into the kitchen to grab a knife, then ran back to stand in the doorway, dizzy from all the cardiovascular exertion. ""WHAT THE FUCK,"" I screamed, brandishing the knife in one hand and the spittle-dampened pillow in the other, ""ARE YOU DOING IN MY BED?"" Chuck stared at me, horrified, his mouth a gradually widening crescent. A noise began to escape his throat -- an ""eeeee"" sound like a leaky bagpipe being played several miles away -- that gradually broadened into a full-bodied sob. ""EEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeEEEEEEEeeee,"" he wailed, clutching himself into a ball again. I ran to the kitchen and fumbled with my phone. ""DAVE,"" I said. ""HE'S BACK, DAVE! HE'S IN MY BED! DAVE!"" When Dave arrived, the sobs had abated. I stood in the kitchen, gripping and re-gripping the knife. ""What's this about, hmm?"" asked Dave, perturbed. ""I was fast asleep, you know."" ""I know, I know, but look, LOOK just COME, COME HERE --"" I put the knife down on the counter top and dragged him to the bedroom. We stood in the doorway looking at Chuck balled up on the bed. ""Well?"" I said. Dave appeared to be speechless. ""I don't get it,"" said Dave after a moment. ""You pulled the sheets off your bed?"" I looked at Dave. I looked at Chuck. I looked back at Dave. ""What?"" I squawked. Dave turned to me, compassion in his big brown eyes. ""Are you alright?"" he asked, softly. ""Is there something going on that you'd like to talk about? Because, hmmm, I am here to listen."" I was about to snap a curt reply when I became aware of a noise I hadn't heard before. Chuck.... was laughing. A deep, slow sound, the voice suddenly several octaves lower. He was no longer curled up in a ball. Now he sat on the edge of the bed, head tilted downward, eyes lasered in on me beneath craggy brows as if Dave weren't in the room at all. ""Surprise,"" rumbled Chuck, and shook with chthonic laughter.",0
