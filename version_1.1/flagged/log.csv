" Mitochondria-Mediated Remodeling in Lace Plant Leaves during Programmed Cell Death


Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a pivotal role in plant development and response to various environmental stimuli. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) is a renowned model for studying PCD-driven leaf remodeling, showcasing intricate perforations formed during this process. Despite extensive research, the precise involvement of mitochondria in lace plant leaf remodeling remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of mitochondria in PCD-mediated lace plant leaf remodeling.

Using advanced microscopy techniques, we demonstrated the dynamic changes in mitochondrial morphology and distribution during lace plant leaf development and PCD. Our results showed a significant increase in mitochondrial density and fragmentation specifically within the regions undergoing leaf perforation. Furthermore, time-lapse imaging revealed a distinctive pattern of mitochondria redistribution, primarily localized to the areas surrounding cell death sites.

To investigate the functional relevance of mitochondria in lace plant leaf remodeling, we employed pharmacological approaches targeting mitochondrial function. Treatment with mitochondrial inhibitors such as rotenone and antimycin A resulted in aberrant leaf development and the absence of expected perforations, indicating the crucial role of mitochondria in lace plant leaf remodeling during PCD.

Furthermore, gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of key mitochondrial-associated genes, notably those involved in oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Manipulation of ROS levels also disrupted leaf perforation and impeded mitochondrial fragmentation during PCD, reinforcing the interdependence between mitochondria, ROS signaling, and leaf remodeling.

Collectively, our findings provide compelling evidence for the central role of mitochondria in lace plant leaf remodeling during PCD. Mitochondrial dynamics, functionality, and interaction with ROS signaling are critical for orchestrating the complex genetic and physiological processes underlying lace plant leaf development. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of PCD-driven leaf remodeling in plants and shed light on the broader implications of mitochondrial function in plant developmental processes..",Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?
